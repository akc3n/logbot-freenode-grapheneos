00:07:57 <treesa24[m]> This might be a stupid question but would it be beneficial or not to use AVG antivirus with graphene
00:10:16 <TheJollyRoger> treesa24[m]: no benefit. Any "antivirus" software you try won't be able to do anything meaningful, at least not for you.
00:13:45 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, Android forces applications, by mandatory access controls in the kernel, to stay within their own private storage now that shared storage is being phased out. So really, antivirus can't really do anything for you. It might make some companies who convince you to buy it a quick buck though, in one way, or another.
00:19:00 <TheJollyRoger> There are some places where malware detection may make sense; however, on a user's PC is not one of them, on a mobile device, less so.
00:21:02 <TheJollyRoger> (For instance, if you were a mail host, it may make sense for you to scan your incoming, internal, and outgoing E-mails before they are delivered to users, after you've gone through the other earlier lines of defense such as publishing and enforcing Sender Policy Framework, validating Domain Keys Identified Mail and enforcing Domain Mail Authentication, Reportiong & Conformance, Spamassassin,
00:21:04 <TheJollyRoger> and such. But that's a very niche use case than a desktop or a tablet or a phone.)
00:45:23 <treesa24[m]> Thank you
00:45:38 <treesa24[m]> *unsubscribes from avg*
00:45:43 <TheJollyRoger> treesa24[m]: you're welcome!
00:45:54 <TheJollyRoger> Any other questions you want to ask me about GrapheneOS?
00:46:15 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm not a dev, so my experience is somewhat limited, but I can try to find you an answer.)
00:46:52 <treesa24[m]> Are there any settings I should change?
00:49:33 <TheJollyRoger> treesa24[m]: Not really. GrapheneOS has been set up to be as secure and private as possible by default. Sane defaults are one of the principles of good security design.
01:21:40 <treesa24[m]> Nice
01:21:47 <treesa24[m]> I can't believe it works so well and its free

03:55:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> Braxman is not a reliable source of information, unfortunately.
03:55:58 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: that person spreads tons of misinformation and is incredibly misinformed
03:56:12 <strcat[m]> they feign expertise and linking their content is not permitted here
03:56:15 <mjakelski[m]> hahaha good to know
03:56:18 <strcat[m]> it's a source of misinformation not information
03:56:34 <strcat[m]> not an expert, and they tell people to do things that decrease their security
03:56:48 <mjakelski[m]> I always wondered why he boasts so much about Lineage
03:56:52 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: AOSP doesn't have Google apps and services in the first place
03:58:18 <strcat[m]> it uses the Android NTP pool (we use secure HTTPS-based network time with time.grapheneos.org), Google connectivity check servers (we offer that as an option but use ours by default) and falls back to Google DNS (we use a different fallback - but this isn't used in practice anyway)
03:58:45 <strcat[m]> ^ those 3 things also apply to LineageOS, if you care about that
03:59:38 <strcat[m]> anyway AOSP doesn't use Google apps and doesn't really use Google services, unless you count those open standard services that are provided by many others too
03:59:52 <strcat[m]> and AOSP is Linux
04:03:24 <mjakelski[m]> strcat: it this a correct comparison: is Android to ASOP (stock Android) as Windows is to Linux, and ASOP to Graphene as Linux is to QubesOS?
04:03:44 <somenerd[m]> QubesOS isn't based on linux
04:03:46 <strcat[m]> don't understand how to parse what you're saying
04:04:39 <mjakelski[m]> In the big picture, I am trying to understand the privacy differences between Graphene and Ubuntu Touch
04:04:41 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: AOSP *is* the upstream Android project (which is open source) and it doesn't have Google apps and services
04:05:12 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: Ubuntu Touch doesn't have modern exploit mitigations, doesn't have any meaningful application sandbox and is in general extremely far from a privacy/security-focused OS
04:05:21 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: there is hardly any privacy to speak of with it
04:05:33 <strcat[m]> and privacy also depends on security, and you're not getting that with it
04:05:38 <strcat[m]> it is a step back by 10 years
04:05:50 <strcat[m]> you are far better off with a production release of AOSP
04:06:03 <strcat[m]> you don't need all the improvements in GrapheneOS to do drastically better than that
04:06:17 <mjakelski[m]> Okay. Who is Ubuntu Touch for?
04:06:21 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features is what we add on top of the already very good privacy and security of AOSP 11
04:06:31 <strcat[m]> we avoid rolling back the existing privacy and security
04:06:40 <somenerd[m]> > Okay. Who is Ubuntu Touch for?
04:06:41 <somenerd[m]> power users ig
04:06:42 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: it's off-topic, I can't answer that
04:06:51 <somenerd[m]> yeah ot
04:06:56 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
04:06:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> <mjakelski[m] "Okay. Who is Ubuntu Touch for?"> People who want desktop Linux apps on their phone.
04:07:06 <somenerd[m]> a bit ot now
04:07:11 <somenerd[m]>  * ot
04:07:15 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: most of the privacy and security work is in AOSP, we build on that
04:07:32 <strcat[m]> a lot of our past work either made it into AOSP or became obsolete due to improvements in AOSP
04:08:12 <strcat[m]> AOSP already comes with a well hardened application sandbox, full system SELinux policies providing MAC (and MLS for profiles) for everything with nothing not covered, and the policies are very strict with the OS built around them
04:08:26 <strcat[m]> big difference trying to bolt on MAC on a case-by-case after the fact vs. building the OS around it and splitting up components to be sandboxed
04:08:36 <strcat[m]> for example the userspace drivers were split up into a bunch of HAL sandboxes
04:08:42 <strcat[m]> media infrastructure too
04:08:56 <strcat[m]> sandboxed media container parsing, codec sandbox, and so on
04:09:03 <strcat[m]> that's not what we do, that's all the baseline
04:09:15 <strcat[m]> verified boot verifying the whole OS from a root of trust every boot (and works for GrapheneOS)
04:09:16 <hypokeimenon[m]> By the way strcat do you know of any other projects that build on AOSP but have some of their stuff upstreamed?
04:09:32 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: some vendors like Sony upstream their code to AOSP
04:10:04 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: various other people outside of companies have contributed too
04:10:50 <strcat[m]> a lot of the time improvements happen upstream on their own, and it obsoletes older work we did
04:11:18 <strcat[m]> lately we haven't had time to submit lots of stuff other than talking to them and providing ideas and bug reports, etc.
04:12:00 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: in general though, you're misinforming yourself by learning from YouTube influencers seeking fame/money who probably know less on the topics than you do and just act otherwise

04:21:40 <strcat[m]> don't recommend Libreboot, microcode / firmware updates are important and you'll be insecure without them
04:21:58 <strcat[m]> reality if that and x86 or ARM CPU/SoC is a giant black box and you don't make things better by not installing the security updates
04:22:53 <strcat[m]> the microcode is a tiny portion of the overall complexity of the CPU anyway... but it has an outsize impact on security since it's how they generally fix / work around vulnerabilities by flipping 'chicken bits' to disable functionality, performance features, etc. that are insecure
04:23:39 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/rygorous/status/1195399284939640832
04:24:34 <strcat[m]> using libreboot, linux-libre etc. just assures you will be insecure and without privacy by not having security updates to some of the most crucial code on the device
04:24:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hello mjakelski[m], the best advice I could give you would be to follow what strcat[m] says. Just because something is open source, it doesn't necessarily magically mean it's secure or private; it simply means that the barriers to scrutinizing/examination of the source code itself are significantly lower.
04:25:25 <TheJollyRoger> Just because the work /can/ be done by anyone, it doesn't mean that someone is actually buckling down and doing it.
04:25:44 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: no need for a backdoor if you leave the front door open by not applying important security updates (or not having them available for one reason or another)
04:26:02 <TheJollyRoger> Oh hell, the bridge has conked out again. I think I'm not seeing SwankyBarbecue4 on the IRC side.
04:28:12 <somenerd[m]> yeah same situation on logbot
04:29:28 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I'll guess at what he said: these days, there's no practical reason for a backdoor when you have a bug, and bugs don't result in huge political backlash. Take OpenSSL for example: the entirety of Debian is Libre Software, and that didn't stop Heartbleed back in '06 when a maintainer saw one line that didn't look like it did anything, commented it out, and then for two years, Debian
04:29:30 <TheJollyRoger> produced keys with no randomness.
04:30:50 <TheJollyRoger> The word "backdoor" seems to be increasingly thrown around by toxic power users who have no idea how to threat model and judge a system's security by how long they spent setting it up their own way.
04:33:28 <mjakelski[m]> Damn... my world has officially been shook. What do you guys run?
04:34:12 <mjakelski[m]> Is there any "secure" hardware out there?
04:34:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> security is a scale
04:34:32 <TheJollyRoger> mjakelski[m]: There sure is, but it isn't what you think it is.
04:34:44 <TheJollyRoger> "Secure" is only valid for a given threat model.
04:34:57 <mjakelski[m]> I made myself believe Librebooting a thinkpad or buying a pinbook pro was the best solution for a daily driver in college
04:35:02 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, if you're talking about a computer that's secure in terms of "exploit free" I must disappoint you:
04:35:08 <TheJollyRoger> The Halting Problem is mathematically unsolvable.
04:35:16 <TheJollyRoger> So if you want a "secure" computer it won't be turing-complete.
04:35:23 * JTL chuckles
04:35:44 <aosp[m]1> <strcat[m] "aosp: use the provided adapter t"> Thanks, worked like a charm!
04:36:19 <somenerd[m]> > The Halting Problem is mathematically unsolvable.
04:36:19 <somenerd[m]> lol
04:36:31 <somenerd[m]>  * lol
04:36:47 <somenerd[m]> > So if you want a "secure" computer it won't be turing-complete.
04:36:47 <somenerd[m]> lol
04:37:49 <TheJollyRoger> mjakelski[m]: I myself run a Talos II Workstation, which runs Gentoo. While I wholeheartedly endorse Raptor's product and the Talos II, I will *not* present it as a magical solution.
04:38:10 <TheJollyRoger> Because hey, I'm still running a desktop stack that's one browser exploit away from a complete compromise of everything on my PC.
04:38:41 <TheJollyRoger> And one kernel compromise away from being compromised eight ways to Sunday.
04:39:23 <mjakelski[m]> <TheJollyRoger "And one kernel compromise away f"> hahaha
04:39:23 <TheJollyRoger> (Figuratively speaking, because IRL, it'd be a lot more than that!)
04:40:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. Never forget that the philosophy behind the Linux Kernel was "Hey let's just write all the drivers, everything into the kernel, in its most privileged position, so it can run faster. What could go wrong?"
04:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> Never forget, as well, that even if the *kernel* of the operating system is secure, the rest of the desktop stack itself, isn't designed to be.
04:40:42 <TheJollyRoger> So... if you're looking for a simple answer to a very complex and nuanced question, I hate to disappoint.
04:40:53 <somenerd[m]> use mobile?
04:41:13 <somenerd[m]> not good for productivity though
04:41:43 <somenerd[m]>  * not good for productivity though (lack of apps sometimes)
04:41:45 <TheJollyRoger> Indeed, that's a pretty good solution. The mobile stack was designed with the assumption that the applications you run are going to come from many different (and possibly, untrustworthy) sources and we can't trust them with everything in the operating system, so let's compartmentalize them into their own personal, individually sandboxed environments.
04:41:53 <TheJollyRoger> But, yes, the compatibility aspect is a big downer!
04:43:27 <TheJollyRoger> mjakelski[m]: if I could go back to the day when I woke up and said "I'm going to start caring about computer privacy and security" and change one thought that younger me thought back then, I think the one thought I'd change would be to have some humility;
04:43:27 <mjakelski[m]> <strcat[m] "don't recommend Libreboot, micro"> this is a mind-blower for me... will keeping my Intel bios up to date give me just as much security as libreboot? is the secret to privacy to keep moving, not let software sit and become stale for someone to learn its weekness?
04:43:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> was sad to see spectrum dropping to tentative support for power
04:43:47 <TheJollyRoger> I used to think that libreboot, open source, and compiling all my software myself was the way forward.
04:44:13 <JTL> > is the secret to privacy to keep moving, not let software sit and become stale for someone to learn its weekness?
04:44:16 <TheJollyRoger> Turns out, all I was doing, was just taking all that responsibility that I had *no idea* how to handle onto my own shoulders and believing, hubristically, that I could handle it.
04:44:17 <JTL> Getting warmer
04:44:53 <TheJollyRoger> mjakelski[m]: Generally, microcode updates are shipped by your operating system, unless you've decided to actively refuse microcode updates by running a "FSF Certified Free!!!!11" distro.
04:46:09 <TheJollyRoger> (Some BIOS vendors *do* implement microcode updates, but some operating systems will also include them, because some don't. BIOSes are something of the wild west, and this is why we have things like vertically loaded or horizontally loaded microcode, because sloppy vendors who have the attitude, "you bought it, its your problem now" are extremely common.)
04:46:31 <JTL> Hi Lenovo o/
04:46:32 <mjakelski[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I used to think that libreboot, "> this is the stage where I am at. chasing privacy seems to be like the 5 stages of grief
04:46:33 <JTL> lol
04:46:50 <TheJollyRoger> mjakelski[m]: it is, hahaha. I've joked that the stages of cybersecurity awareness come in five stages:
04:47:01 <TheJollyRoger> Apprehension: "Er.. can you call me back on my landline? I think my E-mail is hacked."
04:47:22 <TheJollyRoger> Interest: "Now, would I get more privacy out of Fedora? What if I went for Ubuntu? Maybe I should install Gentoo? Or TAILS?"
04:47:25 <TheJollyRoger> Smugness:
04:47:40 <TheJollyRoger> "I run Qubes and me_cleaner! I compile all my software myself! NSA, Come at me bro!"
04:48:06 <TheJollyRoger> Defeatism: "Even if we could formally audit the kernel, the rest of the operating system provides a large attack surface we cannot mitigate the first time around..."
04:48:09 <TheJollyRoger> and finally...
04:48:11 <TheJollyRoger> finally...
04:48:16 <somenerd[m]> suspense
04:48:18 <TheJollyRoger> Alcoholism: "*hic* *snicker*"
04:48:51 <signalarch[m]> Currently on step 5
04:49:04 <mjakelski[m]> Im about to skip right there
04:49:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe. Well, unofficially, rum is one drink we do have here at GrapheneOS :P.
04:51:22 <mjakelski[m]>  I have briefly heard of hardened Gentoo, it that what you run? TheJollyRoger
04:51:36 <TheJollyRoger> mjakelski[m]: no, hardened profiles for Gentoo are not available for POWER9.
04:51:48 <TheJollyRoger> The reason I run Gentoo has actually very little to do with Gentoo itself.
04:52:14 <TheJollyRoger> And more because when I first launched the Morgan's Revenge, binary release distributions did not support POWER9 as well, and we needed patches from upstream.
04:52:27 <TheJollyRoger> So it wasn't a choice.
04:52:36 <somenerd[m]> maybe move to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ?
04:52:46 <TheJollyRoger> Sure, good thinking.
04:53:45 <TheJollyRoger> mjakelski[m]: , there should be a link in the topic that should take you to our second channel, which we set aside for stuff that's not related to GrapheneOS but is still relevant and productive.

06:43:31 <grayhatter> almost no randomness... there was still "some"
06:44:21 <grayhatter> but that's not a bug, that's a package maintainer being grossly negligent, or on the take... perhaps both
06:49:53 <grayhatter> TheJollyRoger: as a friend at work likes to put it; there's 2 threat models that matter, nation state, and non-nation state. for the latter, update your sh&% within 2 weeks from the CVE, and you're nearly untouchable... as for the former, you can start using 'password' for everything because then atleast when mossad comes to black bag you, they won't be an angry you made them work :D

07:58:41 <Nick22461> I recently booted GrapheneOS, but when I restart the device I get a warning message and the Google logo before it switches to the Graphene logo, does this mean that Google is still running somewhere?
08:03:30 <nscnt> Nick22461: No, it doesn't mean that Google is still running. This logo is fused into the hardware. We can't change it. The warning is actually a good sign (if it's orange), because--like the logo--a key for the operating system is pinned by Google and on every boot, it gets compared. Because GrapheneOS has another key than the stock Android, it recognizes that it's another operating system that
08:03:31 <nscnt> gets loaded. Everything's fine like that
08:04:10 <ayaen_t[m]> I read about this somewhere a few days back as i too am new to grapheneOS and it is not an actual  issue. infact that is a feature of pixel devices , they detect when alternate os's are loaded.
08:04:10 <ayaen_t[m]> but sure go ahead with the instructons and use auditor app to verify your installatoon
08:04:10 <ayaen_t[m]> unfortunately i forget where i read it and i could be wrong in what i tell you . Anyways welcome to graphen OS !
08:05:00 <ayaen_t[m]> Yeah there we have a clear answer . thanks nscnt
08:07:42 <ayaen_t[m]> Does anyone know of any settings for password protecting apps?
08:07:42 <ayaen_t[m]> or is there any way to password protect individual apps in the first place without installing a different launcher or app?
08:27:13 <strcat[m]> Nick22461: the logo in the edk2 code is set based on the device brand
08:27:23 <strcat[m]> Nick22461: GrapheneOS on an HTC device would have an HTC logo there
08:27:29 <strcat[m]> not part of the OS
08:27:40 <strcat[m]> it's like the motherboard boot logo on a desktop
08:28:12 <strcat[m]> so sure, you replace the OS, but it's still going to say HP or w/e
08:29:03 <strcat[m]> if we had a partnership with a hardware vendor we could have our logo there
08:29:07 <strcat[m]> not that it maters
08:29:11 <strcat[m]>  * not that it matters
08:29:23 <strcat[m]> because the keys flashed in SoC fuses would be ours
08:57:28 <Nick22461> And can Google track what I do on GrapheneOS?
09:00:11 <ayaen_t[m]> there you go https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services that should take care of your concern  to some extent
09:04:18 <nscnt> Nick22461: If you use apps/services from Google, sure. But that's on you and not on GrapheneOS
09:10:07 <Nick22461> I don't intend on installing google apps so it should be good
09:22:47 <nscnt> Every app may have some tracking integrated. It's neither limited to Google apps nor Google services in general. There are a lot more providers for such stuff (Facebook, Microsoft to name a few). "Contains no trackers" by Exodus is not very meaningful whether trackers are included or not
09:23:44 <Nick22461> The only mainstream app I'll download is Signal
09:25:51 <nscnt> I don't wanna digtate what you should use in any way; I don't care. You should only be aware of that
09:26:57 <Nick22461> For sure, but in this case there is no reason to be tracked right?
09:29:43 <nscnt> Signal has a good reputation (here)
13:29:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> <nscnt "Signal has a good reputation (he"> Where does it not have a good reputation?

15:15:32 <phastens> Hi ! Maybe someone here can help me. I'm stuck on flashing process. I launch flash-all.sh but nothing seems happen. I don't know why.
15:15:55 <phastens> Pixel 4a and installation on debian. Fastboot to the right version
15:16:10 <phastens> Evererything went fine until bash script
15:26:35 <nscnt> phastens: So unlocking the bootloader and everything else went fine?
15:26:44 <phastens> Yep
15:27:53 <jpds> phastens: Pastebin the error you get
15:29:50 <phastens> One thing is, i did not updated android (just a 10Mb of update)
15:29:55 <phastens> I'm doing that right now
15:30:14 <phastens> And I don't have any error message
15:30:23 <phastens> Just the script stuck
15:47:31 <emsyna[m]> <phastens "Hi ! Maybe someone here can help"> how are you running script ? as an user or root (root user or sudo command)
15:48:04 <phastens> as an user
15:48:34 <phastens> I hope the android update i'm doing right now will solve the problem
15:51:24 <emsyna[m]> what do you mean Android update ?
15:51:46 <emsyna[m]> updating android-tools ?
15:52:23 <emsyna[m]> if so you should instead use standalone version, because debian has most certainly outdated version
15:58:38 <phastens> No, the stock android. There is some updates and it say it's best practice to do it before installing grapheneos
15:59:04 <phastens> This is the only thing I didn't do on the install instruction so...
15:59:31 <phastens> For android tools I installe the standalone version already
16:22:20 <phastens> So android update did not solve my problem
16:22:33 <phastens> And I have no error on script like I said before
16:22:41 <phastens> I'm running out of idea
16:27:13 <user2> Hello
16:27:44 <user2> If I create a second user profile and install whatsapp on there would my privacy be compromised on my main profile due to that? Will switching to my main profile stop whatsapp from working in the background? Any ideas? Thx.
16:28:45 <phastens> after multiple bootloader reboot via powerbutton, it seems to work. Don't know why.
17:13:30 <organicpumpkin[m> <user2 "If I create a second user profil"> No, your privacy in the main profile would not be compromised.
17:16:40 <Guest10389> hi. could someone please help me. i'm a newbie. i'm in the process of installing graphene os on pixel 4a. i have just unlocked bootloader and trying to flash flash-all.bat but it doesn't work. thanks for any help
17:20:43 <brenneke[m]> Pretty sure they are going to need some details to be able to help you.
17:21:29 <Guest10389> hi sorry i'm new to all of this. what sort of details? i'm running windows 10 and powershell
17:21:43 <louipcm> Guest10389: use powershell
17:22:45 <emsyna[m]> <Guest10389 "hi. could someone please help me"> is your device detected by typing " fastboot devices" ?
17:23:02 <Guest10389> what would be the exact command i need to type in powershell to flash the files?
17:23:52 <louipcm> please thoroughly read the install guide at https://grapheneos.org/install
17:23:56 <emsyna[m]> check your device detection first
17:24:55 <emsyna[m]> it might be possible it doesn't work because it's not detected ; if it returns nothing, check your device manager and see if you have an exclamation mark with "Pixel 4a" entry
17:25:31 <emsyna[m]> if you do have an exclamation mark, look for a driver with windows update
17:27:20 <Guest10389> when i type :\fastboot devices it comes up with OA0312C213728 fastboot does that mean its connected?
17:29:25 <Guest10389> in device manager it seems connected, with no exclamation mark. just before installation installed latest google usb drivers
17:30:02 <emsyna[m]> yea sounds like it's indeed detected, so if you do ./flash-all.bat it should work
17:30:26 <emsyna[m]> and actually you don't need to installed latest google usb drivers
17:30:45 <emsyna[m]> I always did with my enumerated method, and it never failed, but it's a matter of preference
17:31:08 <emsyna[m]>  * and actually you don't need to install latest google usb drivers
17:31:46 <Guest10389> i tried installing it first without google usb drivers but i couldn't unlock the phone. after i installed them i could
17:32:10 <emsyna[m]> either method should work anyway
17:32:14 <emsyna[m]> so it's not a big deal
17:32:16 <emsyna[m]> have you tried flashing it again ?
17:34:12 <Guest10389> i tried typing ./flash-all.bat but it doesn't work.  it says fastboot: the term "fastboot" is not recofnized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
17:34:44 <emsyna[m]> you probably forgot to set your env variabe then
17:34:49 <emsyna[m]>  * you probably forgot to set your env variable then
17:35:19 <emsyna[m]> do "$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
17:37:01 <Guest10389> i typed that it and then then next line is >>
17:38:11 <emsyna[m]> oh damn, CTRL+C
17:38:15 <emsyna[m]>  * do $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
17:38:20 <emsyna[m]> i badly pasted it
17:38:26 <emsyna[m]> now do it again , it should work
17:45:18 <Guest10389> it says at line 2 char 14 senvpath = "$pwd\[;atform-tools:$env:Path.  unexpected token '$pwd\platform-tools' in expression or statement. unexpecte token '\platform-tools' in expression or statement
17:49:22 <Guest10389> when i tried the command again the next line is >>. what should happen when i type that command?
17:49:48 <emsyna[m]> i can't reproduce it to be frank
17:51:17 <emsyna[m]> did you actually follow the official guide ?
17:51:31 <emsyna[m]> and not some random videos
17:52:16 <Lia[m]> <Guest10389 "when i tried the command again t"> Ah, you probably forgot a quote
17:52:20 <Lia[m]> Try typing a quotation mark then enter
17:52:21 <strcat[m]> Guest10389: if you're on Windows, make sure you're using PowerShell and open a fresh one
17:53:10 <strcat[m]> Guest10389: if you want to make sure you're entering the right commands without typos in a very cautious, copy-paste them to notepad, edit the device name / release name and then copy them to PowerShell
17:53:23 <Guest10389> yes followed the guide. could someone please tell me what the correct response from that command should be?
17:53:53 <strcat[m]> you can right click to paste in PowerShell
17:54:05 <strcat[m]> Guest10389: just copy the commands out to notepad and copy from there to PowerShell with right click
17:54:23 <strcat[m]> instead of typing them out by hand
17:57:55 <Guest10389> when i type $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path" (copied from website) and paste in new powershell window, it doesn't seem to do anything. the next line goes back to PS C:\users\Daniel\Desktop\platform-tools> . is that whats supposed to happen?
17:58:32 <emsyna[m]> yes it's normal
17:59:17 <emsyna[m]> you should do "cd .." however, given you're in the targeted folder
18:02:43 <Guest10389> when i type cd $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path" into powershell it says set location: a positional parameter cannot be found tha accepts argument '=':
18:03:19 <emsyna[m]> i mean, prior doing it again ..
18:03:50 <strcat[m]> Guest10389: recommend closing it
18:03:52 <strcat[m]> opening it again
18:03:59 <strcat[m]> don't run commands not listed there
18:04:16 <strcat[m]> and they need to 100% match what is there, other than changing the release version and device name
18:04:54 <strcat[m]> Guest10389: it looks like you're deviating from the instructions by downloading platform-tools by hand and changing your directory in PowerShell
18:05:12 <strcat[m]> Guest10389: just remove that from your downloads and follow the way it does, run the exact commands it has, no deviations from it
18:05:32 <strcat[m]> no improvisation or filling in the gaps is needed, you can genuinely copy paste all of the commands and just modify the device name and version
18:05:43 <strcat[m]> I could even update the version to make it simpler
18:08:09 <emsyna[m]> mhh, might be a good idea, doing a "simple" version and the current one as "detailed" or something
18:08:26 <emsyna[m]> however it's well explained so shrugs
18:08:48 <Guest10389> since i'm having trouble doing this after unlocking the bootloader. is it safe to turn off the phone and try it again tomorrow?
18:08:59 <Guest10389> thank you for your patience and help
18:10:06 <strcat[m]> emsyna: the problem is we need to explain all the edge cases and common mistakes that are made
18:10:18 <strcat[m]> and we are covering doing it on 3 substantially different platforms
18:10:40 <strcat[m]> it would be simpler to follow if we split it into 3 different guides per platform, but harder to maintain and find
18:11:09 <strcat[m]> emsyna: we're going to be making a WebUSB-based installer to provide an easier way to install it
18:11:14 <Guest10389> apologies, didn't mean to cause so much trouble
18:11:57 <Guest10389> is it safe to turn off my phone after unlocking the bootloader? i'll try again some other time
18:12:11 <louipcm> sure
18:14:51 <Guest10389> since i'm having trouble, do you know of anyone in australia that would be able to install this for me? paying someone to help install it for me might be a better option?
18:19:10 <TheJollyRoger> Guest10389: no, it isn't. I can try to walk you through the precise procedure another time.
18:19:48 <TheJollyRoger> (I mean, no it isn't better to pay someone else)
18:20:05 <TheJollyRoger> It's perfectly safe to turn off your phone if the bootloader is unlocked so long as no commands were running on the phone at that time.
18:20:37 <TheJollyRoger> Just do not use the phone with any expectation of security and privacy without locking the bootloader again.
18:22:23 <Guest10389> ok. thank you all for your time and help. i'll try again at a later date.
21:08:48 <new_graphene> hi, at this moment, trying to setup Graphene on pixel 4 xl. bootloader already unlocked, but when entering bootloader ADB does not detect the device although windows does detect.
21:08:58 <new_graphene> hi, at this moment, trying to setup Graphene on pixel 4 xl. bootloader already unlocked, but when entering bootloader ADB does not detect the device although windows does detect. i tried all usb ports and different cables. no go
21:09:16 <new_graphene> hi, at this moment, trying to setup Graphene on pixel 4 xl. bootloader already unlocked, but when entering bootloader ADB does not detect the device although windows does detect. i tried all usb ports and different cables. no go also, while unlocking obviously these usbs/ cables did work
21:09:18 <new_graphene> sorry
21:09:25 <new_graphene> i thought it was editing :)
21:10:07 <new_graphene> also in device manager it shows the device as "Lemobile bootloader interface"
21:10:49 <new_graphene> any ideas?
21:14:12 <louipc> you not using the flash script?
21:14:29 <new_graphene> flash-all doesnt work
21:14:47 <new_graphene> its saying fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html"
21:14:51 <new_graphene> i'm using the latest from there
21:15:02 <louipc> are you using powershell?
21:15:15 <new_graphene> cmd as admin
21:15:27 <louipc> please review the install instructions
21:15:34 <louipc> you need to use powershell
21:18:06 <new_graphene> ok, in powershell now
21:18:13 <new_graphene> i've set the path to platform tools
21:18:39 <new_graphene> lets try flashall
21:25:35 <new_graphene> all works
21:25:36 <new_graphene> thanks
21:25:40 <new_graphene> i'm on graphene :)
21:25:46 <new_graphene> have a nice day and thanks for the quick help
21:26:35 <louipc> have a good time
