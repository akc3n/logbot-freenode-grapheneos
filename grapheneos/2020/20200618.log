00:58:42 <jcpicard32[m]> I just checked Wire's twitter, and don't any tweets about Copperhead posted anymore either. Thanks so much to everyone who proofread my letter, and everyone else who did things to help.
00:59:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> What happened?
01:00:37 <madaidan[m]> I asked James if he's seething from it and he ignored me so I must assume he's pissed
01:00:43 <jcpicard32[m]> Wire announced a partnership with Copperhead on Twitter and on their blog. The blog post has been taken down and the tweets appear to be deleted as well
01:00:58 <jcpicard32[m]> Still listed on Copperhead's website but that's to be expected
01:01:16 <madaidan[m]> <madaidan[m] "I asked James if he's seething f"> Oh shit he's gonna see this
01:01:28 <madaidan[m]> I didn't mean it James
01:01:36 <jcpicard32[m]> Also hi James.
01:01:51 <jcpicard32[m]> He's somehow an even bigger piece of shit than the other James I had to deal with all of last year.
01:02:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> Wire eh.
01:03:23 <hypokeimenon[m]> Does anyone know if they solved their metadata and multi-device issue?
01:04:14 <hypokeimenon[m]> Also any word on how long they are going to support the consumer version of Wire?
01:14:07 <adeus[m]> You don’t need to worry about metadata with wire just sign up with bogus email and use Tor. It’s the only voice calling app that supports E2E encryption over TCP and actually works with Tor (yes calls are clear).
01:19:45 <jcpicard32[m]> Even DDG already knows what's up lol
01:19:46 * jcpicard32[m] uploaded an image: image.png (36KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nLYBawidWvGpqTyNtWfaBKDs >
01:22:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> <adeus[m] "You don’t need to worry about me"> How do the other voice calling apps operate, if you've looked into them? Signal, Jami, Jitsi etc.
02:09:41 <adeus[m]> None of them work over Tor
02:09:53 <adeus[m]> They require UDP
02:10:04 <adeus[m]> Jitsi is not E2E
02:10:57 <throwaway893342> Hey, i just installed graphine today, and i was wondering if i could get some help with something
02:12:01 <throwaway893342> Im trying to get rid of the swipe features for the pixel 3a in exchange for the old 3 button system
02:12:50 <throwaway893342> i tried following this guide, but since nexus launcher is a google app its not on here in the first place https://www.xda-developers.com/disable-android-pie-gestures-google-pixel-3/
02:13:22 <throwaway893342> What would be the equivalent that needs to be removed or is that not possible?
02:31:29 <overheadscallop[> go to phone settings, search "System Navigation" and the last option is the classic 3 button
02:31:42 <overheadscallop[>  * go to phone settings, search "System Navigation", click that*, and the last option is the classic 3 button
02:32:40 <overheadscallop[> you don't need to disable the default launcher or use a different launcher

02:48:54 <throwaway893342> im an idiot
02:49:01 <throwaway893342> Thanks for your help
02:49:06 <overheadscallop[> no prob
03:12:53 <faxing[m]> What do you all think about using my fingerprint for unlocking my device
03:13:24 <faxing[m]> Right now I'm using a strong alphanumeric passcode but it's a pain to put in every time I want to use my phone
03:13:43 <faxing[m]> So I was just wondering how much less secure using something like fingerprint unlocking would be
03:16:26 <cn3m[m]> faxing: use a long pin
03:18:43 <anne232> Is there any phone supported by graphene OS that can also use SD cards?
03:19:44 <faxing[m]> So stick with my current strong alphanumeric passphrase?
03:20:42 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "Is there any phone supported by "> No, there's no security and privacy focused phones that support an internal one
03:21:01 <cn3m[m]> <faxing[m] "So stick with my current strong "> I'd use a long pin with no fingerprint
03:21:11 <anne232> why not
03:22:28 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "why not"> It's just not popular anymore. Pixels and iPhones are really only the device worth jumping on imo
03:22:44 <anne232> iphones LOL
03:22:52 <anne232> why would anyone ever?
03:23:10 <anne232> is having more memory not worth it?
03:23:19 <anne232> if i got a pixel 3a or pixel 3 or something with 64gb
03:23:22 <anne232> what if i need more storage than that
03:23:45 <anne232> and what about samsungs phones? I know graphene doesnt support them, but are they not popular? why are they so much worse
03:23:56 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "why would anyone ever?"> iPhones are really the only comparable option to GrapheneOS on a Pixel
03:24:30 <anne232> in what way is it comparable?
03:24:49 <anne232> privacy wise and in terms of being able to customize it, i'd say it's not
03:25:00 <anne232> apple constantly tracks your location etc
03:25:34 <anne232> ive always kind of thought iphones are for simpletons
03:31:51 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "apple constantly tracks your loc"> That's factually incorrect. They ask on setup
03:31:52 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "ive always kind of thought iphon"> Before iOS 12 I'd agree with you
03:31:52 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "if i got a pixel 3a or pixel 3 o"> I use the Pixel 3a, but the 3 makes sense if you don't need the longer support time
03:31:52 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "is having more memory not worth "> All Pixels are 4GB
03:33:57 <anne232> i mean storage cn3m[m]
03:34:39 <anne232> and idk im fairly sure they constantly have the ability to track you. I was at a party a week ago and my friend accidently dialed emergency services
03:34:48 <anne232> and they knew his exact location, we werent at his house so it wasnt linked to phone records or anything
03:34:56 <anne232> they called him back and knew his address and sent a cop etc.
03:35:01 <anne232> how could that have happened w/o apple tracking you?
03:39:52 <interceptingfist> On the graphene websitr it mentions user profiles to isolate apps from sharing info. So anyone know if every time I switch to a different user profile if its still technically running in the background?
03:40:44 <interceptingfist> Or does it disable the profile once I switch? Sorry I'm unable to find this answer
03:49:47 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "and idk im fairly sure they cons"> If you opt out it's not sending your location. Emergency services can triangulate you with call towers. I worked on ad tech apps for Android and iOS and I've MITMd both systems. Apple isn't spying on you
04:00:16 <overheadscallop[> <interceptingfist "On the graphene websitr it menti"> I believe other profiles still run in the background, try this conversation in the irc log https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200615#c4133666
04:01:14 <overheadscallop[> since per user profile keys are a thing they shouldn't be active until you log in (if a pin or something is set)
04:07:11 <interceptingfist> ok thank you
04:07:35 <interceptingfist> Its a bummer they stay logged in when you switch profiles
04:13:13 <joshman[m]> It's a feature. You can actively use profiles interchangeably
04:13:39 <joshman[m]> Though I don't use profiles due to vpn leak
04:17:36 <interceptingfist> Yea but it looks like they all stay logged in until you reboot
04:18:04 <interceptingfist> I have a flash router so VPN should be fine for me
04:26:39 <anne232> @cn3m[m], you're trying to tell me they tringulated his cell phone to the exact location and address that he is at in about thirty seconds???
04:27:25 <anne232> honestly probably less. they called him back seconds after he hanged up the accidental call and already knew his address like 10 seconds into the call.
04:27:25 <interceptingfist> The NSA can
04:27:38 <anne232> The NSA likely can. But can 911 operators?
04:27:59 <interceptingfist> Yes idk...
04:28:27 <interceptingfist> To triangulate would take a bit of time
04:28:34 <anne232> exactly.
04:28:42 <interceptingfist> We ain't China, were not that that far advanced
04:28:54 <anne232> That's my point. Apple tracks your location.
04:29:45 <interceptingfist> Def do but the operator doesn't know what phone he has
04:30:04 <anne232> https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/18/technology/apple-911-location/index.html
04:30:40 <anne232> "
04:30:40 <anne232> Apple is rolling out a new feature in its next iPhone software update to send emergency responders instant, precise location information in the US. "
04:30:59 <anne232> If they have the ability to do this, they could certainly track you for other reasons.
04:32:23 <interceptingfist> Wow holy shit
04:32:46 <interceptingfist> Just read majority of it
04:33:31 <interceptingfist> They basically have a built in emergency system
04:33:59 <cn3m[m]> anne232: emergency calling location reporting is very different. It never phones home to Apple on my system my location
04:34:37 <anne232> How do you know that?
04:34:44 <anne232> Apple is the one implementing this sytem.
04:34:54 <anne232> It means regardless, that there is some kind of sophisticated tracking software on the device.
04:35:08 <cn3m[m]> It's call GPS
04:35:10 <anne232> Even if it doesn't constantly send them the location, they definitely have the ability to track you, based on this.
04:35:13 <interceptingfist> That system will be abused
04:35:20 <anne232> I know. But the fact that they can activate it any time is very spooky.
04:35:27 <cn3m[m]> I MITM my iPad Pro
04:35:36 <interceptingfist> By government type
04:35:37 <cn3m[m]> It's purely under user control
04:36:28 <anne232> The NSA or another adversary could almost certainly take advantage of this 'emergency calling location reporting'
04:36:39 <interceptingfist> Wondr if it works if user  opts out
04:36:39 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "The NSA or another adversary cou"> They can't

04:37:40 <interceptingfist> They have a buddy that works in dispatch
04:37:40 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "How could you know taht cn3m ?"> It is a text message from gps when you make an action on your device.
04:38:12 <cn3m[m]> You just don't call emergency services
04:39:03 <interceptingfist> I like feature for my wife though
04:39:03 <notmyname723[m]> so it works even on device with no sim?
04:39:35 <anne232> probably
04:39:45 <cn3m[m]> <notmyname723[m] "so it works even on device with "> Yes, all device have to support that legally
04:40:09 <anne232> a little more personal security is not worth a privacy sacrifice
04:40:15 <notmyname723[m]> then it shouldn't be cell tower triangulation
04:40:26 <notmyname723[m]> if works without sim
04:40:28 <anne232> I would never call emergency services anyways lmfao who does thaty
04:40:36 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "a little more personal security "> It's opt in by calling them
04:40:39 <cn3m[m]> <notmyname723[m] "then it shouldn't be cell tower "> This uses GPS
04:41:18 <interceptingfist> I wonder if it auto turns on gps if its off
04:41:33 <cn3m[m]> I don't think GPS ever works if you don't turn on location services. This might have an override. I can't really test it on my iPad
04:41:44 <notmyname723[m]> cn3m: can ad companies tell if location is spoofed?
04:42:14 <interceptingfist> I love my iPad mini

04:51:18 <anne232> and interceptingfist I dont use Graphene OS at the moment, I joined this IRC to get more information about what phone I should get because I want to use it soon. That being said, I use one of the earlier Pixels with LineageOS

04:56:10 <anne232> why do you say that?
04:56:31 <TheJollyRoger> Not only that, but "Install another ROM" most "kustum ROMz" don't support verified boot, OTA updates, they use debug builds, and significantly roll back the SELinux security policies.
04:56:33 <cn3m[m]> <interceptingfist "Will they ever eliminate that yo"> GrapheneOS has proposed scoped apps
04:56:36 <notmyname723[m]> only few android tablets support LOS (decent for privacy, bad for security)

04:57:17 <notmyname723[m]> can't lock bootloader
04:57:28 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: as above. If you're not getting verified boot, and you're using debug builds, pretty much you're screwed the moment you get a browser exploit.
04:57:45 <notmyname723[m]> sometimes selinux permissive instead of enforcing
04:57:46 <anne232> tbh i dont understand why the bootloader thing matters that much?
04:57:58 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: ok, are you familiar with verified boot?
04:58:03 <anne232> Not really, no
04:58:07 <anne232> im no security expert
04:58:14 <anne232> but im very interested in security still lol
04:58:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, let me back this up and try to break it down for you a little bit:
04:58:18 <notmyname723[m]> you don't want someone installing a modified version of your OS
04:58:20 <cn3m[m]> Lineage breaks verified boot, rollback protections, damages the sandbox, it also uses CAF which is questionable and lies about security patches.
04:58:57 <anne232> also im not sure that you do need twrp for lineage? I didnt use it.
04:58:59 <interceptingfist> <cn3m[m] "GrapheneOS has proposed scoped a"> Is this already implemented
04:59:15 <notmyname723[m]> most devices, yes
04:59:26 <anne232> mine didnt require it.
04:59:27 <notmyname723[m]>  * most devices, yes you need twrp
04:59:27 <TheJollyRoger> Starting with Android 7, it became mandatory for OEMs to implement something called Verified Boot: this meant while the bootloader was locked, the late-stage bootloader would check the signature on the entire persistent system image. This ensured that you could prove, with a high degree of certainty, that the image you were running, is legitimate. The rationale:
04:59:27 <cn3m[m]> <interceptingfist "Is this already implemented"> No sadly it's not
04:59:29 <notmyname723[m]>  * most devices, yes you need twrp recovery
05:00:08 <TheJollyRoger> Let's say that you end up visiting a website that runs a JS Exploit and it breaks out of the browser, breaks out of the SELinux sandbox, and gets an exploit that can change your system partition, and install low-level malware.
05:00:14 <TheJollyRoger> If your bootloader is locked,
05:00:17 <cn3m[m]> Verified boot was 4.4. It was just a warning though
05:00:38 <TheJollyRoger> Then simply rebooting will /revert/ those changes and restore your system image, which includes everything right down to your firmware, to a pre-compromise condition.
05:01:10 <TheJollyRoger> this means that you'd need to get compromised /again/ before someone can continue doing nasty things to your phone.
05:01:33 <notmyname723[m]> <anne232 "also im not sure that you do nee"> which device?
05:02:08 <cn3m[m]> iOS hasn't had an exploit that can break verified boot since 2016 even with it's very active jailbreak community hunting for one even on unpatched versions
05:02:11 <TheJollyRoger> That orange warning sign you see "Software Integrity Not Guaranteed?" that's what this mean - you're essentially placing your trust into the persistent partition on the phone and hoping for the best, rather than having a proper root of trust.
05:02:38 <cn3m[m]> Verified boot is incredibly strong on a well designed OS like ChromeOS, Android, and iOS
05:02:40 <anne232> And lineageos does not use verified boot?
05:02:47 <notmyname723[m]> days of untethered jailbreaks behind us
05:02:50 <TheJollyRoger> Essentially, you've just ensured that should your phone get a compromise, that compromise is now persistent.
05:02:55 <notmyname723[m]> all semi-tethered now
05:03:16 <cn3m[m]> <notmyname723[m] "days of untethered jailbreaks be"> Honestly a very good thing
05:03:16 <interceptingfist> Im out Good night
05:03:17 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: yup, LineageOS considers verified boot an antifeature and disables it because people want to play sysadmin with their phones.
05:03:35 <anne232> Also is an attack like that not unlikely? I mean, your computer doesnt have a "verified boot" on it
05:03:45 <anne232> so couldnt you make the same argument in a case like this?
05:04:04 <anne232> is there any way i could enable it on lineageos?
05:04:11 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "Also is an attack like that not "> macOS, ChromeOS do and Windows in extremely rare cases
05:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: the desktop doesn't have verified boot because the desktop security model is perimeter based and no real progress on it has been made since the 1990's, and it's hobbled by reverse compatibility.
05:04:27 <cn3m[m]> macOS and ChromeOS it is mandatory
05:04:44 <anne232> but who wants to use those? lol
05:04:44 <notmyname723[m]> <cn3m[m] "macOS and ChromeOS it is mandato"> uefi for macos?
05:05:02 <anne232> those are shit operating systems, why would anyone use anything other than linux in 2020?
05:05:05 <TheJollyRoger> an attack like this is actually very likely - again, this is part of a defense-in-depth strategy which understands that it is possible for root level compromises to occur.
05:05:16 <cn3m[m]> <notmyname723[m] "uefi for macos?"> T2 enforces verified boot and it's pretty solid. Not perfect
05:05:23 <TheJollyRoger> After all that's essentially what's been plaguing the desktop since the 1990's.
05:05:43 <notmyname723[m]> that only for new devices?
05:05:58 <anne232> i mean if someone roots your linux box you are fucked...
05:06:06 <anne232> I dont see how im put any more at risk not having verified boot on my phone
05:06:11 <anne232> than not having it on my desktop...?
05:06:15 <TheJollyRoger> This is why the attitude taken by /sane/ mobile operating system developers is to essentially lock down the entire system image and write the operating system as a large collection of mutually-distrusting components which are constrained by mandatory access controls to /only/ have the access they need.
05:06:18 <cn3m[m]> Lineage also has known vulnerabilities against it in the vast majority of cases so verified boot on those devices is very important
05:06:55 <anne232> they're probably often patched? i mean im not expert but why would a developer leave major vulnerabilities unpatched?
05:07:03 <TheJollyRoger> Laziness.
05:07:06 <TheJollyRoger> And because again,
05:07:31 <TheJollyRoger> LineageOS caters to people who want to play sysadmin with their phones or "power users" and considers verified boot and security obstacle to that.
05:07:39 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "they're probably often patched? "> Partly due to unpatchable issues too due to vendor
05:08:16 <notmyname723[m]> <TheJollyRoger "LineageOS caters to people who w"> also unofficial support for devices where official support ended
05:08:17 <TheJollyRoger> People who also don't know any better and don't understand the nature of Android also end up falling for those "Privacy Theatre" apps like Xprivacy etc,
05:08:39 <TheJollyRoger> which simply do client-side checks that /provide a false sense of privacy/.
05:08:52 <anne232> idek what xprivacy is
05:08:58 <cn3m[m]> Or firewalls which are harmful
05:08:59 <anne232> I just like that lineageos doesnt have all the google b/s in it
05:09:11 <TheJollyRoger> Good thing you don't, it's essentially just an app that offers you the illusion your phone is spoofing data.
05:09:13 <anne232> and it allows old phones to still function and get newer software, has selinux,
05:09:28 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "I just like that lineageos doesn"> If you want that and security GrapheneOS and iOS are both more memorable
05:09:39 <TheJollyRoger> But it won't work unless you completely disable the android security model.
05:09:48 <notmyname723[m]> <anne232 "and it allows old phones to stil"> not always, sometimes permissive
05:10:18 <cn3m[m]> Lineage always weakens SELinux policies
05:10:28 <TheJollyRoger> So these people who didn't know any better just decided to do away with a proper security model entirely, because they just didn't know any better and only went on what the UI was telling them :D
05:10:29 <anne232> does stock android even have them at all?
05:10:32 <cn3m[m]> Along with non Pixel devices in general in most cases
05:10:32 <notmyname723[m]> anne232: which phone doesn't require twrp to flash lineage?
05:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: AOSP does not include Google.
05:10:55 <anne232> notmyname723[m], Pixel XL
05:11:49 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: those old phones are no longer recieving firmware updates, so it would be unwise to use them. In theory, you could maintain your own fork of AOSP to backport the security patches if you really wanted to, but I don't encourage people to hold out on devices that no longer are getting vendor support.
05:12:41 <cn3m[m]> RattlesnakeOS still supports the Pixel XL for example. It does have known vulnerabilities(nothing like Lineage though)
05:12:57 <notmyname723[m]> possible to sideload aosp gsi without edits on trebel supported device?
05:13:08 <notmyname723[m]>  * possible to install aosp gsi without edits on trebel supported device?
05:13:36 <anne232> what vulnerabilities does lineage have that are provable?
05:13:38 <notmyname723[m]> would basic functions work?
05:13:49 <notmyname723[m]>  * would basic functions work out of box?
05:13:57 <anne232> I mean, what OS should I go with then if I shouldnt be using Lineage?
05:14:06 <TheJollyRoger> Personal rant, I have no idea why the open source community raises so much hell about "Teh BaSeBand BaKCdurr Pr0seSSar!!11" and "Bl0BBy f1rmW4Re!!11" and then hold out on insecure devices that are no longer getting firmware updates.
05:14:14 <TheJollyRoger> Doesn't make sense. Too much cognitive dissonance.
05:14:17 <anne232> I currently have a pixel XL, and I plan to change that soon, but for now, is Lineage not my best option?
05:14:31 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "what vulnerabilities does lineag"> Check the Android Security Bulletin. anything in a vendor image is not patched
05:15:05 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "I currently have a pixel XL, and"> RattlesnakeOS is the most secure OS available
05:15:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, as an interim measure, go that way.
05:15:25 <cn3m[m]> It will only support the OG Pixel until Android 11 is released
05:16:00 <cn3m[m]> Serious security focused OSs like GrapheneOS and CalyxOS wouldn't support it as it's unsafe
05:17:56 <anne232> how can an entire device just be inherently unsafe?
05:18:09 <cn3m[m]> At least not on public releases
05:18:26 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "how can an entire device just be"> Since it has publicly known flaws that can't be fixed
05:18:43 <anne232> why cant or wont they be fixed?
05:18:59 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: Would you like the short version or the long version?
05:19:09 <anne232> whatever you feel like typing, I'd be interested in either.
05:19:13 <greenmoon[m]> Damn I have a bug with the new riotx update
05:19:45 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, pour yourself a drink.
05:20:09 <TheJollyRoger> ("Pour yourself a drink" = my way of saying "we could be here for a long time.")
05:20:19 <anne232> that's fine.
05:20:25 <anne232> im here to learn.
05:20:56 <cn3m[m]> Apple supports their devices for 5-7 years since they control the hardware and software development. Qualcomm and others don't want to develop security patches for that long and charge a lot. To have an Android go over 3 years you would need to pay a lot of money to vendors or control the hardware firmware stack
05:21:39 <TheJollyRoger> So the thing with computers nowadays except for a couple very, very, VERY tiny embedded systems, we're used to thinking of them as discrete assemblies of a CPU, GPU, RAM, Hard Drives, etc... but what the interesting thing is, your computer, and by extension, your cellphone, are actually networked, interconnected distributed systems consisting of *thousands* of computers which work
05:21:40 <TheJollyRoger> co-operatively to give you the impression of a complete system;
05:22:58 <TheJollyRoger> take for instance, that SD Cards run their own operating system to perform error correction, writelevelling, and maintenance operations on the flash memory storage.
05:23:20 <TheJollyRoger> In order to operate transparently to the host operating system, with the "host" being the operating system you see.
05:23:22 <TheJollyRoger> You with me so far?
05:25:50 <anne232> yes
05:27:32 <TheJollyRoger> Something of interest in phones is that they run their CPUs are best described as "Systems On Chip" - Your phone's CPU is its own complete packaged system, consisting of the CPU, GPU, modem and radios, etc. all compressed into the same chip. A lot of parts on it, are going to be interconnected. Again, nothing inherently bad about that - that's how we can get phones down to such small, neat,
05:27:34 <TheJollyRoger> cute, power-sipping form factors.
05:27:47 <TheJollyRoger> *is that the CPUs that they run are best described as
05:29:01 <TheJollyRoger> This is going to get nuanced hurriedly - firmware in itself isn't a bad thing. It's how we can have operating systems that we can simply compile for a device, or run on a wide variety of devices that are similar, without having to port each operating system to the device in assembly.
05:29:23 <TheJollyRoger> *each operating system to each device in assembly
05:30:38 <TheJollyRoger> This is also why anyone proclaiming to you to sell a device to that's "firmware free" is lying through their teeth.
05:31:46 <TheJollyRoger> The firmware is going to be the (significantly more primitive) operating systems that the other components on the SoC will be running. Your phone's SSD, GPU, the radios, etc.
05:32:56 <TheJollyRoger> Now... before you start asking me about "TeH BaSeBAnD BacKdURR!", I'm going to state that on devices that GrapheneOS supports, the modems are isolated from host memory via the CPU's system memory management unit.
05:33:43 <anne232> okay gimme one sec to read this, i was getting a drink
05:33:54 <TheJollyRoger> Firmware should be signed and it should be validated on initialization by those devices themselves, which are permanently fused to only run firmware that is valid from their vendors.
05:34:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, the "Pour yourself a drink" is not just figurative, it's very literal when I say it.
05:34:23 <TheJollyRoger> :)
05:34:54 <dazinism> <interceptingfist "Or does it disable the profile o"> Theres some info about user & work profiles here https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
05:35:45 <anne232> I see.
05:35:52 <TheJollyRoger> So here's the thing:
05:37:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: I disagree
05:37:28 <TheJollyRoger> Although devices on the host is isolated (people who go on and on about basebands being "backdoors" are living about 10 years in the past), security is a /process/ and not a once-and-done affair. On something as complex and versatile as the tangled mess of CPUs and devices that are computers, work NEEDs to be done on more than just the host to do things such as mitigate exploits:
05:37:33 <TheJollyRoger> Hey anupritaisno1[m] what's up?
05:37:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Firmware doesn't have a revocation policy
05:38:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> We should actually have a master key that signs other keys
05:38:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> So in case of a leak revocation is possible
05:39:09 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. Well... if we're going to try to recover a set of signing keys, well, that's sorta beyond my pay grade :P.
05:40:09 <cn3m[m]> A leaked signing key would suck on any system other than Pixels solid custom OSes
05:40:44 <cn3m[m]> * A leaked signing key would be absolutely devasting on any system other than Pixels solid custom OSes
05:40:44 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: so that's why vendor support is /needed/ to keep those devices secure. Firmware nonetheless occupies a very important and privileged position in your devices, and the thing is that Google negotiates with Qualcomm for three years of support, after which Qualcomm says "Sorry bro, but I'm not going to continue fixing this anymore."
05:40:48 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, yeah X(
05:41:09 <anne232> so
05:41:18 <anne232> how can this be fixed or improved upon?
05:41:25 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: you got a pen?
05:41:26 <anne232> like we as humanity have to move past this at some point?
05:41:32 <anne232> sure lol, i have notepad
05:41:56 <renlord> strcat[m]: hey, my outgoing emails to outlook are getting makred as junk mail
05:42:00 <renlord> how do i debug this
05:42:06 <renlord> i checked spf/dkim and all they look OK
05:42:18 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "how can this be fixed or improve"> Apple did it by making their own SOCs. Google could do that
05:42:42 <TheJollyRoger> Write your politicians, get out and start knocking on doors, and start forming a lobby to require Qualcomm and other SoC vendors to support their SoCs, or get a class action lawsuit together to hold them responsible for planned obsolescence.
05:43:10 <anne232> lol that peaceful shit doesnt work
05:43:35 <cn3m[m]> Support brands that already have long support (Apple 5-7 years) (Google 3 years).  They obviously see the reward in it
05:43:40 <anne232> rev up the molatov cocktails smh
05:44:05 <anne232> is there any way we can just make them no longer need to support it anyways? like is there a whole entire alternative?
05:44:10 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: Whatever floats your boat, but I've often said that attacking a computer is a technological measure, and defending one is a matter of politics. Fixing tech is comparatively easy compared to fixing /people/.
05:45:29 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: sure, go and steal get their signing keys.
05:45:35 <anne232> eh. are multi billion dollar corps and their execs really 'people'?
05:45:44 <anne232> thats quite the task lol
05:45:58 <anne232> I just wish we didn't have to rely on these big corps for our firmware and tech in general.
05:46:38 <TheJollyRoger> Political talk I'd prefer not to go into, but this is why it's a difficult task.
05:46:39 <anne232> I wish smaller businesses or better yet, collectives, could manufacture our things, instead of wealthy interest groups and the likes being in charge
05:46:44 <anne232> Yeah, I agree
05:46:53 <anne232> this is an irl channel for graphene, I get that.
05:46:59 <anne232> But I do feel as if it is somewhat related.
05:47:27 <anne232> its just hard to not lean that way at least a little bit when discussing a subject such as this.
05:47:41 <TheJollyRoger> Mhmm.
05:48:51 <TheJollyRoger> At the same time, this is a two-edged sword. Firmware /should/ be signed, because hooooohohoo boy, when it isn't, that's when things can get really messy in a hurry insofar as where security is concerned.
05:51:06 <cn3m[m]> Just hope Google makes their own chips without getting rid of the Qualcomm bootloader features like custom key for verified boot
05:51:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:51:43 <mxnorvak[m]> Huh, I thought firmware is like drivers for the hardware you have, not actually an OS  on its own for those parts
05:52:03 <cn3m[m]> Kernel wise you're looking at up to 5 years support
05:52:16 <anne232> mobile security is more complicated to some degree, i guess
05:52:33 <TheJollyRoger> Computer security itself is complicated.
05:52:42 <anne232> well yeah i know
05:52:55 <anne232> as i said earlier im not expert but it just seems like mobile devices add more complexity in a way
05:53:46 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: yep, the driver in your host often will talk to the firmware, which then does its own magic.
05:54:30 <TheJollyRoger> You may find it amusing to know that an eight-port MicroSEMI SAS controller can have up to ~40MB of binary firmware fused into its own onboard read-only memory.
05:54:46 <TheJollyRoger> Which is often compressed, signed and validated.
05:55:02 <TheJollyRoger> That's more than enough space to fit an entire Linux Kernel and userspace.
05:55:10 <dazinism> anne232: modern devices are so very complex that it takes the resources of a huge company to make a decent job of putting them together
05:55:29 <dazinism> Actually, several huge companies
05:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: if you're curious, I own and use a Talos II as my daily driver computer. The motherboard alone came with more than 7000 pages of documentation, including the POWER ISA reference manual, and hundreds of pages of schematics, and required compiling more than 64MB of firmware.
05:56:39 <JTL> Needs 2000 more pages
05:56:42 <JTL> OVER 9000!
05:56:44 * TheJollyRoger cracks up
05:56:53 <TheJollyRoger> Well if you add the POWER reference manual...
05:56:58 <JTL> There we go
05:56:59 <TheJollyRoger> Then very well you could get OVER NINE THOUSAND! :D
05:57:49 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: if you're curious about a platform that you can control down to the firmware, that's about as good as you're going to get at this moment.
05:59:04 <dazinism> Theres been various efforts to develop computer systems that start to break out from being dominated by a huge corporate. But its difficult.
06:01:27 <TheJollyRoger> The amount of *risk* that someone has to shoulder to design a CPU is absolutely insane.
06:01:46 <TheJollyRoger> Getting silicon made is no easy task.
06:03:32 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: yep, the driver in you"> It's always great when i assume i know quite enough about one thing and I've seen these conversations multiple times but then i start reading the chat and I'm like, I need to learn the basics again
06:04:56 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: heh, well... I'm always considering myself a student when I'm at the keyboard. These areas of study are bottomless pits >_<.
06:06:12 <TheJollyRoger> Sometimes firmware is loaded from /lib/firmware in the form of precompiled, signed and verified binary packages each time that the host boots, or it's stated by loading it into SPI flash or electronically erasable programmable read only memory on the device itself.
06:07:38 <dazinism> Making computer chips isnt very easy/practical. Especially on a small scale
06:08:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(...
06:08:23 <anne232> there are open source firmwares for alot of hardware now though, yes?
06:08:52 <TheJollyRoger> There's a place I heard about that will do low volume production runs of silicon by assembling several masks into a single mask, then running it all as the same batch, but as Louis Armstrong said "If you gots to ask how much it costs you can't afford it!"
06:08:54 <dazinism> Some people are doing it. But, as far as I understand, the chips you can do are like decades old tech.
06:09:21 <dazinism> Then theres FPGAs
06:09:24 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: I think some university labs could
06:09:29 <dallemon[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The amount of *risk* that someon"> Don't you mean amount of RISC 😅
06:09:32 <anne232> TheJollyRoger, I cant seem to find anything on this tallos II online really lol
06:10:20 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: no, not really. There's been efforts like Coreboot to attempt to develop open source firmware for devices that don't have signature validation, but they've been developed by the slow and painful process of reverse engineering, and on modern devices all they really do is make calls back to a management interface that's known only to Intel anyways.
06:10:21 <dazinism> Again, compared to a modern device, a huge downgrade in performance
06:10:25 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: https://raptorcs.com
06:10:26 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "there are open source firmwares "> The problem is there's a lot of work that goes into secure firmware. For example Qualcomm does an amazing job. So does Apple. MediaTek left a critical issue for a year. Not sure if they have fixed it
06:10:28 <TheJollyRoger> There you go.
06:10:46 <TheJollyRoger> dallemon[m]: ahahahahaha I laughed XD
06:10:49 <anne232> ive never really worried about hardware security much, should I really?
06:10:55 <anne232> and yeah i was referring to coreboot, libreboot and similar
06:11:02 <TheJollyRoger> JTL: hey that's awesome! I hope maybe I could come across something like that someday.
06:11:12 <JTL> Heh maybe
06:11:14 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: at this point, your most secure hardware is going to be your Pixel 3a.
06:11:26 <anne232> i was speaking more along the lines of desktop
06:11:32 <cn3m[m]> Libreboot ships with vulnerabilities
06:11:38 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: devices running libreboot are going to be permanently vulnerable to Spectre and Meltdown.
06:11:43 <anne232> but should i not just go and get a 3a xl or a 3 xl or a 3?
06:12:02 <anne232> then whats the point in libreboot
06:12:31 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anne232: at this point, your mos"> Isn't iPhone still a little ahead and Graphene wins in software?
06:12:31 <dallemon[m]> <anne232 "then whats the point in libreboo"> "freedom"
06:12:34 <TheJollyRoger> Meaning the JS running in your browser from off the Internet can reach out of the browser, reach out of the virtual machine you've isolated the guest VM in, reach INTO A DIFFERENT VM, and suck out your disk encryption keys or your GPG private keys.
06:12:41 <TheJollyRoger> Enjoy.
06:12:58 <anne232> coreboot could accomplish the same?
06:13:25 <anne232> wait what, TheJollyRoger ?
06:13:28 <anne232> oh nvm i get it now
06:13:48 <anne232> idk like should i be paranoid about my computer hardware now?
06:14:04 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4 and 4a are technically more secure on a hardware level than the 3s, but without official GrapheneOS can't recommend that yet
06:14:08 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: Any modern x86 devices running Coreboot are simply using Coreboot as a shim to issue callbacks to a management interface that's closed source, so you might as well consider any modern x86 devices running coreboot to simply not even be open.
06:14:26 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "but should i not just go and get"> It's very much a personal choice
06:14:42 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3 has just under 1.5 years left on support
06:14:56 <anne232> is the 3 not better than the 3a?
06:14:58 <dazinism> Theres this FPGA based project https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5706
06:15:23 <jcpicard32[m]> anne232: Get the device with the features you care the most about. The 3a has a headphone jack and will be supported for longer. The 3 has wireless charging and a better camera.
06:15:23 <dallemon[m]> <cn3m[m] "Isn't iPhone still a little ahea"> AFAIK you can still jailbreak an iPhone through the browser.
06:15:23 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3a just under 2
06:15:24 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: Like I said, if you're interested in hardware security and openness, at this moment your most solid bet is going to be a Talos II, Talos Lite, or a Blackbird from Raptor Computing Systems.
06:15:52 <TheJollyRoger> And -- heh, good point dazinism, I forgot about Betrusted -- /performant and usable as a desktop/.
06:16:12 <anne232> Are you sure this isn't overkill?
06:16:15 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4 and A13 iPhones are definitely at the forefront hardware security wise
06:16:16 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Category:Gallery The Morgan's Revenge be me ship.
06:16:18 <anne232> can I run Qubes OS on these?
06:16:48 <anne232> like if im gonna drop 7 grand on a computer
06:16:54 <TheJollyRoger> QubesOS at this moment requires a large amount of x86 assembly language. A port is in progress but may not be viable for some time yet.
06:17:28 <anne232> and this hardware doesnt utilize anything like that?
06:17:38 <anne232> Would it not be a lesser evil for me to just use qubes OS with my current hardware then?
06:17:45 <TheJollyRoger> Completely different Instruction Set Architecture.
06:18:02 <anne232> Wouldnt there be a hell of a lot of compatibility issues?
06:18:27 <TheJollyRoger> No, they'll run what you compile for them, provided it's not written in an architecture-specific language like assembly.
06:18:33 <TheJollyRoger> I've gotten Unreal 4 to run on mine before.
06:19:16 <TheJollyRoger> However, if you don't know what you're doing or have immediate and ready access to people who can hold your hand through it like I did when I set up mine, stick with what you have.
06:19:37 <TheJollyRoger> In all honesty, there are *much* bigger things you have to worry about than  closed source management interfaces on the desktop.
06:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> Like an inherently broken perimeter based security model that is stuck in the mid 1990's.
06:20:42 <anne232> fuck
06:20:43 <TheJollyRoger> And won't change because that would break backwards compatibility or what we've come to expect out of the desktop.
06:20:44 <anne232> this is all so heavy
06:20:44 <cn3m[m]> <dallemon[m] "AFAIK you can still jailbreak an"> You can't
06:21:01 <cn3m[m]> Qubes has some security concerns
06:21:22 <anne232> lol
06:21:24 <anne232> like what
06:21:37 <cn3m[m]> I think there's too much trusted in the dom0 thanks to the repos
06:21:50 <anne232> you dont even use the dom0 really
06:21:50 <cn3m[m]> The guests are also insecure
06:21:54 <anne232> guests?
06:22:24 <anne232> I rarely ever run anything in the dom0
06:22:26 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "you dont even use the dom0 reall"> Everything is running off of dom0 if it's compromised it's game over
06:22:29 <TheJollyRoger> Qubes treats the isolation provided by the Xen hypervisor as a panacea, but neglects that compartmentalization does very little if all the guests themselves suffer the same vulnerabilities... like say, let's say Debian being years behind on security patches and sometimes disregarding security patches from upstream entirely unless a CVE gets assigned.
06:22:31 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "guests?"> Any VM you rub
06:22:43 <cn3m[m]> Run*
06:22:43 <anne232> I know that, even the qubes documentation admits that if the dom0 is compromised its game over.
06:22:47 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "I rarely ever run anything in th"> Updates man
06:22:48 <anne232> But that's very unlikely.
06:22:54 <anne232> Yeah only updates
06:22:56 <anne232> thats literally it
06:23:11 <TheJollyRoger> I like to put this in ship terminology: it's kinda like what happened to the Titanic. Yes, it had watertight compartments, the fact that it could survive flooding in five didn't matter when six got punctured.
06:23:15 <anne232> It's still much more secure than any other operating system out there that I know of.
06:23:18 <cn3m[m]> Qubes trusts way too many builders and signers for comfort
06:23:34 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "But that's very unlikely."> It's not repo based attacks happen way more than you would think
06:23:47 <anne232> ive not heard of any recently?
06:23:58 <anne232> and what builders and signers do they trust that arent apart of the qubes project?
06:24:04 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "It's still much more secure than"> Windows 10 Secured Core, macOS, and ChromeOS have far better trust models
06:24:09 <anne232> LOL
06:24:24 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "ive not heard of any recently?"> There was just a study where 174 supply chains got real world attacks. Snap also shipped malware
06:24:24 <anne232> all 3 of those are spyware dude.
06:24:26 <nickcalyx[m]> cn3m:  and TheJollyRoger  what do you run on your laptop then
06:24:31 <TheJollyRoger> The advantage of Qubes is that if one domain gets compromised, then it's not game over, but it on its own is not going to prevent all of them from being compromised via the same exploit
06:24:32 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "and what builders and signers do"> Everyone from Fedora hahah
06:24:50 <anne232> how can they all get compromised from the same attack? that doesnt make sense
06:24:58 <anne232> the whole point of qubes is that you run different things in different qubes
06:25:15 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "cn3m:  and TheJollyRoger  what d"> I run Windows 10 Enterprise on mine. Notably more secure than QubesOS for me
06:25:19 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "how can they all get compromised"> You trust the signing of the updates you get which is serious
06:25:22 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: sure they can. Debian is lagging years behind in security updates and exploit mitigations.
06:25:28 <anne232> Dude, Idc what you say
06:25:32 <anne232> advocating windows 10 is absurd
06:25:36 <anne232> windows 10 is not secure or private.
06:25:37 <greenmoon[m]> <anne232 "all 3 of those are spyware dude."> Stop trolling anne
06:25:42 <anne232> im not
06:25:56 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "how can they all get compromised"> If one VM can get hacked it stands to reason they could hack the others
06:26:09 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "windows 10 is not secure or priv"> Prove it
06:26:11 <TheJollyRoger> And if you choose to connect those domains to the internet, they can very well be attacked simultaneously because Debian doesn't backport security fixes from upstream unless they get a CVE.
06:26:13 <anne232> right, but im not gonna be running the same softwar eon al vms
06:26:59 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 with some light tweaks comes up clean on MITM
06:27:02 <anne232> An attack like that seems unlikely and unrealistic. if i use one qube for chatting, one qube for browsing the internet, another for Tor browser, etc.
06:27:04 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "right, but im not gonna be runni"> You will likely have a browser on each
06:27:09 <anne232> how am i gonna have all of my vms hacked?
06:27:11 <anne232> Nope lol
06:27:12 <nickcalyx[m]> cn3m: how can you quantify that windows 10 is more secure than qubes exactly, though
06:27:19 <TheJollyRoger> So, this is why I say that Qubes is a welcome and appreciated move to a decent security model on the desktop, it's not a panacea
06:27:24 <anne232> LOL yes, ikr nickcalyx[m]
06:27:25 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: consider Systemd yet? :)
06:27:30 <TheJollyRoger> *systemd yet?
06:27:40 <anne232> what about systemd?
06:27:59 <anne232> idk ive researched it abit and it seems like the paranoia surrounding systemd may be..... idk im iffy on this
06:28:19 <anne232> im not super educated, but systemd doesnt seem that terrible?
06:28:29 <TheJollyRoger> What each of your domains is running for its init and what the operating system's going to fall back for things like say... hey DNS, and yes you can be attacked over DNS.
06:28:40 <anne232> and yes TheJollyRoger , nothing is "a panacea"
06:28:53 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "cn3m: how can you quantify that "> I have Windows Sandbox which is running on Hyper-V which is first class. I have core isolation. I have NT kernel. I have WDAG(also based on Hyper-V) I have Windows 10 which has far better hardening. I have defense in depth which Qubes doesn't. I also only trust one company to ship updates and everyone there is paid
06:29:19 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 is more secure in every meaningful metric. It uses a ton of ram though
06:29:20 <nickcalyx[m]> cn3m: ok but I was asking about how you quantify that windows is more secure than qubes
06:29:44 <anne232> It's a clunky pieces of shit and a privacy hazard. Microsoft has spooks in the system to spy on you. Linux systems are far more useful in general too.
06:29:50 <nickcalyx[m]> and how do you know windows has "far better" hardening
06:29:53 <anne232> Windows has a long history of being exploited lol
06:29:56 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "cn3m: ok but I was asking about "> In what way is it anything but demonstrably more secure how I have it setup?
06:29:57 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not going to go into detail on systemd, but it's an example of where disregarding of hardening of the individual domains can lead to simultaneous compromise, even if you do everything right - and on Debian this problem is exacerbated because Debian freezes the packages at a specific version, and then tries to backport security fixes to them from upstream, then diverges significantly from
06:29:58 <TheJollyRoger> upstream over time.
06:30:28 <anne232> i use a combination of arch, debian and fedora qubes for different purposes.
06:30:30 <nickcalyx[m]> cn3m: I'm not making a claim that qubes is more secure.  I'm asking you how you quantify that windows is more secure than qubes
06:30:38 <anne232> so im not too worried about debian specific issues.
06:30:48 <nickcalyx[m]> what's the methodology
06:31:00 <cn3m[m]> Hardening is an easy win for Windows 10 and NT kernel(which is much better designed for security).
06:31:39 <anne232> you can do 'hardening' on a linux system as well.
06:31:52 <nickcalyx[m]> how can you quantify that windows NT kernel is "better designed".. I'm not being argumentative but it just sounds like hot air when its not backed by methodology to compare and not quantified
06:33:21 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "how can you quantify that window"> A perfect example (beside obvious quantifiable hardening) is how they are moving to a far more hybrid model. Look at the GPU crash on Linux and Windows. NT gets smaller and Linux gets bigger
06:33:51 <renlord> this is really annoying, everything is setup correctly, but just because my ip address is not in some reputable list, my mail got marked as spam
06:33:51 <anne232> lol gpu crash
06:33:53 <renlord> stupid
06:33:55 <dazinism> Theres also this old classic about Windows
06:33:58 <dazinism> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY
06:34:18 <renlord> there's should be anti-trust regulations against these sort of behaviour
06:34:31 <anne232> also either way, windows is still a piece of shit, it runs like shit, its clunky, microsoft spies on you and siphons information
06:34:32 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Theres also this old classic abo"> That's a meme
06:35:03 <dazinism> cn3m: a great one though ;)
06:36:14 <jcpicard32[m]> <anne232 "also either way, windows is stil"> Proof?
06:37:34 <anne232> it runs like shit? theres lots of extra shit running on it and it makes the system clunky. microsoft admits that it sends some data to them, i wouldnt be surprised if it sent more.
06:37:52 <anne232> Also another big downside to windows is that it doesnt have cryptsetup
06:38:05 <jcpicard32[m]> anne232: Run an MITM. You can see what it's actually sending instead of spreading FUD like you're doing now
06:38:11 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 has CFG, a meaningful implementation of ASLR, it can force important hardening features like CFG, ACG, SimExec, CallerCheck, SEHOP, StackPivot even in userland. It has a minimal kernel. Windows 10 UWP apps are fully sandboxed. The virtualization is first in class. Windows 10 Secured Core can offer the best verified boot on x86. Microsoft is the only trusted party in updates. nickcalyx That's the main
06:38:11 <cn3m[m]> highlights.
06:38:13 <anne232> microsoft is known to be an nsa collaborating company
06:38:28 <anne232> they collaborate with nsa spooks, its known
06:38:47 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "microsoft is known to be an nsa "> MITM it
06:38:50 <anne232> you can run an mitm and maybe find a few things, or maybe find little to nothing, but if they wanted your data or info
06:38:55 <anne232> they could get it.
06:39:03 <anne232> your windows machine is not safe from adversaries.
06:39:19 <cn3m[m]> Microsoft is the one that tried to escape the US data collection laws by moving it's servers.
06:39:56 <anne232> yet they still collaborate with intelligence agencies as does google and such
06:40:00 <nickcalyx[m]> 😂
06:40:02 <anne232> why do you want to defend these corporations?
06:40:41 <anne232> microsoft.... as a trusted party....
06:40:53 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "why do you want to defend these "> They make the best software for security and by extension privacy
06:40:54 <cn3m[m]> I use the best product
06:40:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "Microsoft is the one that tried "> But did they succeed?
06:40:55 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "But did they succeed?"> They did until Congress passed a new law
06:41:04 <jcpicard32[m]> Google is one of the biggest contributors to your saint Linux.
06:41:11 <jcpicard32[m]> These companies do substantial work to move security forward
06:41:19 <anne232> no they dont
06:41:22 <jcpicard32[m]> And privacy without security is nothing more than theater
06:41:23 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "microsoft.... as a trusted party"> You completely trust every root cert
06:41:40 <anne232> easily over microsoft
06:41:51 <anne232> google has contributed nothing to linux. if anything they've made it worse^^
06:41:51 <jcpicard32[m]> anne232: How does the Chromium sandbox not move browser security forward?
06:41:59 <jcpicard32[m]> Compared to Pale Moon
06:41:59 <jcpicard32[m]> Or IE6
06:42:04 <cn3m[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "Google is one of the biggest con"> Google and Linux are both actively sharing vulnerabilities with the US and Chinese governments a month in advance so they can maintain their forks
06:42:05 <jcpicard32[m]> You're just wrong that they're not improving security
06:42:12 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, that's enough. anne232, you're going into denial over Google and Linux.
06:42:42 <jcpicard32[m]> cn3m: I'm aware
06:43:05 <nickcalyx[m]> What does the.NSA.run
06:43:18 <anne232> how so TheJollyRoger
06:43:34 <cn3m[m]> Linux and Android share vulnerabilities with the feds and root certs could hack you. There's no safety from the government or big corporations anne232
06:43:40 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "What does the.NSA.run"> I dunno, but whatever it is I want it
06:43:54 <nickcalyx[m]> They run linux
06:44:00 <anne232> lol of course google does but linux isnt really a corporation and has no incentive to
06:44:02 <jcpicard32[m]> (Citation needed)
06:44:12 <anne232> unless you have evidence, this is just conspiratorial
06:44:30 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: Consider that Google has consistently ranked among the "top ten" contributors to Linux and other projects like Kubernetes for many years.
06:44:46 <anne232> but in what meaningful way have they actually contributed?
06:44:51 <dazinism> Truth is that probably no computer can be totally trusted
06:44:55 <anne232> Android and ChromeOS do not count
06:45:52 <jcpicard32[m]> anne232: I'd recommend watching this
06:45:53 <jcpicard32[m]> https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bj1gpz/syzbot_and_the_tale_of_thousand_kernel_bugs/
06:46:07 <TheJollyRoger> About 5.3% of contributions to the kernel, behind Intel at ~12, and Red Hat at ~8, as well as -- haha damn jcpicard32[m] you beat me to it.
06:46:08 <jcpicard32[m]> Google uses their hardware to fuzz the linux kernal
06:46:19 <jcpicard32[m]> In doing so they've found bugs faster than they can be patched
06:46:31 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "unless you have evidence, this i"> They are an open source project of course they share vulnerabilities. There's security teams for this so people can maintain forks. That includes governments.
06:46:40 <nickcalyx[m]> what percentage of google's contributions to linux are security related though.. as opposed to performance
06:47:29 <anne232> yeah and also they share vulnerabilities with everyone, them being open source
06:47:31 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "what percentage of google's cont"> Google tries to upstream security features all the time and Linux says it hits performance too hard. Look at the AOSP kernel and the ChromeOS kernel. They are much more secure
06:47:41 <anne232> how does that mean that they share secret exploits with the government?
06:48:02 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "yeah and also they share vulnera"> They do it a month before the code is public
06:48:07 <nickcalyx[m]> cn3m: I asked about percentages though
06:48:10 <cn3m[m]> Read the links
06:48:17 <anne232> evidence?
06:48:18 <anne232> please
06:48:23 <anne232> what advantage would this even provide
06:48:35 <renlord> anne232: the advantage for one is doing things correctly
06:48:38 <dazinism> Its reasonable to suggest that iOS and Android/AOSP are the most secure operating systems avaialble.
06:48:44 <anne232> lol what
06:48:44 <renlord> as oppose to taking the shortcut
06:48:47 <anne232> how is that correct in any sense of the word
06:48:48 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "cn3m: I asked about percentages "> You mean that they reject?
06:49:01 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "evidence?"> I sent you two links
06:49:06 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: did you even see the part about syzbot finding bugs that the "precious open source community" hasn't? Some of them SEVERE?
06:49:23 <TheJollyRoger> What part of that do you not understand?
06:49:27 <renlord> unfounded conspiracy theories are not welcome here.
06:49:48 <anne232> aye^
06:50:06 <TheJollyRoger> Because honestly, I don't really have the patience to deal with Toxic Power User mentality.
06:50:07 <renlord> if you want to discuss conspiracies, I expect you to pile on evidence.
06:50:11 <jcpicard32[m]> anne232: More evidence than was given to me when I started looking has been given to you in the last ten minutes.
06:50:17 <jcpicard32[m]> I suggest you read it instead of discussing with us
06:50:34 <jcpicard32[m]> If you want to dispute this info from reputable sources I suggest you find your own reputable sources to do so
06:50:45 <cn3m[m]> Google is the hero of Linux security. However Linux ignores their work and only cares about performance
06:50:49 <renlord> also consider writing a paper and submitting it to a credible journal
06:50:56 <renlord> if you're going to do the research
06:51:05 <renlord> everyone will be interested.
06:51:11 <jcpicard32[m]> It doesn't matter that you want Linux security to be comparable to Windows or MacOS
06:51:26 <jcpicard32[m]> It's not for the reasons discussed in the links above
06:52:02 <renlord> cn3m[m]: i believe at this point, google has given up
06:52:04 <cn3m[m]> No serious exploitation researcher would consider Linux more secure than Windows
06:52:35 <renlord> beyond very critical vulnerabilities that need to be patched, i doubt they upstream anything else
06:52:45 <renlord> and backport mainline instead
06:52:58 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
06:53:14 <renlord> LKML people cant take 1% performance hit for more correctness
06:53:16 <renlord> lol
06:53:17 <anne232> would they consider windows secure either?
06:53:27 <renlord> anne232: probably not
06:53:39 <anne232> i agree on linux itself, but what about distros that implement more security, and that are hardened?
06:53:40 <renlord> but out of the box, relatively more secure
06:54:08 <cn3m[m]> The stink of Linux weighs down on serious projects like GrapheneOS, ChromeOS, and Kicksecure. They are doing serious overhauls of security to counter, but Linux makes the situation worse every patch. Zircon can't come soon enough
06:54:09 <renlord> anne232: the moment you make a syscall into supervisor mode, you are fucked.
06:54:22 <renlord> anne232: if you're using any linux distro
06:54:50 <renlord> it is free rein within the monolitith linux kerenl
06:54:55 <renlord> it is a design problem
06:55:05 <anne232> lol but proposing windows as an alternative seems silly cn3m[m]
06:55:18 <anne232> ChromeOS, a serious project?
06:55:35 <renlord> anne232: what are your main gripes with ChromeOS?
06:55:49 <anne232> well for one, im pretty sure you need a google account to use alot of the features.
06:56:07 <anne232> its very limited in features too
06:56:29 <anne232> it feels more like you're using a smart phone than a desktop or laptop
06:56:40 <renlord> anne232: you are talking about completely separate things and not security.
06:56:47 <renlord> you're complaining about functionality.
06:56:59 <anne232> well google account isnt a good thing for privacy.
06:57:25 <renlord> if you dont have good security, you dont have privacy at all.
06:57:29 <anne232> but sure. I concede that I dont know much about chrome OS in terms of security.
06:57:34 <renlord> your privacy will eventually be compromised.
06:57:44 <anne232> yeah, right, but
06:57:49 <anne232> I think im much more private and secure
06:57:51 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "well google account isnt a good "> The integration is all open source you can audit it and the opt outs
06:57:54 <anne232> using qubes OS properly on my computer
06:57:56 <anne232> than using chrome OS lol
06:58:07 <dazinism> Going back to AOSP being one of the most secure operating systems available - this sounds like a nice plan https://grapheneos.org/#roadmap
06:58:36 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "but sure. I concede that I dont "> ChromeOS on official Chrome hardware is likely the more secure and open device you can get on the consumer level for a laptop. Even down to using Coreboot
06:58:40 <renlord> anne232: maybe. if your hypervisor gets RCE-d gg let end.
06:58:48 <renlord> all your opsec down the drain
06:59:08 <renlord> and i believe its more likely to happen on qubes than on chromeos
06:59:11 <renlord> lol
06:59:37 <cn3m[m]> ChromeOS has verified boot, much stronger hardening measures, and meaningful sandboxing for programs
06:59:43 <cn3m[m]> ChromeOS is meaningfully more secure and by extension private
06:59:53 <TheJollyRoger> No exploit mitigations and simple reliance on Xen!
06:59:54 <dazinism> Think Qubes is a reasonable choice given all options
06:59:55 <anne232> except when google has access to all your info
07:00:16 <anne232> take these complaints to the qubes developers and see what they have to say?
07:00:33 <anne232> idk i may, im sure they hav ea response to this
07:00:42 <anne232> i doubt its that simple.
07:00:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: BTW I'm adding plugins to vanadium
07:01:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> *laughs in unlock*
07:01:06 <renlord> qubes guys will say, they are doing the best they can with what they have, which is a commendable project.
07:01:14 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: I cracked up XD
07:01:17 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "except when google has access to"> Check the source they don't
07:01:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: well I got adblock into vanadium
07:01:48 <anne232> anything you use w/ your google account they will have the data of.
07:02:03 <cn3m[m]> Qubes is very limited what they can do. Much like GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS is starting on a drastically more secure base project
07:02:15 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200618-123154_Vanadium.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/pyzvUwqwIDHaMgsgVbVgoCYW >
07:02:17 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: oh good gravy XD
07:02:17 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200618-123159_Vanadium.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/xeDoUZbrwAehkwBfeenPKHrz >
07:02:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's not much tbh
07:03:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyone can do this given enough time
07:03:10 <anne232> android,  'drastically more secure' than fedora?
07:03:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> anne232: yes
07:03:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> The only thing android doesn't have is stack probing
07:03:38 <cn3m[m]> Qubes is a great project it's just not going to compare to multi billion dollar projects like AOSP, ChromeOS, macOS, and iOS.
07:03:42 <anne232> then why is it commonly said that android is quite  vulnerable?
07:03:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise android has everything better than fedora
07:03:54 <anne232> macos and ios are jokes lmao
07:04:07 <anne232> I mean the limited functionality alone makes those projects so shitty
07:04:10 <jcpicard32[m]> Because people who say that are comparing it to the iPhone
07:04:26 <jcpicard32[m]> The iPhone is substantially more secure than any non-Graphene phone
07:04:33 <anne232> well android isnt a very good desktop software though
07:04:36 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "then why is it commonly said tha"> Android is a family of operating systems. AOSP is insanely strong. Your Xiaomi phone that hasn't gotten patches for 2 years is not
07:04:37 <renlord> android and ios are very competitive now when it comes to seucirty
07:04:57 <renlord> i think since android 8, its been very competitive
07:04:58 <anne232> it sucks that we have to constantly have patches to keep something secure lmao
07:05:02 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: because Android seeks to get CVEs assigned for every single vulnerability that they discover. Most open source projects just see it as an insult and don't bother reporting CVEs.
07:05:03 <anne232> ik thats how it is but its sannoying
07:05:05 <renlord> prior to 8, its been lagging behind ios
07:05:06 <jcpicard32[m]> There's still a big difference at the hardware level though, no?
07:05:18 <renlord> jcpicard32[m]: true
07:05:22 <cn3m[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "The iPhone is substantially more"> It trades blows with GrapheneOS and smashes CalyxOS and Stock Android. iPhones are truly not a good thing to have to compare too. GrapheneOS is really the only thing I can say are better
07:05:27 <jcpicard32[m]> Obviously much smaller with things like Titan M
07:05:28 <renlord> that's mostly due to diverse hardware ecosystem
07:05:50 <jcpicard32[m]> right
07:05:52 <renlord> but the stock pixel vs. stock iphone -- very competitive
07:06:12 <anne232> the extra security you speak of is really worth the limited functionality of the iphone?
07:06:22 <jcpicard32[m]> Depends on your threat model
07:06:25 <anne232> and the fact that its used by simpletons and makes you look like a rich asshole lmao?
07:06:34 <jcpicard32[m]> If you're a journalist, or working for a political campaign, then yes
07:06:38 <renlord> anne232: geniuses fuck up too
07:06:40 <renlord> just so you know
07:06:51 <jcpicard32[m]> If you want to sysadmin your phone then no
07:07:04 <anne232> apple is a bad company and i dont want to give my money to them
07:07:04 <cn3m[m]> Most of that is ecosystem issues. Android can't force privacy and security features due to countless apps the would break
07:07:11 <greenmoon[m]> Rich with a sub 1000$ phone lol?
07:07:22 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "but the stock pixel vs. stock ip"> If you use Google Play sure
07:07:30 <anne232> a grand is a lot to drop on a phone.
07:07:35 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "the extra security you speak of "> Have you tried iOS 12 and 13 they aren't bad
07:07:37 <jcpicard32[m]> The iPhone SE does exist
07:07:45 <anne232> most people dont have a grand to spare. I do, but I still wouldnt be willing to buy it.
07:07:48 <renlord> anne232: you should just use a nokia 2g phone.
07:07:51 <jcpicard32[m]> $400 for top notch security is not exactly that much
07:08:10 <dazinism> <anne232 "apple is a bad company and i don"> Get a pixel 3a and stick GrapheneOS on it then....
07:08:15 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "apple is a bad company and i don"> They make money of screwing you on repairs not your data. I prefer that. They also open source half of their OSes
07:08:15 <greenmoon[m]> <anne232 "a grand is a lot to drop on a ph"> You aren't rich if you use a 1000$ phone...and  Many poor's people have those phones they just buy them at credit
07:08:20 <anne232> I plan on doing that dazinism
07:08:37 <renlord> or just use a public payphone
07:08:41 <renlord> best for privacy.
07:08:45 <anne232> yeah going in to debt to get a shitty brand name phone as a status symbol
07:08:46 <anne232> lol
07:08:53 <renlord> with a paperbag
07:08:57 <renlord> over your head
07:09:02 <anne232> public payphone? boi that aint encrypted
07:09:06 <TheJollyRoger> And with the microphone unscrewe.
07:09:08 <TheJollyRoger> *unscrewed.
07:09:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ultimate privacy.
07:09:18 <TheJollyRoger> No one will listen to your phone calls then.
07:09:30 <jcpicard32[m]> Idk man. I've already deleted all my accounts, sold my devices and moved to the desert.
07:09:36 <anne232> phone calls are obsolete honestly
07:09:38 <renlord> tap morse with a unique encoding
07:09:39 <TheJollyRoger> (This includes the person you're trying to call, but bah, details!)
07:09:43 <jcpicard32[m]> This message is being sent from a device made from FLOSS sand /S
07:09:44 <dazinism> I hang about payphones and listen to folks chatting
07:09:59 <anne232> tbh i never seen payphones anymore
07:10:04 <anne232> i live rural though
07:10:12 <TheJollyRoger> dazinism: maybe now would be the time for me to dig out that laser microphone I bought off the Internet somewhere...
07:10:17 <renlord> anne232: HAM Radio
07:12:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: why u buying such stuff
07:12:57 <greenmoon[m]> <anne232 "yeah going in to debt to get a s"> Idk where u from but most people that I knows get their phones at credit, very few buy them at full price outside of their phone providers
07:13:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> I would honestly like to make a poc of audio using gyroscope BTW
07:13:09 <radixed9[m]> I have my amateur radio license  renlord:
07:13:29 <anne232> i mean if i was buying a 1000 phone
07:13:29 <radixed9[m]> iPhone SE is $400. If you need security and privacy with long support there is no better deal
07:13:31 <anne232> i would pay up front
07:13:34 <renlord> radixed9[m]: why do amateurs need an amateur radio license?
07:13:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> radixed9: have you considered an upgrade?
07:13:43 <renlord> i thought you can just use the unlicensed band?
07:13:46 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: Oh, heh, heh, no reason... >_>...
07:13:57 <TheJollyRoger> renlord: I think you can, but you're not supposed to go above a certain amount of power.
07:13:59 <radixed9[m]> Funny guys 🙂
07:14:03 <anne232> well anyways, what currently available phone for graphene OS will have the longest support?
07:14:07 <anne232> if I get a phone, I want it to last me
07:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> 3a.
07:14:16 <renlord> wait for the 4a lol
07:14:19 <jcpicard32[m]> Then I'd get a 3a or an SE
07:14:29 <jcpicard32[m]> or a 4a if you can wait
07:14:29 <TheJollyRoger> renlord: I think in Canada it's something like 3-5 watts but I am not sure.
07:14:32 <radixed9[m]> <renlord "i thought you can just use the u"> no you can't use a HAM radio without a license
07:14:48 <renlord> well i havent tried, so i wouldnt know
07:14:51 <radixed9[m]> Source: am a General
07:15:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm like can I get a fucking flagship with LCD jcpicard32
07:15:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can't find LCD anywhere
07:15:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Qled is still far off
07:15:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oled has burn-in
07:15:47 <renlord> how quick do authorities catch on to unlicensed broadcasting/
07:15:52 <jcpicard32[m]> Yeah. I've just decided I can't win. Especially since I prefer OLED for colors and reading in bed
07:16:04 <jcpicard32[m]> But that burn-in tho
07:16:13 <radixed9[m]> renlord: You could steal a callsign. If you use it without a callsign someone will report you
07:16:40 <renlord> and i assume they have sophisticated ways to triangulate the signal?
07:16:45 <radixed9[m]> You would have to known the rules to not get reported so you might as well spend the $25 for a license
07:16:45 <renlord> or do they drive a van around
07:16:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Imagine broadcasting over the waves
07:17:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's probably good for disaster preparation
07:17:23 <radixed9[m]> <renlord "and i assume they have sophistic"> We have actually practiced that. Not for that reason of course ;)
07:17:42 <renlord> practice triangulation?
07:18:14 <radixed9[m]> You also can't squat the calling frequency without QSYing
07:18:17 <TheJollyRoger> I would like to get my radio license someday, so when my friends and I go on long nature hikes, we can remain in touch over the radio and broadcast at much higher power than we normally would.
07:18:26 <radixed9[m]> <renlord "practice triangulation?"> there are even competitions
07:18:36 <radixed9[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I would like to get my radio lic"> Get an ICOM and pump 7w
07:18:46 <renlord> interesting..
07:19:23 <radixed9[m]> I have a yaesu and I can only hit 5w on it. Silly safety recommendations
07:19:31 <TheJollyRoger> radixed9[m]: hohoho seven watts with a good antenna would be awesome! Those little hand-held walkie talkies we buy at the store never gave us great results, they always start crapping out way too soon.
07:19:41 <radixed9[m]> I also have the waterproofing mine is not very good
07:19:46 <renlord> whats the range
07:20:00 <TheJollyRoger> Currently I've got some Baofeng radios, but they cap out at five. I haven't ever turned them up that high though.
07:20:11 <radixed9[m]> <renlord "whats the range"> around 1 mile with a hill in the way
07:20:28 <radixed9[m]> You can go much lower line of sight
07:20:30 <radixed9[m]>  * You can go much longer line of sight
07:20:42 <TheJollyRoger> renlord, well... we've been kind of unfortunate but I live in a very hilly area with dense forests, and we're lucky to get more than a kilometre. Two on a very good day, if we're out in the plains.
07:21:31 <radixed9[m]> Yeah you would have to turn up the squelch to get over a mile reliably if it is very bad TheJollyRoger:
07:21:32 <TheJollyRoger> live, and play in
07:21:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(
07:22:00 <TheJollyRoger> Those little baofengs aren't bad, but I have wanted to get something with more power.
07:22:17 <TheJollyRoger> They're certainly a huge step up from those little walkie-talkies you buy at the store.
07:22:22 <radixed9[m]> A mile with stock squelch with a mountain in between and through trees works for me at 5w
07:22:53 <TheJollyRoger> Those usually I find last just about one city block and then that's it.
07:22:56 <radixed9[m]> wait... no that was my old radio that was 1.25w? It has been a while since I did a range test
07:23:19 <radixed9[m]> I could try it again, but they are quite impressive
07:23:48 <radixed9[m]> I think you could get 2 miles through a mountain and thick forest(indoors) at least
07:23:54 <radixed9[m]> you might have to play with settings though
07:24:00 <TheJollyRoger> Something like that would be boss.
07:24:32 <TheJollyRoger> A few of us were thinking we could get a long whip antenna for the guys heading out, and then put one of the antennas up in a tree back at camp.
07:24:50 <radixed9[m]> If you go ICOMs and push 7w and take advantage of their stock great antennas you could do much better
07:24:56 <TheJollyRoger> Beautiful.
07:25:02 <TheJollyRoger> Aw man thanks!
07:25:13 <radixed9[m]> It is worth it the testing is so cheap
07:25:28 <radixed9[m]> Tech is not hard. General was a little hard(years after tech)
07:25:39 <radixed9[m]> I would never try Expert(not worth it)
07:26:21 <TheJollyRoger> Yikes.
07:26:54 <radixed9[m]> I took my General with my Tech without practice and almost got it
07:27:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, a range of a few miles would be ideal, something I'd be willing to spend money and time on, when I have more of both...
07:27:07 <radixed9[m]> General is possibly worth studying for right out of the gate
07:27:18 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
07:28:01 <radixed9[m]> Expert is just for the street cred and to help with testing tbh
07:28:02 <radixed9[m]> I have never thought once I wanted Expert
07:29:15 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just looking into amateur right now... haven't thought about going any further.
07:29:42 <TheJollyRoger> Er, just tech I mean.
07:30:18 <radixed9[m]> You still can go low freq and get access to some high frequency ranges with tech
07:30:25 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
07:31:06 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta scoot, but I hope I can pick your brain for this some more, sometime soon!
07:31:29 <radixed9[m]> Anytime man
07:31:34 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks!!
07:31:50 <dazinism> <anne232 "I plan on doing that dazinism"> Welcome onboard then. I'm sure you'll learn to love all our crew-  including the extreme paranoid, extremely correct, pedants and jokers...
07:32:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Time to broadcast music illegally then
07:32:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anime music /lenny
07:32:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Anime music /lenny"> :lenny
07:32:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay doesn't work
07:32:45 <radixed9[m]> Fun fact music is banned on HAM radio
07:33:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> What's a ham
07:34:19 <radixed9[m]> Hamfisted referring to CQ
07:34:32 <radixed9[m]>  * Hamfisted referring to CW
07:36:14 <cn3m[m]> RiotX crapped out on me
07:37:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> You ever get that feeling when you remove your earphones
07:37:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> And everything is suddenly loud as hell around you
07:37:29 <dazinism> The loRa stuff is interesting. Got a friend thats been messing with DisasterRadio - https://f-droid.org/app/tk.giesecke.disaster_radio

10:03:05 <barrikade[m]> I somehow can't see the screenshots. I am using riot.
10:03:23 <barrikade[m]> It also seems they are using BlackBerrys uem to remotely wipe the phone
10:04:47 <barrikade[m]> They also talk about the whole story and even how copperheados stole the funds and seized the infrastructure
10:06:10 <greenmoon[m]> I see the usual 'military grade encryption' buzzword lol
10:06:47 <greenmoon[m]> * I see the usual 'military grade protection' buzzword lol
10:07:23 <barrikade[m]> Now the screenshots work had to open and close the app.
10:07:37 <greenmoon[m]> * I see the usual 'military grade protection ans encryption' buzzword lol
10:08:02 <barrikade[m]> They also seem to offer 3 chatapps specter (never heard of it) silent and signal.
10:10:34 <greenmoon[m]> He managed to sell one at least 😀
10:11:27 <greenmoon[m]> Easy money
10:13:43 <cn3m[m]> Wow..
10:14:00 <greenmoon[m]> I hope he donate some money to the project at least
10:20:54 <barrikade[m]> This guy also selling grapheneos phones has an Option to donate money at the checkout: https://www.openyx.io/
10:28:24 <greenmoon[m]> At least this one is a bit cheaper, the phone more recent and probably supported for a longer time. But i would not trust a preconfigured phone
10:30:50 <greenmoon[m]> They can always factory reset but if someone buy from them i doubt that they knows how to or care about it.
10:41:05 <barrikade[m]> A friends start-up asked me to install grapheneos on 4-5 phones. What would you consider an appropriate donation for the devs? I thought taking 20 bucks for the installation + donation to grapheneos. Also I recommended signal as secure messenger against business espionage as it seems the best choice for this adversary?
10:56:40 <dazinism> $20 per device sounds like a good deal, especially if you consider the >$1000 for those on eBay
10:57:59 <aragorndr[m]> I found a guy who install gos for ~120€, but for a friend 20$ sounds good
11:03:13 <barrikade[m]> But how much should I ask for the devs? 20 as well? So in total 40 per device? (As I wrote it is a startup all people there work for free at the moment) gos installation is a lot easier than installing lineage os which I used to do for 25-40.
11:03:53 <travankor> people pay money to install roms?
11:05:52 <barrikade[m]> Yes. Mostly non tech savy people who are privacy conscious or who want to use their phones longer than the official EOL (lineage os)
11:06:09 <cn3m[m]> Yeah do it on GitHub and it will be matched
11:08:13 <barrikade[m]> In my experience there are many people feel very uncomfortable with their phones but they don't know or also don't have a passion to install custom ROMs. Some people are also afraid of bricking their phones. I am happy to teach people how to flash a ROM but most just want to have it done and are happy to pay a few bucks for it.
11:09:49 <barrikade[m]> @cn3m:privacytools.io: thanks for the reminder. I will donate on github then.
11:41:07 <cn3m[m]> <barrikade[m] "@cn3m:privacytools.io: thanks fo"> Cheers
11:49:58 <dazinism> barrikade: guess if its a friend ask them to donate something reasonable / that they can afford.
11:50:21 <dazinism> if they consider they continue to get value from using GrapheneOS to continue to make contributions
11:57:43 <yekip[m]> question re bluetooth, not sure if its my phone or normal for graphene. I connected my pixel 3 to car bluetooth kit (new kit working proeperly with iphone). but it doens't auto re-connect like my iphone would. so connect, turn engine off, bluetooth powers off. then when starting engine agian it should reconnect but it doesnt. i have to go into settings and manually pair it each time. is this normal for graphene? if not i
11:57:43 <yekip[m]> another pixel when i can to see if its the phone.
11:59:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> iirc grugq looked at having a pre-secured phone with Graphene OS and marketing it with some choice secure apps where purchases would contribute to each of the developers but they decided there wasn't enough interest.
12:42:43 <dazinism> hypokeimenon: yeah, at the price they were looking for, which I'm not sure they ever publicly disclosed.
12:44:33 <dazinism> They were looking to pull in enough to fund continued development of some (proprietary?) stuff they added, also to fund being able to donate devices to worthy causes
12:56:21 <dazinism> Then theres all the logistics of flashing and delivery. Also after sales support, dealing with warranties etc but I guess all that would apply to anyone trying to sell .

14:45:48 <defconanon12[m]> I used ProtonVPN. Limited functionality. Not really a problem for me though. I really enjoy what they offer you.
14:47:57 <defconanon12[m]> I am really enjoying Graphene OS so far. First time ever using a custom ROM. I always wanted to but always got phones that were harder to unlock the bootloader.
14:48:52 <defconanon12[m]> Even more so carrier-locked.
14:53:45 <jalb66> I remember it was talked here about why pgp or gpg was insecure and full of bugs, etc... but I can't remember why, can you refresh my memory?
15:10:44 <strcat[m]> jalb66: just look back in the logs
15:11:06 <jalb66> strcat[m]: thanks
15:11:06 <furofuro_01[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I used ProtonVPN. Limited functi"> It's a nonissue though. It's one of the best free vpn options, although not too great
15:11:08 <strcat[m]> PGP is an overcomplex, poorly designed legacy crypto approach, and is PARTICULARLY bad when used for messaging
15:11:25 <strcat[m]> GPG is a particularly bad implementation of it with a lot of further usability and security issues
15:11:59 <strcat[m]> just as gnutls is a particularly poorly done and insecure TLS implementation which manages to make OpenSSL look great
15:12:12 <strcat[m]> and OpenSSL is garbage so...
15:13:15 <strcat[m]> to compare TLS with PGP, PGP is stuck in the SSL 2 era, it's best to avoid it entirely and use secure, modern cryptography designs instead
15:13:27 <jalb66> strcat[m]: thanks a lot
15:13:53 <strcat[m]> look back in the logs for details
15:14:26 <jalb66> I will
15:14:30 <strcat[m]> even if PGP wasn't overly complex, legacy crypto it is not suitable for secure messaging at all
15:14:32 <strcat[m]> it's not really suitable for anything
15:15:08 <jalb66> And what do you think about omemo?
15:15:17 <strcat[m]> use signify for signing / verification, use the Signal protocol for secure messaging with forward secrecy, use AGE for encrypting files
15:15:30 <strcat[m]> jalb66: it's an implementation of the Signal protocol for XMPP essentially
15:15:38 <jalb66> So it's good
15:15:41 <strcat[m]> jalb66: with support for multi-device
15:15:51 <strcat[m]> jalb66: it's a good concept
15:15:52 <strcat[m]> I can't speak to how well it's implemented
15:16:27 <jalb66> I know you're not a xmpp fan 🙂
15:16:31 <alzxjm[m]1> strcat: is this the AGE you are talking about? https://github.com/FiloSottile/age
15:17:11 <jalb66>  But it works very well for me and it's very fast and it also uses Omemo and encrypted groups
15:17:19 <jalb66> Few people in the group or it fails
15:17:23 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: yes
15:17:33 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: use signify for signing, age for file encryption
15:17:48 <jalb66> I must search about AGE
15:17:51 <strcat[m]> do not use either for secure messaging - use a proper protocol for secure messaging with forward secrecy, Signal protocol is the state of the art
15:18:52 <strcat[m]> here's an example situation, lets say you have an encrypted group chat with 5 people where messages self-destruct after 2 days
15:19:09 <strcat[m]> an attacker is monitoring one of these users, capturing all the traffic being sent
15:19:22 <strcat[m]> at some point they obtain their device and get them to unlock it, or brute force their lock method
15:19:55 <strcat[m]> if you used encrypted chat based on PGP, they've obtained ALL of your group chat messages
15:19:55 <jalb66> A compromised user?, because using encryption
15:20:10 <JTL> endpoint compromise or otherwise
15:20:15 <strcat[m]> if you used the Signal protocol, they've only gotten the messages from the past 2 days that weren't yet deleted on the device
15:20:20 <jalb66> Ah yes, I know that about PGP
15:20:44 <strcat[m]> PGP is not appropriate for secure messaging, the design is fundamentally inappropriate for it
15:20:49 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "if you used the Signal protocol,"> Yay perfect forward secrecy
15:20:52 <jalb66> Yeah
15:20:57 <strcat[m]> and it is not good for signing/verification or file encryption either
15:20:58 <strcat[m]> it has serious flaws for those too
15:21:11 <jalb66> I don't know why people continue using gpg in emails
15:21:18 <strcat[m]> it also has serious core flaws like using SHA1 for fingerprints and being full of really badly designed / implemented crypto
15:21:19 <blacklight447[m]> Fun fact, you could potentially do double ratcheting with pgp
15:21:19 <strcat[m]> it should just not be used
15:21:23 <blacklight447[m]> But, its a completely nightmare to us
15:21:27 <jalb66> sha1!!!!
15:21:37 <blacklight447[m]> .use
15:21:37 <strcat[m]> the keyring / web of trust approach is also really bad
15:21:37 <blacklight447[m]> Makes using pgp normally childsplay
15:21:41 <strcat[m]> it makes things really complicated and hard to do correctly
15:21:47 <strcat[m]> here's a question
15:21:55 <jalb66> Wow... sha1 yet
15:22:03 <strcat[m]> how do you use gpg to verify a file with a key? what's the command to do that?
15:22:29 <jalb66> S it's not a good idea to encrypt a file with gpg -a --cipher-algo AES256 file?
15:22:31 <JTL> Uh, import key to keyring (lol) gpg --verify <file> (assuming signature isn't detached)
15:22:37 <jalb66> So it's not a good idea to encrypt a file with gpg -a --cipher-algo AES256 file?
15:22:38 <strcat[m]> that is not what gpg --verify does
15:22:45 <strcat[m]> gpg --verify uses ANY key in the keyring
15:22:49 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "how do you use gpg to verify a f"> gpg -e file
15:22:52 <JTL> strcat[m]: right
15:22:58 <strcat[m]> how do you specify which key should be used to verify
15:22:59 <madaidan[m]> oh wait
15:23:03 <madaidan[m]> you said verify
15:23:06 <madaidan[m]> I'm blind
15:23:10 <JTL> And I need coffee
15:23:17 <jalb66> Hmm
15:23:19 <strcat[m]> GPG will use ANY key in the keyring
15:23:22 <JTL> That's true
15:23:36 <strcat[m]> and it will output which key it used using a sha1-based fingerprint
15:23:36 <strcat[m]> with output that you have to... parse?
15:23:39 <jalb66> :-o
15:23:40 <JTL> and is a horrible design imo
15:23:44 <JTL> strcat[m]: yup...
15:24:03 <strcat[m]> there is gpgme which supposedly provides an API that makes it easy to use correctly
15:24:07 <strcat[m]> but nope
15:24:08 <jalb66> I suppose this is AGE: v
15:24:08 <strcat[m]> the opposite
15:24:13 <jalb66> I suppose this is AGE: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age
15:24:20 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/hanno/status/1270344418810384385
15:24:30 <strcat[m]> jalb66: yes, that's the reference implementation
15:24:34 <strcat[m]> it's a spec others can implement
15:24:42 <jalb66> ok, thx
15:25:08 <strcat[m]> jalb66: you should use age + signify atm
15:25:12 <strcat[m]> age is encryption with integrity
15:25:15 <jalb66> ok 🙂
15:25:52 <strcat[m]> but if you want to verifiable it came from you, you also need to use signify atm - although age is probably going to support specifying a key as the sender and verifying that
15:26:21 <strcat[m]> it always has integrity (can't tamper with the message)
15:26:42 <strcat[m]> but atm it's designed in a way that doesn't confirm where it came from and the docs will tell you to use signify
15:27:00 <jalb66> If it's only to encrypt a file to upload to the Cloud, is it enough to use only age?
15:27:13 <strcat[m]> no you should use age + signify
15:27:20 <jalb66> Ok
15:27:20 <strcat[m]> until age supports that functionality itself
15:27:52 <strcat[m]> it's just early on and it's not added yet since they are doing things in a really rigorous / well reviewed way before adding it
15:29:22 <strcat[m]> jalb66: if you encrypt with a *passphrase*, you don't need to use signify, but you generally shouldn't use a passphrase rather than a key
15:30:08 <jalb66> Yes, I know, it's only to make the file "more secure" with a large passphrase
15:30:20 <jalb66> But I suppose it can be guessed that way
15:30:28 <strcat[m]> jalb66: if you use a key, it currently separates the concept of encryption with integrity + signing so you need signify
15:30:29 <strcat[m]> just because of how that works
15:30:32 <jalb66> It's to use a cloud
15:30:39 <strcat[m]> jalb66: basically, atm it encrypts something for someone's private key using their public key
15:30:50 <strcat[m]> with integrity
15:30:51 <jalb66> OK, I must install it and see 🙂
15:31:18 <strcat[m]> jalb66: providing signing to prove it came from you is beyond just encrypting it for them and you may not want to do it
15:31:25 <jalb66> Anyway I already have signify
15:31:40 <jalb66> Ok, then I'll use it with signify
15:31:44 <strcat[m]> so, atm it supports 2 options
15:31:53 <jalb66> And see the options
15:32:00 <strcat[m]> encrypt file using someone's public key so they can decrypt
15:32:05 <strcat[m]> or symmetric encryption / authentication using a passphrase
15:32:21 <strcat[m]> both have integrity, it just needs to be noted that when encrypting something using someone's public key
15:32:28 <strcat[m]> if you want to prove it came from you, you also need to use signify
15:32:29 <strcat[m]> make sense?
15:32:34 <jalb66> Yes
15:33:03 <strcat[m]> and so for example to backup files on the cloud
15:33:13 <strcat[m]> you want to encrypt them to yourself and also sign them so you verify it's what you uploaded
15:33:23 <jalb66> OK
15:33:25 <strcat[m]> so you need age + signify for that
15:33:37 <strcat[m]> unless you use a passphrase (which COULD be a strong key if you auto-generate a long enough random one)
15:33:44 <strcat[m]> and then being able to decrypt it verifies authenticity too
15:33:45 <jalb66> I'ĺl see how to use them both
15:41:39 * interceptingfist uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200618-113833_1.png (87KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/fKWoEBgIODuBOKxcWffpdUal >
15:42:19 <mxnorvak[m]> Is AGE only good for encrypting files you wanna upload to a cloud or its what should be used for encrypting files locally as well?
15:42:29 <interceptingfist> If I toggle that switch at top right, will it sign out of all user accounts or at least stop them from running in background
15:43:02 <jalb66> mxnorvak[m], what's the difference? 😉
15:43:07 <jalb66> I think both
15:43:17 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: you can use it to encrypt files locally but then you're depending on a passphrase since you're just going to have the key locally
15:43:27 <strcat[m]> unless you mean on a flash drive or w/e
15:43:33 <strcat[m]> it's perfect for encrypting stuff you're putting on a flash drive
15:44:02 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: basically, either use age to encrypt with a passphrase
15:44:13 <strcat[m]> or use age to encrypt something to someone's public key and most of the time also sign that with signify to prove it came from you
15:44:16 <defconanon12[m]> <furofuro_01[m] "It's a nonissue though. It's one"> Very true. I would say if you want the utmost privacy and security Mullvad VPN. I also like how that VPN service is willingly pushing boundaries.
15:44:17 <strcat[m]> those are the 2 main ways to use it
15:44:41 <mxnorvak[m]> I don't know much but i remember JellyRoger telling me if what I'm looking for is only encrypting my files and backing them up locally , VeraCrypt is great and AGE is the way to go for when you wanna upload the encrypted file to a cloud
15:44:45 <strcat[m]> if you're just encrypting it for yourself or as a one off thing
15:44:54 <strcat[m]> then using a strong randomly generated passphrase is perfectly appropriate
15:45:16 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: you don't use AGE for disk encryption
15:45:22 <cx2[m]> Can only encrypt individual files and not folders/directories ATM, right?
15:45:30 <strcat[m]> you can use it for encrypting an archive you want to back up though
15:45:34 <strcat[m]> cx2: yes that's what it's for
15:45:51 <strcat[m]> it's a file encryption tool with modern encryption providing integrity and streaming
15:46:22 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "mxnorvak: you don't use AGE for "> Ok i see
15:46:38 <cx2[m]> Been casually using rAGE since TJR suggested it, so far easy to use. Keeping a close eye on the project.
15:46:57 <mxnorvak[m]> Thanks
15:47:05 <strcat[m]> cx2: the spec provides random access (seekable)
15:48:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): BTW why does zygote use JIT but not system server?
15:48:34 <mxnorvak[m]> Security wise, which one is better, encrypting only the files you want or full disk encryption?
15:48:42 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: nothing uses ART JIT on GrapheneOS
15:49:00 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: neither
15:49:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes but why google made zygote compiled by jit a thing?
15:49:28 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: FDE is not a good approach to use as the only approach, at all
15:49:42 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: because as soon as you've booted and decrypted the key is in memory from that point onwards until you power off
15:50:13 <strcat[m]> it ONLY protects the data at rest - i.e. the data stored on the drive
15:50:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> So what about TCG opal?
15:50:36 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "mxnorvak: because as soon as you"> So that's why when they wanna arrest someone they want their system to be turned on and signed in ?
15:50:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay yes
15:50:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Got it
15:51:02 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: it doesn't have to be signed in for the key to be in memory
15:51:12 <strcat[m]> with FDE, once you boot and enter the decryption passphrase, the whole thing is decrypted in memory
15:51:29 <strcat[m]> when the screen is locked, it's still decrypted and accessible by the OS
15:51:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Honestly I do fscrypt + dm-crypt "mxnorvak" (https://matrix.to/#/@mxnorvak:matrix.org)
15:51:33 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: and it's not per-user or anything
15:51:37 <strcat[m]> it has nothing to do with being signed in
15:53:06 <mxnorvak[m]> So i guess FDE is only good for an external hard drive you want to encrypt right?
15:53:16 <mxnorvak[m]> Oh no
15:53:50 <mxnorvak[m]> Does the key for that hard drive also stay in memory even if you've unplugged it?
15:54:27 <cx2[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "Does the key for that hard drive"> Computer either needs to be powered off, or does from low battery.
15:55:57 <mxnorvak[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Honestly I do fscrypt + dm-crypt"> Thanks for letting me know what you use , unfortunately i don't know what any of that meant
15:56:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> "mxnorvak" (https://matrix.to/#/@mxnorvak:matrix.org): combine FBE on top of FDE
15:57:10 <mxnorvak[m]> Aah
15:58:37 <mxnorvak[m]> Like encrypting my files with AGE and then using VeraCrypt for FDE
15:58:38 <alzxjm[m]1> Chrome OS uses fscrypt, right?
15:59:25 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: ChromeOS and AOSP both use per-user filesystem-based encryption
15:59:51 <strcat[m]> ChromeOS originally used an earlier userspace implementation of it before ext4/f2fs supported it
16:00:28 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: verified boot for the OS, per-user filesystem-based encryption for user data, device-based encryption for system data
16:00:41 <strcat[m]>  * alzxjm: verified boot for the OS, per-user filesystem-based encryption for user data, device-based filesystem encryption for system data
16:00:56 <strcat[m]> they're very similar in approach
16:01:31 <strcat[m]> different implementations other than sharing a lot of infrastructure
16:03:48 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "mxnorvak: neither"> What is the problem with FBE in this case?
16:04:39 <strcat[m]> you said FDE or manually encrypting files
16:04:40 <strcat[m]> you never mentioned FBE
16:04:42 <strcat[m]> and you proposed those 2 things as alternatives which doesn't make sense
16:04:52 <strcat[m]> FBE is filesystem-based encryption not manually encrypting files
16:05:08 <mxnorvak[m]> My bad
16:05:10 <mxnorvak[m]> I meant FBE
16:05:51 <mxnorvak[m]> Sry, i better learn more about these terms before asking
16:05:54 <strcat[m]> FBE is granular, fscrypt is basically per-directory encryption
16:06:35 <strcat[m]> and each file has a separate encryption key generated from the directory key
16:06:59 <strcat[m]> AOSP uses it for per-profile (per-user) encryption keys
16:07:01 <strcat[m]> it can be made more granular than that
16:09:58 <alzxjm[m]1> Mind if I ask a slightly-related question? Arch Linux supports AppArmor with linux-hardened. Is it reasonably secure to run apps in a Firejail with AppArmor enabled?
16:11:05 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "FBE is granular, fscrypt is basi"> Thanks again :)
16:11:36 <madaidan[m]> Firejail is a privilege escalation hole
16:11:38 <madaidan[m]> It's the opposite of reasonably secure

17:28:09 <interceptingfist> Anyone know if shelter app works on graphene?
17:49:25 <dazinism> interceptingfist: yeah it works fine. Security wise its not as safe as using a separate user profile, but the fact it shared the UI/clipboard etc. can be nice for some things.
17:50:45 <dazinism> Cloning apps to the work profile often doesnt work. Its random, swiping the app closed and reopening can make cloning work again
17:52:08 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Cloning apps to the work profile"> That's not GrapheneOS specific
17:52:12 <dazinism> *swiping the shelter app closed
17:52:31 <interceptingfist> <dazinism "interceptingfist: yeah it works "> My concern is overloading my device since the profiles continue running in the background.
17:53:22 <interceptingfist> <dazinism "*swiping the shelter app closed"> Do you run multiple user accounts to keep apps compartmentalized
17:53:39 <TheJollyRoger> Aw darn, I missed the GPG talk :P.
17:53:43 <dazinism> interceptingfist: the OS shuts them down as needs the resources, same as it does for apps in the main profole
17:53:55 <dazinism> *as it
17:55:19 <dazinism> interceptingfist: yes I do a bit. Tend to mainly use main and work profile, but some stuff in other user profiles
17:55:22 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Aw darn, I missed the GPG talk :"> Greasy Privacy Guesses
17:56:53 <interceptingfist> dazinism: do u use graphene? If so how's the battery life going back and forth between profiles?
17:57:12 <TheJollyRoger> cn3m[m]: ahahahaha XD
17:58:03 <anne232> do y'all ever sleep?
17:58:07 <anne232> lmao
17:58:38 <dazinism> interceptingfist: yeah I'm on GrapheneOS. Havent noticed battery drain being a problem. Thing that tends to eat battery is apps that arent well optimised for AOSP.
17:58:57 <TheJollyRoger> interceptingfist: I use different profiles on Graphene, but I do it largely for convenience, meaning that I am generally leaving the profiles running around the clock. The effects of letting the phone idle with multiple profiles and apps running in those profiles is largely negligible, provided you're not running some peer to peer battery hog like AnTox or something along those lines.
17:59:29 <dazinism> RiotX, Riot.im and Signal can use a fair bit
17:59:42 <TheJollyRoger> (This should not be construed as an endorsement of AnTox. I did it because AnTox is the most battery-hungry app I know of)
18:00:08 <dazinism> Although I tend to set them up so they dont as I dont use any as a primary messenger.
18:00:40 <anne232> what do you suggest as a 'primary messenger', dazinism ?
18:01:41 <interceptingfist> dazinism: why do you use work profile?
18:01:52 <dazinism> Depends on your situation I guess, also what your contacts use. I've liked the battery performance of converstaions.im and I've got friends to join a server I trust.
18:02:16 <anne232> Conversations is XMPP, right?
18:02:59 <dazinism> Also use signal a bit. But I check it somewhat irregularly. When I remember.
18:03:05 <anne232> dont they have OTR or omemo? does the server matter too much in this case?
18:03:09 <anne232> doesnt signal persistently run?
18:03:10 <interceptingfist> TheJollyRoger: thanks for the info about the apps
18:03:57 <dazinism> anne232: yeah with xmpp the server matters.
18:04:09 <TheJollyRoger> interceptingfist: anytime, as always your mileage is going to vary. You should be able to monitor your battery usage.
18:04:11 <anne232> even if you're using otr or omemo?
18:04:38 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "do y'all ever sleep?"> Not much
18:04:39 <dazinism> I use omemo rather than OTR, think most people do now?
18:04:44 <interceptingfist> TheJollyRoger: I'm planning on putting shopping apps in one profile, for example, that way they're compartmentalized and not linked. So I can basically have two eBay accounts on my device.
18:04:50 <anne232> I still know hella ppl who dont know about omemo lol
18:04:55 <jalb66> Always omemo
18:05:28 <anne232> alot of clients havent adopted omemo afaik? alot of people use pidgin
18:05:36 <TheJollyRoger> anne232: very much so. Consider this: your XMPP contact list by design is stored on your server uencrypted and your admin can essentially impersonate you to your contacts at will.
18:05:49 <anne232> That's a good point.
18:06:21 <anne232> the admin could see your contacts but im not to worried about being impersonated just b/c my contacts would know it wasnt me bc otr and omemo tell the other user if thyere contacting you from an unrecognized computer
18:06:25 <TheJollyRoger> In this entire world, where I've gotten people to use XMPP, I've only met one person who didn't simply set their client to simply blindly trust all new devices because verifying them all across every single device was too much work.
18:07:23 <dazinism> <interceptingfist "dazinism: why do you use work pr"> To have apps running and readily available at the same time, but compartmentalised. Especially apps that only work with storage permission.
18:07:25 <anne232> well tbh its outside alot of peoples threat model
18:07:55 <TheJollyRoger> Then with that in mind, you trust your service providers.
18:08:00 <TheJollyRoger> Therefore, service provider matters.
18:08:01 <anne232> not alot of people can expect to have their xmpp contacts being impersonated
18:08:08 <anne232> oh yeah i agree w/ u now im just saying
18:08:49 <interceptingfist> dazinism: OK thank you!
18:09:08 <TheJollyRoger> interceptingfist: hey right on.
18:10:54 <dazinism> <anne232 "doesnt signal persistently run?"> I have it in the work profile and use the freeze function in shelter to close it down. I guess 'force stop' in the main profile, or a different user profile may also stop it, but not tried. (doesn't stop it when its in a work profile)
18:11:44 <TheJollyRoger> Force Stop will work in a different profile. When an app is in "STOPPED" state it can't restart until you manually tap on it or reopen the window (if you forgot to close it)
18:24:47 <dazinism> anne232: to get a good experience with modern clients (especially on mobile using conversations.im) its good to check the server with https://compliance.conversations.im/about/
18:29:50 <dazinism> interceptingfist: I'll probably change things around a load when scoped storage arrives, with Android R, in a few months.
18:31:59 <dazinism> I've been uncomfortable about apps that have needed storage to work. Things have (painfully) slowly been improving, but scoped storage will make things a whole lot better
18:35:32 <dazinism> A load of things will get a load easier. Currently heres a load of the tricks I use to try to stop data leaks through shared storage.
18:35:37 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/storage
18:36:31 <dazinism> lol, that was a load of loads. ..
18:37:01 <interceptingfist> dazinism: I'll check those loads
18:37:34 <interceptingfist> Also where can I read about scooed storage and android r
18:41:38 <overheadscallop[> https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/storage
18:41:58 <interceptingfist> Ic now android r is android 11
18:43:05 <interceptingfist> Does apple already basically donscoped storage
18:43:18 <interceptingfist> Do scoped
18:48:39 <cn3m[m]> Yes apple has fully scoped apps
18:49:06 <cn3m[m]> It's much stronger in that regard
18:49:55 <charuto> does anyone know where i can find some pixel 3s for sale? seems like aliexpress is my best option but i'm not too sold on it
18:55:58 <interceptingfist> You can get them around 200 on ebay
18:56:14 <interceptingfist> Pixel 3 probable cheaper than 3a
18:57:15 <strcat[m]> paintedman: your wifi change to android-prepare-vendor doesn't work, breaks the build
18:57:23 <strcat[m]> you must not be doing a clean generation of vendor files or not doing a clean build
18:57:50 <interceptingfist> cn3m: what will be the main differences between iOS and android 11 for privacy
18:58:34 <interceptingfist> Will they be similar in privacy after android r/11 is released
18:58:46 <cn3m[m]> <interceptingfist "cn3m: what will be the main diff"> Stock Android or GrapheneOS?
19:00:40 <cn3m[m]> <interceptingfist "Will they be similar in privacy "> GrapheneOS 11/R I will think is pretty comparable to iOS 13. GrapheneOS will be better out of the box for sure
19:00:50 <interceptingfist> Stock android
19:01:53 <cn3m[m]> Gapps are 10-50x more data hungry than iOS and you lack a lot of key controls. iOS will have much stronger scoping. iOS will be vastly more private than Stock Android
19:02:07 <interceptingfist> What will make grapheme that much better though? The freedom?
19:02:40 <interceptingfist> Oh yea true, I'm slowly forgetting about the g apps lmao
19:02:45 <cn3m[m]> <interceptingfist "What will make grapheme that muc"> GrapheneOS has notable hardware and software privacy features with more in the pipeline
19:02:58 <interceptingfist> Thanks graphene and f droid for that
19:03:39 <TheJollyRoger> I can't wait until we've got a first-party app store... can't wait to get off F-Droid.
19:03:43 <interceptingfist> All it really needs is the scoped storage
19:03:44 <cn3m[m]> The user profiles are insanely strong which helps, but they aren't that usable
19:03:49 <cn3m[m]> <interceptingfist "Thanks graphene and f droid for "> F-Droid is the one thing really holding GrapheneOS back security wise imo
19:03:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
19:04:07 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS needs a strong store
19:04:10 <alzxjm[m]1> Is there a good collection of recommendations for maximizing privacy on stock Android for those who need to use the stock ROM?
19:04:24 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid and Aurora are both concerning(Aurora notably less so)
19:04:42 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "Is there a good collection of re"> Disable gapps
19:04:42 <interceptingfist> alzxjm: download f droid instead of using google
19:04:52 <cn3m[m]> <interceptingfist "All it really needs is the scope"> I would like to see more and there are GitHub issues for it
19:05:08 <interceptingfist> Don't log into any of the bloatware don't make a google id
19:05:52 <interceptingfist> cn3m: it just appears easier to get a cheap $150 iPhone 7 and be done
19:05:54 <cn3m[m]> iOS is substantially better designed for app restrictions. There's a large improvement over AOSP
19:06:14 <cn3m[m]> AOSP has notable leads in other areas though mostly security
19:06:31 <cn3m[m]> Then again the store situation is concerning on Android
19:06:58 <JTL> It should be possible down the line to make "app restricted" builds of GrapheneOS in the future, and I think the idea is disallowing apps and other code that aren't part of the system image
19:07:08 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS vs iOS is really down to how the user uses it
19:07:17 <alzxjm[m]1> This seems like a good solution to the store conundrum: https://blog.project-insanity.org/2019/06/17/bye-bye-play-store-mirroring-play-store-apks-to-private-f-droid-repo/
19:07:22 <JTL> Not for sake of "HURR DURR DRM" but for security :)
19:07:29 <JTL> lol
19:07:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ehehehe, yeah.
19:07:31 <cn3m[m]> They are both incredibly strong project
19:07:50 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "This seems like a good solution "> F-Droid just needs to go entirely
19:07:51 <interceptingfist> Can graphene possibly make user accounts able to be signed out of? I really think privacy wise that would crush competition
19:07:53 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid is not a solution
19:08:33 <JTL> Long ago I thought forking F-Droid was a possiblity, but from what I know there's just too many ifs and buts there that starting anew would be a better idea
19:08:58 <cn3m[m]> <interceptingfist "Can graphene possibly make user "> You can do that already
19:09:03 <jknsec[m]> GrapheneOS app store when
19:09:07 <TheJollyRoger> interceptingfist: the best way to get a feature in GrapheneOS is to send in a Pull Request. In the future GrapheneOS has wanted to expose more profile functionality to the user, but the fastest way to start on that path is to give us a step.
19:09:19 <alzxjm[m]1> Not even F-Droid installing only apps mirrored from the Play Store? These seems to be a good middle-ground.
19:10:07 <TheJollyRoger> The problem is F-Droid itself. It's a much older app that's full of legacy code.
19:10:27 <madaidan[m]> <jknsec[m] "GrapheneOS app store when"> When people start contributing
19:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. We need an app developer.
19:11:27 <interceptingfist> TheJollyRoger: do you send pull request on website?
19:11:43 <EssentialChaos[m> Does the store have to be integrated or can it be a completely separate app?
19:11:53 <cn3m[m]> iOS insanely strong background rules, their full app scoping, and much more respectful developer community (with regards to least privilege) is where it pulls ahead. This can all be added to GrapheneOS at some point which would make in hands down the strongest
19:11:55 <radixed9[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Does the store have to be integr"> It would be a seperate system app
19:11:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> "TheJollyRoger" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org): I know of one
19:12:31 <EssentialChaos[m> <radixed9[m] "It would be a seperate system ap"> So it doesn't have to be developed for Graphene specifically?
19:12:37 <cn3m[m]> I'm an app developer, but I'm also the only one really active on Reddit. I can't do both
19:13:22 <radixed9[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "So it doesn't have to be develop"> Right now the Updater app needs a lot of work. I am working on letting Vanadium, PDF Viewer, and Auditor update OTA. That would be the framework needed to expand to potentially shipping third party apps
19:13:29 <TheJollyRoger> interceptingfist: once you've written the code, you send pull requests containing your contribution to the project's github at https://github.com/GrapheneOS
19:14:02 <EssentialChaos[m> <radixed9[m] "Right now the Updater app needs "> I am asking, because maybe someone who doesn't have Graphene could work on this
19:14:05 <TheJollyRoger> The developers will review your code and if it looks good, they'll merge it with the GrapheneOS source tree.
19:14:22 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: oh wow. Could you give him a shout for us...? We'd desperately need the help.
19:14:30 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: might be easier to find somebody else for reddit than an app dev perhaps
19:14:50 <alzxjm[m]1> cn3m: > I'm an app developer, but I'm also the only one really active on Reddit. I can't do both
19:14:50 <alzxjm[m]1> Yeah definitely don't stop doing the reddit proselytizing. I started paying attention to your comments when you started showing up in every single thread. Probably the reason I'm here at all.
19:14:52 <JTL> cdesai: agreed
19:14:53 <EssentialChaos[m> Just in general an alternative to Play store
19:15:10 <radixed9[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "I am asking, because maybe someo"> It will be based off the current framework in GrapheneOS and that needs improvements first. This has to start with GrapheneOS or CalyxOS

19:21:08 <EssentialChaos[m> Does Google have something like "Safe Browsing", but for Android apps?
19:21:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well I have past experience in Java, kotlin and even flutter/dart
19:21:16 <jknsec[m]> I assume the range of apps would initially quite limited? Of course we need to provide the ability to sideload apps in general, but that's very much a given, at least until the catalogue is big enough. It would be great of we could have stuff like the signed Google Play-free Signal apk and other (presumably) highly used apps. I'm sure many of those devs would be cooperative.
19:21:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> But idk
19:21:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Something is definitely lacking
19:21:49 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Does Google have something like "> Yes, Play Protect and it's not as horrible as people say

19:24:55 <radixed9[m]> If GrapheneOS had a store it would highly curated Play Protect would not be relevant
19:25:48 <faxing[m]> What apps do you all use for weather (if any)
19:26:27 <TheJollyRoger> alzxjm[m]1: Although back in the day, the project did bundle F-Droid with the privileged extension, this approach is no longer viable today, since Technology Marches On
19:27:59 <radixed9[m]> <TheJollyRoger "alzxjm: Although back in the day"> CalyxOS does this. It is not used in GrapheneOS as it doesn't meet the security standards

19:46:35 <defconanon12[m]> What do you need help with exactly on Reddit?
19:47:07 <overheadscallop[> fighting misinformation
19:47:24 <jfbourdeau> NOOBIE : If need whatsapp, telegram, facebook etc. Is it a good idea to use the shelter App  and put them in the work profile ok, a good practice / approach ?   Sorry for that noobie question, I habe been IOS all my life, I am new to Android.
19:47:37 <defconanon12[m]> Oh I mean I can put in the time for that. Count me in.
19:47:54 <alzxjm[m]1> > What do you need help with exactly on Reddit?
19:47:54 <alzxjm[m]1> People like me need to be deprogrammed. Years and years of the FLOSS-at-all-costs dogma.
19:48:35 <overheadscallop[> jfbourdeau: a separate user profile is stronger than a work profile, but less usable
19:48:39 <alzxjm[m]1> It's tough to swallow at first when someone shows up and starts talking about how Windows 10 LTSC is more secure than Debian.
19:48:43 <jknsec[m]> I mean I could try to see if I can spare some time. I can at least try. Count me in as well if it's not too late.
19:48:56 <defconanon12[m]> It is all about catching someone's rational belief that is misinformation and destroying it.
19:49:17 <overheadscallop[> jfbourdeau: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
19:50:15 <jfbourdeau> ok tks overheadscallop[   I will do some reading... but if I use Whatsapp and after need to use k9 (with contacts), I somekind need to logout, back in / switch users ???  I will go read your links. Tks for pointing me in the right direction
19:51:17 <defconanon12[m]> When I first studied into hacking and OPSEC. I was surprised to find out about IOS and Mac OS. That took me a while to digest. It really shook my world.
19:52:07 <overheadscallop[> jfbourdeau: If whatsapp and k9 are in separate user profiles there's no easy way to share between those apps. If whatsapp is in the work profile and k9 in the main profile, sharing is possible using the built-in app sharing function
19:52:56 <defconanon12[m]> I always thought people were less secure on different OSes if you didn't use Linux. Now I think a lot different.
19:53:31 <jfbourdeau> overheadscallop[, yes yes I get it tks.  But I though " SHELTER" was doing the same as what you propose, but in a more FLEXIBLE way...  but I will try / experience what you propose to see how it goes... As you say it would be more secure... Else, SHELTER was cool ( I am new to it)
19:53:36 <EssentialChaos[m> <defconanon12[m] "I always thought people were les"> Same here
19:54:46 <overheadscallop[> jfbourdeau: Shelter is just an app that manages the work profile for you.

19:54:47 <alzxjm[m]1> Like I said, deprogramming. This is the dogma (Linux = maximum security) in most of the privacy-focused areas of reddit.
19:56:57 <yekip[m]> <overheadscallop[ "jfbourdeau: Shelter is just an a"> Not sure if it's still working ok, or supported. I installed it the other day and can't seem to install any APKs into it. could be user error though as its first try for me

19:58:06 <defconanon12[m]> alzxjm: Definitely. Very dogma. Reddit not just in Linux communities but quite a bit in Tor communities and the such. "What is the best OPsec?" Oh just download Qubes OS with Whonix you will be fine! An average user would do this but an advanced user will layout the vulnerabilities and how you can cover your bases. Even if you cover all of them nothing is truly 100% foolproof.
19:59:12 <jknsec[m]> Is Tor even safe to use nowadays?
19:59:34 <EssentialChaos[m> <defconanon12[m] "alzxjm: Definitely. Very dogma. "> I mean, Qubes with Whonix seems like a good combo, though
19:59:43 <radixed9[m]> <jknsec[m] "Is Tor even safe to use nowadays"> Tor Browser is the only reasonably sound attempt at web privacy
19:59:58 <jknsec[m]> I hear various things. Not much I've seen backed up, though.
19:59:58 <yekip[m]> <jknsec[m] "Is Tor even safe to use nowadays"> safe to use, but no magic pill. needs using with knowledge and even then it's no guarantee of much
19:59:59 <radixed9[m]> Honorable mention to Safari on iOS
20:00:27 <yekip[m]> <radixed9[m] "Honorable mention to Safari on i"> you think thats bvetter than firefox?
20:00:29 <yekip[m]> oh sorry, iOS. i mena desktop
20:00:40 <yekip[m]>  * oh sorry, iOS. i mean desktop
20:00:44 <EssentialChaos[m> Btw, here's a qeustion, do you need an adblocker to look like other people?
20:00:45 <alzxjm[m]1> Bromite on GrapheneOS?
20:00:45 <defconanon12[m]> EssentialChaos: I am not saying it isn't but do you think the average user is going to know how to protect themselves from hyperjacking?
20:01:05 <concat[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "Bromite on GrapheneOS?"> Why use Bromite instead of Vanadium?
20:01:22 <radixed9[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "Bromite on GrapheneOS?"> Vanadium blends in better. It is designed to look like every other Chrome and Pixel user
20:01:23 <jknsec[m]> Gotta harden that Qubes install
20:02:15 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "Btw, here's a qeustion, do you n"> Since other people have adblockers because ads are annoying?
20:02:16 <alzxjm[m]1> From https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing:
20:02:16 <alzxjm[m]1> "Bromite provides integrated ad-blocking and more advanced anti-fingerprinting."
20:02:34 <EssentialChaos[m>  * Btw, here's a question, do you need an adblocker to look like other people?
20:03:02 <jcpicard32[m]> alzxjm: Bromite is a good project, and the only browser besides Vanadium that the project recommends. However Vanadium is still the most recommended for reasons above, plus the security hardening work done by GrapheneOS
20:03:02 <faxing[m]> <jknsec[m] "Is Tor even safe to use nowadays"> A tool is only as strong as the user, if you're stuck in bad practices then it will be much easier to identity you with greater precision, if you are in a habit of good privacy practices then I think Tor is an extremely powerful tool if you're looking for increased anonymity.
20:03:21 <jcpicard32[m]> From https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing:
20:03:23 <yekip[m]> <radixed9[m] "Vanadium blends in better. It is"> thanks I didn't know that.
20:03:26 <jknsec[m]> Qubes works poorly for me because I literally have to manually edit boot .cfg files to get it to work and as such Xen doesn't update properly unless I do that with every update.
20:03:37 <jcpicard32[m]> "Using Vanadium is highly recommended. Bromite is a solid alternative and is the only other browser we recommend. Bromite provides integrated ad-blocking and more advanced anti-fingerprinting. For now, Vanadium is more focused on security hardening and Bromite is more focused on anti-fingerprinting. The projects are collaborating together and will likely converge to providing more of the same features. Vanadium will
20:03:37 <jcpicard32[m]> be providing content filtering and anti-fingerprinting, but it needs to be done in a way that meets the standards of the project, which takes time."
20:05:00 <faxing[m]> How does Fennec stack up? The ability to use desktop plugins seems extremely advantageous and pretty powerful.
20:05:29 <jknsec[m]> Isn't that just deMozilla'd Firefox?
20:05:41 <faxing[m]> I've been using only Vanadium and Tor Browser for now but I'm looking for stronger compartmentalization for my mobile device
20:05:41 <jcpicard32[m]> faxing: Avoid Firefox on Android. According to the usage guide Firefox and its derivatives (like Fennec) bypass the hardening work
20:05:41 <alzxjm[m]1> I appreciate the ad-blocking in Bromite. It seems like an acceptable choice.
20:05:45 <jcpicard32[m]> And have no sandbox other than the application sandbox
20:05:53 <jcpicard32[m]> Extensions don't do what you think
20:05:54 <jknsec[m]> And as such behind on security updates?
20:06:11 <radixed9[m]> <jknsec[m] "Isn't that just deMozilla'd Fire"> It has no security features and delays updates
20:06:20 <jknsec[m]> oh god
20:06:32 <alzxjm[m]1> At home I use a pi-hole so Vanadium is fine there.
20:06:33 <radixed9[m]> Fennec F-Droid is quite bad
20:06:33 <jknsec[m]> That's worse
20:06:59 <jknsec[m]> As if Firefox on Android wasn't bad enough
20:07:32 <radixed9[m]> Firefox on Linux as well
20:07:34 <jcpicard32[m]> alzxjm: You can also set up DNS based ad-filtering that works to adblock in Vanadium. See https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking
20:08:21 <jknsec[m]> Isn't it also a bad idea to use For browser on Android. Shouldn't you always be using something dedicated like Whonix or Tails for Tor if you want any semblance of OPSEC?
20:09:16 <jknsec[m]> But, you know, TB is still Gecko and as such bypasses the hardening. Not to mention the unique screen size alone...
20:09:18 <jfbourdeau> I am using Vivaldi on my Linux PC.  I was planning to use the Android version on GrapheneOs,  Simply because of the BookMarks sync that works well.  Is this a bad idea ?
20:09:29 <faxing[m]> Is there any way to make Vanadium use only incognito mode?
20:09:47 <faxing[m]> Or do I have to manually make a new incognito tab every time I want to make a new tab
20:11:03 <jknsec[m]> faxing No, not yet anyway. The best you could do is to created a home screen shortcut or something that opens an incognito tab but there's no setting that does that.
20:11:04 <faxing[m]> <jfbourdeau "I am using Vivaldi on my Linux P"> Vivaldi mocks users concerns about privacy, I wouldn't put much trust in them if I were you. Its also made by the old developers of Opera, who is now involved in predatory loan schemes.
20:11:15 <jknsec[m]> Possibly in the future, though.
20:11:31 <jknsec[m]> Ew Vivaldi
20:11:32 <faxing[m]> <jknsec[m] "faxing No, not yet anyway. The b"> Okay, that sucks. Thanks for the information
20:11:36 <jfbourdeau> !!!!   wow
20:11:40 <radixed9[m]> Vivaldi developers left because of Opera's shady business practices and they have taken privacy more seriously lately. Sadly they stopped uploading source code
20:12:00 <faxing[m]> Oh yeah I forgot that a bunch of it isn't open source
20:12:25 <jknsec[m]> FLOSS or bust
20:12:53 <jfbourdeau> tks..... Some of you are using Linux ? What do you use : brave ? CHromium ?  FF ?  as for my Mobile, I will sick with the built-in graphene browser
20:12:55 <faxing[m]> Also even if that is why they left it doesn't change their mocking of user's concerns about the direction the project was taking in relation to the privacy of users
20:12:56 <jknsec[m]> If the chip was not made with libre sand I want no part in it
20:12:56 <EssentialChaos[m> Has Vivaldi stopped releasing their Chromium modifications?
20:13:16 <faxing[m]> tks?
20:13:24 <radixed9[m]> I am running Edge Chromium(WDAG) on Windows 10 Enterprise
20:13:35 <radixed9[m]> Vanadium on GrapheneOS
20:13:38 <interceptingfist> Is vanadium downloadable without graphene
20:13:50 <alzxjm[m]1> https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium on Arch Linux and macOS
20:14:03 <jfbourdeau> cool tks
20:14:09 <radixed9[m]> <interceptingfist "Is vanadium downloadable without"> No you wouldn't want it to be either. It is highly integreated with OS security features. Use Bromite
20:14:18 <faxing[m]> Also I use Tor for almost everything, Firefox for the things that Tor is too slow for, and Brave for logins and purchases on my Debian system
20:14:19 <jknsec[m]> I technically use Qubes but otherwise I use Fedora 32 with Ungoogled Chromium for dev
20:14:41 <jknsec[m]> Tor through Tails/Whonix
20:14:41 <jfbourdeau> ok good
20:15:18 <jfbourdeau> faxing[m], I am debian too ( BUster debian 10 via Bunsenlabs)
20:15:32 <jknsec[m]> I have a Windows system for games but it's pro and not enterprise so it's shit
20:15:37 <faxing[m]> Ey, nice
20:16:11 <faxing[m]> I've got my main drive with Debian 10 and another drive with Windows 10 Home that I use for gaming
20:16:35 <faxing[m]> I've only got that because I've got a steering wheel and oculus rift s and neither of which have any Linux support really
20:16:53 <faxing[m]> Or I'd replace windows 10 with something like pop or manjaro
20:28:34 <yekip[m]> can anyone tell me if its considered safe to download and use the APKMirror installer to install their damn .apkm files?!
20:29:34 <cn3m[m]> Apkmirror does signature verification and they have a good reputation. I would trust them more than say F-Droid
20:30:00 <yekip[m]> oh really? glad I asked, thanks! i was wrongly assuming fdroid was the most trusted and apkm was  a bit spammy!
20:33:04 <paintedman[m]> strcat: ﻿I'm going to narrow down that list tomorrow to one library (if possible) and then it would be much easier to decide how to fix Wi-Fi problem without workarounds which I use now for debugging
20:33:44 <cn3m[m]> <yekip[m] "oh really? glad I asked, thanks!"> F-Droid is trustworthy. However they have security issues that make me not love the idea
20:34:16 <yekip[m]> thanks
20:34:37 <yekip[m]> no idea how to install the damn thing anyway! it just sends me to a google play store link, to get the apkm installer?! if i wanted google, why would i be on apkmirror i tghe first place?!
20:38:04 <yekip[m]> is pixel 3 an "arm device" or an "arm64 device"?
20:40:35 <madaidan[m]> Pixels are arm64. arm64 is just the 64-bit version of arm.
20:42:17 <yekip[m]> thank you
20:45:13 <cosiams[m]> Out of pure curiosity, why doesnt GrapheneOS uses Open Gapps? What are the disadvantages? It would fix most app compatibility issues and by my limited understanding, its a safer implementation than MicroG.
20:46:18 <cdesai> see this is the biggest problem I have with their name
20:46:24 <yekip[m]> this concerns me, not sure if it should. just installed apk mirror installer app. it has a warning/disclaimer which says" We'll partner with Google and use a unique identifier on your device to respect your data usage choice"
20:46:28 <cdesai> open gapps == google apps, the binary apks.
20:46:40 <cdesai> what's open about it is the script they use to generate the zips
20:47:00 <cdesai> I had this exact confusion when I first heard of the name.
20:47:43 <JTL> cdesai: same
20:48:03 <faxing[m]> The actual apps are closed source
20:49:33 <blacklight447[m]> <cn3m[m] "F-Droid is trustworthy. However "> I mean, its pretty secure if all apps used reproducible builds
20:51:04 <cosiams[m]> <cdesai "open gapps == google apps, the b"> cdesai (@freenode_cdesai:matrix.org): Thanks, but can't you just use a very limited versions of open gapps like Pico? That would still decrease Googles power over your device, while enableing app support.
20:51:57 <cdesai> cosiams[m]: no, because it's not legal to ship them anyway
20:52:57 <cn3m[m]> <cosiams[m] "Out of pure curiosity, why doesn"> Legal issues predominantly
20:53:00 <cn3m[m]> The privacy isn't good either

20:55:40 <jcpicard32[m]> Thanks so much for this even
20:58:26 <jknsec[m]> cn3m Done.
20:59:27 <cosiams[m]> What is the campaign about?
21:00:11 <jcpicard32[m]> cosiams: Fighting misinformation on reddit
21:04:58 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: Alright I DMed you.
21:05:42 <defconanon12[m]> I don't claim to know everything. I am still learning myself.
21:06:20 <defconanon12[m]> I just know some things and I have used some tools in the past to better protect myself per say.
21:09:53 <jknsec[m]> Similar. I have vested interest in privacy and security and do work that occasionally dips into activism and investigative journalism. I would love it if I could help make the case for the truth, if you will.
21:10:37 <jknsec[m]> Writing is basically my job at this point, pretty much.
21:10:38 <defconanon12[m]> Truth always wins and sees light in the end.
21:11:19 <cn3m[m]> I'm writing a huge pastepin of all my recommended readings and explanations
21:11:19 <defconanon12[m]> I love real journalism myself. Though not my expertise though I could do it.

21:21:12 <defconanon12[m]> jknsec:  Either way I had to go to .im to remove my comment.
21:24:32 <jfbourdeau> NOTIFICATION questions : are some of you having NOTIFICATION problem with GrahenOs When using k9 mail, when phone locked ?  If I get new eMails when phone locked (screen turned off), I don't get notified...  Probably something that can be fixed easily.
21:24:36 <jknsec[m]> Ah
21:25:54 <defconanon12[m]> Wow this new patch is bad. Hah.
21:26:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> jfbourdeau: I've had this issue on non-GrapheneOS Android variants. Could be a K9 bug. Have you checked settings for sync intervals? (If you have the app open, it will obviously try syncing for new mails, but your background settings may be different)
21:26:53 <faxing[m]> Oh by the way cn3m  I forgot to ask last night, when I was asking if I should use a fingerprint or alphanumeric passcode, it sounded like you meant that a numeric pin would be better than an alphanumeric passcode - could you maybe elaborate
21:26:54 <jfbourdeau> DannyWorkOrderPr, tks.... Will doublecheck....
21:27:14 <faxing[m]> * Oh by the way cn3m  I forgot to ask last night, when I was asking if I should use a fingerprint or alphanumeric passcode, it sounded like you meant that a numeric pin would be better than an alphanumeric passcode - could you maybe elaborate? It'd be greatly appreciated.
21:27:21 <defconanon12[m]> Talking about the patch with RiotX by the way.
21:27:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> faxing: That...doesn't sound right, lol
21:29:48 <defconanon12[m]> Okay I figured out a work around with that bug. I was stuck in edit mode.
21:30:32 <faxing[m]> Well I didn't think so either but I'm not an expert with security by any means (more of a privacy guy) and I seem him around a lot so I just figured I was missing something or I didn't know enough about it
21:30:43 <faxing[m]> * Well I didn't think so either but I'm not an expert with security by any means (more of a privacy guy) and I see him around a lot so I just figured I was missing something or I didn't know enough about it
21:31:43 <cn3m[m]> faxing: I said a pin is better than a password with a fingerprint
21:31:55 <cn3m[m]> A password with no fingerprint is ideal
21:32:37 <cn3m[m]> I personally use a long pin that is entirely randomly generated. It's fast enough for me to put it in and secure enough. It's a good balance for me
21:33:29 <faxing[m]> Ah, okay yeah I meant about using alphanumeric alone or fingerprint, thanks for the clarification
21:33:43 <faxing[m]> <cn3m[m] "I personally use a long pin that"> Also could you elaborate?
21:34:04 <faxing[m]> You mean you use a long random numeric pin?
21:38:35 <cosiams[m]> jknsec:
21:39:14 <defconanon12[m]> faxing: If you want a good read you should look into "Human tagging."
21:40:23 <faxing[m]> Sounds interesting
21:40:27 <faxing[m]> What's it about?
21:42:32 <defconanon12[m]> Am I allowed to share a direct link to a PDF? To answer your question it is about how we are always tracked and what does that mean when it comes to privacy and security. What are you giving away when you use your fingerprint or any biometrics.
21:43:07 <faxing[m]> That sounds really interesting
21:43:24 <faxing[m]> I'd love to read it if you wouldn't mind DMing me the PDF if you have it
21:52:04 <jknsec[m]> I mean nowadays I'm not even sure how bad the spying is at this point. Even with GrapheneOS and religious usage of things like Tor they probably still know exactly what you're doing.
21:52:46 <radixed9[m]> There is much less mass spying than there was
21:53:13 <jknsec[m]> I mean the NSA had some pretty beefy AI in like what? 2006?
21:53:31 <jknsec[m]> Are you sure about that?
21:55:16 <defconanon12[m]> Depending on where you are at. Mass surveillance has died down a bit.
21:55:25 <jknsec[m]> The US alone still collects most of the shit that they did before Snowden. Wide adoption of things like Signal and Tour makes it harder but for everything else it's still pretty bad.
21:55:37 <jknsec[m]> Five eyes is still around
21:55:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <defconanon12[m] "Depending on where you are at. M"> Legality of mass surveillance has died down a bit
21:55:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <jknsec[m] "Five eyes is still around"> 5, 9, 14
21:56:07 <jknsec[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro Now that seems a bit more accurate
21:56:42 <defconanon12[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: Also, true.
21:57:49 <jknsec[m]> At least in Europe there's GDPR. I mean there's 14 eyes but there are at least some places
21:59:43 <defconanon12[m]> It all depends on your threat model.
22:01:11 <defconanon12[m]> I believe in the US they are trying to pass the Earned-Act. Get rid of end to end encryption.
22:02:47 <defconanon12[m]> * I believe in the US they are trying to pass the Earned IT Act. Get rid of end to end encryption.
22:05:20 <defconanon12[m]> * I believe in the US they are trying to pass the Earn IT Act. Get rid of end to end encryption.
22:07:46 <faxing[m]> Yeah, they are
22:08:08 <faxing[m]> We just have to hope it doesn't pass
22:08:19 <faxing[m]> *  just have to hope it doesn't pass
22:09:13 <defconanon12[m]> This means all information that is end to end will be public.
22:09:51 <faxing[m]> Yeah
22:10:14 <jknsec[m]> I mean if that happens I guess goodbye to Signal. Tbh I'm honestly surprised they're still operating.
22:10:36 <faxing[m]> Signal said something along the lines of "if it passes we'll be eaten alive by the EARN IT act wolves"
22:10:40 <faxing[m]> So it sounds like they're pretty worried about it
22:11:48 <jknsec[m]> Yeah
22:12:24 <defconanon12[m]> Yikes.
22:13:12 <defconanon12[m]> I guess it will be up to app developers to fight it. Another crypto war.
22:15:01 <jknsec[m]> Also EARN IT is not quite a ban on end to end encryption, it's merely an end to Section 230 protection, meaning that any company that does not "EARN" the protection by conforming to government outlined "best practices" will be responsible for what their users say, and as such will be sued into oblivion.
22:15:22 <jknsec[m]> It's pretty much a bill designed to kill Signal.
22:15:53 <jknsec[m]> Others ofc, but especially smaller companies.
22:23:06 <defconanon12[m]> Essentially, it takes away freedom of speech which is what the internet is known for.
22:24:11 <jknsec[m]> Basically the death of the free internet, yeah. Was just saying that it's much worse than you think.
22:24:55 <jknsec[m]> The US will probably end up going the China route if the trend continues.
22:25:30 <salvoromega[m]> https://signal.org/blog/earn-it/
22:25:30 <salvoromega[m]> Signal's post on EARN bill
22:25:53 <defconanon12[m]> Oh I know. I think they could do better but choose not to. The internet would go off the rails if it does pass.
22:26:12 <jknsec[m]> Only reasonable alternative to Signal that isn't sketchy is Briar I think. And that's Android only I think.
22:26:57 <jknsec[m]> At least that's decentralized
22:27:17 <jknsec[m]> Err, p2p
22:27:17 <defconanon12[m]> They are just treating Signal that it is only used by criminals which is far from the truth.
22:27:30 <defconanon12[m]> Did the same with Tor.
22:27:59 <jknsec[m]> If Signal goes For will follow
22:28:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <defconanon12[m] "They are just treating Signal th"> Especially considering many squadrants of Armed Forces, government groups, and companies have issued recommendations to use it
22:28:16 <jknsec[m]> * If Signal goes Tor will follow
22:28:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <jknsec[m] "Only reasonable alternative to S"> I mean, Riot E2EE is audited, and not lacking anything that I'm aware of.
22:28:56 <jknsec[m]> Where is New Vector based?
22:29:16 <jknsec[m]> Europe?
22:30:02 <defconanon12[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: Very true.
22:34:14 <hypokeimenon[m]> <jknsec[m] "Where is New Vector based?"> Uk
22:34:14 <salvoromega[m]> For those interested in not merely sitting on the sidelines and watching the internet die:
22:34:14 <salvoromega[m]> https://mobile.twitter.com/editoremilye/status/797243415922515970
22:34:14 <salvoromega[m]> Good info in the link on how Congress really works....bottom line: annoy your local office with letters and calls
22:36:08 <jknsec[m]> hypokeimenon Oof
22:36:21 <jknsec[m]> That's almost just as bad
22:36:58 <jknsec[m]> Have you seem what the UK is up to? I mean Investigatory Powers Act is bad enough...
22:38:18 <defconanon12[m]> In my opinion it is a terrible to go after the product and not the criminals first. Why try to shut down Signal and others like it when more are just going to keep popping up?
22:39:52 <defconanon12[m]> Less convenient ways mind you.
22:40:53 <dominusart[m]> They don't care about criminals, they just want average person not to use E2EE
22:40:54 <jknsec[m]> Because it's not about criminals
22:41:02 <jknsec[m]> ^
22:41:29 <dominusart[m]> Also, Tor will never go down because it's in USA's best interest for it to be up
22:41:45 <dominusart[m]> They need it for their own operations
22:41:53 <dominusart[m]> There is a reason 99% of Tor funding is from Usa's gov
22:41:58 <defconanon12[m]> I agree to this. They want to shut it down. At least from what I can see.
22:42:36 <dominusart[m]> Idk if it's still 99% from USA, but that was the case in 2025ish
22:42:41 <dominusart[m]> 2015*
22:42:56 <defconanon12[m]> dominusart: Yes. I don't think Tor will go away from the Earn It Act.
22:43:41 <dominusart[m]> What is "Earn it act", I am not familiar with Usa's doing as I do not live there
22:45:28 <dominusart[m]> Is it another USA's stab at crippling encryption?
22:46:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <dominusart[m] "Is it another USA's stab at crip"> It's the server-side version of the Clipper Chip, yes.
22:46:29 <jknsec[m]> I mean then again the US has been trying to "fix" the Tor problem since Snowden. I mean if they get control of enough of the network they can deanonymize pretty much anyone.
22:47:43 <defconanon12[m]> You are talking about if they get control of enough relays right?
22:48:10 <dominusart[m]> Yeah, but the network is growing each year, with more nodes being outside of US's reach.
22:49:33 <dominusart[m]> Also, it's not like Tor is used only by US. China and Russia use it as well.
22:50:17 <defconanon12[m]> Everyone around the world uses Tor. Illegal in some places.
22:52:53 <dominusart[m]> Ofc, I just gave China and Russia as examples because they are the "enemies" of US and making new nodes is incredibly easy. If I remember correctly one party would need to control around 40% of network to try and deanonymize the traffic
22:56:22 <jknsec[m]> Don't underestimate an adversary with infinite time and resources. However, I will say this. Want to kill Tor? You'll have to basically destroy the internet completely. Cut the fiber cables at the bottom of the sea and lock every country into their own, localized internet pockets.
22:56:57 <jknsec[m]> Hell Tor is even used in China regardless of their Great Firewall
22:57:40 <jknsec[m]> They'll eventually get it, somehow. But not now, but they'll probably managed to kill it one day.
22:57:40 <defconanon12[m]> Bridges and VPNs. Though it is advised not to use a VPN over Tor or vice versa.
22:58:11 <jknsec[m]> Bridges are where it's at
22:58:20 <defconanon12[m]> ^
22:58:51 <cx2[m]> Almost thinking, why not use a bridge always?
22:59:09 <dominusart[m]> <jknsec[m] "Don't underestimate an adversary"> Good thing is they don't have infinite time and resources then.
23:00:34 <defconanon12[m]> Not advocating criminals here but just stating a fact this how the lead guy Ross? Got shut down. Used a VPN over Tor. Didn't trust using only Tor. Silk Road got shut down. Correct me if I got his name wrong it has been a while.
23:01:36 <TheJollyRoger> cx2[m]: The reason why they don't use bridges all the time is because the regular listed guard nodes have been, to some extent, vetted by the Tor Network by consensus, if I recall right.
23:02:08 <anne232> defconanon12[m], I'm pretty sure that wasn't why he was busted lmao. He had terrible opsec.
23:02:10 <TheJollyRoger> Which prevents someone from simply spinning up a bajillion Guard nodes and running all the sybil attacks they want.
23:02:59 <defconanon12[m]> anne232: Please enlighten me what exactly was his terrible OPsec?
23:03:01 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: Adrian Crenshaw discusses the Dread Pirate Roberts on "How Tor Users Got Busted" - and what happened to the Dread Pirate Roberts was that when he was promoting the SilkRoad early on, he used the same screenname to solicit help for a PHP programmer that he used to advertise the Silk Road.
23:03:18 <jknsec[m]> dominusart They have more time and resources than you do. Much more. If they specifically want you they'll eventually get you.
23:03:29 <anne232> Okay defconanon12[m] there were tons of things he did wrong, give me a second and I'll show you.
23:03:36 <TheJollyRoger> Then said something like, "I need a php programmer, if you have the skills, contact me at rossulbricht⊙gc"
23:03:40 <anne232> Yeah what TheJollyRoger is a good example and there are many more.
23:03:41 <cx2[m]> TheJollyRoger: and thinking about it, it’s likely that most TOR users don’t use a bridge.....so “blending in” might be diminished  while using a bridge? Somehow I don’t think that’s correct
23:03:41 <dominusart[m]> <defconanon12[m] "Not advocating criminals here bu"> There is a talk called "Don't fuck it up" by Dr.Zoz from defcon
23:03:45 <dominusart[m]> Idk which one
23:03:45 <TheJollyRoger> https://sadtrombone.com
23:03:48 <dominusart[m]> but it's on yt
23:04:02 <jknsec[m]> But I will however say that they are not infallible and are prone to errors as well
23:04:12 <anne232> he also told real life friends about SR
23:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> cx2[m]: the idea behind bridges is that you're using a guard node that's not listed.
23:05:06 <TheJollyRoger> Or if you're using meek_azure then azure becomes your guard node. Azure costs the Tor Project a *lot* more to run and they must pay for this out of pocket.
23:05:47 <cx2[m]> Good thing USG is funding, handsomely
23:06:23 <TheJollyRoger> So if you don't need to use meek_azure, don't, because there are people in countries whose response to seeing Tor usage is "dispatch the military death squads" who do.
23:07:19 <cx2[m]> Of course.
23:07:52 <cx2[m]> TheJollyRoger: Ive only been in two countries where I’ve needed a bridge.
23:08:14 <defconanon12[m]> anne232: Okay that wasn't the only reason. Hah he relied on Gmail. Told his friends. Used VPN. Mixed in his real life with his online life both on the clearnet and Tor.
23:08:45 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: yeah. It was all bad opsec, and he even at one point when confronted by the FBI after ordering fake IDs, said something like,
23:08:54 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger:  Thanks for info. I'll give it a watch.
23:08:54 <TheJollyRoger> "Theoretically anyone could go on a website like the Silk Road and get these."
23:09:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, the key words are "Adrian Crenshaw" and "How Tor Users Got Caught" or "How Tor Users Got Busted" I forget which, but I'm pretty sure the speaker is "Adrian Crenshaw" and it's at DefCon.
23:10:29 <TheJollyRoger> So add "taunted the FBI after they became suspicious" to the list of "opsec fails"
23:11:08 <dominusart[m]> From what I read guy was generally a tool.
23:11:24 <defconanon12[m]> Criminals really like to be open. Some.
23:11:33 <TheJollyRoger> I guess it goes to their head...?
23:11:54 <dominusart[m]> Bad criminals, you don't hear about the good ones because they don't get caught
23:12:05 <defconanon12[m]> Egotistical that is for sure.
23:12:44 <defconanon12[m]> Oh smart criminals can definitely make mistakes you just have to know where to look.
23:13:32 <anne232> using VPN was the least of his worries lol
23:13:55 <anne232> he also apparently made his employees send their actual ids which is.... yikes idk who would agree to that.
23:14:05 <defconanon12[m]> His OPsec is pretty laughable.
23:15:10 <TheJollyRoger> If I recall right, he also did something you really shouldn't do when you use Tor... and that was to use it from a Coffee shop's wifi. So the coffee shop could simply go "Oh hey we have this guy and Tor usage spikes when he's here."
23:15:45 <TheJollyRoger> It's not using Tor with a coffee shop's wifi that's the cardinal sin, more trying to homebrew your own security *on top of Tor* without knowing what you are doing.
23:16:20 <TheJollyRoger> And the implications of doing so.
23:16:25 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger: I thought it was a library and they caught him there? Either way bad OPsec if you don't know what to do while on public WiFi.
23:16:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yep.
23:17:09 <TheJollyRoger> Something like that.
23:17:51 <TheJollyRoger> This is why Toxic Power User mentality destroys privacy, opsec, and security all in one fell swoop.
23:20:05 <defconanon12[m]> Yeah I agree. If you don't know something and take it into your own hands without research and perhaps help. You are screwed.
23:20:25 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
23:21:32 <defconanon12[m]> What does everyone think of Brave's recent scandal? Talking about the Brave browser?
23:21:57 <TheJollyRoger> I haven't got any thoughts on it, I don't keep up with Brave.
23:22:26 <radixed9[m]> Brave is modifying links. The distinction is compared to affliate driven services like DuckDuckGo you click on the links not type them in
23:22:27 <jknsec[m]> Never liked or used Brave so can't really comment.
23:22:30 <radixed9[m]> I doubt this will change anyone's mind about Brave
23:23:43 <radixed9[m]> It borders on fraud in this usage(it might be IANAL)
23:24:43 <defconanon12[m]> radixed9: It changed my mind when I looked into it more.
23:25:03 <jknsec[m]> *whispers*
23:25:23 <jknsec[m]> "ungoogled chromium"
23:25:49 <jknsec[m]> Fuck Brave and their money making schemes
23:25:50 <dominusart[m]> ungoogled chromium on opnBSD is pretty good, but then you have to use opnbsd
23:26:07 <jknsec[m]> Ha
23:26:18 <concat[m]> <jknsec[m] "Fuck Brave and their money makin"> Yes making money is bad
23:26:30 <defconanon12[m]> https://decrypt.co/31522/crypto-brave-browser-redirect
23:26:44 <defconanon12[m]> An interesting read on the issue.
23:27:03 <jknsec[m]> concat Yes it is indeed
23:27:12 <jknsec[m]> No one should make money ever
23:27:50 <radixed9[m]> <dominusart[m] "ungoogled chromium on opnBSD is "> OpenBSD is not well suited for the desktop
23:27:55 <radixed9[m]> Security wise
23:28:14 <dominusart[m]> Hence the "but then you have to use openbsd"
23:28:16 <concat[m]> No BSD is, HardenedBSD is a kind of.
23:28:26 <radixed9[m]> macOS is
23:28:34 <dominusart[m]> HardenedBSD is just openbsd fork
23:29:01 <jknsec[m]> Only decent OS for desktop is... GrapheneOS with a keyboard?
23:29:01 <strcat[m]> FreeBSD fork
23:29:01 <concat[m]> <dominusart[m] "HardenedBSD is just openbsd fork"> no it isn't
23:29:02 <strcat[m]> not OpenBSD
23:29:02 <concat[m]> It's based off FreeBSD
23:29:13 <jknsec[m]> Or an iPad tbh
23:29:28 <TheJollyRoger> OpenBSD again falls back to the same security problem that's plagued the usual desktop model: it assumes that you are only going to ever be running trustworthy code, or code written to respect the operating system's policies.
23:29:33 <jknsec[m]> Maybe Qubes or Fedora maybe.
23:29:34 <concat[m]> jknsec That's not a desktop OS
23:29:58 <jknsec[m]> And your point?
23:30:02 <concat[m]> <jknsec[m] "Maybe Qubes or Fedora maybe. "> Not Fedora, Fedora is just as insecure as any other Linux distro. ChromiumOS/CloudReady is the only Linux-based OS with a security model
23:30:26 <jknsec[m]> Qubes or Chrome then
23:30:32 <radixed9[m]> AOSP is a Linux based OS with a great security model
23:30:46 <TheJollyRoger> pledge and unveil in OpenBSD require that the application be coded to use them.
23:30:48 <dominusart[m]> <concat[m] "It's based off FreeBSD"> Oh, my bad, must have mistaken it with another project which has kernel based on OpenBSD and it's called "HardenedBSD" internally
23:30:50 <jknsec[m]> So iPad it is then
23:30:50 <nickcalyx[m]> BSD on the desktop is interesting
23:30:53 <concat[m]> <radixed9[m] "AOSP is a Linux based OS with a "> context: desktop
23:31:19 <radixed9[m]> <jknsec[m] "So iPad it is then"> If you want a laptop functional mobile OS for the most part yes
23:31:45 <radixed9[m]> ChromeOS gets an honorable mention(not ChromiumOS)
23:31:45 <jknsec[m]> iPad Pro with a keyboard
23:31:53 <jknsec[m]> Bet
23:32:15 <dominusart[m]> The truth is, your system is as secure as your hardware is.
23:32:19 <cx2[m]> <jknsec[m] "iPad Pro with a keyboard"> *magic keyboard....it’s bonkers
23:32:48 <radixed9[m]> No need to trust bluetooth
23:33:16 <radixed9[m]> iPad Pro + magic keyboard is at the forefront of privacy and security
23:33:18 <jknsec[m]> I'm more fucking with you but yeah the desktop security model is shit. A Talos machine with Qubes (which is not supported) yet is basically the only thing that's remotely secure.
23:33:46 <radixed9[m]> <jknsec[m] "I'm more fucking with you but ye"> Where did you get that idea?
23:34:00 <cx2[m]> <radixed9[m] "iPad Pro + magic keyboard is at "> AND an f-ing joy to use
23:34:06 <madaidan[m]> <dominusart[m] "The truth is, your system is as "> No, it's not. The most secure hardware isn't gonna fix windows 96.
23:34:18 <jknsec[m]> radixed9 Then again I trust Apple less and less with every day.
23:34:58 <jknsec[m]> I'm sure both Qubes and Talos are not secure anymore by now at this point.
23:34:58 <radixed9[m]> <jknsec[m] "radixed9 Then again I trust Appl"> Why? I trust them more throughout the years than I used too
23:35:00 <dominusart[m]> I mean, ofc when you use outdated piece of shit software your system is not secure.
23:35:44 <cx2[m]> <jknsec[m] "radixed9 Then again I trust Appl"> Shit, I’m paying apple to not sell me..... I DO trust that.
23:35:51 <jknsec[m]> Since the security world moves so quickly
23:36:04 <jknsec[m]> I mean they do
23:36:45 <madaidan[m]> <jknsec[m] "Since the security world moves s"> Depends on which world you're talking about
23:36:47 <madaidan[m]> My grandma moves faster than desktop Linux
23:37:19 <hypokeimenon[m]> <jknsec[m] "I'm more fucking with you but ye"> I don't think Qubes/Xen has been ported to ppc
23:37:20 <jknsec[m]> Remember the whole Siri debacle? Fappening? Aka don't use icloud and keep your device on airplane mode as much as possible type shit?
23:37:57 <radixed9[m]> <jknsec[m] "Remember the whole Siri debacle?"> I think you should research both of those incidents more if that's what you walked away with that
23:39:56 <jknsec[m]> Siri moreso. I mean they admitted that they listen to your conversation s. Plus Apple is a known Prism partner. Stripped down, however, with no iCloud and Siri disabled, it's great from a security perspective and decent from a privacy perspective
23:40:28 <jknsec[m]> While what I said was hyperbole it is try the iPhones are getting easier and easier to crack.
23:40:38 <madaidan[m]> Every US company can be a PRISM partner. Apple isn't special.
23:41:06 <radixed9[m]> They made a mistake on Siri and pushed forward their end to end encryption and offline processing. They changed everything to opt in. I am not sure what they could have done better
23:41:08 <radixed9[m]> They stopped outsourcing everything after that too
23:41:32 <radixed9[m]> They made a mistake and they had a strong reaction. I don't know what more we could have expected
23:41:32 <jknsec[m]> I know, but they're a big company. Technically every US company is subject to PRISM but you know
23:41:58 <concat[m]> <radixed9[m] "ChromeOS gets an honorable menti"> Why not ChromiumOS?
23:42:33 <concat[m]> It has weaker verified boot (only rootfs and bootloader) but that doesn't make it an unworthy candidate especially since it has much more going for it.
23:42:35 <strcat[m]> jknsec: any company that wants to do business in the US
23:42:35 <jknsec[m]> They're getting better, yeah. But there are certain things about Apple that... unsettle me, I'd say.
23:42:35 <radixed9[m]> concat: Verified boot mostly. It is still Linux
23:42:50 <jknsec[m]> ^
23:43:28 <jknsec[m]> But that's just personal preference on my part
23:43:53 <concat[m]> radixed9 It isn't "Just Linux", it has *a lot* more than just Linux. And you still have rootfs and bootloader verification, not as strong as ChromeOS but does that really just remove it from the competition?
23:44:14 <jknsec[m]> I just do not trust a lot of their privacy theater, really.
23:44:34 <jknsec[m]> What a company says is not necessarily conducive to what they actually do.
23:44:45 <concat[m]> radixed9 Its kernel like ChromeOS inherits a lot of Android mitigations like ShadowCallStack and CFI.
23:45:20 <concat[m]> radixed9 It also has ``minijail0`` wrappers and just about the same system hardening as ChromeOS.
23:45:21 <jknsec[m]> I'm sure you guys hate me for saying that
23:45:38 <cn3m[m]> Apple has been verified too use local processing whenever they can
23:46:08 <cn3m[m]> I have an iPad that I MITM most updated
23:46:12 <cn3m[m]> Updates*
23:46:22 <concat[m]> ChromiumOS also has really hardened virtualization software (Crostini). It takes a lot of cues from QubesOS (all code is untrusted, devices are entirely virtualized and inaccessable by VM)
23:46:26 <strcat[m]> concat: I don't think ChromeOS uses ShadowCallStack atm - I think just Pixel phones do
23:46:27 <concat[m]> On top of that it then runs the distro inside a container inside a VM
23:46:45 <jknsec[m]> You can still be better than everyone else and still be evil. They're reliable and decent but honestly they scare me a bit.
23:47:03 <radixed9[m]> strcat: I thought I saw they got ShadowCallStack I could be wrong on that
23:47:04 <concat[m]> strcat Huh, I recall it having ShadowCallStack. I'll double check.
23:47:25 <strcat[m]> concat: ShadowCallStack is arm64-only so it wouldn't exist for x86 Chromium
23:47:31 <strcat[m]> and I don't really think they have it on arm
23:48:04 <jknsec[m]> Then again I am more than like some other uninformed r/privacy paranoid power user™ and am honestly open to listening to verifiable evidence.
23:48:04 <concat[m]> strcat Uh no, Chrome/ChromiumOS is arm
23:48:30 <radixed9[m]> He is saying they wouldn't put it only on arm
23:48:30 <strcat[m]> arm is one of the architectures it supports
23:48:31 <strcat[m]> it's still primarily for x86
23:48:35 <strcat[m]> and I don't think they use ShadowCallStack on arm
23:49:04 <strcat[m]> Pixel phones use CFI and ShadowCallStack but it's not widely adopted anywhere else - I am not sure if it's even used anywhere else right now for the Linux kernel
23:49:19 <concat[m]> https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/compiler-rt/+/google/stable%5E1..google/stable/
23:49:19 <strcat[m]> and I don't think ChromiumOS uses ShadowCallStack at all
23:49:22 <strcat[m]> they use CFI for userspace
23:49:53 <strcat[m]> concat: not sure what that's supposed to show
23:49:54 <strcat[m]> compiler-rt is an LLVM library
23:50:45 <radixed9[m]> They could definitely use it on arm and it has been tested on similar setups
23:50:49 <concat[m]> Uh wrong bookmarked link hold on
23:50:55 <strcat[m]> ShadowCallStack support being present in LLVM doesn't mean they use it
23:50:58 <jknsec[m]> See I like Graphene honestly because of the people here, especially strcat. It "feels" better but then again feeling should not be the basis for any security decision.
23:51:14 <strcat[m]> and ShadowCallStack is arm64-only since the x86 support was a failure and was removed
23:51:37 <jknsec[m]> Plus it helps that Daniel knows what the fuck he's talking about
23:51:49 <jknsec[m]> Thank you, by the way.
23:51:55 <strcat[m]> everyone has ShadowCallStack support in LLVM if it's up-to-date but doesn't mean it's used or that they provide production support for it in libc
23:51:59 <strcat[m]> rather than the compiler-rt stuff
23:52:06 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "ShadowCallStack support being pr"> No you're right, I shared a wrong link
23:52:11 <strcat[m]> similar to CFI where it has to be implemented in libc or somewhere else to do it properly
23:53:19 <concat[m]> <radixed9[m] "They could definitely use it on "> Can you tell when the tests were made?
23:53:49 <concat[m]> It could help me find what I was talking about
23:55:45 <radixed9[m]> https://github.com/samitolvanen/linux/tree/clang-cfi?
23:58:07 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "and ShadowCallStack is arm64-onl"> Off-topic for a moment since we're talking about x86, wasn't Windows the best verified boot for x86?
