01:44:32 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you can drop the BPF JIT related commits, since BPF JIT isn't used and requires enabling CONFIG_MODULES anyway
01:44:57 <strcat[m]> I'd rather just keep it disabled
01:54:20 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: for yama we need to add back the toggle we used to have in dev settings
01:54:41 <strcat[m]> so probably set Yama ptrace setting to 2 by default
01:54:45 <strcat[m]> and have a setting to disable it
01:54:52 <strcat[m]> maybe in dev options, maybe in regular security settings
01:54:55 <strcat[m]> because it might break some apps
01:55:06 <strcat[m]> if it's needed by non-devs needs to be in sec settings
01:55:07 <strcat[m]> unsure
01:55:46 <strcat[m]> apps all have a unique uid/gid (per-app per-profile) and the SELinux domains are now unique too
01:56:09 <strcat[m]> and the OS sandbox feature (isolatedProcess) for building sandboxes in apps uses unique uid/gid per sandboxed process
01:56:16 <strcat[m]> and similarly unique SELinux domain
01:56:27 <strcat[m]> so there is not much that the ptrace_scope feature really does
01:56:43 <strcat[m]> there aren't many processes that run as the same uid/gid and the same SELinux domain
01:56:58 <strcat[m]> so the only real purpose of it is that it's a toggle to dynamically enable / disable ptrace
01:57:05 <strcat[m]> to reduce kernel attack surface mostly
01:57:11 <strcat[m]> since it's a non-trivial feature
02:41:54 <cyborgninjaneer[> > so probably set Yama ptrace setting to 2 by default
02:41:54 <cyborgninjaneer[> Isn't yama a kernel security module?

02:57:58 <sheruleeya[m]> * As it connects initially, it somehow leaks the real ip, which is problematic
02:58:20 <sheruleeya[m]> Apparently, that query bypasses the block connection without vpn

03:05:00 <nickcalyx[m]> I think it will break shit if you do that.
03:05:26 <sheruleeya[m]> Alright, I won't. I doubt it sends anything identifying (data) anyways

17:19:12 <cyborgninjaneer[> I had considered a separate profile, but with JavaScript is disabled is Gecko still a liability?
17:21:00 <sheruleeya[m]> On increasing attack surfaces, security sacrifices, well yeah, it's a liability
17:22:29 <sheruleeya[m]> You can check the logs about fingerprinting, tor browser, etc for details
17:23:26 <sheruleeya[m]> * It should route that I guess, but fingerprints (albeit it is only used in 3.5% tracking according to Mozilla) Gotta double check this
17:26:14 <sheruleeya[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=Fingerprinting&ch=grapheneos
17:26:14 <sheruleeya[m]> (Example for fingerprinting)
17:26:49 <cyborgninjaneer[> A better question might be whether Vanadium has a more unique fingerprint than Tor browser with Javascript disabled on bith
17:26:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> Both*
17:27:38 <sheruleeya[m]> I rather use Bromite for anti-fingerprinting
17:28:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> My original question was quite specific, but perhaps I did not word it well: With JavaScript disabled, what is the remaining attack surface like in Tor Browser?
17:29:01 <sheruleeya[m]> Not sure about that on your question though
17:29:40 <sheruleeya[m]> * I rather use Bromite for anti-fingerprinting, if I was to choose between Bromite or Vanadium
17:29:59 <cyborgninjaneer[> Without JavaScript, what other means are there of compromising an Android device?
17:30:27 <sheruleeya[m]> * Not sure about that on your question though, having two different browsers on different forks increase the attack surface. Firefox has no additional isolation besides from the os itself.
17:30:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's not helpful as I already know that.
17:31:05 <sheruleeya[m]> (I really need to delegate this to somebody else to be honest, or on sites:
17:31:05 <sheruleeya[m]> Check out whonix and tor documentation)
17:31:28 <sheruleeya[m]> It would honestly answer your questions more than I can myself.
17:31:47 <cyborgninjaneer[> To be more general, what attack vectors remain for browser-based malware when JavaScript is disabled?
17:32:00 <sheruleeya[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "My original question was quite s"> JS attacks isn't the only attack that exists afaik
17:32:14 <sheruleeya[m]> The link/correlation attacks

17:59:11 <cyborgninjaneer[> So long story short it's as bad as I thought.

18:22:22 <jalb> Hi, about VPN leaks when using different users. If I only install some VPN app in another profile and so I only use the VPN there, will the main user (admin) be connecting to the VPN too?. When I finish I stop the VPN app and in the main user I don't see the VPN connected in the Network settings. So?. Thanks
18:37:34 <cyborgninjaneer[> Each user profile needs its own VPN app. I'm fairly certain the inactive profile is basically shut down when you switch, so it shouldn't be able to connect to anything at all, but I can't confirm that.
18:38:27 <jalb> cyborgninjaneer[: so, the admin profile (without the VPN app) will be connecting with the normal connection?
18:38:52 <jalb> I know that for example WIFI is ACTIVE when you are in a different user/profile
18:39:15 <jalb> That's why I ask
18:46:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> > cyborgninjaneer: so, the admin profile (without the VPN app) will be connecting with the normal connection?
18:46:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yes. It will connect to the clearnet unless you set up a VPN in that profile
18:47:18 <jalb> cyborgninjaneer[: thanks
18:52:00 <rover1[m]> cyborgninjaneer: no background process if switch to another profile?
18:52:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> > cyborgninjaneer: no background process if switch to another profile?
18:52:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's the part I'm not sure about
18:53:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> I think not.
18:53:51 <jalb> Well, Wifi is active in all the profiles
18:55:26 <jalb> When you switch to the main profile you'll see that connections have been made while you were in another prifle

19:24:45 <fomijafi[m]> Can anyone recommend a good VoIP service with DID number that allows group messaging? I was testing VoIP.ms but no group messaging :(
19:25:27 <jiibus[m]> jmp.chat has group messaging in Alpha, but it works for the most part from my understanding.
19:25:46 <jiibus[m]> Definitely a way more private service than voip.ms
19:26:30 <fomijafi[m]> Looks like about 3 bucks per month
19:26:32 <jiibus[m]> You just have to contact support to have group messaging turned on for your account
19:26:33 <fomijafi[m]> Not awful
19:26:59 <jiibus[m]> Yea, $35/year isn't too baf
19:27:03 <jiibus[m]>  * Yea, $35/year isn't too bad
19:28:36 <jiibus[m]> The conversations app works well with their service for me. When someone leaves a voicemail, for example, it automatically sends it as a `.wav` attachment from that person
19:31:18 <fomijafi[m]> jiibus: do you know if there are pricing models for multiple numbers? Not seeing that on their site?
19:31:43 <jiibus[m]> Not sure, never had that need for myself. Could always jump in their jabber room and ask
19:32:32 <jiibus[m]>  * Not sure, never had that need for myself. Could always jump in their jabber room and ask
19:32:32 <jiibus[m]> discuss‚äôcsc
19:34:29 <fomijafi[m]> Thanks for uku help!
19:35:11 <fomijafi[m]> * Thanks for your help!
19:58:53 <glct[m]> <fomijafi[m] "Can anyone recommend a good VoIP"> MySudo might be what you're looking for
20:28:23 <fomijafi[m]> glct: via aurora store you're suggesting?
20:40:51 <glct[m]> I'm suggesting the app, but yes it's available on Google play store and by extension the aurora store. On Android if you're USA, CA or Aus If otherwise it's not yet available
20:40:53 <fomijafi[m]> Though I did use mysudo on an iPhone previously. Very user friendly.
20:40:53 <fomijafi[m]> Thanks, trying to keep this GOS device fully free from play services.
20:40:54 <jneplokh> MySudo requires play services
20:44:38 <glct[m]> How do you know Jacob? Have you tested it on a Google free device?
20:46:25 <jneplokh> Yep, I‚Äôve tried it on GrapheneOS and it simply does not launch. They have a hard dependency for now unfortunately
20:56:59 <nickcalyx[m]> It also won yt work with microg but we've had people submit crash logs
21:07:42 <glct[m]> Ah... That's too bad. Thanks for confirming
21:28:27 <xabi[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Crdroid is the reason it is halt"> Is omnirom a good base? They used to make fun about lineage/cyanogen code quality
21:30:43 <jneplokh> glct: Yeah it is pretty unfortunate, you have to DIY a solution, but that can be fun as well ;)
21:35:02 <john_doe2[m]> Hey, I am going to buy a new phone soon, was considering either iphone 2020 se or a pixel 3a ( to install grapheneOS on). I was more inclined towards pixel 3a, however i was told that the project might die off because the lead dev hasn't been receiving sufficient community support, is that just a rumor or is there substance to it?
21:36:06 <Mobius[m]> don't trust everything you read on the internet
21:37:20 <glct[m]> I think there was a point a while back where that was the case, with a lack of development support. But the situation (from my outsider's perspective) is a healthier. There's consistent monetary contributions as well (which needs more support to reach the goal) but anyway to conclude my point, the answer is no
21:38:15 <glct[m]> There's still assistance needed from us with a misinformation campaign against GOS which is the reason I'm here, to help. Still doing my research on this
21:39:40 <qyo3462572445[m]> <glct[m] "MySudo might be what you're look"> Check out JMP. Not sure about group messages but, the devs are EXTREMELY responsive on their xmpp group for any questions or issues.
21:41:17 <qyo3462572445[m]> Anddd I just saw that someone already suggested this. Sorry.
21:41:19 <jneplokh> Yeah I gave JMP a try and it is solid, I just needed numbers for sms verifications codes though, so I went with voip.ms. But when I did ask a question, the devs answered really quickly
21:44:29 <fomijafi[m]> Yea I think I might hang onto VoIP.ms for a throwaway, but checking out jmp now
23:18:31 <naithan[m]> !nick test2
23:52:07 <neonfuz2> So is it blasphemy to install zoom on grapheneOS
23:52:44 <sheruleeya[m]> On a separate profile, maybe not
23:58:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> Zoom will steal your virtue.
23:58:52 <cyborgninjaneer[> Shouldn't hack your phone as long as it's in a separate profile though
23:59:02 <cyborgninjaneer[> Minimize permissions as well
23:59:05 <sheruleeya[m]> But again, I refrain from doing it, as much as possible. You could use the website anyways if possonle.
23:59:41 <sheruleeya[m]> * But again, I refrain from doing it, as much as possible. You could use the website anyways if possible (yes it is, when you tick the desktop mode)
