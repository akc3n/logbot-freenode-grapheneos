00:00:50 <brenneke[m]> Checking Vanadium on GrapheneOS, any concern with webrtc leak like this?
00:01:02 <strcat> brenneke[m]: that's not a thing
00:01:45 <strcat> VPN services are implemented via OS support
00:01:53 <strcat> apps don't have the *option* to leak via network connections
00:01:58 <strcat> it's not how things work
00:03:24 <brenneke[m]> Am sure you are right.....kinda all went over my head unfortunately!
00:03:50 <strcat> brenneke[m]: apps are not responsible for sending their traffic through a proxy, the OS does, understand? they can't leak via network connections
00:04:01 <strcat> they are not responsible for implementing it
00:04:24 <strcat> browser proxy implementations are known to be incomplete - but that isn't used on Android
00:04:45 <strcat> has zero relevance to using a VPN service app or the OS VPN support
00:05:22 <violadivias> hello debug cable works with Pixel 3a?
00:05:33 <strcat> which debug cable
00:05:43 <strcat> the proper kind of debug cable works
00:05:54 <brenneke[m]> OK. No cause for concern with anything on that screenshot then?
00:06:09 <strcat> brenneke[m]: read what I wrote
00:06:16 <violadivias> github.com/Peter-Easton/android-debug-cable
00:07:06 <strcat> brenneke[m]: enable a VPN and run the test, you will see that what I said is true - it should be obvious why from what I said
00:07:20 <strcat> brenneke[m]: apps are not responsible for routing their traffic through VPNs / Tor on Android
00:07:21 <brenneke[m]> <strcat "brenneke: read what I wrote"> I did of course, I am not that smart. Where did VPN come in?
00:07:39 <strcat> brenneke[m]: you are talking about WebRTC being used to leak the real IP when using a VPN
00:07:47 <strcat> that is not how VPNs work on Android
00:07:49 <strcat> this is not an issue
00:07:58 <strcat> I think that's all that needs to be said - not an issue, move along
00:08:06 <strcat> see the FAQ
00:08:27 <strcat> BBBBBBBBhttps://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support
00:08:31 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support
00:08:37 <brenneke[m]> <strcat "brenneke: you are talking about "> I am on VPN......was referring more to my local IP.
00:09:08 <strcat> which VPN
00:09:11 <strcat> which app
00:09:47 <strcat> turn off the setting for access to the local network if it has a bypass for that like OpenVPN
00:09:51 <strcat> the OpenVPN app rather
00:09:54 <violadivias> strcat: is there a schematic for the "proper" cable?
00:10:03 <strcat> violadivias: talk to TheJollyRoger
00:10:38 <violadivias> strcat: ok sounded like you knew about the cables
00:10:45 <strcat> I do
00:10:58 <strcat> TheJollyRoger has schematics and can make cables
00:11:29 <dazinism> violadivias: that link you shared is from JollyRoger
00:11:40 <violadivias> cool
00:11:48 <dazinism> And pretty sure they work with 3a
00:11:52 <violadivias> sounds like there is more than one cable
00:12:05 <violadivias> any link to official docs from google?
00:12:18 <dazinism> Dont think there are any
00:12:25 <strcat> there is 1 kind of cable for each device
00:12:34 <dazinism> There used to be a different cable for Nexus
00:12:36 <brenneke[m]> <strcat "which app"> OpenVPN on router....Asus Merlin.
00:12:53 <strcat> brenneke[m]: you need to use a VPN service on the device, not outside it
00:12:58 <violadivias> pins found by trial error?
00:13:07 <strcat> brenneke[m]: if you want to avoid leaks
00:13:23 <strcat> otherwise you are relying on your network doing that
00:13:54 <brenneke[m]> <strcat "otherwise you are relying on you"> I am relying on my network yes.
00:14:06 <strcat> that's why the app has access to the local network
00:14:42 <strcat> so yes, if you don't use a VPN service on the device which blocks apps from accessing the local network, they can do that
00:14:46 <strcat> and apps are not designed to avoid leaks
00:14:54 <strcat> the OS prevents leaks when you use a VPN service
00:15:12 <strcat> it's the responsibility of the OS and it does it properly
00:15:32 <strcat> WebRTC will make connections over the local network, etc. if it can
00:15:49 <strcat> if you aren't using a VPN service not providing a local network bypass it can and will by design
00:16:41 <strcat> you aren't using a VPN on the device so the OS is not blocking leaks
00:19:12 <brenneke[m]> <strcat "you aren't using a VPN on the de"> So same thing now with device connected to VPN.
00:19:39 <strcat> use a VPN app that doesn't allow local network access
00:19:40 * brenneke[m] uploaded an image: device-on-vpn.png (307KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/mPAXxJoVpmWXCVthhRfCkuUv >
00:19:46 <strcat> which VPN app
00:19:49 <strcat> that's what I asked before
00:20:08 <strcat> there is a toggle to disable local network access in most
00:20:16 <brenneke[m]> VPN Client Pro
00:21:33 * brenneke[m] posted a file: Screenshot_20200504-172121.png (76KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/psUZZKKGVjxOoLKpxESxLzcU >
00:22:24 <strcat> ok so if you have that enabled the app can't access the local network
00:22:43 <strcat> it can't connect to other hosts on the local network and they can't connect to it
00:22:52 <strcat> assuming the VPN properly implements that
00:24:39 <strcat> there is no leak in the VPN implementation
00:25:11 <strcat> you screenshot doesn't demonstrate one either
00:26:59 <cx2[m]> strcat: Quick question about Auditor.... I have disabled and re-enabled remote attestation due to it missing 3 verifications (one every four hours)
00:27:00 <cx2[m]> When I re-enabled, Attestation failed again.
00:27:21 <strcat> cx2[m]: I think something went wrong with the service, haven't had time to look into it
00:27:27 <strcat> maybe it ran out of space - don't know
00:27:31 <strcat> help welcome
00:27:54 <cx2[m]> If I knew how, I would.
00:28:09 <strcat> I'll check quickly
00:28:11 <strcat> one sec
00:29:08 <cx2[m]> Nah not on my account. Hasn't even been a full day. But I switched countries and thought that might have something to do with it. I appreciate the help.
00:29:25 <strcat> cx2[m]: no it's broken here too
00:29:28 <strcat> that's what I'm saying
00:29:38 <renlord> strcat: w.r.t to running unbound as my DNSSEC enforcing resolver, why do i have to do this when, other MTAs are responsible for checking DANE?
00:30:01 <renlord> unless i also want my MTA to check DANE for other MTAs also when relaying outgoing emails?
00:30:02 <strcat> renlord: they are responsible for checking DANE when sending email to you only
00:30:09 <strcat> on the client verifies the server certificate
00:30:16 <strcat> one sending mail == client
00:30:22 <strcat> there is not client cert verification only server
00:30:29 <strcat> when you are sending mail, you need to verify DNSSEC + DANE
00:30:48 <strcat> cx2[m]: dunno what could have gone wrong with it :(
00:30:55 <renlord> ok, so the unbound setup is for myself to enforce DANE against other MTAs
00:30:57 <strcat> haven't touched it recently
00:31:07 <strcat> renlord: to enforce DNSSEC, so you can do DANE in postfix
00:32:06 <cx2[m]> Dang.... again, I really wish I could help, without any programming knowledge, is there anything I can assist with?
00:32:13 <strcat> cx2[m]: looking into it
00:32:32 <strcat> high stress day - been having people attacking me and the project + endorsing James / Copperhead
00:32:37 <strcat> and need to do a major release today
00:32:52 <nickcalyx[m]> Cx2 are you a good writer
00:33:32 <strcat> cx2[m]: hey, fixed it
00:33:33 <renlord> strcat: what attacks today?
00:33:37 <cx2[m]> nickcalyx: define, writer
00:34:03 <strcat> renlord: Samourai Wallet community turned on us because James has been there for 2+ years and has been spreading lots of fraudulent claims and misinformation about GrapheneOS, etc.
00:34:22 <strcat> renlord: James started giving them free access to his product built from my legacy codebase
00:34:31 <strcat> i.e. the new CopperheadOS
00:34:36 <madaidan[m]> strcat: Didn't you say there was a kernel dev that once said Linux is an unfixable security mess and there's no point in hardening it?
00:34:37 <cx2[m]> strcat: thanks! IF Attestation fails, does it wait for the next scheduled time to try again? Or can i force it by disabling then reenabling
00:34:38 <strcat> and that seems to be enough for them to start supporting him and turning on us
00:34:48 <strcat> cx2[m]: it tries again really fast
00:34:56 <strcat> faster than the next scheduled time IIRC
00:35:00 <renlord> samourai wallet in general is not really honest and forthcoming, many prominent bitcoin developers especially from bitcoin core has complained about samourai wallet
00:35:04 <strcat> I can't really remember how the job scheduling is set up atm
00:35:11 <strcat> renlord: well it's their community
00:35:13 <strcat> that's problematic
00:35:18 <strcat> a dozen people or more in the community
00:35:35 <strcat> madaidan[m]: yes several of them have said that
00:35:56 <strcat> madaidan[m]: their counter to including hardening was it's insecure and cannot be made secure and you should not use it for multi-user or anything trusted basically
00:36:03 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "madaidan.: yes several of them h"> Do you've any links/names? Sounds interesting.
00:36:17 <renlord> i think i saw on LKML briefly
00:36:19 <strcat> madaidan[m]: no - has happened multiple times and they were core linux kernel maintainers
00:36:51 <strcat> madaidan[m]: I would look for the terms like they to use like sekurity or w/e it is they say
00:37:55 <strcat> https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/18/282 an example of them saying that (on an unrelated issue - here they are bashing preventing generating native code dynamically)
00:38:01 <strcat> anyway good search term to use
00:38:34 <renlord> yes i complain too
00:38:37 <renlord> makes profiling hard
00:38:56 <renlord> but also agree that it is a security dumpster fire
00:39:40 <madaidan[m]> strcat: Thanks, I'll start looking.
00:40:05 <renlord> but i've also resigned to the fact that linux is just not suitable for non-power users
00:40:28 <strcat> good chance it was Peter Zijlstra
00:42:30 <strcat> cx2[m]: so the issue is that I have a debian container and debian loves stupid autoconfiguration
00:42:52 <strcat> I installed apachebench so it tried to turn on an apache server in the container which broke nginx somehow even though it was still running? who even knows
00:43:15 <strcat> I would like to  use something else but there aren't really good options
00:43:34 <strcat> cx2[m]: anyway fixed by removing it
00:43:37 <strcat> the package
00:43:48 <strcat> brenneke[m]: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
00:43:56 <strcat> brenneke[m]: > Using Vanadium is highly recommended and Bromite is a good alternative if you want a few more features like ad-blocking and more aggressive anti-fingerprinting
00:44:00 <cx2[m]> Can confirm. Attestation was successful
00:44:00 <strcat> brenneke[m]: is my recommendation
00:44:12 <strcat> brenneke[m]: Vanadium does NOT have any VPN leaks because the OS does that properly
00:44:19 <strcat> brenneke[m]: what you're seeing is NOT a leak
00:44:21 <cx2[m]> strcat thank again!
00:45:38 <strcat> brenneke[m]: it's just fingerprinting - the browser includes the local IP address for WebRTC when it's enabled, Bromite disables things like that, Vanadium hasn't really started on this yet due to lack of resources, which is why Bromite is mentioned there even though it doesn't have all the same hardening, etc.
00:47:17 <zxwayland> tom cat
00:51:35 <strcat[m]> ?
00:53:18 <zxwayland> quick question. when i get my new pixel 3a in the mail from the google store. hpoefully this friday. do i need to power it on and let it update via google server before i unblock the bootloader and flash grapheneos?
00:55:40 <strcat> optional
00:55:58 <strcat> zxwayland: you do need to power it on to unlock the bootloader ofc :P
00:56:06 <strcat> but updating it is optional
00:56:33 <strcat> I consider it good practice right now due to past issues with older firmware versions
00:56:40 <strcat> i.e. there were past bootloader versions with quirks
00:56:47 <zxwayland> oh, there is old firmware?
00:56:47 <strcat> but not for the 3a that I know of
00:57:09 <strcat> zxwayland: I'm just saying that we only test with the latest firmware version shipped with the current OS version
00:57:15 <zxwayland> oh ok
00:57:34 <strcat> there MAY be issues with older firmware versions - so we consider it best practice to update first, but you don't have to, and it's unlikely anything will go wrong
00:57:39 <strcat> GrapheneOS will flash all the latest firmware anyway
00:57:45 <strcat> and you would notice if something went wrong
00:58:11 <strcat> zxwayland: I just try to cover all common problems people run into it
00:58:23 <strcat> so I say to use an up-to-date OS on the device they use to flash and on the device they are flashing to
00:58:35 <strcat> because there are bugs that have been fixed
00:58:38 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "madaidan.: I would look for the "> Do you've any more key words? I can't find anything.
00:58:55 <zxwayland> well, i asked this a couple of days ago. Daniel, what if you decided to leave/stop supporting grapheneos? is there a backup plan? Because I want to use Grapheneos for a least 3 years with supported updates
00:59:17 <madaidan[m]> Maybe "security masturbation" although probably a bit Linus-specific.
00:59:38 <strcat> madaidan[m]: no - but I'm 100% sure that someone like peter that's an official maintainer has said exactly that on multiple occasions (saying that it's insecure and people trying to improve it are just misguided and should start over, which is amusing since it's what I think is the only real solution - but ofc it makes sense to do what we can with linux until then)
00:59:49 <strcat> zxwayland: it's open source
01:00:01 <strcat> zxwayland: other people are free to continue it, I am doing my best to build a community that could do that
01:00:34 <zxwayland> so, maybe someone would fork if you decided to spot developement of grapheneos?
01:00:39 <strcat> zxwayland: it's unlikely that I would just leave/stop but you should be aware that there is a person / company aiming to destroy the project
01:00:45 <zxwayland> stop*
01:00:52 <strcat> zxwayland: there are people like renlord involved in GrapheneOS development
01:01:11 <zxwayland> oh, who is stopping you guys?
01:01:26 <strcat> zxwayland: not saying they are stopping us but that they are aiming to destroy the project
01:01:32 <zxwayland> i don't know who is renlord
01:01:41 <strcat> one of the other GrapheneOS devs
01:02:01 <zxwayland> not sure why he is a dev
01:02:11 <strcat> I don't understand what you mean
01:02:32 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: renlord is a developer because he showed up to work on it and made substantial contributions to the project.
01:02:33 <strcat> I'm just clarifying that there are other people involved, it's not just me doing it by myself, other people work on it too
01:02:39 <zxwayland> why would a dev of grapheneos destory the project?
01:02:43 <strcat> did not say that
01:02:49 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, no no no, misunderstanding here -
01:03:11 <zxwayland> ohhh
01:03:14 <strcat> zxwayland: I'm saying that there are people aiming to destroy the work we're doing
01:03:27 <strcat> specifically, the CEO / director of the company's former sponsor
01:03:37 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "madaidan.: no - but I'm 100% sur"> I'll try again then
01:03:42 <TheJollyRoger> A long time ago, the project was partnered with someone who initially agreed to sponsor the project, but reneged on his promise and attempted to make a hostile takeover.
01:03:52 <strcat> well I own half the company
01:03:58 <strcat> and the company was sponsoring the project
01:04:02 <strcat> so it's not just that he agreed
01:04:11 <strcat> it was a condition of founding the company and it being involved
01:04:12 <zxwayland> ohh the copperhead os?
01:04:21 <strcat> yes Copperhead is a former sponsor of the project
01:04:31 <strcat> the CEO/director attempted to take over the project and it continued on without them
01:04:32 <zxwayland> didn't know the whole drama
01:04:39 <strcat> this is explained at https://grapheneos.org/#history
01:04:51 <zxwayland> i thought it was just bro fight nerd drama
01:04:53 <strcat> just worth noting that they are aiming to destroy GrapheneOS and he's having a lot of success causing harm
01:05:17 <strcat> zxwayland: he's definitely not a nerd or at all technical - and not a business person either
01:05:49 <madaidan[m]> <zxwayland "i thought it was just bro fight "> The best type of drama
01:05:54 <strcat> zxwayland: he forked the legacy code, pays outsourced devs to do a very incomplete job maintaining/porting and is selling it as a product
01:06:12 <strcat> zxwayland: and he's highly active trying to harm myself, the project and other GrapheneOS developers/contributors
01:06:30 <strcat> zxwayland: so I was just stating that you should be aware that the project is under a serious assault by someone aiming to destroy it
01:06:36 <strcat> through a bunch of different ways of attacking it
01:06:57 <zxwayland> oh no
01:06:58 <strcat> if you are concerned about the longevity of the project, that is the biggest issue, that there is a malicious person doing everything they can to harm us
01:07:09 <zxwayland> i haven't heard anything about this
01:07:11 <strcat> because they want to wipe out the original open source project
01:07:18 <strcat> and have only their proprietary fork of it available as a product
01:07:25 <strcat> it's a problem for them that the original project continues to exist
01:07:28 <strcat> that's why they are doing this
01:07:31 <zxwayland> just heard a youtube say got a pixel phone? just grapheneos instead
01:08:02 <strcat> lately they have had a lot of success causing harm and turning people against us, partly through giving them their proprietary fork of my legacy code as a 'free' gift to test
01:08:17 <strcat> and people think because it's a product from a company it's somehow better than the real thing they poorly ripped off
01:08:17 <zxwayland> it was a privacy adovcate youtuber
01:08:25 <strcat> people who seriously don't understand open source or this project
01:08:32 <zxwayland> oh no
01:08:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:08:38 <zxwayland> sorry to hear about thar
01:08:43 <zxwayland> i love open source
01:08:43 <strcat> but anyway they are doing a lot of damage lately and this is not the only way the project is being attacked
01:08:57 <strcat> they are attacking it in a bunch of different ways right now
01:08:59 <zxwayland> i hate paying for softwarre
01:09:39 <strcat> I can't promise that they aren't going to succeed at ruining everything with their endless attacks, they are extremely malicious, deceitful, manipulative and driven to harm myself and GrapheneOS
01:09:56 <strcat> and lately feels like they are succeeding at fucking things over
01:10:14 <zxwayland> i don't heard anything negative from the old sponser about you guys
01:10:17 <TheJollyRoger> Jeez >_<.
01:10:57 <strcat> but also worth noting I own 50% of that company still
01:11:04 <strcat> and they are certainly not going to succeed at anything
01:11:06 <zxwayland> i can see them being a patent troll
01:11:15 <strcat> they don't have any patents and I own the code
01:11:20 <zxwayland> lol nice
01:11:22 <strcat> if there were patents I would own them
01:11:31 <strcat> I made sure to do everything on the project as an individual
01:11:41 <zxwayland> thats good
01:11:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:11:55 * madaidan[m] uploaded an image: image.png (89KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/SVGqdTyFZgUXQgnvZYBKhjOg >
01:12:03 <madaidan[m]> I though Peter was one of the baddies?
01:12:10 <madaidan[m]>  * I thought Peter was one of the baddies?
01:12:16 <strcat> well he's an anti-security jerk imo
01:12:28 <strcat> that list of people doesn't mean they are on the right side of these issues
01:12:58 <zxwayland> well, i have been using linux for many years. been seeing many forks and unmaintained software support. just a little worry that 1 guy is running grapheneos thats all
01:13:23 <strcat> zxwayland: it's not just me but I certainly do need more help with development - there are other developers involved already though
01:13:26 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "that list of people doesn't mean"> What do you think about that Daniel Micay guy on there? Is he alright?
01:13:33 <strcat> and I need a lot of help defending the project from people aiming to destroy it
01:13:54 <zxwayland> oh
01:14:22 <zxwayland> sorry to hear
01:15:09 <zxwayland> unfortunately, i don't think any or many privacy advocate know about this project is getting attcked
01:16:01 <strcat> zxwayland: well unfortunately some of them are siding with the proprietary fork and helping to cause harm
01:16:01 <madaidan[m]> It's too hard to find kernel devs shitting on the kernel :(
01:16:15 <zxwayland> I just want to use a de-google privacy OS on the pixel phone
01:16:26 <strcat> madaidan[m]: it's more that they were telling security people to fuck off cause security is not part of linux
01:16:57 <strcat> trying to argue that they are misguided for doing something intractable
01:17:05 <madaidan[m]> I can only find Torvalds being pissy about that
01:17:21 <strcat> linus isn't as bad as some of the others
01:17:23 <strcat> at all
01:18:25 <strcat> madaidan[m]: and the issue with linus is more an issue with other people - not challenging him when he's wrong
01:18:39 <strcat> madaidan[m]: but w/e
01:18:55 <strcat> I've stopped being involved upstream and we haven't really started redoing the kind of work we did before on it downstream
01:18:57 <strcat> need help for that
01:19:42 <zxwayland> sorry, i am not a coder. i tried writing code. but its not for me. i hate it when i have to write exactly the code
01:20:20 <zxwayland> i am not an introvert too. I am an extrovert. I like working and being with people
01:21:16 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: that's actually something we might have a use for if you like talking to and working with people. We need people (which I call "elves") to defend against trolls and misinformation.
01:22:15 <TheJollyRoger> Which is actually a great way to help and contribute to GrapheneOS.
01:22:25 <seaclown> lol, I like working too but am definitely not extroverted
01:22:40 <zxwayland> according to MBTI, (Myers–Briggs Type Indicator) - My personality type is an ENFP. I get along with every personality type. Or I can adjust to it. I am good at reading people and working the computer nerds too
01:23:04 <zxwayland> I can do good at social engineering too
01:23:06 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "need help for that"> I really like kernel hardening stuff and wanna help with that. Idk if I'm skilled enough yet though.
01:23:54 <madaidan[m]> <zxwayland "i am not an introvert too. I am "> Join the anti-social club
01:24:32 <zxwayland> lol
01:25:12 <zxwayland> I can give a good persuasive speech too
01:25:34 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: interested in becoming an elf? I can get you some reading material.
01:25:50 <zxwayland> ah not sure what I can do.
01:25:56 <zxwayland> I can write a blog lol
01:26:44 <TheJollyRoger> Simple: Elves fight trolls. Ideally, you'll want to hang around privacy circles, places where tech or privacy technology is discussed, and if you see a troll, to ensure their FUD gets /countered./
01:27:11 <zxwayland> fear, uncertainty and doubt?
01:27:44 <zxwayland> but people write those unproven troll messages all the time on message boards
01:27:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, FUD is Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. Or, if they're giving out FAO (False Assurances and Overpromising), to counter that -- both of those -- with truth.
01:28:21 <zxwayland> have you heard of the youtube "The Hated One"?
01:28:38 <zxwayland> i was following him and any Edward Snowen youtube videos about him
01:28:39 <TheJollyRoger> I haven't.
01:29:25 <zxwayland> i mean snowen videos about his talks
01:29:27 <madaidan[m]> <zxwayland "have you heard of the youtube "T"> He spreads misinformation himself sometimes
01:30:05 <zxwayland> oh, i wasn't sure. I know he is very bias. he is very pro privacy for the digital age
01:30:07 <madaidan[m]> Everytime someone recommends Purism garbage as private/secure, a part of me dies inside.
01:30:18 * TheJollyRoger pretends to vomit over the railing.
01:30:27 <TheJollyRoger> Same here.
01:30:39 <qyo3462572445[m]> <madaidan[m] "Everytime someone recommends Pur"> But but but...librem 5!
01:31:00 <zxwayland> ohhh, whats so bad about them?
01:31:15 <zxwayland> I heard about the Liberm smartphones and the Librem laptops
01:31:21 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: would you like the full story or my cliff notes?
01:31:27 <madaidan[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "But but but...librem 5!"> Everyone knows un-updateable firmware is insanely secure
01:31:28 <zxwayland> seems like a lot of money. when you can do the software yourself for free
01:31:49 <madaidan[m]> <zxwayland "ohhh, whats so bad about them?"> They're overpriced security/privacy theater with nothing meaningful
01:32:07 <zxwayland> when i saw a librem laptop on youtube. it just looks like a Linux Gnome desktop. nothing special
01:32:12 <madaidan[m]> The Librem 5 is a massive degradation from any standard Android/iOS device
01:32:15 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: the long story short is that they're selling an insecure device that's being falsely marketed as "open source" even though nothing is, they've essentially gamed the definitions of "free hardware" by simply fusing the blobs into read-only memory that the host has no control over.
01:32:34 <zxwayland> oh
01:32:38 <strcat> you could prevent updating the entire OS
01:32:41 <zxwayland> you mean onto the RAM?
01:32:45 <strcat> and then it complies to the rules they follow
01:32:48 <qyo3462572445[m]> <madaidan[m] "Everyone knows un-updateable fir"> And its fully.open source. Hardware and software. Plus...the hardware switches are changing the world.
01:32:51 <TheJollyRoger> Essentially, they've paradoxically managed to create an inherently broken by design device that's less open, less secure, and less private than Android phones.
01:33:06 <madaidan[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "And its fully.open source. Hardw"> Ah yes the open source ARM SoC
01:33:08 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: sarcastic or not?
01:33:11 <madaidan[m]> Brilliant innovation
01:33:18 <strcat> qyo3462572445[m]: it is NOT open source - neither the hardware or firmware is open source, that's misinformation
01:33:21 <madaidan[m]> <TheJollyRoger "qyo3462572445: sarcastic or not?"> Sarcastic
01:33:37 <qyo3462572445[m]> Sorry! I'm being sarcastic. I should a put that.
01:33:44 <strcat> was not obvious at all
01:33:48 <strcat> sorry
01:33:52 <TheJollyRoger> X3 Got it.
01:33:58 <qyo3462572445[m]> I forgot sarcasm doesn't do well online
01:34:03 <madaidan[m]> Use /s for non-obvious sarcasm
01:34:48 <qyo3462572445[m]> <madaidan[m] "Use /s for non-obvious sarcasm"> Sorry new to matrix. when I put a "/" a bunch of options come up
01:34:53 <TheJollyRoger> Ehehehe. For sarcasm, I like to use something like: "<sarcasm>Oh yeah definitely I agree totally</sarcasm>" or just "/s" as an emoticon, but I like to use the HTML-like parsing since it's easier to make certain parts of my line sarcastic.
01:35:23 <madaidan[m]> u CaN aLsO uSe ThIs!11!!!
01:36:06 <analog[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ehehehe. For sarcasm, I like to "> <sarcasm>wow, you're very creative</sarcasm>
01:36:14 <TheJollyRoger> Mwahahahaha XD
01:36:43 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: ah! I like to put it afterward, like this:
01:36:45 <qyo3462572445[m]> That's my mistake. Yes, I know the whole "its all open source " is FUD from them. Plus way over priced either way for what they are selling
01:36:47 <madaidan[m]> I've been looking for these Linux anti-security quotes for over an hour now.
01:36:48 <TheJollyRoger> This is the best post ever made /s.
01:36:51 <strcat> also worth noting I'm having a really rough day / week from people falling for an obvious scam
01:36:57 <strcat> and backing it
01:37:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... :(
01:37:13 <TheJollyRoger> It's ok man. You've got a right to be upset :(.
01:37:37 <analog[m]> the one time XML is better than S Expressions
01:41:28 <madaidan[m]> TheJollyRoger: Agreed
01:41:48 <madaidan[m]> James is a prick
01:42:00 <strcat> madaidan[m]: I read through tons of the discussions so I see them regularly doing this kind of thing - but yeah it has only been a few times they did that specifically
01:42:08 <strcat> i.e. telling people it's hopeless and they are misguided to try
01:42:20 <strcat> it's hard to find something like that from searching
01:42:24 <strcat> don't know the exact words used
01:42:42 <strcat> and there are tens of thousands of these discussions about security stuff where they push back
01:43:21 <madaidan[m]> Can you recall vaguely what one of the threads were about?
01:43:26 <strcat> no
01:45:01 <violadivias> anyone know if @Morpheus______ is on freenode?
01:47:05 <madaidan[m]> I give up searching for now
01:47:34 <madaidan[m]> I just keep finding the same "lInUx Ez UnHaKaBlE" tech news article bullshit
01:47:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
01:48:07 <JTL> What a bunch of fools
01:48:41 <madaidan[m]> lmao https://thehackernews.com/2015/09/linux-secure-operating-system.html
01:48:55 <madaidan[m]> Who would even ask that
01:49:12 <madaidan[m]> Ohhhhh
01:49:19 <madaidan[m]> They're calling seL4 a linux kernel
01:49:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <madaidan[m] "Everyone knows un-updateable fir"> Saw someone claiming today that the imx8mq can be flashed via USB-C in USB download mode, without opening it up, but I've yet to find a procedure/any discussion about this.
01:49:27 <madaidan[m]> That makes more sense but is just as retarded
01:49:30 <analog[m]> <madaidan[m] "Ohhhhh"> Shipp
01:49:57 <renlord> i am renlord
01:50:01 <renlord> lol
01:50:36 <JTL> DannyWorkOrderPr: That doesn't surprise me at all. And if all else fails, chip off.
01:50:39 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "i am renlord"> Thanks, your name wasn't clear enough for me
01:50:39 <qyo3462572445[m]> <madaidan[m] "I just keep finding the same "lI"> In all reality though, for the average person who doesn't want to use windows (I just don't like it) is macOS the only decently secure option then right now? I do like Linux a lot. The usability is wonderful in my opinion.
01:51:14 <analog[m]> qyo3462572445 MacOS is a good option for the average person
01:51:24 <analog[m]> Chromebooks are good too if you don't care about privacy
01:51:33 <madaidan[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "In all reality though, for the a"> There's also ChromeOS and mobile OSes.
01:51:40 <strcat> madaidan[m]: seL4 is not even *nix
01:51:46 <strcat> it doesn't implement that stuff
01:51:51 <strcat> you can implement it in userspace like other things
01:51:59 <madaidan[m]> Mobile has a far superior security model than desktop
01:52:02 <strcat> but it doesn't have an implementation aside from running a linux VM on top of it
01:52:21 <qyo3462572445[m]> <analog[m] "Chromebooks are good too if you "> Ahh but I do lol if I didn't care about privacy I wouldnt be on grapheneos
01:52:26 <renlord> madaidan[m]: lol, you're a cheeky one
01:52:28 <zxwayland> sorry, i was mopping the floor
01:53:05 <renlord> how is sel4 a linux kernel
01:53:10 <strcat> this is a TheJollyRoger facepalm moment: seL4 implementation of POSIX is running a linux kernel on top of it, with none of the security advantages for that
01:53:14 <strcat> renlord: lol it isn't at all
01:53:19 <strcat> renlord: it's not even a *nix kernel
01:53:21 <renlord> when its a fkin microkernel and is based off a completely different design
01:53:23 <strcat> it has no implementation of POSIX
01:53:30 <hitchhooker[m]> anybody knows is dockerfile oci, v2s2 or v2s1 in podman format?
01:53:35 <strcat> it takes a totally diff approach and has a totally diff non-POSIX API
01:53:37 <renlord> sad life really
01:53:51 <strcat> the 'official' way to get POSIX with it is using a Linux kernel as a userspace process
01:53:56 <TheJollyRoger> strcat... woah woah wait are you... are you...
01:53:59 <TheJollyRoger> are you kidding!?
01:54:01 <TheJollyRoger> Like...
01:54:02 <zxwayland> i thought renlord is an evil do-er from an anime
01:54:04 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "how is sel4 a linux kernel"> Tech news articles should be burned
01:54:07 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: no lol
01:54:11 <renlord> probably more right calling barrelfish sel4
01:54:13 <TheJollyRoger> They went through the trouble of...
01:54:15 <TheJollyRoger> of...
01:54:16 <renlord> but its not either
01:54:28 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: I mean seL4 can be used directly
01:54:37 <strcat> but running a linux kernel on top of it as they want people to do is so weird
01:54:41 <strcat> and I don't see how that helps anything
01:54:45 <TheJollyRoger> of designing a "Formally Verified" Microkernel and hardware abstraction and... and... and... and then just threw an entire Linux Kernel into it?
01:54:47 <strcat> the linux kernel has the same local / remote attack surface
01:54:56 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: for that use yeah lol
01:55:01 <TheJollyRoger> O_O
01:55:03 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: not into it
01:55:05 <strcat> on top of it
01:55:10 <renlord> gernot heiser bitches about it everyday -- running linux on top of it
01:55:11 <TheJollyRoger> Oh cripes that's even worse.
01:55:26 <TheJollyRoger> Well.
01:55:28 <strcat> the linux kernel is properly isolated from other non-linux related things
01:55:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ok... maybe er...
01:55:33 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe better out than in.
01:55:33 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
01:55:34 <strcat> non-linux-related*
01:55:35 <TheJollyRoger> OH WHEW.
01:55:40 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: but your entire linux-based OS
01:55:41 <zxwayland> hey, when i flash install grapheneos, do i need to use a vpn on it? do you guys use password managers? i have never used a password manager before
01:55:46 <strcat> is just linux running on top of it
01:55:48 <strcat> basically in a VM
01:55:58 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: so the approach to implementing POSIX is basically running a Linux VM on top of it
01:56:01 <strcat> that's all I'm saying lol
01:56:11 <renlord> crazy people blame sel4 when the linux on top of it breaks
01:56:14 <renlord> lol
01:56:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat "zxwayland: other people are free"> Many of us are =D It's happening!

01:58:49 <TheJollyRoger> Hey zxwayland, you won't need a vpn for running GrapheneOS at all. I don't use a VPN at all. If you like offline password managers like I do, try KeePassDroid, which will work with KeePass2.
01:58:50 <madaidan[m]> Broken for me too
01:58:52 <analog[m]> their SSL expired2 days ago
01:58:54 <analog[m]> yeah
01:58:55 <hitchhooker[m]> expired cert
01:58:55 <zxwayland> ohhh
01:59:13 <strcat> luckily they don't use hsts so I can bypass the error without looking up the current hsts bypass? :(
01:59:27 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: I'm getting an expired certificate error.
01:59:39 <madaidan[m]> Reminds me of when Manjaro recommended everyone to set their clocks back to fix their expired cert
01:59:39 <renlord> could always just curl --insecure
01:59:47 <renlord> madaidan[m]: wtf really?
02:00:08 <analog[m]> renlord Yes.
02:00:15 <JTL> renlord: Yes that's true

02:01:34 * TheJollyRoger gasps.
02:01:39 <renlord> hsts comes across as very weird to me
02:01:45 <madaidan[m]> They tried to hide it after so you need wayback
02:01:45 <strcat> secret way of bypassing hsts
02:01:56 <strcat> renlord: why
02:02:08 <strcat> basically what hsts does it ENFORCES valid TLS
02:02:15 <renlord> you gotta pin the certs with major browser vendors
02:02:19 <strcat> the header way has browser cache it
02:02:22 <renlord> why not just use the DANE approach
02:02:26 <strcat> renlord: HSTS isn't pinning
02:02:27 <renlord> its more generic and robust
02:02:35 <zxwayland> TheJollyRoger, what was it that you wanted me to read about?
02:02:38 <strcat> HSTS is just 'must use valid TLS'
02:02:44 <strcat> it disables bypassing warnings as part of that
02:02:57 <JTL> I'm still sad about HPKP being gone, and TACK wasn't more than just a proposal
02:03:00 <strcat> there is an HSTS preload list rather than relying on the caches
02:03:20 <renlord> doesnt it also stop rogue CAs from spoofing certs?
02:03:24 <strcat> renlord: no
02:03:29 <strcat> HSTS just enforces valid TLS
02:03:46 <strcat> do `curl -v https://grapheneos.org/ >/dev/null`
02:03:55 <strcat> < strict-transport-security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
02:03:58 <strcat> this is HSTS

02:04:30 <strcat> which browsers dropped, but I still use it
02:04:32 <JTL> RIP HPKP :(
02:04:41 <strcat> I don't bother pinning leaf keys though - since it doesn't do anything anyway

02:05:09 <strcat> I just enforce that the Let's Encrypt immediate or backup intermediate is used - or the ISRG root, which is their new root
02:05:24 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: thanks
02:05:38 <JTL> It wasn't perfect but I feel the ability of being able to prevent an MITM (pinning) and being able to detect it during/after the fact (Expect-CT) is being conflated as the same by some people
02:05:38 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: the way it does quotes when posting on irc confuses me
02:06:04 <strcat> JTL: soon expect-ct won't really do anything since CT is just mandatory for all certs now
02:06:10 <strcat> and the old certs will expire
02:06:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You've built something beautiful here, man.
02:06:20 <JTL> right, same concept when referring to just CT though
02:06:22 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, it's been fucking me pretty hard recently, hahaha...might have to use both Matrix&IRC soon.
02:06:22 <strcat> I don't know how long it will take before the old ones expire
02:06:31 <strcat> JTL: yeah expect-ct is just a bit odd
02:06:36 <JTL> Agreed
02:06:37 <strcat> since it has a limited time where it will do anything
02:06:45 <JTL> Exactly my thought
02:06:49 <strcat> I'm surprised they made it
02:06:53 <strcat> I mean
02:06:54 <JTL> Me to
02:06:55 <strcat> afaik
02:06:59 <strcat> CT is almost already hard enforced
02:07:09 <strcat> it's enforced for all new certs - ofc a malicious person can backdate one
02:07:15 <strcat> but the date when that won't be possible is approaching
02:07:15 <JTL> I know it was mandatory for EV certificates at some point
02:07:20 <JTL> Those were of dubious value though
02:07:20 <strcat> because there's a limited max lifetime for certs
02:07:32 <strcat> and there's an issue date where they require CT
02:07:39 <strcat> so after a certain point CT is mandatory for all certs
02:07:44 <strcat> and can't be bypassed by backdating
02:07:45 <JTL> Right
02:08:18 <strcat> an interesting thing about EV certs is they tend to make OCSP enforced
02:08:33 <JTL> Knew that
02:08:48 <strcat> I set Must-Staple but it barely does anything
02:08:59 <strcat> cause it just enforces that the server staples proof it isn't revoked
02:09:02 <strcat> and the proofs last ~1 week
02:09:18 <strcat> it Must-Staple EMULATES having 1 week cert lifetime
02:09:33 <strcat> it would be superior to just use 1 week lifetime certs since wouldn't require Must-Staple support
02:09:48 <JTL> ^
02:09:49 <strcat> JTL: nginx and apache have broken OCSP stapling
02:09:55 <JTL> I'm aware
02:09:57 <strcat> it's POSSIBLE to work around it with nginx
02:10:01 <strcat> via referencing file
02:10:03 <strcat> and using script
02:10:05 <strcat> which is what I do
02:10:12 <strcat> script fetches, validates and stores OCSP response
02:10:27 <strcat> and uses the update time to figure out when it should get a new one
02:10:46 <strcat> https://github.com/tomwassenberg/certbot-ocsp-fetcher
02:10:47 <strcat> useful script
02:11:18 <strcat> so you use a cronjob / systemd timer unit + the certbot hook
02:11:29 <strcat> so certbot runs it before it reloads the server after deploying new certs
02:11:33 <strcat> and then it updates it regularly too
02:12:07 <JTL> Neat
02:12:25 <zxwayland> TheJollyRoger, i was waiting for some link
02:13:27 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: oh, no I don't have it yet, I'd have to go and dig up some stuff and then pile it into another knowledge base, but I do have some twitter links for you in my old knowledge base file...

02:26:07 <sea2clowns> thank you TJR
02:27:13 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, ye be welcome.
02:28:58 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy bseeinu[m], my number one and number two and number three picks would be GrapheneOS and Auditor and Vanadium, respectively! But since that's very obvious, I'll move to my next three: after that comes Signal, which is an app I really can't live without, since I use it for just about everything ranging from being able to cheat on long distance phone call bills, to discussing my Very
02:29:00 <TheJollyRoger> Confidential business.
02:31:48 <qyo3462572445[m]> I was able to get almost my whole family and circle of friends on signal. I'm actually impressed.
02:32:21 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr~
02:33:04 <qyo3462572445[m]> Although I do hope something good comes about with Session
02:34:30 <bseeinu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ahoy bseeinu, my number one and "> Same, 90% of friends and family moved to Signal. I tried to play with Auditor after your advice ;)
02:34:52 <bseeinu[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "Although I do hope something goo"> What could be better about Session?
02:35:07 <bseeinu[m]> I ended up using Bromite over Vanadium
02:35:57 <qyo3462572445[m]> <bseeinu[m] "What could be better about Sessi"> No phone number. Not that I mind using a phone number for my friends and family, having the option of NOT having to use one would I nice. I know its an ongoing topic about Signal moving in that direction though.
02:36:42 <bseeinu[m]> I'd prefer that too
02:38:28 <bseeinu[m]> Any quirky little projects to check out on FDroid? (I'm bored if you didn't notice)
02:40:21 <TheJollyRoger> bseeinu[m]: whoops, sorry, I left you hanging there!
02:40:25 <TheJollyRoger> I think my second one is OpenCamera!
02:40:32 <TheJollyRoger> That's one I DEFINITELY find myself using all the time!
02:41:26 <TheJollyRoger> If you have a Pixel 3, Turn on the "Camera2" API and watch the colours of your photos *explode* or you can even try the "Pano" function in conjunction with it, and you'll get some amazing results.
02:48:50 <bseeinu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If you have a Pixel 3, Turn on t">  I actually installed the latest beta yesterday and there's a couple new options in "Processing". It also finally stopped giving me " Serious error" when switching cameras
02:48:58 <TheJollyRoger> Oh fantastic!
02:49:28 <TheJollyRoger> One more you might like... and this one come as a matched pair...
02:49:35 <TheJollyRoger> *these two comes a matched pair...
02:50:06 <bseeinu[m]> Noise reduction algorhithm
02:50:21 <TheJollyRoger> I'm a tad bit old fashioned, and I recieve a lot of encrypted E-mails, but I have a Yubikey so I just use K9 Mail and OpenKeyChain.
02:50:23 <bseeinu[m]> And Edge reduction algorhithm
02:50:42 <TheJollyRoger> This makes reading of encrypted E-mails a lot easier.
02:50:58 <TheJollyRoger> (I also have a number of smartcards, which I make myself out of J3H145DI cards, they work with GrapheneOS)
02:50:58 <bseeinu[m]> Interesting!
02:51:30 <TheJollyRoger> Something else... let's see...
02:51:31 <bseeinu[m]> As yubikeis alternatives?or other stuff
02:51:44 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I'm a tad bit old fashioned, and"> I wish I used email more to get pgp encrypted email from people. Usually I just use open keychain for tinkering around
02:52:32 <TheJollyRoger> As GPG smartcards. Although GPG is not something I recommend other people take up if they haven't already, for those who are already stuck on it, due to network effect like I am, that's what I use.
02:52:59 <JTL> I think that's a fair assessment
02:53:32 <bseeinu[m]> Love the honesty of that
02:53:36 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: righteous! You should definitely check out age and signify though, if you're not in the habit of using E-mail. I think E-mail unfortunately can't be fixed as it is, and it's best to instead try to focus on getting onto secure and more faster-moving alternatives, than trying to fix E-mail.
02:53:36 <bseeinu[m]> :)
02:54:41 <TheJollyRoger> bseeinu[m]: Yubikeys are tiny little security tokens, they do the encryption and decryption on behalf of the host. Unfortunately, they're not without shortcomings.
02:54:51 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "qyo3462572445: righteous! You sh"> Agreed. I just kinda like the nostalgia of it I guess? And I'm sorry... Age and Signify?
02:55:52 <TheJollyRoger> The main problem is that you need to generate the secret keys on a computer, and this means you need to trust the computer in order to have a backup, or you can take a leap of faith on the token (and hope that its RNG isn't busted... which very often, it will be because the RNG on the token is often NOT anywhere near the quality of the RNG on a computer)
02:56:06 <TheJollyRoger> but then you won't have a backup.
02:56:31 <TheJollyRoger> There are tokens that don't suffer this limitation, like the Trezor Model T, but that requires a slightly different workflow.
02:57:25 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m], age and siginfy are two new encryption and signing utilities that are specifically designed to address some problems inherent to GPG.
02:57:55 <TheJollyRoger> age stands for "Actually Good Encryption" and it uses AES in Galois Counter Mode, so it's an authenticated mode of encryption, unlike GPG, which uses CFB mode, which is unauthenticated.
02:58:21 <TheJollyRoger> (GCM, or Galois Counter Mode was not invented at the time the PGP standard was written and updated.)
02:58:48 <qyo3462572445[m]> Ohh interesting. I'll take a look into them. Sounds pretty neat. Always on the look out for using and learning something new
02:59:07 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, age and signify are really great for doing one thing and doing it very well.
02:59:15 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, age allows you to encrypt to an SSH key.
02:59:36 <TheJollyRoger> So I have a small script I call "Backurypt" which actually has displaced GPG in taking backups for my systems.
02:59:51 <TheJollyRoger> It's not ready for public release yet.
03:00:12 <JTL> Backwardsrypt
03:00:22 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahaha XD
03:00:48 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "For instance, age allows you to "> And this encrypts the private key?
03:00:52 <TheJollyRoger> But long story short, what I can do is generate an ed25519 SSH key, then actually copy it out onto a sheet of paper since the private key is only about 5 lines of characters long, or put it on a USB drive.
03:01:12 <TheJollyRoger> Then I can keep that private key on the shelf, and then encrypt my backups to it.
03:01:20 <TheJollyRoger> And put them in a cloud server.
03:01:41 <TheJollyRoger> With the full confidence that short of ed25519 being broken, they'll be as hard to access as that private key stored on the shelf.
03:02:12 <TheJollyRoger> Because it's an authenticated mode of encryption, this also means that someone can't modify the backups.
03:02:22 <TheJollyRoger> No passwords needed.
03:02:27 <TheJollyRoger> No passwords to leak or be compromised.
03:02:43 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "And put them in a cloud server."> That's where my backups fall short. I need to find an easy, trust worthy, secure way to back up mine, and family's data, securely off site.
03:02:46 <TheJollyRoger> And if worst comes to worst? I have a private key on the shelf in paper and ink.
03:03:07 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: with age, it's staring you right in the face.
03:03:22 <TheJollyRoger> Because the backups would be encrypted with a key that the provider doesn't have.
03:03:50 <bseeinu[m]> Is there any way to actually remove icon labels on home screen? (Sorry, I was actually looking for a couple yubikeys I had around in a bin
03:03:51 <TheJollyRoger> The only thing that needs to remain on the system that's being backed up is the certificate.
03:03:56 <TheJollyRoger> Which can be made publicly available.
03:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> bseeinu[m]: I'm not sure. I don't tweak around with the labels and appearance.
03:05:10 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "qyo3462572445: with age, it's st"> I will have to really dive deeper into this. Thanks for the info! Is it as easy to get set up as ssh keys or pgp keys?
03:05:16 <bseeinu[m]> I know it's silly but coming from iOS it's driving me insane to see all those truncated app names
03:05:20 <TheJollyRoger> It's as easy to set up as ssh keys.
03:05:27 <bseeinu[m]> 🧑
03:05:41 <TheJollyRoger> bseeinu[m]: oh, you mean like how it goes "MyApp..." ?
03:05:56 <bseeinu[m]> Yeah
03:05:58 <qyo3462572445[m]> Sweet! I know what my weekend project will be.
03:06:01 <TheJollyRoger> AH!
03:06:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah I dunno how to deal with that, I hadn't thought of it :P.
03:06:16 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: fantastic ^_^.
03:06:25 <bseeinu[m]> Such poor spacing and design for the layout, no matter the font size
03:06:49 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: As always, you should test the backup to ensure you can properly decrypt it. Otherwise you've essentially ransomwared yourself!
03:07:09 <JTL> Ahahaha
03:07:11 <JTL> Good one
03:07:40 <TheJollyRoger> But, yes, once every so often what I will do is essentially just back up my entire home drive all at once:
03:07:55 <TheJollyRoger> https://jollyrogers.ca/public/backurypt.txt This is NOT ready for public release, it doesn't work, so don't use it yet,
03:08:00 <TheJollyRoger> but it's what I've been working on.
03:08:13 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "qyo3462572445: As always, you sh"> Of course. That would not be good. The other thing I need to worry about is allowing my family to gain access to said back ups easily and in a not too technical way, in case something happens to me.
03:09:12 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah. Yeah that's the tricky part!
03:09:55 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "https://jollyrogers.ca/public/ba"> Cool! Thanks for this info.
03:10:22 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome! Just don't use it yet, that script is NOT production ready and I've not actually tested it, it's just been uploaded there as a snapshot of what it looked like at the time.
03:10:36 <TheJollyRoger> But you can see what the command structure looks like.
03:10:49 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Oh yeah. Yeah that's the tricky "> Yea. I've been thinking about making videos of what to do and how to do it, and just putting it on a flash drive for them.
03:11:04 <TheJollyRoger> The threat model for Backurypt is that if someone compromises your PC, they may get your files that you have now... but they won't get the keys to the files you had in the past.
03:11:24 <TheJollyRoger> At least, provided you keep your Backurypt keys offline.
03:11:42 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You're welcome! Just don't use i"> All good! I rather dive deeper into it before i start doing anything.  So that will give me an idea of what's going on.
03:11:46 <brenneke[m]> Just installed Bromite, is there any way to get bookmarks from Vanadium?
03:11:50 <TheJollyRoger> That would probably be best, as well as possibly copies of the executables and such.
03:12:06 <TheJollyRoger> I have a funny story about backups actually... I think this channel's heard it before but I don't know if you've heard the infamous "LaserDisk" story?
03:13:31 <TheJollyRoger> Well, a while back, I did some work (unrelated to computers) for a client that had state of the art backup archival. They had this special data vault where all the blueprints were stored and everything in this climate controlled area.
03:13:35 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "That would probably be best, as "> Besides I'm not there yet. I wrote my first bash scrip recently to turn on WiFi and connect to my WiFi. That's about the extent of my scripting knowledge right now but I'm working on it.
03:14:05 <TheJollyRoger> The only problem was... that "state of the art" was state of the art for about forty years ago.
03:14:14 <TheJollyRoger> It was stored on Laserdisks.
03:14:19 <TheJollyRoger> Which are now obsolete.
03:15:06 <JTL> Ought to check every 5 or so years at least...
03:15:09 <JTL> Jeebus
03:15:09 <TheJollyRoger> Toshiba hasn't produced LaserDisk players for generations now.
03:15:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
03:15:54 <TheJollyRoger> The thing that saved us from having to send a field technician out to slowly and painfully map every little corner, nook and cranny on a sketch with a measuring tape, and guesstimate the locations of the pipes and such...?
03:15:57 <TheJollyRoger> Microfilms.
03:16:08 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "It was stored on Laserdisks."> I dont I've seen a lazer disk in 25 years.
03:16:25 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I think all that stuff may have been before our time.
03:16:52 <TheJollyRoger> But we were lucky. Forty years ago when they sealed that vault away, someone had the bright idea to save copies of the originals on a series of microslides.
03:17:04 <TheJollyRoger> And small little archival films.
03:18:31 <brenneke[m]> <brenneke[m] "Just installed Bromite, is there"> Seems a little backwards to not be able to export bookmarks, did I miss it?
03:18:42 <qyo3462572445[m]> That's crazy. Someone was thinking ahead for the next person. Don't see that happen often. Usually is "eh, in won't be here in 40 years not my problem"
03:18:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:20:21 <TheJollyRoger> This is really rare though; most engineering consulting companies instead keep their originals drawn on a vellum-like acid free paper, because of precisely this risk, the risk of losing the originals.
03:21:06 <TheJollyRoger> It's really really rare that you'll have drawings stored in miniature, but for places like automotive industries or OEMs, it does happen because sometimes to do that would require too much space or be too inconvenient.
03:21:17 <TheJollyRoger> Or sometimes, the originals get lost or destroyed in a fire.
03:21:41 <TheJollyRoger> So even paper needs to be backed up.
03:21:48 <qyo3462572445[m]> I would think now its all scanned backed up to "the cloud" or something
03:21:56 <TheJollyRoger> Aaargh X( Yeah....
03:22:42 <JTL> On one hand CD/DVD-R and USB drives has existed for ~20 years, the other concern is the durability of the format over time
03:22:43 <JTL> :p
03:22:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(
03:22:55 <qyo3462572445[m]> Which is probably left on a publicly accessible server with no password
03:23:10 <TheJollyRoger> No kidding though, I'm pretty sure "loss of the original vellums" was probably the reason why we were digging into some data vault that hadn't been opened in 40 years.
03:23:25 <JTL> qyo3462572445[m]: An Amazon S3 bucket open to anyone with an AWS account?
03:23:27 <JTL> Too soon
03:23:28 <TheJollyRoger> Since those vellums are actually considered legal documents.
03:23:33 <TheJollyRoger> OH GOD X(
03:23:55 <TheJollyRoger> If say, I design you a bridge, and I put my CET's stamp on it, and sign it, that is now a legal and binding document.
03:24:11 <TheJollyRoger> And if that bridge collapses I could get in serious trouble :P.
03:24:23 <qyo3462572445[m]> <JTL "Too soon"> You say "too soon" but when it happens every few days.. Is there ever really a "right time"? Lol
03:25:52 <JTL> Indeed
03:26:13 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: if you want to know though the most durable and practical backup mechanism I've ever seen though, short of hammering the letters onto a sheet of metal...
03:26:17 <TheJollyRoger> It's probably going to be microfilms.
03:27:58 <TheJollyRoger> Film these days is made from a kind of polyester-tetrephalate film base, not like Nitrate like you've probably seen in Inglorious Basterds.
03:28:18 <TheJollyRoger> It's very strong.
03:28:29 <JTL> > like you've probably seen in Inglorious Basterds.
03:28:31 <JTL> Ahahaha
03:28:34 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Film these days is made from a k"> I can't say I've ever seen that movie at all
03:28:57 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, ahahahaha. Well... uh... not sure if I should spoil it but the extreme flammability of old nitrate film was a plot device in that movie.
03:29:17 <TheJollyRoger> Nitrate based filmstock is essentially extruded, flattened dynamite.
03:29:47 <qyo3462572445[m]> I've always meant to see it. just never have.
03:29:56 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Nitrate based filmstock is essen"> Oh wow
03:30:37 <TheJollyRoger> The tiniest little ember will set nitrate film up in a flash, it's almost explosively combustible. This is why cinema fires could be so deadly before the invention of safety film, and even afterwards, because nitrate film offered superior clarity compared to something like the older, earlier acetate film.
03:31:10 <brenneke[m]> Anyone know the location of Vanadium bookmarks?
03:31:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hi brenneke[m], I think it might be in per-app storage. Let me see if it can be exported.
03:32:24 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. Dunno if they can be moved outside the app. I'll have to do more digging later.
03:33:43 <brenneke[m]> Wow.....even Naked Browser has bookmarks export and import!
03:33:46 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: but, because polyester tetrephalate film base is very durable, won't rot, and can be quite easily transcribed, and large amounts of data can be transcribed to it all at the same time, this is why I like it as a backup medium, but it's not waterproof.
03:34:17 <qyo3462572445[m]> I never knew that about old film. Makes sense why you always heard about big theater fires way back when
03:35:07 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:35:38 <TheJollyRoger> This is precisely the reason why. Back then in those days as well in order to generate the white light for the cameras, they usually used carbon arc lamps.
03:35:53 <TheJollyRoger> So this meant they had the film whirring past a carbon arc.
03:35:59 <TheJollyRoger> If that film jammed...
03:36:33 <qyo3462572445[m]> Sounds like a recipe for disaster
03:36:38 <TheJollyRoger> Then suddenly you'd have the camera feeding flattened, extruded, solidified nitro into a lamp that makes its light by using a current of electricity to vaporize carbon.
03:37:41 <TheJollyRoger> Er, sorry, not the camera, the projector
03:37:50 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, the light for the projectors :P.
03:37:55 <TheJollyRoger> (it's late :P)
03:39:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Want to hear more about your smartcard implementation, either here or elsewhere, TheJollyRoger
03:39:49 <TheJollyRoger> Oh it's nothing special. I just use ANSSI SmartPGP and then compile it using GlobalPlatformPro and the Oracle JCard libraries and load it onto a smartcard.
03:40:03 <TheJollyRoger> Which you can buy from most retailers online or even Alibaba.
03:41:03 <TheJollyRoger> They're nothing special and in all honesty if you need security and robust backups for your private keys, you're better off a Trezor Model T.
03:41:10 <TheJollyRoger> *off buying
03:41:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I've been eyeing them for some time, as a Thinkpad user. I'm not happy with trusting the implementation of pretty much any of those USB keys, as they've all been found to have issues.
03:41:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Trezor may actually be the one that i haven't seen anything on
03:42:46 <TheJollyRoger> Well... they're more meant for using Bitcoin. I bought mine because I was interested in using it to replace my aging smartcards and Yubikeys which I have in service now.
03:42:53 <TheJollyRoger> (Again, and also for my book)
03:43:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Solo Keys/Nitrokey has piqued my interest, but I don't know enough to audit their implementations
03:44:09 <TheJollyRoger> They're essentially a BasicCard or JavaCard on an open source card reader.
03:44:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Although I'm seeing Nitrokey has been independently audited by Cure53
03:45:01 <TheJollyRoger> So to analogize, Nitrokey is about as open source as running Linux Mint with "contrib non-free" added.
03:45:08 <TheJollyRoger> in a Windows VM.
03:45:16 <TheJollyRoger> *In a VM running on Windows.
03:45:37 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. Did you read the audit itself? :)
03:45:46 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Ooh tellme
03:46:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <TheJollyRoger "Heh. Did you read the audit itse"> Actually am right now - looking at all the vulns they found, and were then fixed
03:46:36 <brenneke[m]> Looks like bookmarks can be had from Bromite (albeit in a clunky way) bit not Vanadium. Why bother with Vanadium on GrapheneOS when Bromite half a step better?
03:47:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Vanadium more secure, from my understanding, and you don't have to trust a 3rd party to have basic smartphone functionality
03:47:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I run both.
03:47:17 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: for the same reason we bother with airbags in a car.
03:47:29 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <DannyWorkOrderPr "I run both."> For different things.
03:47:29 <TheJollyRoger> And seatbelts.
03:47:58 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium takes advantage of and utilizes the sandboxing and memory safety improvements and exploit mitigations specific to GrapheneOS.
03:48:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> ^scribble this down somewhere for an FAQ
03:48:51 <DannyWorkOrderPr> if it's not already.
03:48:52 <TheJollyRoger> Given that your browser essentially handles what should be considered attacker-controlled input (and if the site isn't https, then consider it to essentially run input from anyone on the internet), this is a good thing.
03:49:01 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderPr: I'll add another PR.
03:49:25 <TheJollyRoger> (I've got about ~29 of them open, so if you're going to send in a PR, we should co-ordinate to make sure we don't end up writing over each other)
03:49:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: Was there anything, firmware or hardware-wise, that you weren't happy with, following the post-audit improvements?
03:50:27 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I'm seeing an impressive amount of "This issue was fixed by the Nitrokey maintainers, the fix was verified by Cure53"
03:51:53 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderPr: the issue is more so that the Nitrokey Pro relies on a smartcard anyways as its secure element. So you're not actually getting anything open source, because JCard OS is proprietary, the interpreter is proprietary, and the toolchain is proprietary from Oracle, and on BasicCard, the functions that are meant for constant time implementations of the cryptographic functions are
03:51:55 <TheJollyRoger> non-free.
03:52:10 <TheJollyRoger> My big issue with Nitrokey is that they're selling something as being more open than it is.
03:52:23 <TheJollyRoger> If you tell me "This is as open as we can make it, but this is where it isn't" then I'm cool with it.
03:52:43 * JTL remembers the Librem 5 with it's dubious amount of blobs
03:52:54 <JTL> Moot point because most of the tech people left and they can't seem to ship units anyways
03:53:25 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Also, TheJollyRoger , why PR-ing the wiki owned by yourself, out of curiosity? Also-also, at what stage will you be interested in merging with the new community wiki?
03:54:05 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderPr: when I have enough time, right now at this moment time is a limited resource for me.
03:54:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: Ah, yeah, fair enough. I wonder why that's so uncommon
03:54:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: That's why I was asking - I may be able to help with that transition! Feel like it's a good idea for us to choose the permanent home for the community wiki, though
03:55:16 <TheJollyRoger> So that's my big beef with the Nitrokey Pro; at that rate I'd rather just buy a smartcard, since at least those I know what I signed up for.
03:55:49 <DannyWorkOrderPr> JTL: any idea where they all went? anyone been tracking?
03:55:51 <TheJollyRoger> Since I can set the lock key on those smartcards myself, rather than have to deal with the attack surface and potential exploits and bugs of the extra microcontroller onboard.
03:56:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> We should try to nab some of them =]
03:56:34 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be writing for the wiki, just... right now I need to be able to have time to sit down and do it.
03:57:24 <JTL> DannyWorkOrderPr: It's a long story rife with [citation needed] and dead links, but they either left at their own volition due to Purism's incompettence or got fired b the CEO
03:57:34 <JTL> DannyWorkOrderPr: I'm sure if they really want to, they'll find us
03:58:07 <JTL> Plus I think "astroturfing" to recruit developers is a poor practice
03:59:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> You'll have to elaborate on what you define as astroturfing
03:59:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> You'd be shocked at how few security people are aware of Graphene. The site's not exactly SEO'd up (not saying it should be, just the reality of the current situation)
03:59:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> JTL
04:00:07 <JTL> Probably using the wrong terminology, but I think attempting to publicly recruit random people from other projects wtihout context or knowing them beforehand is a poor practice
04:00:19 <JTL> DannyWorkOrderPr: I am aware of the obscurity of the project
04:01:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> JTL: Yeah, I'm not going to bust into the Librem room and tell them they're wasting their time, come kick it with us, lol
04:01:51 <JTL> Someone was talking about Copperhead in the Librem room recently, and the same person (not me) brought up GrapheneOS, so I'm sure some of them will find themselves here
04:02:06 <JTL> Meh
04:02:18 <JTL> I do get little bridies from time to time :p
04:03:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But, perfect example, analog was in a public room last night discussing his lack of welcome from the Mozilla security team that he was interested in assisting, and I asked him if he'd be interested in lending Graphene a hand. He's now currently brushing up on Graphene docs, and plans to start getting involved.
04:04:05 <TheJollyRoger> \o/ Splice the mainbrace!
04:04:07 <strcat> still dealing with the fallout from James turning the Samourai Wallet community against the project
04:04:07 <analog[m]> Oh yeah, the Mozilla engineers are horrible.
04:04:09 <strcat> still going on
04:04:18 <TheJollyRoger> Holy shit.
04:04:38 <strcat> going to be an ongoing disaster now
04:04:53 <strcat> thanks to ignorant people siding with James out of spite
04:05:01 <strcat> and going out of their way to support him and cause harm to us
04:05:21 <strcat> I'm probably going to make a dedicated page about this on the site because I foresee it becoming a major issue
04:05:31 <strcat> not linked in then nav bar or anything
04:05:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: link to thread?
04:05:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Or is this PMs
04:05:38 <strcat> it's not one thread
04:05:43 <strcat> it's an ongoing event
04:05:43 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh >_<.
04:06:00 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: James has been in the Samourai Wallet Telegram for 2 years
04:06:10 <strcat> spreading bullshit and misinformation about myself, GrapheneOS, etc.
04:06:30 <strcat> and he recently figured out that he could win them over to his side by just offering them his proprietary fork of my legacy code for free
04:06:47 <strcat> so they're happily eating that up and thinking they've gotten something great being given a paid product for free
04:06:55 <strcat> when it's just a bad ripoff of our legacy code
04:07:06 <strcat> they added DRM/tracking to it for their licensing system
04:07:19 <strcat> and they've failed to properly maintain/port what they forked
04:07:21 <strcat> they don't understand it
04:07:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Maybe just one tweet on your account to link to that reads like this:
04:07:54 <strcat> it's going to be an ongoing problem now with these people helping James
04:08:17 <strcat> when I talk about how this community needs to be actively countering his misinformation this is exactly what I mean
04:08:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> "Stuff CopperheadOS has that GrapheneOS doesn't: open source code used against license terms, DRM/tracking
04:08:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Stuff GrapheneOS has that CopperheadOS doesn't: recent upstream security patches, ongoing security improvements"
04:08:29 <strcat> I'm going to lose days of development work to this
04:08:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Twitter eats shit like that^ up, strcat
04:08:56 <strcat> GrapheneOS has had 2 years of extensive development of privacy/security work since what they forked...
04:09:11 <DannyWorkOrderPr> exactly
04:09:59 <zxwayland> oh sorry to hear, just read the news on the github of daniel and copperheados drama
04:11:06 <zxwayland> strcat, is the project code somehow register and given credit on your name?
04:11:24 <strcat> zxwayland: it was published under my name with me as the author/owner
04:11:39 <strcat> although that stuff isn't up anymore
04:11:47 <TheJollyRoger> strcat owns the code, but I'm willing to bet they launder its commit history.
04:11:48 <strcat> but it was always credited to me and it was explicitly agreed that I owned it
04:11:56 <zxwayland> as long as they don't change the code/fork it. they have to give the source code for free
04:11:57 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: they don't have that commit history
04:12:12 <strcat> zxwayland: after they pushed me out they filed a fraudulent copyright claim over my work
04:12:16 <strcat> which I recently discovered
04:12:38 <zxwayland> sounds like a patent troll
04:12:39 <strcat> zxwayland: my lawyer is aware of this and we'll probably contest it and get it invalidated
04:13:09 <zxwayland> if you have a patent troll lawyer and you can prove that you created it/open source it. you would win
04:13:38 <zxwayland> sounds expensive
04:14:12 <strcat> I have a lawyer
04:14:15 <strcat> lawyers ARE expensive
04:14:27 <zxwayland> if you have date logs and your name under it. thats good enough proof
04:14:33 <strcat> legal fees are where most donations are going to go atm thanks to James
04:14:42 <strcat> donations are essential to continuing development
04:14:58 <strcat> by defending the project from James and his malicious actions
04:15:21 <analog[m]> Not just donations but also community support as a whole
04:15:26 <zxwayland> couldn't they just change the code and they should leave you alone
04:16:24 <TheJollyRoger> analog[m]: couldn't have said it better, we need to figure out where these attacks are coming from. So if any of you guys hang out in other areas that are related to security/privacy etc, and see FUD/FAO coming from them, speak up.
04:16:51 <strcat> zxwayland: I already own the code
04:16:53 <strcat> it's my code
04:17:29 <strcat> 90% of it didn't even exist when I was involved with them, but regardless all the code in GrapheneOS is owned by the GrapheneOS developers and is permissively licensed
04:17:32 <zxwayland> actually i don't even see one website talking about your case. only from TheJollyRoger sent me a link from github
04:17:34 <analog[m]> TheJollyRoger Yeah, I was alerted of FUD being spread from Samorai Wallet's Telegram by James Donaldson and someone defended Micay and Graphene which is good.
04:17:54 <analog[m]> I wasn't able to get a Telegram, but I wanted to chim in as well.
04:17:59 <strcat> analog[m]: he has been doing it for 2 years and he has successfully converted prominent members in the community with a lot of blind followers to his side
04:18:03 <TheJollyRoger> Unless they were to do a cleanroom rewrite of the entire code, it would still be strcat's engineering, since those algorithms and such are the essential parts of the code.
04:18:05 <strcat> so this is a serious problem
04:18:13 <TheJollyRoger> analog[m]: WHEW
04:18:25 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
04:18:33 <TheJollyRoger> Oh cancel that whew.
04:18:36 <strcat> zxwayland: James was very successful in silencing this originally
04:18:42 <strcat> stole my Twitter account
04:19:08 <strcat> got me banned from Reddit for a bogus reason and lost control of the subreddit until they gave it back to me... fairly recently
04:19:15 <zxwayland> Well, you need to create a buzz and have people spread awareness of your case
04:19:30 <zxwayland> looks like you have 0
04:19:52 <zxwayland> it can change
04:20:01 <strcat> I will when we make a public announcement about what they're doing + a fundraiser for legal fees
04:20:07 <strcat> there are people who will help spread it
04:20:13 <zxwayland> thats good
04:20:15 <strcat> we are going to try to get it done this week
04:20:20 <strcat> it's difficult
04:20:57 <strcat> and I fully intend to go on the offensive legally
04:21:01 <zxwayland> you basically need to be on slashdot.org and have edward snowen retweet about your case
04:21:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. How does one get on slashdot.org...?
04:21:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: as per my email yesterday, happy to collate everything, take statements from past and current community members and devs, and contact the EFF on GrapheneOS' behalf
04:21:37 <strcat> EFF already helped me get my lawyer
04:21:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: When zxwayland POSTS on /.!
04:21:56 <zxwayland> nice
04:21:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. And then it has to rise in popularity...?
04:22:10 <strcat> still going to need a lot of money for legal fees
04:22:13 <strcat> it's going to be expensive
04:22:30 <TheJollyRoger> Cripes >_<.
04:22:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: right. slashdot is a news aggreagate, like reddit, with less bullshit and skiddies
04:22:38 <strcat> it's not cheap having a legal battle especially when it's going to be a complicated mess not 1 thing
04:22:43 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Or, at least, it used to be
04:22:46 <TheJollyRoger> Well... let's get those donations in.
04:23:00 <JTL> Slashdot is still relevant today? :p
04:23:03 <zxwayland> in worse case scenario. it would be like openoffice. people would just don't use it anymore and use libreoffice
04:23:04 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: need to make a public statement similar to the history / copyright sections on the site
04:23:11 <strcat> but elaborating on what they're doing
04:23:14 <strcat> naming them ofc
04:23:15 <analog[m]> strcat: Do you have Monero?
04:23:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> JTL: I love communities that aren't popular where smart people hide, aha
04:23:21 <strcat> analog[m]: no
04:23:24 * JTL remembers reading slashdot 10 years ago
04:23:29 <strcat> I mean I guess I kinda do in the sense that Trezor supports Monero
04:23:32 <JTL> DannyWorkOrderPr: Me too, just wondering how "active" Slashdot is
04:23:33 <zxwayland> i read engadget lol
04:23:39 <TheJollyRoger> strcat, OK draft coming.
04:23:41 <strcat> but I've never used it
04:23:47 <strcat> and don't have a wallet to use with that
04:23:48 <analog[m]> I see.
04:23:56 <strcat> and don't really want to deal with more cryptocurrency stuff right now
04:23:57 <TheJollyRoger> strcat moment.
04:24:15 <zxwayland> can't you do it cheaply?
04:25:54 <TheJollyRoger> *sorry, I mean "one moment.")
04:26:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: You have had a habit today of very ambiguous messages, lol, take a second to plan out what you're saying with some context, please.
04:27:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Also, go make that Slashdot post!
04:27:07 <TheJollyRoger> Hold up.
04:27:20 <TheJollyRoger> Wait until we've got something to repost, eh? :)
04:27:29 <JTL> I was just about to say that
04:27:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Can't have too many, but, sounds good =]
04:27:54 <zxwayland> oh, i thought i was being clear
04:28:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > can't you do it cheaply?
04:28:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> No clue what this refers to, m8
04:28:30 <zxwayland> i do have a million ideas running thru my head. i don't actually follow thru with them thou
04:29:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, that's a huge problem in communities like this =] We need activity and word of mouth out in the social-sphere right now, more than idle chat and suggestions.
04:30:05 <zxwayland> Like i am not well structure and i don't plan out well
04:31:14 <zxwayland> well, where are these post attacks from? i usually see posts about lineage os and graphene os
04:31:27 <zxwayland> never about cooperhead os
04:31:41 <strcat> because it's a proprietary fork of my legacy codebase
04:31:57 <zxwayland> actually i do live off the grid. i don't own a reddit account, no facebook, etc
04:31:57 <strcat> and the biggest change they made is adding DRM/tracking for a licensing system for updates
04:32:14 <strcat> this is the first community they've found with people to support / push it
04:32:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: https://twitter.com/_copperj/status/1257410952938565634
04:33:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> https://twitter.com/sthenc/status/1257031675915063296
04:33:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> https://twitter.com/bitdov/status/1257336325663068163
04:34:22 <zxwayland> oh, i don't even go on twitter and i don't even have a twitter account
04:34:55 <strcat> but these people do and they're causing immense harm now
04:35:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: I mean, you asked where the posts are, lol
04:35:05 <strcat> James found a community that's willing to help him push his misinformation
04:35:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1257281300664389632
04:35:48 <zxwayland> who the hell is this Stephen Cole guy?
04:35:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1257280671493521408
04:36:17 <strcat> zxwayland: James reached out to these people and gave them CopperheadOS access to test it / promote it
04:36:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: one of the "figureheads" that got a free copy of CopperheadOS that strcat mentioned above
04:36:22 <strcat> so they're basically Copperhead partners now
04:36:33 <strcat> they're participating in his fraud
04:36:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: Who isn't, according to them, lol
04:36:54 <strcat> and they didn't like my response to their post pushing a ripoff of my work
04:36:59 <zxwayland> he even mention he never used grapheneos
04:37:02 <strcat> so they doubled down on this and switched to using it
04:37:14 <strcat> zxwayland: some of them did, and switched over to this out of spite now
04:37:20 <strcat> and they're pushing it largely out of spite
04:37:30 <strcat> because they didn't like being called out for supporting this scam ripped off from my work
04:37:47 <strcat> so James found an audience that loves being sweet talked and manipulated by him
04:37:58 <strcat> and he's now using them as pawns to promote it and harass me
04:38:23 <zxwayland> whoa he has 1540 followers
04:38:25 <strcat> lots of people here seem to find it hard to believe that people would fall for it
04:38:37 <strcat> zxwayland: not a lot, some actually have a lot of followers
04:38:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> From what I've been seeing, though he's not deleting posts/making followup ones, Stephen seems aware he's bit off more than what he was aware of: https://twitter.com/maxtannahill/status/1257198254766333960
04:39:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But yeah, he's done his job/damage for now
04:39:22 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: more of them will be doing the same
04:39:37 <strcat> probably something like 30 people, a few of them with a lot of followers, that are now helping James like this
04:39:56 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: this is what I worry about in terms of him spreading him misinformation and fraudulent claims
04:40:05 <strcat> that he'll find an audience for it and use that to sustain his war on us
04:40:23 <strcat> which is what I expect to happen here, they're going to get him attention / money to direct towards causing further harm
04:40:39 <strcat> you can see he's using that channel and these posts to spread misinformation about myself and GrapheneOS
04:40:52 <strcat> his goal is muddying the waters and harming the project and myself, that's it
04:40:58 <strcat> he's incredibly spiteful and malicious
04:41:02 <strcat> he values that far more than anything
04:41:24 <strcat> I have to deal with actually doing privacy/security research and development work and moving forward the open source project
04:41:40 <strcat> not just ripping off someone's code and paying some cheap outsourced devs to do a half assed job of porting it forward
04:41:43 <strcat> without understanding it
04:41:53 <strcat> he just invests most of his time/effort in causing harm
04:42:10 <zxwayland> looks like the have big names brands supporting them. unless they are fake
04:42:13 <strcat> and while he's not the brightest he's smart enough to come up with ways of causing substantial damage like this
04:42:15 <strcat> zxwayland: it's fake
04:42:25 <strcat> zxwayland: being addressed too
04:42:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Community: Let's spearfish his social media campaigns, and redirect the interest of the "reader at home" who's following along =] All we can do, right now.
04:43:37 <analog[m]> Also Micay, is this a bad time to ask you a non-Copperhead related question?
04:43:53 <strcat> no
04:44:01 <analog[m]> Okay.
04:44:05 * analog[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/yRQliCfuzbdlKIkmVUnWidQU >
04:44:05 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Vanadium takes advantage of and "> GrapheneOS documentation states Bromote has it too. Personally prefer some of the subtle tweaks in Bromite.
04:44:10 <strcat> it's always a good time to avoid talking about narcissistic sociopaths
04:44:14 <zxwayland> sounds like you got reverse zuckerberg
04:45:12 <analog[m]> My message might've been too long, I'm unsure if there's a character limit on IRC.
04:45:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> analog: the bridge will make a link for the IRC users - hopefully they click!!
04:45:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> auto-pastebin, & such
04:46:54 <strcat> I read it
04:47:15 <strcat> I don't really understand why it does that instead of just splitting it into multiple lines
04:47:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Freenode et al will auto-ban the bridge bot otherwise, according to Matrix Issue tracker
04:47:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It's been chapping my ass for weeks
04:48:06 <zxwayland> is arch linux any good?
04:48:25 <analog[m]> Arch Linux has good hardening options, but it has the OpenSSL and Systemd attack vectors.
04:48:28 <analog[m]> I use Void Linux personally.
04:48:53 <strcat> I wouldn't say it has good hardening options
04:49:19 <strcat> so for example if I paste something long

04:49:48 <zxwayland> i can't read that
04:49:49 <DannyWorkOrderPr> analog: "This had reminded me of a statement you've previously written during the Tor Browser Memory Allocation ordeal noting Mozilla's terrible practices such as relying on volunteers and free labor. I wanted more of an elaboration about that, doing some searches I wasn't able to find anything online that fit your narrative."
04:49:58 <renlord> if you spam the same shit, freenode does kill you
04:50:17 <strcat> should have used oftc it's a lot less silly
04:50:20 <strcat> and permits tor directly
04:50:21 <zxwayland> i have never hear of void linux
04:50:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Is it possible to bridge two IRC rooms?
04:51:05 <renlord> sure
04:51:10 <renlord> put a bot relay
04:51:30 <strcat> I wouldn't want to do that
04:51:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Hmm =] And the oftc <-> matrix bridge is also less dogshit?
04:51:39 <zxwayland> i hear from debian users say arch linux is whatever
04:51:45 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: no that's matrix.org problem
04:51:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: oh fuck, we here we go
04:51:54 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: but oftc are friendlier to it
04:52:21 <renlord> everytime i ask a question on oftc, i never get an answer though
04:52:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: The Freenode<->Matrix bridge, specifically - not Matrix the protocol, to be clear?
04:52:53 <analog[m]> strcat Have you ever used guix? (not to be confused with GuixSD)
04:52:55 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: the problem is matrix.org and the standard matrix server
04:53:13 <strcat> analog[m]: not a fan...
04:53:14 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Right, the matrix.org homeserver is overloaded and laggy constantly.
04:53:19 <strcat> opposite of how things should be done
04:53:33 <strcat> taking something declarative and making it a programming language with a bunch of bad design decisions everywhere
04:53:33 <analog[m]> Yeah.
04:53:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Am switching some of my rooms over to tchncs.de Matrix homeserver
04:54:13 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: it shouldn't be laggy though it's a software issue
04:54:49 <strcat> oftc is a lot nicer than freenode - fewer netsplits, services not down as much, tor users permitted, not as many restrictions from spam, etc.
04:56:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: Matrix.org team continues to say the lag issues are not software, but instead, server resource issues. They keep adding resources to their cluster, but it's not done automatically, so, it's a poor experience, and an even poorer response: "Switch to another free server, set up your own server, or pay us via modular.im for your own"
04:56:44 <analog[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro You can use my homeserver if you'd like.
04:56:55 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: simply the fact that it is written in python
04:57:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: Was just going to say, the dendrite or whatever rewrite should be much better than synapse as a homeserver, looking forward to that. Might actually be able to run one myself, then
04:57:37 <strcat> cannot say it's not software when it clearly is
04:57:41 <strcat> adding more resources is a workaround
04:58:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Ah, yeah, I mean, just having more performant server code would be a solution, too - but their day-to-day issue is too many users for their existing code, not enough auto-scale
04:58:34 <strcat> not just more performant but more reliable
04:58:52 <strcat> you can't make server software in python with reliable latency, etc.
04:59:10 <strcat> you can do background stuff with it if you can spare the resources
04:59:20 <strcat> but if you're using it for a massive server with many users/connections...
05:00:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Thoghts on Go, in comparison? That's what Dendrite will be, apparently
05:01:17 <strcat> doesn't have nearly the same kinds of issues
05:01:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> "Go is the new Python" seems to be the message I'm getting from a lot of projects.
05:01:30 <strcat> shitty language but well implemented compiler, runtime and libraries
05:01:49 <renlord> despite GC, still happy with runtime?
05:01:51 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: that's a good way to put it, it's a shitty language with a good implementation and great libraries
05:02:20 <strcat> renlord: it's not a great GC but it's optimized for latency rather than throughput and the expectation is you deal with that using more hardware
05:02:40 * analog[m] uses Yggdrasil which is written in Go
05:02:51 <strcat> they have no control over shared memory between threads so the GC is global instead of per thread
05:03:00 <strcat> and it has data races, and unlike java they can lead to mem corruption
05:03:14 <strcat> it has problems for sure
05:03:15 <JTL> I've heard of issues with Golang's garabage corruption
05:03:18 <strcat> it's not a well designed or modern language
05:03:25 <strcat> but it has good tools and libraries
05:03:42 <strcat> it's got a lot of warts and unnecessary complexity / special cases in the language
05:03:46 <strcat> weird, badly designed ways of doing things
05:04:07 <strcat> and is missing modern language features providing good ways of doing things like error handling or reusing code well
05:04:22 <strcat> type system really sucks so it's not good at statically finding errors at all
05:04:25 <renlord> is this where you ask everyone to just use rustlang?
05:04:30 <renlord> heh
05:04:30 <strcat> forces using a lot of reflection / dynamic casts
05:04:35 <strcat> renlord: rust and go aren't competitors
05:04:39 <strcat> go isn't a low level systems language
05:04:46 <strcat> that's just a silly misunderstanding by people unfamiliar with them
05:04:54 <zxwayland> has anyone tried the mobile phone os called /e/
05:05:04 <strcat> Go is a reimplementation of Java with less verbosity
05:05:06 <strcat> pretty much
05:05:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: I've got a feeling you're going to have a couple more questions like this, give this a shot: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
05:05:43 <JTL> /e/ is a LineaageOS fork
05:05:43 <strcat> Java 1.0 with M:N threading and without class inheritance -> Go
05:05:46 <JTL> Can't say much beyond that
05:05:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: Search /e/ and look for strcat's messages, haha
05:06:15 <renlord> strcat: isnt go like closer to the hardware since it compiles into assembly
05:06:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Or TheJollyRoger madaidan. etc
05:06:28 <strcat> I don't think I've really said much about it
05:06:29 <renlord> but running on top a lightweight runtime
05:06:31 <strcat> don't want to spend my time on that
05:06:45 <strcat> renlord: Java compiles to machine code too and has AOT compilers
05:06:51 <strcat> renlord: not a property of the language
05:07:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: Don't blame you, same story as the other privacy-adverts
05:07:13 <zxwayland> i don't get it. i just see myself and "w/e"
05:07:58 <renlord> zxwayland: you should try it then report back to us
05:08:07 <strcat> renlord: GrapheneOS for example uses AOT compilation for Java - only uses the interpreter for cold code (like one-time init code) and dynamically loaded classes (ew), it disables JIT
05:08:20 <strcat> and there are other AOT compilers for it
05:08:23 <strcat> predating Android
05:08:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: Use exact match. But yeah, shockingly, not a ton in there. Search Lineage instead, you'll find what you're looking for
05:08:39 <strcat> well predating ART for sure but also Android itself too
05:08:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: "Exact match" and "all time"
05:08:58 <strcat> look on the subreddit
05:09:23 <TheJollyRoger> Hi hi. Someone asked for me?
05:09:34 <strcat> renlord: https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/295
05:09:35 * zoraver[m] uploaded an image: go_generics.jpg (58KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/oBXXzpUdbLUTCugdmztFkURn >
05:09:46 <strcat> renlord: for the referebce openjdk approach
05:10:12 <strcat> AOT libraries can be compiled in two modes controlled by --compile-for-tiered flag:
05:10:14 <strcat> Non-tiered AOT compiled code behaves similarly to statically compiled C++ code, in that no profiling information is collected and no JIT recompilations will happen.
05:10:16 <strcat> Tiered AOT compiled code does collect profiling information. The profiling done is the same as the simple profiling done by C1 methods compiled at Tier 2. If AOT methods hit the AOT invocation thresholds then these methods are recompiled by C1 at Tier 3 first in order to gather full profiling information. This is required for C2 JIT recompilations in order to produce optimal code and reach peak
05:10:18 <strcat> application performance.
05:11:32 <zxwayland> /e/ supports 0 smartphone models right now
05:11:47 <strcat> huh?
05:12:02 <zxwayland> https://e.foundation/get-support/
05:12:09 <strcat> lets just not talk about other OSes here atm
05:12:19 <zxwayland> oh sorry
05:12:26 <strcat> zxwayland: their site just requires JS probably
05:12:30 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: I pinged "accidentally", was telling zxwayland to look for your previous msgs in logging
05:12:38 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
05:12:46 <zxwayland> oh, i have noscript on
05:12:47 <strcat> and their definition of supporting something officially is a hell of a lot different than ours
05:13:50 <renlord> most OSes that say they support mean that they leave you out hanging to dry
05:13:53 <renlord> lol
05:14:05 <JTL> renlord: Don't look at the average "ROM" project on the XDA forum
05:14:09 * JTL ducks
05:14:37 <zxwayland> i don't even like it when pretty girls leave me hanging dry on dates
05:17:32 <JTL> speaking of XDA, the heck is this?
05:17:36 <JTL> https://forum.xda-developers.com/razer-phone-2/development/rom-grapheneos-pie-t4049705
05:17:49 <JTL> Someone claimed to build GrapheneOS for the Razer Phone 2, but the link is a 404
05:17:51 <JTL> heh
05:17:58 <JTL> must've been an early April FOols
05:23:46 <zxwayland> is there an app or website where i can view youtube videos without being tracked?
05:26:34 <renlord> download it over a proxy, then play it
05:27:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Or, alternatively, VPN methods+NewPipe forced over it
05:27:10 <TheJollyRoger> hey zxwayland, on the desktop, you can try to use youtube-dl in conjunction with tor, or just use Tor Browser.
05:27:29 <renlord> does youtube even load on the tor browser?
05:27:36 <renlord> with noscript and all
05:28:05 <JTL> 5youtube-dl should work
05:28:13 <zxwayland> oh, i have been just using firefox and it has a bunch of privacy extentions. but i have to keep clearing my cache a lot
05:28:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> (and apps that implement it)
05:28:16 <TheJollyRoger> Open Tor Browser, let it connect, then install youtube-dl (from youtube.dl.org) using `youtube-dl --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9150`
05:28:23 <TheJollyRoger> Oh boy.
05:28:49 <zxwayland> google keeps knowing who i am
05:29:15 <TheJollyRoger> I'm gonna ask you to hold it right there for a sec - adding "privacy extensions", especially ones that operate on clientside checks, really really increases the uniqueness of what you send to the server and makes it *easier* for you to be tracked.
05:29:33 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: Would you like to know opsec's dirty secret?
05:30:35 <TheJollyRoger> The more "customization" you do, generally the worse off you're going to end up.
05:30:35 <zxwayland> just noscript, https everywhere, ublock, facebook container, privacy badger, cookie autodelete, decentraleyes
05:30:52 <zxwayland> opsec's dirty secret?
05:30:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yep.
05:31:28 <TheJollyRoger> *youtube-dl.org
05:32:47 <zxwayland> nope, whats the secret?
05:35:18 <TheJollyRoger> That's it: the more "customization" you do generally the worse off you're going to end up. Privacy Badger's clientside checks and blocking of third-party content generally ends up making you more unique.
05:35:30 <zxwayland> ohhh
05:36:46 <brenneke[m]> In theory but so many are doing the same so the sea is maybe bigger?
05:36:58 <TheJollyRoger> Generally, this is why power users tend to end up shooting themselves in the foot, because they don't realize the ramifications of what they're doing, or install things that look good on paper and often haphazardly implement features that aren't thoroughly thought through but don't have clear threat models.
05:38:01 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: consider that he's mentioned ublock, facebook container, privacy badger and decentraleyes. Out of the entire population using the Internet, a very small percentage does that, and a smaller percentage still will have his Privacy Badger learning data.
05:38:06 <renlord> so many of the same bucket of people do the same thing
05:38:16 <renlord> that read the same material
05:38:36 <renlord> that shadow profile is quite unique
05:38:41 <zxwayland> is privacy badger bad?
05:41:14 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: just use Tor Browser and flush your identity often. Don't customize it. Don't futz with the settings. Don't add stuff to it or mess with the extensions. Just use it as at is.
05:41:49 <renor[m]> <zxwayland "is privacy badger bad?"> It's not "bad". It's just that the "protection" it offers may help identifying you even more while surfing the internet. And combined with other extensions is like a unique fingerprint, as adding more extensions reduces the probability of other people using a similar combination. At least that's what I think.
05:41:51 <TheJollyRoger> If you must futz with something set the security slider to "safer" or "safest."
05:42:23 <strcat> renor[m]: it's not just which extensions but how everything is configured
05:42:27 <strcat> and extensions have their own state
05:42:33 <strcat> which can be tracked
05:43:03 <strcat> the way they filter is also not reliable / robust
05:43:13 <zxwayland> i disabled WebRTC too on firefox on the config
05:43:28 <renor[m]> <TheJollyRoger "zxwayland: just use Tor Browser "> Isn't it bad to use Tor for everything? Even things that require to login indentifying yourself?
05:44:04 <TheJollyRoger> renor[m]: it's not using Tor for everything that's bad per se, it's Mixing The Modes of Anonymity.
05:44:09 <TheJollyRoger> Or as I like to call it, "Crossing The Streams."
05:44:51 <zxwayland> so your saying its just better to be tracked on firefox?
05:45:01 <renor[m]> <strcat "which can be tracked"> I see. So for example, only using a Pi-hole to block some domains without any extensions/config on the browser would cause the same effect?
05:45:17 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: I'm saying use Tor Browser.
05:45:18 <renor[m]> <TheJollyRoger "renor: it's not using Tor for ev"> What do you mean?
05:45:27 <TheJollyRoger> renor[m]: have you heard of the Modes of Anonymity?
05:45:30 <strcat> renor[m]: sure, why wouldn't it?
05:45:59 <zxwayland> but i don't want the feds to be looking on the tor nodes end
05:46:09 <strcat> if you want anonymity the *least bad* option is the tor browser without adding any extensions or changing any settings in it
05:46:16 <strcat> but it has serious problems
05:46:31 <strcat> it is less secure than a chromium-based browser and you make yourself interesting
05:46:44 <zxwayland> i don't add anything on mt tor web browser. i just use the vanilla
05:46:50 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: that's what TLS or the little green lock in your browser is for.
05:46:59 <strcat> traffic coming out of tor makes it suspicious to the site and people run exit nodes maliciously or monitor them
05:47:22 <strcat> zxwayland: yeah just saying if you make changes to the browser that doesn't increase your privacy
05:47:26 <strcat> eliminates it
05:47:43 <renor[m]> <strcat "renor: sure, why wouldn't it?"> Idk, just asking. Maybe using a kind of firewall without any browser config would help reduce the fingerprint of the browser while still blocking ads.
05:48:00 <strcat> no and doing things in a more special way just makes you stand out more
05:48:29 <zxwayland> oh i am standing out? i thought i was being invisible
05:48:56 <strcat> if you run a bunch of extensions / config changes
05:48:58 <strcat> you stand out
05:49:05 <renor[m]> I see... Avoiding trackers converts your setup in your own tracker
05:49:24 <strcat> in fact you even get yourself into logs people may actually review to debug problems
05:49:30 <strcat> not just automated tracking
05:49:35 <strcat> but you make yourself stand out so much
05:49:39 <strcat> that you get individual attention
05:50:02 <strcat> you don't get privacy by making yourself stand out
05:50:14 <zxwayland> hmmm
05:50:22 <strcat> that's one of the issues with using tor - you don't want to use tor to log into some personal account if your goal is not standing out
05:50:39 <TheJollyRoger> renor[m]: The modes of anonymity are essential to using Tor correctly, they're modes like: 1) Sender does not know recipient, sender uses Tor; 2) Sender and recipient know each other, both use Tor; 3) Not anonymous, not using Tor; 4) Using Tor to bypass firewalls, but not anonymous.
05:50:46 <zxwayland> i just don't like ads on youtube and website ads. and the ads are very creepy, its tracking me so much
05:50:57 <violadivias> anyone have a favorite hex editor for windows? i use frhed and like the bookmarking feature but looking for something new
05:51:37 <JTL> Last time I was in the position I used HxD
05:52:02 <renor[m]> So there's no way to avoid at least the ads without standing out while browsing?
05:52:03 <zxwayland> i haven't used windows was since windows xp
05:52:16 <renor[m]> I think there's a lot of people using, for example ublock
05:52:20 <TheJollyRoger> renor[m]: Using Tor in any of those modes is safe provided you follow the golden rules. It's if you /two/ at once then you've seriously compromised your anonymity.
05:52:45 <TheJollyRoger> *if you do two
05:52:54 <TheJollyRoger> Since now you've linked a contextual identity.
05:53:06 <zxwayland> i was wondering if google does know if it is tracking me less
05:53:39 <violadivias> JTL: this looks pretty good thanks
05:53:45 <zxwayland> like i went from a money making tracker me data. to alnomst off the grid of google
05:53:57 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: would you like another dirty opsec secret?
05:54:18 <zxwayland> i don't know secret
05:54:25 <zxwayland> s
05:54:26 <renor[m]> I do hahaha
05:54:44 <TheJollyRoger> Likely a huge source of leaks about you is not your computer.
05:54:47 <TheJollyRoger> Or your phone.
05:55:00 <renor[m]> <renor[m] "I do hahaha"> I mean I do want the secret
05:55:10 <TheJollyRoger> It's leaks from your social circles in life.
05:55:16 <zxwayland> but i have a flip phone
05:55:22 <TheJollyRoger> I said, it's not your phone.
05:55:28 <TheJollyRoger> It's what other people say about you.
05:55:36 <zxwayland> i hate my flip phone
05:55:59 <renor[m]> Sometimes I think that for them it's more important the collective data they can gather than the individual and particular data
05:56:11 <zxwayland> they are collobrating with the feds behind my back?
05:56:18 <renor[m]> Say your friends and common social circle doesn't care about privacy
05:57:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, everything goes to shit when your auntie calls up your grandma over Google Voice because it's free and says "HAAAAAEEEY did ya hear what happened to $GRANDSON? Oh yeah his doctor called back with his test results, now let me tell you all about it!"
05:57:22 <renor[m]> You are a person who has really similar habits and ideology (most times) so if they can track that group of people, you're being tracked in some way too
05:57:26 <TheJollyRoger> Or GMail.
05:57:30 <TheJollyRoger> Or what have you.
05:57:32 <TheJollyRoger> Or Facebook Chat.
05:57:51 * TheJollyRoger shrugs at the amount of platforms that send stuff unsecured and unencrypted.
05:57:57 <renor[m]> Sure...
05:57:59 <TheJollyRoger> And are monetized by datamining.
05:58:05 <zxwayland> shit
05:58:13 <renor[m]> Or people uploading everything to Google Photos
05:58:15 <zxwayland> but i don't have facebook anymore
05:58:23 <TheJollyRoger> How about everyone you know?
05:58:27 <zxwayland> i am going to delete my google account soon
05:58:47 <zxwayland> everyone has facebook/instrgram
05:58:59 <zxwayland> i hate them
05:59:17 <renor[m]> I think a good way to protect yourself is making your data somehow obsolete
05:59:21 <renor[m]> But it's difficult
05:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> You'll get far better privacy getting your social circles to switch onto something like Signal, so they start using that among each other, than you will doing what I did and sinking a new truck's worth of money into an ultra secure setup.
05:59:46 <TheJollyRoger> Not only start using that among each other, but use it /without meaning to/.
05:59:57 <zxwayland> what is an ultra secure setup?
06:00:16 <zxwayland> i thought i have secured my laptop enough
06:00:18 <TheJollyRoger> That, I left open-ended for you to decide.
06:00:45 <graphenehelp[m]> librem running tails
06:00:52 <zxwayland> it took forever to secure my linux laptop
06:01:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <graphenehelp[m] "librem running tails"> On a DVD
06:01:09 <TheJollyRoger> Endpoint security is a rabbithole - just when you think you've got it secure, you realize you don't :)
06:01:26 <zxwayland> yeah, i am always doing more
06:01:28 <renor[m]> That's what I did. 95% of my social interactions take place on Signal/XMPP
06:01:36 <zxwayland> its never nough
06:01:37 <graphenehelp[m]> pretty much everything you type into an electronic device is compromised
06:01:54 <TheJollyRoger> graphenehelp[m]: Not so. It depends on what your threat model is.
06:02:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <zxwayland "its never nough"> Don't let perfect be the enemy of great, or great be the enemy of good. Improve all the time.
06:02:13 <zxwayland> i disable the usb rubber ducky on my laptop
06:02:15 <graphenehelp[m]> totally. but its a good baseline
06:02:39 <graphenehelp[m]> airgapped isnt even safe
06:02:55 <graphenehelp[m]> enough time and enough resources, anything is possible
06:03:20 <TheJollyRoger> graphenehelp[m]: no, a comprehensive, well-thought out, thorough threat model, in which you know where to say "that's above my pay grade" is a good baseline.
06:03:22 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <graphenehelp[m] "airgapped isnt even safe"> That's why I switched all of my CPU fans to aircooling - no vibration readings here! (kidding, but, fuck I'd like to)
06:03:32 <renor[m]> <zxwayland "its never nough"> That's why people don't care and keep using Google. They're lazy
06:03:36 <TheJollyRoger> graphenehelp[m]: okay, heh, whew, great.
06:03:43 <TheJollyRoger> Thought I was gonna have to explain that. :p.
06:03:52 <strcat> with modern GPUs you can even hear the side channels yourself
06:04:03 <graphenehelp[m]> hahahah, turning off fans
06:04:12 <strcat> coil whine is a wonderful thing
06:04:25 <zxwayland> i setted up a bootloader encrypted password, encrypted hard drive
06:04:39 <graphenehelp[m]> we need to go back to ww2 code and develop a handwritten system from there
06:04:53 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: ask yourself what's in your threat model.
06:04:54 <graphenehelp[m]> thats good start
06:05:09 <zxwayland> i am not sure
06:05:21 <graphenehelp[m]> if your processor is post 2008 intel then your cpu is compromised
06:05:34 <TheJollyRoger> Because if someone comes and cinderblocks your window, grabs your laptop while it's powered off and runs away with it, that's going to help. It however, won't do a damn thing about a software exploit while the computer is switched on.
06:06:08 <graphenehelp[m]> exactly
06:06:14 <TheJollyRoger> So again, ask yourself, what's in your threat model?
06:06:15 <graphenehelp[m]> or even hardware exploit, for that matter
06:06:19 <graphenehelp[m]> in this case IME
06:06:57 <zxwayland> i don't know any exploit bugs in my laptop
06:07:34 <graphenehelp[m]> what is your cpu
06:07:51 <zxwayland> intel core i7 from 2018
06:07:58 <graphenehelp[m]> pwned
06:08:00 <graphenehelp[m]> sorry buddy
06:08:41 <TheJollyRoger> https://syzkaller.appspot.com Now you do, if you run Linux.
06:09:33 <violadivias> graphenehelp[m]: lol
06:09:38 <zxwayland> whats that about?
06:09:46 <violadivias> a little hyperbolic
06:09:57 <graphenehelp[m]> lol
06:10:08 <TheJollyRoger> It's about all the exploits and bugs that get discovered in Linux by automated kernel fuzzing. Most of 'em don't get fixed.
06:10:17 <violadivias> show us his home directory
06:10:21 <graphenehelp[m]> same argument could be made for "i dont have anything to hide, but i like wearing clothes"
06:10:22 <violadivias> their
06:10:52 <TheJollyRoger> graphenehelp[m]: These days, possibly it's because I've actually been moving off the x86 as a whole, but I think we have bigger things to worry about than the Intel Management Engine.
06:11:01 <TheJollyRoger> Of course, I'm *extremely* biased here.
06:11:06 <TheJollyRoger> So take that into consideration.
06:12:20 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream is just proof that it's a failed venture
06:12:28 <strcat> those are just thw low hanging things caught by fuzzers
06:12:33 <strcat> and look how fast it finds them
06:12:39 <strcat> look at the rate it produces new unique reports
06:13:06 <strcat> and a lot of those are exploitable
06:13:12 <graphenehelp[m]> JollyRoger: ya, definitely. but economic privacy/freedom is a prerequisite of other "rights"
06:13:28 <TheJollyRoger> strcat yeah, good gravy >_<.
06:13:45 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: I don't know where you'd even begin trying to fix it aside from starting over with how complex and intertwined it all is
06:14:05 <strcat> you can't just take one core component and rewrite it in a safe language
06:14:13 <graphenehelp[m]> economic freedom>hardware freedom>software/FOSS
06:14:14 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: a full broadside of grapeshot?
06:14:15 <strcat> because it's all totally mixed in together / interdependent
06:14:23 <nuttso[m]> How can I stream to a TV with GrapheneOS
06:14:50 <strcat> nuttso[m]: as in mirror your screen on it or stream a video to it
06:14:52 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm joking. Don't fire grapeshot at computers)
06:15:02 <graphenehelp[m]> *buckshot
06:15:27 <TheJollyRoger> Ahem.
06:15:43 * TheJollyRoger is a rum-swilling, wobbly-legged salty pirate of the high seas.
06:15:58 <graphenehelp[m]> hahaha
06:15:59 <graphenehelp[m]> bro
06:16:04 <graphenehelp[m]> i totally made that drink you said the other day
06:16:09 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha yeah? :D
06:16:17 <graphenehelp[m]> just because you said kraken and lemon, i went and bought kraken
06:16:19 <nuttso[m]> <strcat "nuttso: as in mirror your screen"> Yes want to mirror it
06:16:23 <graphenehelp[m]> had it before but never like you said
06:16:24 <zxwayland> i have never heard of linux kernel fuzzing
06:16:26 <graphenehelp[m]> interesting
06:16:27 <TheJollyRoger> Splice the mainbrace! :D
06:16:33 * TheJollyRoger drinks!
06:16:34 <nuttso[m]> But not with hdmi
06:16:53 <nuttso[m]> Can I mirror over wifi
06:17:03 <strcat[m]> not sure if the current hw even supports hdmi because of hdcp nonsense
06:17:30 <TheJollyRoger> Oh crud. I forgot about High Definition Content Protection.
06:17:36 <strcat[m]> nuttso: miracast is dead but there are other streaming protocols the tv might support
06:17:51 <strcat[m]> nuttso: if it supports chromecast you can use vlc
06:18:03 <strcat[m]> they have their own implementation of it instead of Play Services one
06:19:13 <nuttso[m]> <strcat[m] "nuttso: if it supports chromecas"> Will try
06:20:48 <zxwayland> oh gosh, i am getting a headache. i have never heard of linux kernel fuzzing
06:20:51 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: "fuzzing" is where they get computers to continually test code to check for things like bugs or exploits. Usually this is done on highly specialized and extremely powerful computing clusters to get the work done faster.
06:20:55 <violadivias> JTL: HxD is not bad
06:20:58 <JTL> :)
06:21:08 <TheJollyRoger> Like, sometimes with hundreds of thousands of computer cores.
06:21:18 <TheJollyRoger> The only problem is...
06:21:29 <TheJollyRoger> Finding the bugs and exploits doesn't matter much if those bugs *don't get fixed*.
06:22:19 <zxwayland> ahhh
06:22:22 <TheJollyRoger> Or if as strcat says, stuff is so overcomplicated, so intertwined, and so interconnected, and so built-into itself that it's impossible to redo one area, without changing all the rest and causing *more bugs to surface*
06:23:15 <strcat[m]> it also only finds some bugs
06:23:16 <zxwayland> yeah i have heard
06:24:20 <TheJollyRoger> Cripes. It would totally not detect something deliberately malicious >_<.
06:25:08 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger:  well it *could* but it probably wouldn't
06:25:27 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: and it's designed to detect problems that usually / often lead to crashes
06:25:35 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't detect something like just getting root access
06:25:56 <strcat[m]> it doesn't detect the semantics being wrong generally unless you design that somehow
06:26:20 <zxwayland> oh just got an gmail email. my google pixel 3a has been shipped from the google store
06:26:20 <zxwayland> whoa it might come this Tuesday or Wednesday. I thought it was going to come this Friday - Saturday
06:26:23 * TheJollyRoger suddenly goes eyes wide.
06:26:27 <TheJollyRoger> Oh god.
06:26:45 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: Oh excellent :)!
06:27:14 <zxwayland> i don't know if i can keep my laptop/pixel 3a good enough away from the feds
06:27:34 <danvittegleo[m]> sorry random question, does anyone use duckduckgo and actually get good search results back?
06:27:55 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: no
06:27:59 <strcat[m]> I usually just put !g
06:28:02 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: GrapheneOS does not send telemetry, does not include invasive services, and tries to do its best (given what we have available) to protect against memory corruption vulnerabilities and mitigate exploits.
06:28:07 <danvittegleo[m]> lol.. ok that's what i do all the time
06:28:15 <danvittegleo[m]> it's so bad
06:28:20 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy danvittegleo[m], ah, crud, ahahaha, I haven't, not really :(. Even when looking for stuff on Wikipedia :(
06:28:22 <strcat[m]> especially technical topics or looking for something specific
06:28:23 <zxwayland> should i use a vpn on the grapheneos?
06:28:27 <strcat[m]> it only works for like a general search
06:28:30 <violadivias> danvittegleo[m]: i have to put my camo on
06:28:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <danvittegleo[m] "sorry random question, does anyo"> Qwant.com, Startpage.com
06:29:11 <danvittegleo[m]> i'm convinced their algorithm is: "look for noun.. drop all contextual rest of sentence"
06:29:30 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: the Pixel 3a's hardware-bound encryption and Insider Access Protection will protect against someone who confiscates your phone and tries to use legal or extralegal pressure to force a rogue firmware update, or tries to dismantle the phone and gain access to your files without the password.
06:29:47 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: problem is typical comparisons just look up general topics, etc.
06:29:52 <renlord> ddg almost never works when its a technical query
06:29:58 <strcat[m]> they aren't trying to look for some specific thing or answer to a technical question
06:30:06 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah.. true true
06:30:21 <strcat[m]> google is a lot worse than it used to be imo
06:30:32 <strcat[m]> but everything else is even worse
06:30:35 <strcat[m]> all the SEO nonsense, etc.
06:30:35 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: But what GrapheneOS won't protect you against will be someone that can threaten to smash your knees with a dumbbell if you don't give up the keys.
06:30:38 <strcat[m]> gaming the system
06:30:46 <zxwayland> how about my laptop?
06:30:47 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: for google you need to quote everything nowadays
06:30:49 <renlord> i think around 2010-ish was when google peaked
06:30:51 <strcat[m]> you need to quote every word
06:30:56 <strcat[m]> separately I mean
06:31:11 <renlord> its search
06:31:20 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: so for example if you search canine it will happily give you articles not saying that word just dog or w/;e
06:31:22 <renlord> and now its on the path to Yahoo!
06:31:27 <DannyWorkOrderPr> "all the SEO nonsense, etc." +1
06:31:35 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: you need to quote it like "canine" or it uses synonyms now
06:31:42 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: sometimes usually
06:31:52 <strcat[m]> I often don't want it doing that and you need to remember to quote everything
06:32:01 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: once again, provided your laptop is switched off, full disk encryption will protect against someone who will throw a cinderblock into your window, grab your laptop, and run with it, never to be seen again.
06:32:13 <graphenehelp[m]> <zxwayland "should i use a vpn on the graphe"> yes use VPN and graphene gives the option to firewall all connections not on VPN
06:32:37 <TheJollyRoger> It won't protect against action based phishing.
06:32:46 <strcat[m]> FDE won't protect you if they come in and compromise it
06:32:56 <strcat[m]> or if they come in when it's powered up and just locked and they are resourceful
06:33:21 <strcat[m]> it's to secure against theft of the data when it's off (or at least make it really hard if it's locked and has hardware security features applied)
06:33:23 <TheJollyRoger> I have a funny story about one of my former roommates doing that >_<.
06:33:36 <TheJollyRoger> (Roommate prank war)
06:33:58 <strcat[m]> an easy way is just plug in a malicious usb device, can be really hidden
06:34:08 <strcat[m]> a usb device can say it's a monitor and keyboard
06:34:11 <strcat[m]> and have a radio inside
06:34:19 <strcat[m]> now it can record your screen and enter arbitrary commands
06:35:17 <strcat[m]> similarly can just capture keyboard entered data that way
06:35:42 <strcat[m]> for a smartphone consider them doing something like replacing your touchscreen...
06:35:45 <strcat[m]> with a malicious one
06:36:01 <strcat[m]> so they can see everything and do whatever input they want
06:36:04 <strcat[m]> how are you going to defend against that
06:36:15 <strcat[m]> aside from pairing all the hardware to make it somewhat harder...
06:36:27 <danvittegleo[m]> another random question, what does everyone use for a desk/chair setup at home? any recommendations?
06:36:42 <TheJollyRoger> danvittegleo[m]: I really wanted to get a Raynor Ergohuman but they're really expensive.
06:36:56 <renlord> strcat[m]: wouldnt the default udev rules block that?
06:37:05 <violadivias> JTL: 010 editor is pretty slick but not free 30 day trial i might only need it a few hours anyway :)
06:37:06 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: I bought a super long / narrow dining table on etsy and had them space out the legs more
06:37:34 <TheJollyRoger> I just uh... have an ordinary desk from IKEA. >_<.
06:37:45 <renlord> i just use the public park
06:37:46 <danvittegleo[m]> TheJollyRoger: oh dang, yeah that looks nice! $$$
06:38:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah they're really amazing but... YEAH the money!
06:38:24 <TheJollyRoger> I ended up buying a shitty knockoff instead X( Learn from my mistakes!
06:39:10 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah, i'm thinking i might properly invest in something this time around. i have done the shitty knockoff approach before
06:39:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah X(
06:39:48 <strcat[m]> I don't like any of the brand name desks really
06:40:14 <renlord> just get a $5 plastic folding desk
06:40:22 <renlord> and chuck it when you dont need it anymore
06:40:24 <strcat[m]> just want a proper size long block of wood with nice strong / stable metal legs
06:40:52 <strcat[m]> so I just bought that from a fairly local carpenter on etsy
06:41:35 <joshman[m]> I use bed as my chair/desk combo. No chair can help my bulged discs problem
06:41:44 <danvittegleo[m]> lol, i guess i'm getting old. i used to think i'd just sit on whatever
06:41:59 <renlord> just stand then
06:42:08 <renlord> when your legs get tired, you're probably due for a break anyways
06:42:29 <joshman[m]> I do! I either stand at lie
06:42:38 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah, i like alternating between the two
06:42:39 <joshman[m]> * I do! I either stand or lie
06:42:56 <danvittegleo[m]> but i don't have any office at the moment, so my covid office has been laying in bed. which hasn't been great
06:43:07 <danvittegleo[m]> don't recommend
06:43:12 <TheJollyRoger> Oh X(
06:43:34 <TheJollyRoger> I've been wanting to design a desk, but time has been a constraint. :(
06:44:00 <TheJollyRoger> I was gonna just use off the shelf parts and chairs and put the monitors suspended on a rack made from pipes which I could cut and weld myself.
06:44:30 <strcat[m]> get an old flat door and put it across milk crates? lol
06:44:41 <TheJollyRoger> X)
06:44:42 <strcat[m]> the free desk
06:44:47 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
06:44:50 <renlord> flat door can sell for a good price
06:45:16 <renlord> still more expensive than my $5 plastic folding table
06:45:25 <renlord> that might fold on you if things are too heavy
06:45:43 <danvittegleo[m]> hahaha
06:45:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <TheJollyRoger "I've been wanting to design a de"> Autonomous.ai has some nice parts
06:45:57 <TheJollyRoger> Oh no ahaha
06:46:00 <TheJollyRoger> Ooh
06:46:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/diy-smart-desk-kit
06:47:52 <danvittegleo[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: looks like a decent option
06:48:58 <renlord> even a desk now sells on *.ai domain
06:49:01 <renlord> wtf
06:49:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> That plus your Home Depot door and drilling some cable holes, pretty tight
06:49:31 <renlord> if you guys didnt recommend this, i'd have thought its a scam site
06:49:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hotdamn :)
06:49:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, I thought so, too. Saw them when they first started out....on a fucking Facebook ad ducks
06:51:19 <danvittegleo[m]> most of the electronic adjustable desks i've seen are like 500-1000.. pretty crazy
06:52:36 <renlord> ikea sells a hand crank adjustable desk for $249
06:53:20 <danvittegleo[m]> like i want to say that i'm not lazy and i'd use that, but i think i'd just leave it in one place if i had to hand crank it lol
06:54:27 <joshman[m]> <renlord "if you guys didnt recommend this"> I like how you trust this room. This is definitely something in times when public rooms are crowded with bots and scammers from India, Nigeria and others
06:55:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> josh.man: I don't think he trusts the room as much as my username, mate
06:56:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> What's up with you, anyhow, josh.man? You using GrapheneOS? Here to learn?
07:10:34 <joshman[m]> Using GOS as my daily beater
07:10:35 <joshman[m]> While iPhone XS is collecting dust
07:11:22 <joshman[m]> Here to learn, support and help as far as my ability goes
07:14:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > While iPhone XS is collecting dust
07:14:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Haha, sell that bitch while it still has any market value, and save it for the next Pixel!
07:14:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Or, send to Graphene ;P
07:15:41 <danvittegleo[m]> i think as soon as the iphone se landed it probably ruined some of the market value
07:18:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Different market, a bit, innit? The SE is lower size/res/specs, for the people like us not living on Snapchat, lol
07:21:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wow 1.4k messages
07:21:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> This chat sure as hell became active
07:27:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE SILENCED
07:27:51 <DannyWorkOrderPr> JUST TOLD THAT THEY'RE DUMB, AND TO PROBABLY REEVALUATE THEIR VIEWS ON FIREFOX
07:39:58 <danvittegleo[m]> ok another random question, how does everyone manage tabs in their browser
07:41:47 <danvittegleo[m]> i have two methods and they both suck, keep opening tabs until i can't see icons anymore and then close all the tabs or try to close at regular intervals
07:42:35 <danvittegleo[m]> i like firefox tree tabs, the nested nature makes more sense to me.
07:48:15 <TheJollyRoger> Oh uh...
07:48:20 <TheJollyRoger> Woah, I didn't know that was doable.
07:53:05 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah i like that functionality - have been using this extension (https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery) for a while when i'm using firefox.
07:53:35 <danvittegleo[m]> firefox also catches my macbook on fire, so don't always use it.
08:00:39 <joshman[m]> I just keep couple browser windows open with a bunch of tabs  in it. As I don't have external display I also like using Manjaro's second desktop function to separate work and not so work
08:23:09 * TheJollyRoger gets the fire extinguisher!
09:27:34 <mrxx_0[m]> Hey, I have a question not related yo graphene on SSH connexion on a server
09:32:17 * mrxx_0[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nqmPGxDupznvYmnsjClqyfvF >
09:35:27 <limitless0[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): not sure if its os bug or signal bug.have installed Geometric weather and when set up to display forecast on screen at specific time notification then the message on signal aswell shows its contents when on settings its set to not display content on lock screen
09:36:21 <limitless0[m]> Only had signal notification on screen at the time so not sure if happens with other apps
09:39:28 <limitless0[m]> The settings on Geometric weather are: send alert notification on,send precipitation notification on,forecast for today on,
09:40:26 <limitless0[m]> If anyone interested to try it if this happens  only on my device or
09:44:19 <nscnt> limitless0[m]: What's the issue exactyl? You have "Show sensitive content only when unlocked" activated in the 'Privacy' settings of the system and since you turned on the forecast of your Weather app, the contents of Signal messages show up too?
09:44:28 <nscnt> *exactly
09:44:50 <nscnt> ... even if it's unlocked.
09:45:09 <nscnt> *even if it's locked
09:46:10 <limitless0[m]> Its that normal then?
09:46:40 <nscnt> No, I just asked if that's what's happening
09:47:39 <limitless0[m]> Yes thats whats happeninh
09:47:52 <nscnt> Your phone is locked and Signal messages show its content since you turned on the forecast?
09:48:00 <limitless0[m]> Yes
09:48:30 <limitless0[m]> You can try it yourself
09:48:31 <nscnt> Mh idk... Could you check if the Privacy setting has been changed?
09:49:04 <limitless0[m]> Its still set at dont show until unlocked
09:50:41 <nscnt> I'll try to reproduce
10:25:17 <nscnt> limitless0[m]: I can't get it working to recieve 'Forecast for today' at all. I tried a lot ^^
10:44:05 <limitless0[m]> <nscnt "limitless0: I can't get it worki"> Underneath Forecast for today its the option of the time of notification
10:44:44 <nscnt> limitless0[m]: I know. Still doesn't work for me.
10:45:30 <limitless0[m]> At the top Send alert notification? Havr you turned that on
10:45:52 <nscnt> limitless0[m]: Yes.
10:49:31 <limitless0[m]> Set it on again lets say in 2 mins
10:50:04 <nscnt> Trying
10:51:51 <limitless0[m]> The setting bakground free on the very top should be off
10:53:02 <nscnt> I got something, let me try again
10:57:35 <nscnt> limitless0[m]: I've reproduced. Your issue is invalid for me.
10:59:30 <limitless0[m]> So your notification it doesnt show content ?
11:01:13 <nscnt> limitless0[m]: No, my notifications doesn't show content. I tested it with a pending message notification from Signal.
11:03:27 <nscnt> *don't show
11:10:41 <limitless0[m]> <nscnt "limitless0: No, my notifications"> Uninstalled and installed again and its back to normal again it seems,strange .thanks for testing it anyway
11:17:00 <nscnt> limitless0[m]: No problem. c:
12:05:32 <renor[m]> I can't get to work my Solokey (U2F Fido2 key) on GOS. Not via NFC nor via usb-c. Is this feature disabled or smthing?
12:35:41 <mrkeithogs[m]> hey guys
12:35:58 <mrkeithogs[m]> i am having protobuf error anyone able to help
12:41:26 <cdesai> pip install python2-protobuf
12:43:36 <mrkeithogs[m]> many thanks
12:58:09 <mxnorvak[m]> I can't believe i just read all the chats up to now
13:10:15 <mxnorvak[m]> Do you guys use fingerprint as your screen lock ?
13:10:25 <cdesai> uhh https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+log/a3dbf493598a2a57808075806295739bd77833a1
13:10:32 <cdesai> looks like they messed up the kernel tags
13:21:08 <nscnt> mxnorvak[m]: I do.
13:21:59 <nscnt> mxnorvak[m]: There's this argument that one could record what you type in which makes fingerprint safer in that scenario.
13:22:55 <nscnt> I do it because it's super fast and it's safe for my threat model.
13:24:05 <mxnorvak[m]> <nscnt "mxnorvak: There's this argument "> Ive heard many  arguments for and against it
13:24:25 <nscnt> No doubt.
13:24:52 <mxnorvak[m]> One being your fingerprint is just as secure as your backup method for unlocking the screen
13:25:46 <nscnt> That's true. I cover that as well.
13:26:02 <mxnorvak[m]> And that if passwords get leaked you can easily change it but if fingerprint gets leaked,its a biological data about you that is out and you can't do anything about it
13:26:36 <mxnorvak[m]> But its just so easy and fast
13:27:17 <mxnorvak[m]> Tried only unlocking via password, a relatively long one and it was a pain tbh
13:28:35 <nscnt> The last one is not real threat to me. It just doesn't happen that someone copies my fingerprint from e.g. a glass in a restaurant and tries to that for it.
13:28:43 <nscnt> I'm a boring phone user.
13:29:10 <nscnt> I don't really have anything sensible on it. There's no reason for it.
13:31:05 <nscnt> No one cares about me as a special target and I think I'm pretty safe from some widely targeted attacks.
13:31:51 <nscnt> And I just noticed I'm missing whole words in my sentences ._.
13:37:07 <nscnt> mxnorvak[m]: What's that about leaking the fingerprint? Is it about: People collecting fingerprints from glasses and put it up into databases? Or how does it work?

16:50:45 <tentbot[m]> Anyone know a good solution for encrypting individual files/photos on Graphene? For example, I don't want all apps with storage permission to see all my photos.
16:51:06 <strcat> don't give them the legacy storage permission
16:51:12 <strcat> or run apps requiring it in a separate profile
16:51:47 <strcat> the storage permission isn't available to modern apps, only legacy ones either targeting an old API level or opting into the legacy storage model - which stops being an option at the next API level
16:52:28 <strcat> I strongly recommend not giving it to them and trying to work around it - are you going to manually encrypt photos after the camera app already puts them there? not going to work, just don't give apps access to that
17:02:51 <tentbot[m]> Thanks
17:04:06 <strcat[m]> cx2: last verified time is working here - are you sure you're looking at the correct device entry
17:04:12 <strcat[m]> if you repaired it, that's a new device entry
17:04:31 <strcat[m]> the ID is generated when it pairs, it's the fingerprint of the public key for the hardware-backed key it makes when pairing
17:04:50 <strcat[m]> cx2: if you disabled remote attestation, that *deletes* the pairing, and when you enable it again that makes a new one
17:05:05 <strcat[m]> cx2: check if you have multiple devices and delete the ones for the old pairings
17:05:32 <strcat[m]> the site can't know if it's supposed to be deleted - it just stops receiving attestations from that device
17:05:43 <strcat[m]> so when you disable it on the device need to delete it there
17:06:25 <cx2[m]> Will try that now.
17:07:02 <strcat> cx2[m]: I'd guess you just have multiple pairings and you need to delete all but latest
17:07:19 <TheJollyRoger-M> <renor[m] "I can't get to work my Solokey ("> At this moment some u2f functions might be dependent on code in Play services, which is absent. Think new code will need to be written to replace it.
17:09:30 <cx2[m]> strcat fixed. Good call...I'm an idiot. Probably could have scrolled down to figure that out....
17:09:30 <cx2[m]> Now if only someone could tell me how I managed to put the grub on a USB drive, I'd be super stoked 😕
17:09:56 <strcat[m]> could add this to the attestation.app tutorial page among other things
17:12:25 <TheJollyRoger-M> <strcat[m] "could add this to the attestatio"> Yes captain!
17:17:42 <jussa> Hey guys
17:18:23 <TheJollyRoger> AHoy!
17:22:51 <jussa> privileged apps included in the base system with READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE
17:23:12 <jussa> can they acess hardware identigiers?
17:23:17 <jussa> identifiers?
17:23:27 <jussa> on graphene
17:23:42 <jussa> or can you edit the whitelist for example
17:24:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Please see: https://matrix.to/#/!omAJrepvwSfkXJrqbK:matrix.org/$158827271611880666BevcU:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=privacytools.io&via=librem.one
17:25:57 <jussa> lol
17:26:14 <jussa> id rather just an answer than stranger givin a link
17:27:43 <madaidan[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Please see: https://matrix.to/#/"> That's not what he's talking about
17:28:07 <madaidan[m]> Privileged apps included in the base system with READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE can access hardware identifiers.
17:28:58 <jussa> and you cant block them?
17:29:08 <jussa> from accessing hw ids
17:29:13 <jussa> on graphene
17:30:03 <strcat> GrapheneOS 2020.05.05.02 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.05.05.02.
17:30:15 <strcat> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1257724078359789572
17:30:28 <strcat> jussa: you're talking about the OS itself
17:30:38 <strcat> jussa: privileged apps == the OS itself
17:31:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: THANK YOU for your work!
17:31:26 <madaidan[m]> <jussa "and you cant block them?"> Why would you? If the base system is malicious then you've far bigger things to worry about.
17:31:41 <strcat> GrapheneOS 2020.05.05.02 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.05.05.02
17:35:07 <jussa> base system equals isp cellular tracking
17:35:26 <jussa> through use of certain apps
17:35:44 <strcat> jussa: not sure what you're talking about
17:35:46 <madaidan[m]> <jussa "base system equals isp cellular "> That doesn't even make sense
17:35:53 <jussa> yes
17:36:06 <jussa> as priviledged system base apps
17:36:18 <jussa> work i presume
17:36:26 <strcat> jussa: the OS has access to *everything*, it purposely divides things up into sandboxed apps with permissions to sandbox things
17:36:29 <jussa> in conjuction with many normalapps
17:36:42 <strcat> jussa: privileged apps are components of the OS
17:36:48 <strcat> they are part of GrapheneOS, they are not third party apps
17:37:09 <strcat> there is no such thing as a third party privileged app - they can only be part of the OS
17:37:22 <strcat> those apps are part of the OS implementation
17:37:34 <jussa> and these apps and their access cannot be controlled say through cellular tracking , infiltration
17:37:39 <jussa> ?
17:38:04 <jussa> yeah talkin about parts of the os
17:39:07 <strcat> jussa: do you understand that the OS fundamentally has access to that data and prevents third party apps, etc. from getting it?
17:39:11 <strcat> those privileged apps are part of the OS
17:39:20 <jussa> ok
17:39:52 <jussa> but cellular connection is controlled by a "BASE APP" i presume?
17:40:32 <jussa> i understand and read all that
17:41:00 <strcat> the OS is split up into a bunch of different sandboxed processes and apps
17:41:24 <strcat> only a tiny few super core processes (vold, init, etc.) have actual root access and it isn't available to other things
17:41:49 <strcat> everything else is sandboxed and uses privilege separation, i.e. code is only given access to what it needs to function
17:42:06 <jussa> Ok
17:42:09 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: if you were to block those privileged operating system components from accessing what they need to do their jobs, then they aren't going to be able to do their jobs and your device isn't going to work.
17:42:29 <TheJollyRoger> At least, not in the way you probably want it to do.
17:42:30 <strcat> code is placed into apps to use the app sandbox and allow out-of-band updates via apps (although GrapheneOS doesn't use it for out-of-band updates)
17:43:05 <strcat> there are also "APEX components" which cover the things that aren't app-based components - although we use flattened APEX components since we don't do out-of-band updates via that
17:43:14 <strcat> we just do reliable OS updates
17:43:25 <strcat> don't need to update individual packages
17:43:35 <jussa> yeah well you could have an app that spoofs hw ids at the core for all apps out of user choice
17:44:00 <strcat> jussa: hardware ids are not available to third party apps, only the OS
17:44:01 <jussa> even core
17:44:17 <strcat> jussa: the apps included in the OS are part of the OS implementation, it doesn't make sense to spoof anything to them
17:44:17 <jussa> ye well the os is not unpenetrable
17:44:22 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: if you were to engage in SIM Spoofing, then you will not have cellular data because your cellphone provider won't know that you've paid your bills for that month.
17:44:26 <strcat> that's why it's divided up into sandboxed components
17:44:38 <strcat> if those components did not need access to the data they wouldn't have access to it
17:44:53 <jussa> no the spoofed ids just need to be correct
17:44:55 <strcat> it makes no sense to spoof anything to OS components
17:44:58 <strcat> no, it doesn't make any sense
17:45:06 <jussa> as has been done with
17:45:08 <strcat> if an OS component doesn't need access to data, the access would just be taken away
17:45:20 <jussa> huawei e5770 custom firmware
17:45:20 <strcat> it makes 0 sense to spoof anything to an OS component
17:45:38 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: then you're impersonating other people's devices and stealing other people's cellphone data.
17:45:40 <strcat> we control the OS components, we decide what permissions they have and control their code
17:45:57 <jussa> no...
17:46:05 <jussa> im refering to imei mainly
17:46:13 <strcat> so if an app doesn't need access to the privileged phone state, we would just take it away
17:46:21 <strcat> but it's OUR CODE under our control either way
17:46:26 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: the sandboxing is enforced by the SELinux Kernel. Breaking kernel sandboxing would require /breaking Linux/.
17:46:27 <jussa> and no theres plenty of unused aceptable values
17:46:36 <strcat> jussa: which app are you talking about
17:46:38 <strcat> which OS component
17:46:51 <strcat> if it doesn't need access to READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE it can be taken away
17:47:18 <strcat> it does not make sense to spoof anything to OS components - they're our components, and we can just have them stop using it if it's unnecessary
17:47:20 <jussa> i guess modem controls
17:47:24 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: There are no third-party apps that have access to that permission.
17:47:24 <strcat> which app do you think doesn't need access to it
17:47:45 <jussa> it needs acces
17:48:03 <jussa> but why can it not be modifiable
17:48:20 <strcat> it is modifiable, it's our code, if it doesn't need access we can change the manifest of the app
17:48:26 <jussa> if some1 with ethics maintains such brnach
17:48:36 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: what do you mean "modem controls?" There's airplane mode, which will stop the device from dialing out.
17:48:41 <strcat> which OS component doesn't need access to it
17:48:44 <strcat> let me know
17:48:46 <strcat> submit a patch
17:48:51 <jussa> cellular modem...
17:48:52 <TheJollyRoger> be /specific/ and send in a PR.
17:48:58 <strcat> jussa: no clue what you mean
17:49:04 <strcat> the modem is the thing PROVIDING the id to the OS
17:49:17 <strcat> the OS asks the modem what the IMEI is - the modem is what provides that to the OS
17:49:27 <strcat> and the OS does not give that info away to anything
17:49:31 <strcat> it uses it to implement cellular support
17:50:07 <strcat> the OS implements a lot of the support for traditional calls/texts via apps - including privileged apps, which do things third party apps cannot do, because they are OS components
17:50:12 <strcat> and they are required for the functionality to work
17:50:24 <strcat> if you don't need those apps you're free to disable them
17:50:28 <jussa> pixel has hw cellular modem controls like all phones ?
17:50:41 <strcat> the modem knows the IMEI already, it is the modem after all
17:50:48 <jussa> hardware code
17:50:50 <strcat> it is the thing that tells the OS the IMEI
17:50:50 <jussa> yeah
17:50:53 <TheJollyRoger> And as before: breaking out of the sandbox would require /breaking the kernel./ It's not a polite suggestion to the app, the kernel is what gives the app the resources it needs to do something. It can just as easily take it away.
17:51:05 <strcat> jussa: I don't know what you're trying to suggest
17:51:12 <strcat> which app are you talking about
17:51:19 <strcat> give the app id or at least the app name
17:51:19 <jussa> not app
17:51:25 <strcat> of the app that you think doesn't need access but has it
17:51:30 <jussa> ah
17:51:31 <jussa> thay
17:51:34 <jussa> that
17:51:40 <jussa> well let me check
17:51:47 <TheJollyRoger> The Modem itself is also isolated from the host via IOMMU, if that's what you're wondering about. The modem *does not* control the phone. It can write to memory only into the values that the driver for the modem *specifically allows it to*.
17:51:50 <strcat> if it would work with it spoofed then it could just have the access taken away
17:51:54 <strcat> there is no reason to spoof it
17:52:07 <strcat> lets say that spoofing to one of the OS components does not break anything
17:52:18 <strcat> then clearly there is no reason to give it the permission... so why would we spoof it
17:52:31 <strcat> just remove the unnecessary permission / code or even the whole app if it doesn't do anything useful
17:52:58 <strcat> we already omit apps for things like Sprint support and carrier auto-configuration because we don't like the design
17:53:04 <jussa> aslong as it doesnt stop cellular data from workin
17:53:08 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: if you want to stub out those values in the OS, feel free to, just please don't be surprised when you've ended up recreating an expensive iPod Touch 2020 edition.
17:53:08 <jussa> ye ok ill do it
17:53:26 <strcat> you can just enable airplane mode
17:53:36 <jussa> i know
17:53:46 <jussa> but i was wondering
17:54:53 <jussa> are the huawei lte usb wlan modems only devices with imei non-hardware coded
17:55:16 <jussa> and other modem info
17:55:22 <jussa> ids
17:56:20 <jussa> just trying to search for absoluteprivacy and still hmm..casuality
17:56:22 <jussa> lol
17:56:35 <jussa> with cellular data
17:57:15 <jussa> i know its the law (as i rmbr)
17:57:27 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: the cellular data network is designed to be able to understand who paid their bills that month and connect to devices that have.
17:57:43 <jussa> hey
17:57:54 <jussa> prepaids
17:58:09 <jussa> thats past the point
17:58:13 <TheJollyRoger> Still paid. Where do you think that $5 voucher goes to?
17:58:13 <madaidan[m]> <jussa "just trying to search for absolu"> Absolute privacy doesn't exist
17:58:32 <jussa> atleast anonymous paid it
17:59:53 <jussa> well librem 5 and airplane mode graphneneos with huawei e5770 are the only options
18:00:01 <jussa> i guess then
18:00:03 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: let me give you a simple experiment: go buy one of those $5 prepaid vouchers, but instead of topping up your own number, mash numbers at random and see if the voucher made it into your account balance.
18:00:05 <jussa> shame
18:00:08 <mxnorvak[m]> <nscnt "mxnorvak: What's that about leak"> There has been cases when ppl have been able to create someones fingerprint from photo or just the finger print they have left on a glass or something, it is doable but i guess we'd be back at the threat model situation and considering if you're someone who may be a target
18:00:09 <TheJollyRoger> librem5 gives you even worse privacy.
18:00:33 <jussa> nope
18:00:39 <jussa> the os yes
18:00:41 <strcat> the librem 5 has a proprietary SoC, modem and firmware just like other phones
18:00:42 <TheJollyRoger> Since the device is inherently insecure and broken.
18:00:49 <strcat> but unlike other devices
18:00:49 <jussa> but you change the os
18:00:53 <strcat> they prevented updating the firmware
18:01:01 <jussa> no its gnu compliant
18:01:01 <strcat> jussa: does not fix the firmware and hardware security problems
18:01:04 <jussa> hardware
18:01:05 <jussa> also
18:01:07 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: no, the firmware is a part of the phone because they've baked it into read only memory more privileged than the host.
18:01:14 <strcat> jussa: it's fully proprietary hardware and firmware
18:01:19 <strcat> please don't spread misinformation about this
18:01:23 <jussa> librem 5?
18:01:25 <strcat> there is nothing open about the hardware
18:01:32 <strcat> yes, there is nothing open about the hardware or firmware
18:01:33 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: no, the hardware is proprietary, they've just gamed the definition of "libre" hardware by a loophole by permanently burning the firmware into it.
18:01:36 <strcat> none of the components is open
18:01:36 <jussa> really?
18:01:39 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
18:01:39 <strcat> really
18:01:42 <strcat> there is nothing open about it
18:01:45 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: allow me to explain:
18:01:47 <strcat> there is no such thing as an open ARM SoC
18:01:58 <jussa> pinephone then?
18:02:00 <strcat> every ARM SoC is and will be proprietary, they are entirely a proprietary chip
18:02:00 <madaidan[m]> The Librem 5 is a massive degradation from any standard Android/iOS device
18:02:02 <jussa> neo-900?
18:02:03 <strcat> jussa: not open hardware either
18:02:07 <strcat> none of those is at all open hardware
18:02:14 <jussa> ah fuck
18:02:17 <mxnorvak[m]> <nscnt "mxnorvak: What's that about leak"> And i watched a video that suggested biometric data used as security measures have been leaked before from the servers they were stored at, I will give u the link
18:02:19 <madaidan[m]> All linux phones are terrible
18:02:20 <TheJollyRoger> The Free Software Foundation has a "secondary processor exemption" which means that provided that blobs are not a part of the operating system, they don't "count."
18:02:23 <strcat> the only thing open about the pinephone is the schematic for the case/board
18:02:27 <strcat> ALL OF THE COMPONENTS on that
18:02:33 <strcat> including the modem, SoC, Wi-Fi, etc.
18:02:35 <strcat> are proprietary
18:02:40 <madaidan[m]> There's no linux phone with a sane security model
18:02:51 <TheJollyRoger> So what they did, is they simply permanently put the proprietary firmware OUTSIDE OF THE HOST'S CONTROL and load it before the OS does,
18:02:53 <strcat> jussa: pinephone at least doesn't prevent updating firmware like the librem 5
18:02:57 <TheJollyRoger> to give you THE ILLUSION OF open ness.
18:03:03 <strcat> but it has a really insecure SoC
18:03:09 <jussa> librem 5 has devkit
18:03:12 <strcat> and EITHER DEVICE cannot support actual GrapheneOS
18:03:13 <jussa> so u can
18:03:13 <TheJollyRoger> And this is by design because they want to get the "RYF certification."
18:03:32 <strcat> they do not support verified boot, hardware-backed keystore, the hardware encryption support, etc.
18:03:42 <strcat> it won't just make the OS insecure - apps using the hardware keystore will not be able to function
18:03:51 <jussa> cat, hardware wise?
18:03:56 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: no the firmware is permanently flashed into write-protected EEPROM, and it's signed and verified by the SOC anyways.
18:03:56 <strcat> you would have to use a fake hardware keystore implementation that's actually software
18:04:08 <strcat> among other things
18:04:16 <jussa> check the devkit
18:04:18 <TheJollyRoger> So even if you had the source code if you don't have those signing keys belonging to NXP Semiconductors, you /cannot/
18:04:18 <strcat> it simply doesn't support the privacy/security features needed for GrapheneOS
18:04:21 <mxnorvak[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "And i watched a video that sugge"> Idk if what he mentions is true tho, but still there was a sentence about fingerprints that made sense which was "its stupid to use something that you leave everywhere as a security token "
18:04:39 <strcat> jussa: I'm well aware of what it provides, you aren't, you're just making assumptions and repeating misinformation about it

18:05:15 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: the wiring diagrams for the Librem5 aren't even interesting considering they're only the wiring schematics and everything else on them is proprietary and complete black boxes.
18:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: then please, listen to him.
18:05:25 <madaidan[m]> Purism is a dishonest company focused on misleading people into buying their privacy/security theater
18:05:29 <jussa> i am
18:05:51 <jussa> why i mentioned librem
18:06:06 <jussa> was cause of super simplicity of changing modem
18:06:10 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: "listening" means being willing to let go of previously held viewpoints - we're presenting you with why librem is "lie-brem."
18:06:25 <jussa> give that
18:06:28 <jussa> for pixel
18:06:33 <strcat> https://developer.puri.sm/Librem5/Hardware_Reference/Birch.html#components every single digital component here is proprietary
18:06:43 <jussa> and would be great
18:06:51 <jussa> ok i didnt know
18:07:03 <jussa> they spread misinfo
18:07:05 <TheJollyRoger> Purism likes to deliberately omit these subtle nuances from its slick marketing.
18:07:07 <jussa> or impressions
18:07:07 <strcat> and by digital I mean all the chips
18:07:12 <strcat> every component
18:07:16 <TheJollyRoger> They basically openwash.
18:07:44 <strcat> we are not going to officially support a device that is less private, substantially less secure and cannot support all the basic security features including APIs required by apps
18:07:51 <jussa> u can change modem with ease , just saying its plus
18:07:54 <strcat> especially when it cannot have vulnerabilities patched
18:08:23 <strcat> jussa: I don't consider that a plus, when we make our own hardware we want to do pairing like the iPhone
18:08:33 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: what, dismantle the device, physically throw away a perfectly good component, buy another?
18:08:38 <jussa> and no1 commented on the huawei e5770 custom firmwares
18:08:59 <jussa> where the modem ids are not hardware coded
18:08:59 <strcat> I don't know what a huawei e5770 is can't comment on it
18:09:21 <jussa> its 4g usb modem
18:09:48 <jussa> usb otg works on pixel?
18:09:52 <strcat> yes
18:09:57 <jussa> great
18:10:05 <jussa> well goood
18:10:33 <strcat> and you can use airplane mode to disable the cellular radio
18:10:54 <jussa> usb to miocrousb adapter and voila , disable wlan enable openvpn in the modem plug in
18:11:23 <strcat> the Qualcomm modem in the device is going to be more secure / hardened
18:11:28 <jussa> change ids when u want
18:11:52 <strcat> jussa: are you sure this device actually supports changing the ID? because the regulations on modems don't allow it
18:11:56 <strcat> that's why it's generally not possible
18:12:01 <jussa> yeah
18:12:05 <jussa> thats why
18:12:12 <jussa> it was in the news
18:12:23 <jussa> talkiin about huawei beinf accessory
18:12:30 <jussa> to chinas legislated spying
18:12:50 <jussa> due to such devices
18:12:59 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, oh boy here we go again.
18:13:03 <jussa> just a tip for u guys too
18:13:59 <jussa> airplane mode and carry that along with pixel is kinda
18:14:03 <strcat> which news article
18:14:08 <jussa> anonymous?
18:14:14 <strcat> SIM cards have an id too
18:14:20 <jussa> i know
18:14:27 <jussa> sim cards change
18:14:37 <strcat> and there are other ways to identify a radio besides an ID like that
18:14:39 <strcat> for example
18:14:57 <jussa> y but this guy has though about many things
18:14:57 <strcat> using MAC randomization with Wi-Fi cannot usually provide anonymity due to other identifiers
18:15:06 <strcat> MAC is not the only ID
18:15:09 * TheJollyRoger watches jussa get ready to stand out like a sore thumb.
18:15:12 <strcat> the only ID usually controllable by the OS? yes
18:15:13 <jussa> ye uwont use widi
18:15:21 <jussa> u wont use wifi
18:15:23 <strcat> I'm giving Wi-Fi as an example
18:15:32 <strcat> the Wi-Fi hardware and firmware on Pixels supports anonymous usage
18:15:39 <strcat> I'm saying that elsewhere, it doesn't tend to work
18:15:49 <strcat> Broadcom Wi-Fi doesn't support anonymity for example
18:16:08 <jussa> sure
18:16:09 <strcat> and I am not sure if Qualcomm Atheros Wi-Fi supports it elsewhere
18:16:19 <jussa> but wifi is not secure no matter what
18:16:22 <strcat> the best way to use the device anonymously is to use airplane mode + Wi-Fi
18:16:35 <strcat> jussa: you are far better off using Wi-Fi than some insecure third party cellular radio
18:16:37 <jussa> yes with your home router
18:16:41 <strcat> Wi-Fi is well isolated too

18:16:52 <strcat> how is Wi-Fi not portable?
18:17:16 <jussa> your home isp wire connewcrtion
18:17:18 <strcat> I really recommend using Wi-Fi if you want to remain anonymous
18:17:37 <TheJollyRoger> And not doing any "custom tuning"
18:17:42 <strcat> IMEI is not the only identifier for a cellular radio
18:17:44 <jussa> youve done
18:17:49 <jussa> any pen testing?
18:17:53 <strcat> yes
18:17:58 <jussa> usb otg
18:18:06 <jussa> disable wlan on the huawei
18:18:17 <jussa> monitor etc
18:18:26 <jussa> ofc its safer
18:18:43 <strcat> USB has more attack surface than Wi-Fi in the device
18:18:47 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "how is Wi-Fi not portable?"> Need to be near a router
18:18:57 <jussa> i know
18:19:16 <jussa> but lol
18:19:24 <jussa> u keep it tight
18:19:28 <jussa> in there
18:19:46 <jussa> n nothin else
18:19:56 <strcat> Wi-Fi firmware runs in a sandbox on the baseband
18:20:08 <cyborgninjaneer[> What's the best practice if you can't live without cell radio?
18:20:09 <strcat> has somewhat modern mitigations
18:20:11 <jussa> usb is not sandboxed<?
18:20:25 <strcat> jussa: the USB firmware is sandboxed but the kernel has a huge amount of attack surface exposed
18:20:31 <TheJollyRoger> jussa:  consider this - you're attaching a second computer to your device, and now if that little dongle becomes untrustworthy (after all, it is a small computer),
18:20:49 <jussa> i know
18:20:50 <TheJollyRoger> by design, guess what else it can become?
18:21:00 <strcat> you want to avoid being tracked
18:21:03 <jussa> u keep it in your comp
18:21:03 <strcat> if they compromised the radio
18:21:08 <strcat> they can track you like that
18:21:08 <jussa> only
18:21:16 <strcat> the radio on the device has no persistent code that's not verified
18:21:20 <strcat> and is well sandboxed
18:21:25 <TheJollyRoger> jussa: you're not listening.
18:21:33 <strcat> the external radio you're talking about is clearly super insecure and poorly implemented
18:21:36 <strcat> so lets say it gets compromised
18:21:38 <jussa> i listen
18:21:48 <strcat> now they have the real IMEI and code running on it
18:21:49 <strcat> to track you
18:21:55 <strcat> they don't even need to compromise GrapheneOS / the phone
18:22:08 <strcat> compromising the radio is enough to track someone
18:22:24 <TheJollyRoger> That radio is handling attacker-controlled input.
18:22:25 <strcat> it's good that the radios in the device are isolated but it's not a substitute for them being kept up-to-date
18:22:27 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: Saw someone claiming yesterday that the Librem's imx8mq can be flashed via USB-C in USB download mode, without opening it up, but I've yet to find a procedure/any discussion about this.

18:24:08 <strcat> jussa: that is not what I said...
18:24:15 <strcat> jussa: I clearly didn't say you can't replace the OS
18:24:28 <strcat> I was talking about how they've made it so it's not possible to ship full security updates for the device
18:24:43 <strcat> full security updates includes updating the firmware for components
18:24:47 <strcat> which is incredibly important
18:24:47 <jussa> it has inbuilt openvpn

18:28:32 <tarekkk> I'm using adb portable 1.4.3

18:29:15 <TheJollyRoger> And tell me what it returns?
18:29:16 <jussa> not rdy
18:29:28 <jussa> and they tell that clearly

18:29:36 <strcat> pinephone is not deliberately insecure and they are purposely using super cheap hardware, and they aren't very focused on providing modern security but they aren't claiming that they are most of the time at least

18:51:59 <jussa_> yeah
18:52:03 <jussa_> exactly
18:52:06 <minoas[m]> @jussa: if you are concern about being tracked just use a burner. buy a few cheap/slightly damaged pixels 2, install graphene on them, prepaid sim and vpn and use them as hotspots to your main device
18:52:47 <jussa_> hmm
18:52:49 <minoas[m]> ditch them as often as you can afford
18:53:11 <jussa_> can i usb tether from pizwl to another
18:53:49 <jussa_> but i cant buy new or old pixels alll the time just for the principle ofprivafcy
18:53:52 <jussa_> <.d
18:54:07 <jussa_> im not bein ttracked
18:55:08 <jussa_> how are u gonna fund the hardware development for graphene
18:55:09 <jussa_> ?
18:56:20 <jussa_> crowdfund to set up open, volunteer organisation of devs n specialists , rent a woekings space
18:56:27 <jussa_> ?
18:56:54 <minoas[m]> privacy is a bit of a luxury today. then change them once every few months. one with a cracked screen should not be that expensive. wifi is safe but you can also share internet through Bluetooth . i think usb internet sharing only works for laptops
18:57:39 <jussa_> mon3y onl7 for parts n manufaxturing and rent and necesssaery equipment

18:59:01 <jussa_> i know parties willing to donate to get u at it, n not just couple of bucks. why dont u setup a crowdfund alrdy
18:59:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> WiFi is safe is probably a simplification...the fact that the packets are broadcasting the password constantly for capture and decryption is woof. Change your passkey regularly, if using hotspot, is a good practice.
18:59:13 <minoas[m]> you can sell them afterwards and recoup most of your cash
18:59:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> jussa_: It's coming, strcat was discussing it for legal defense just last night. Time is a scarce resource.

19:09:53 <jussa_> or like dear old mama
19:10:03 <jussa_> oh mu impossible
19:10:43 <sea2clowns> BrokenCog - flashall scripts, flash-all.sh or flash-all.bat
19:11:19 <BrokenCog> sea2clowns: the only one I see is in the device/linaros/hikey tree ... doesn't seem like the corret one!??
19:11:51 <jussa_> same with ninja installing brAve atleast when u go visit, changing all icons to chrome and names. n chromq theme
19:12:17 <jussa_> what u guys think of postmarket
19:14:55 <jussa_> i mean cant u just add all u want basically peerguardian apparmor firejail snap proton privtorproxy dnscrypt etcetc
19:15:04 <jussa_> to it
19:16:18 <jussa_> meh should just port qubes for ..i guess pixel?
19:16:55 <TheJollyRoger> Whew, problem solved, grapheneOS installed.
19:17:07 <jussa_> on graphene
19:17:37 <jussa_> can u actually containerize diff parts
19:17:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
19:18:01 <jussa_> and disable hardware, turn off
19:18:07 <TheJollyRoger> You can use user profiles, which are entirely disparate identities in the phone and even do not share keys.
19:18:15 <TheJollyRoger> You can turn on Airplane mode and Shut off WiFi.
19:18:29 <jussa_> ah
19:18:35 <TheJollyRoger> The code for the phone's separate radios is separately sandboxed.
19:18:41 <jussa_> so that its physixally shutdown?
19:18:44 <BrokenCog> after this step: https://grapheneos.org/build#generating-signed-factory-images-and-full-update-packages, "script/release.sh crosshatch" is supposed to have the resulting image written in ./out/release-crosshatch-$BUILD, however I don't have any ./out/release* dirs.  any suggestion on finding the resulting images to flash?
19:18:56 <TheJollyRoger> So it's possible to shut down the cell modem by turning on Airplane Mode and switching WiFi on.
19:19:14 <jussa_> ye ik
19:19:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, it stops the phone's modem from dialing out or getting pings.
19:19:43 <jussa_> kk
19:20:07 <jussa_> ye i figured lots is similar to qubes

19:25:15 <sea2clowns> Sorry BrokenCog, have not built before like you are doing.  Reading the build instructions, yes, you should be a release directiory in out/ with the image/update
19:25:26 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know that, sorry. I don't know if that number is even tracked.
19:25:28 <sea2clowns> would need to look at release.sh but should it didn't build properly
19:25:44 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be right back though. Hopefully will not be long.
19:25:50 <sea2clowns> but shoulds like*
19:25:54 <sea2clowns> fuck, can
19:26:02 <sea2clowns> can't type, sounds***!
19:26:03 <BrokenCog> lol.  i get ya!
19:26:55 <BrokenCog> it seems the build completed - the last step of generating signed factory images succeed without errors, it's just compltely opaque as to where the resuling images landed.
19:28:13 <jussa_> where u guys based?
19:28:42 <jussa_> for when the phone production eould start
19:28:54 <sea2clowns> Montreal or vancouver, depending where my VPN spits me out, lol
19:29:26 <jussa_> ahh, so its gonna be open n remote managed
19:29:55 <sea2clowns> i'm just hanging out, helping where i can.  not part of the team
19:30:24 <sea2clowns> Toronto generally i think is the answer you're looking for though
19:30:34 <jussa_> u need specialist on the hardare design n manufacturimn
19:30:44 <nscnt> cx2[m]: Why don't you use irc directly?
19:30:47 <jussa_> wghos on your side fully
19:30:59 <jussa_> physicaLLY  present
19:31:12 <jussa_> id say

19:31:51 <cx2[m]> <nscnt "cx2: Why don't you use irc direc"> purely because i want to use it from terminal.
19:31:58 <jussa_> in a liberalcountry
19:32:29 <inthewaves> Does anyone know how to get choosecombo to use the proper BUILD_ID? I'm trying to build for aosp_sargo which uses QQ2A.200501.001.B2.2020.05.05.02 instead of QQ2A.200501.001.B3.2020.05.05.02, but `choosecombo release aosp_sargo userdebug` is telling me the BUILD_ID is QQ2A.200501.001.B3
19:32:43 <jussa_> unl4ee th5res a contractor alerdy u trust
19:33:26 <jussa_> id go towards the homeland of phones
19:34:09 <jussa_> usa..
19:34:14 <jussa_> impossible
19:35:15 <jussa_> youll have infiltration in a sec n a backdoor .d canada too
19:35:24 <jussa_> did u guys hear
19:35:40 <jussa_> that jolla did ccustom sailfishh
19:35:44 <jussa_> for fuckin
19:35:46 <jussa_> russia
19:35:50 <jussa_> government
19:35:54 <jussa_> :d
19:36:03 <jussa_> aurora its called
19:36:25 <nscnt> cx2[m]: Misunderstanding, let me try again: You want to use weechat-matrix(?). Why are you making detours and don't use WeeChat with irc (especially as irc is the actual chat room and it's just bridged to Matrix).
19:37:13 <jussa_> wish i get to meet tge rus secret police agent n get a copy
19:37:20 <jussa_> lols
19:37:34 <jussa_> one hell of a mobile os must be
19:38:10 <jussa_> sucks that sailfish went that road tho
19:38:25 <jussa_> n alot ppl helpin
19:38:41 <jussa_> for fr4e
19:38:53 <jussa_> on the open sourve parts
19:39:05 <jussa_> well nemo mobile
19:39:11 <nscnt> jussa_: How about writing, which you can also understand?
19:39:18 <jussa_> is the open version
19:39:23 <jussa_> soery
19:39:42 <jussa_> u know sailfish os rite?
19:39:49 <jussa_> and jolla
19:40:46 <jussa_> what, so the teAM is all jolla secret rebels or russian
19:40:52 <jussa_> ? :d
19:40:57 <jussa_> silence
19:41:51 * BrokenCog usually interprets silence as lack of interest.
19:41:58 <cx2[m]> nscnt: got it.....ummm good question. I've never really used irc before, so its all a learning experience.
19:41:58 <cx2[m]> I installed it on fedora, then got side reacted when I realized that fedora apparently doesn't like my speakers.
19:41:58 <cx2[m]> Also, what do you mean by writing? You've mentioned that before...
19:42:19 <sea2clowns> lol brokencog
19:42:29 <jussa_> nah
19:42:41 <jussa_> i asked about sailfish n jolla
19:42:48 <jussa_> opinions
19:42:51 <DannyWorkOrderPr> cx2: re: writing, they were talkin to jussa_ who keeps sending 10 messages one word at a time, and in 1337-sp34k
19:43:11 <jussa_> brought up some spexial topics
19:43:28 <jussa_> and no1 is interested?
19:43:34 <jussa_> nah lol
19:43:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> jussa_: What about them? Is there anyone writing apps for Sailfish/Jolla? Anyone porting it to hardware with secure boot?
19:43:48 <jussa_> i mean to discuss, give an opinion
19:44:01 <jussa_> yes
19:44:04 <jussa_> many apps
19:44:08 <cx2[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: nscent mentionted it the other day to me as well... regarding something I could do to "help out" I didn't know if that was serious and if so, what was meant by it.
19:44:14 <jussa_> openrepos.net
19:45:15 <nscnt> cx2[m]: Mh? I doubt I mentioned 'writing' for helping out. TheJollyRoger did at some point, but I can't remember who was mentioned.
19:45:19 <jussa_> anbox getting along
19:45:36 <jussa_> and some good ports not sure bout sec
19:45:49 <cx2[m]> @nscnt maybe it was him.... someone mentioned it.
19:46:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> cx2: Probably helping improve the documentation/community Wiki
19:47:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> You can find that here: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Home
19:47:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> In its current form
19:47:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> The new platform, should one be created, is being discussed here: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Platform
19:48:30 <cx2[m]> Anyway.... Danny@WorkOrderPro So fedora was giving me the runaround with sound.... which detracted me from learning how to setup weechat..... fedora is still being an asshole, but gave up on the sound as I have other machines for videos, etc. (new macbook speakers are pure insanity)
19:48:46 <cx2[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: looking at it now. Thanks!
19:52:34 <nscnt> cx2[m]: Sound's working fine for different sound setups for me. I have had speaker and headphones (directly in audio-out and over different dacs).
19:54:00 <antranigv> I saw on Twitter that there's a new release, but I'm not sure how to update. any clues?
19:54:46 <fading_epilogue> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
19:54:57 <tentbot[m]> Think you just have to wait until the update server gets to you or something
19:55:20 <jussa_> well if any1 knowws a link or l3AK to jollas fish for kgb pm me
19:55:56 <jussa_> casual requests
19:56:01 <jussa_> nuffin special
19:56:18 <cx2[m]> nscnt: from what I have been reading, it's something to do with NVIDIA....the machine I installed Fedora on is about a year old MSI Machine. The other thing that I was concerned with was the fact that it has both an SSD and HDD.... but Fedora figured that out automatically it seems. Wheras MX Linux needed to be partitioned manually..... and then I somehow put GRUB on my USB drive hahahaha.... so it would only boot if the
19:56:18 <cx2[m]> drive was attached..... still can figure that one out either.
19:56:18 <cx2[m]> Anyway, I'm going to stick with Fedora, but so far can't figure out a fix for sound.
19:58:52 <nscnt> cx2[m]: I really don't know what you're doing ö_ö
19:59:07 <cx2[m]> I don't either
19:59:12 <cx2[m]> hahaha
19:59:14 <cx2[m]> Kidding....
19:59:40 <jussa_> nvidia
19:59:53 <jussa_> classic backdoors
19:59:54 <nscnt> cx2[m]: Nvidia isn't nice to Linux distros.
20:00:39 <nscnt> cx2[m]: You can enable the non-free NVIDIA driver repo in the Software settings
20:01:02 <jussa_> yeees...dooo itt
20:01:14 <nscnt> cx2[m]: There's absolutely no problem if there's a SSD and HDD. Don't know why you think that's a problem.
20:01:38 <cx2[m]> nscnt:  Bottom line: Took the Fedora Advice. Was concerned because the machine has two drives. Fedora took care of that on it's own. ✔︎
20:01:38 <cx2[m]> NVDIA is being an asshole.... soooo probably just use BT speakers...
20:01:51 <nscnt> cx2[m]: I wouldn't have installed my operating system over two hard disks. SSD+HDD? That's just weird imo
20:02:26 <jussa_> i have 268gb microsd with fedora 32 serv
20:02:42 <jussa_> chinese...267gbs
20:03:00 <jussa_> bigger than the thinkpads ssd
20:03:34 <nscnt> cx2[m]: You put GRUB on your USB drive? What are you doing?! I really don't understand (>O_O)>
20:04:26 <nscnt> Do you guys get some interferences as well? I recieve some weird messages sometimes
20:04:48 <nscnt> In beetween my messages
20:04:50 <nscnt> weird
20:04:53 <jussa_> like wgqat
20:04:56 <nscnt> there it is
20:05:01 <nscnt> lol
20:05:01 <jussa_> gagagha
20:05:57 <nscnt> cx2[m]: I would probably start over. Just use your SSD for your Fedora installation. Format everything else.
20:06:17 <cx2[m]> nscnt: Its not that I thought there was a problem... I just wasn't sure how the operating system would install with the two disks internal to the machine. Again, Fedora took care of it.
20:06:17 <cx2[m]> Though i did a bit of reading on it and it's not too uncommon to install across two hard disks... apparently its a matter of placing / on SSD, and /home on HDD.
20:06:17 <cx2[m]> The GRUB issue was because the USB with the OS on it was still plugged in when I partitioned the drives.... Also becasue I didn't really know what I was doing.
20:06:26 <nscnt> Oh Matrix's lagging
20:07:32 <cx2[m]> nscnt: That's what i'm saying.... Fedora figured it out on it's own. No issues using the HDD purely for data...... which is good because why would I want all of that nice space to go unused??
20:07:32 <cx2[m]> The issue I was having when manually partitioning was with MX Linux
20:07:44 <nscnt> cx2[m]: That's not an issue of a still plugged-in USB drive. That's the only way to install it. With the plugged-in usb.
20:09:03 <nscnt> cx2[m]: I never ran into an issue with manual partinioning in a Fedora install
20:09:23 <cx2[m]> <nscnt "cx2: That's not an issue of a st"> Again this is concerning the MX Linux install.... And right, That's how I was installing it.... but when I manually partitioned drives, I accidentially threw GRUB on the USB drive.... I wasn't paying attention. I just thought it was funny is all
20:10:28 <cx2[m]> nscnt: I'm not talking about Fedora... i'm talking about MX Linux.
20:10:28 <cx2[m]> Fedora was fine on install. No issues at all except the with NVIDIA.
20:11:02 <BrokenCog> so, I downloaded a recent build and flashed it to the pixel 3axl (not the image I built locally which I'm still tryihng to flash), however I don't seem to be able to connect to the devicde with ADB or fastboot.  I've enabled USB debugging is there something else I'm missing??
20:11:18 <nscnt> I have one SSD, 3 HDDs on my system. I installed Fedora just on my SSD. I even unplugged my HDDs because I don't want to accidentally choose my HDDs. I use all 3 HDDs for storage only. You don't need to choose your drives on install. Just because you haven't, it doesn't mean the storage will be unused.
20:12:14 <nscnt> cx2[m]: I don't understand why you would have the need to fiddle with MX Linux?
20:12:32 <nscnt> Wait
20:12:34 <nscnt> wait
20:12:49 <nscnt> I misunderstood that part, sorry
20:14:53 <cx2[m]> <nscnt "I have one SSD, 3 HDDs on my sys"> nscnt: well do your point, Say I just install to the SSD, the HDD had been previously encrypted.... so how would I then access it if I didn't format it on install? Just mount it, and format it once I have fedora configured? And if so, how would I then encrypt it?
20:16:36 <cx2[m]> nscnt: keep in mind I can't just unplug the HDD.... I could remove it.... but then how do I mount it once I have Fedora up and running, and encrypt it so that it auto-mounts and decrypts when logging into the machine?
20:20:28 <BrokenCog> the pre-built download flash-all.sh does as a last step: "fastboot -w --skip-reboot update image-bonito-qq2a.200405.005.zip" ... in the build tree's ./out directory, what is the equivalent zip file?  is it an .img file?  a .bin file?
20:22:37 <sea2clowns> cx2 - only played with fedora a bit but you would use cryptsetup and crypttab to add it after
20:22:49 <nscnt> cx2[m]: That's probably out of your scrope. But it works just as you said.
20:22:52 <nscnt> *scope
20:24:37 <cx2[m]> Thanks guys...mind if I shoot you a DM later if issues arise? Don't want to keep taking away from the channel.
20:24:57 <cx2[m]> > Thanks guys...mind if I shoot you a DM later if issues arise? Don't want to keep taking away from the channel.
20:24:57 <cx2[m]> Or gals..
20:26:02 <sea2clowns> image-bonito-qq2a.200405.005.zip would contain system/product/vendor/boot/dtbo/super_empty/vbmeta img's
20:26:50 <sea2clowns> and also has android-info.txt in it
20:27:20 <BrokenCog> okay, I'll bundle that - I"m guessing no structure, just all in a single dir?
20:29:08 <BrokenCog> sea2clowns: what's the "super_empty" ?
20:31:21 <zcassh> hi
20:31:50 <BrokenCog> also, there is a super_system.img which is 2G, is that the bundle of everything?/
20:32:07 <zcassh> is it better to stick to chrome or chromium? There were dicussions on matrix claiming chromium is generally poorly maintained for linux distros
20:32:16 <zcassh> idk how true that is
20:34:23 <sea2clowns> idk, just looked in package i had from the website.  learning was we go ;) sorry bud, definitely not your expert
20:38:18 <sea2clowns> zcassh - just use Vanadium that comes with Graphene
20:38:36 <zcassh> on the linux desktop, I meant
20:39:18 <zcassh> I'm looking through https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.05.05.02, "disable safe volume feature everywhere instead of only the US"
20:39:21 <zcassh> what's that?
20:44:07 <zxwayland> ahoy
20:48:52 <BrokenCog> maybe it disable's the safe volume feature everywhere in the world, rather than only in the US?
20:49:26 <sea2clowns> zcassh - guessing it is just as it reads?  Disables the output volume prompt that warns the user about going above a certain db level
20:49:44 <zcassh> oh that's what it meant
20:50:43 <BrokenCog> alright, well, either this is going to be a bricked pixel, or i've sorted all the image files it needs... stand-by.
20:50:59 <sea2clowns> lol, good luck!
20:52:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> No such thing as perma-brick, from what I've been told, so no worries
20:53:36 <BrokenCog> agh.  evry time with this USB it's different.  "use FIle Transfer" worked before, now not.
20:54:15 <zxwayland> how do i verify the crosshatch-factory-2020-05.05.02.zip.sig its legit?
20:54:24 <zxwayland> Signify: Unknown parameter '-Cqp'
20:54:50 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-signify
20:55:06 <zcassh> did you install signify or signify-openbsd?
20:55:10 <zcassh> signify*
20:55:10 <strcat> > On Debian-based distributions, the signify package and command are an unmaintained mail-related tool for generating mail signatures (not cryptographic signatures) with the final releases from 2003-2004 made directly by the developer via the Debian package without upstream releases. Please pressure them to correct this usability issue.
20:55:28 <zxwayland> signify
20:55:38 <zxwayland> yeah i am using debian buster
20:55:39 <zcassh> it's signify-openbsd in debian
20:55:46 <zcassh> signify-openbsd*
20:55:48 <zxwayland> ohhh ok
20:57:04 <zxwayland> signify -Cqp factory.pub -x crosshatch-factory-2020.05.05.02.zip.sig && echo verified
20:57:07 <zxwayland> -bash: signify: command not found
20:57:12 <zcassh> use signify-openbsd
20:57:17 <zxwayland> ahh
20:57:22 <strcat> debian renames it
20:57:26 <zcassh> or set an alias for signify-openbsd and map it to signify
20:57:30 <jussa_> can you torify the system?
20:57:34 <strcat> because a debian developer made an obsolete tool called signify
20:57:52 <strcat> last release in 2004 only made via debian (they released the software solely via the debian package - no upstream sources)
20:58:03 <zxwayland> signify-openbsd: can't open crosshatch-factory-2020.05.05.02.zip.sig for reading: No such file or directory
20:58:08 <jussa_> of graphene
20:58:14 <strcat> jussa_: https://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support
20:58:15 <zcassh> see https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-signify, you're supposed to replace signify with signify-openbsd in any subsequent steps
20:58:30 <jussa_> on top of vpn ofc
20:58:56 <zcassh> jussa_: you can use orbot
20:59:14 <strcat> read the faq section
21:00:11 <jussa_> on android cant run orbot n vpn same time
21:00:24 <jussa_> as orbot acts as vpn
21:00:28 <inthewaves> zxwayland: you need to change the .zip.sig part with the filename of the actual .zip.sig you downloaded
21:00:49 <zcassh> it's https://releases.grapheneos.org/crosshatch-factory-2020.04.14.23.zip.sig for now
21:00:52 <strcat> jussa_: tor supports bridges
21:01:06 <jussa_> orbot too?
21:01:11 <strcat> yes
21:01:12 <jussa_> oh ye
21:01:18 <BrokenCog> DannyWorkOrderPr: seems to be the case.  failed on several steps, but re-flashing the current stable grapheneOS image works.
21:01:23 <strcat> zxwayland: the install guide doesn't tell you the commands to install a specific version, it gives generic commands and uses a version as the example
21:01:38 <zxwayland> ops nevermind, i was in root lol
21:01:41 <zcassh> so "signify-openbsd -Cqp factory.pub -x crosshatch-factory-2020.04.14.23.zip.sig && echo VERIFIED"
21:01:45 <zxwayland> i had to exit root
21:02:08 <zxwayland> it has beem verified
21:02:51 <zcassh> go ahead with the rest of the instructions
21:03:04 <zcassh> just make sure to make the correct substitutions accordingly
21:03:36 <danielrf[m]> strcat: just checking if you'd seen my earlier message about the manifest referring to android-10.0.0_r36 for both tags?
21:03:52 <strcat> danielrf[m]: it's supposed to
21:04:22 <strcat> there isn't a difference
21:04:50 <dan-v[m]> yeah, mostly just semantics in matching what was used for factory images
21:04:54 <strcat> ^
21:05:10 <strcat> danielrf[m]: we just use the BUILD_ID they used so people can match it to the upstream release
21:05:18 <danielrf[m]> you get this error message when building: "Expected BUILD_ID is QQ2A.200501.001.B2 and currently building with QQ2A.200501.001.B3"

21:20:07 <cdesai> strcat: that commit mentioned something about a cts test failing

21:20:12 <strcat> cdesai: yeah
21:20:19 <strcat> but the link cannot be resolved outside google
21:20:30 <strcat> because they linked to an issue using their special tld syntax

21:22:33 <strcat> Access denied
21:22:59 <strcat> so that exists
21:23:02 <strcat> but you can't see it
21:26:41 <strcat> cdesai: but yeah would like to figure that out
21:26:51 <strcat> just delayed for later than today
21:27:01 <strcat> I chose not to include it for now
21:33:58 <BrokenCog> well, aside from the #build page not explaining what img files needed for flashing, and incorrectly stating where the build is located, I've seemingly gotten a scratch build flashed.
21:34:12 <BrokenCog> now I'll try to get Vanadium built ...
21:35:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> jussa_: OnePlus doesn't even have verified boot, it's faked. Search the logs in this room for more info.
21:36:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> jussa_: I can ship you a Pixel if you're looking to use Graphene with it.
21:36:50 <strcat> BrokenCog: what do you mean when you claim it incorrectly states where the build is located, or doesn't explain what's needed for flashing?
21:36:55 <strcat> *shrug*
21:37:41 <jussa_> yes i am
21:37:47 <jussa_> ofc
21:38:03 <jussa_> after our talk im all in
21:38:10 <jussa_> with the os
21:38:20 <jussa_> been tryin  many
21:38:28 <jussa_> on many diff phones
21:39:18 <jussa_> latest postmarket on n900, did nemo mobile from 2013 on it too lol, sailfish on oneplus2 , ubuntu touch on oneplus one
21:39:50 <jussa_> but yeah its daily driver
21:40:07 <jussa_> or ill put nethunter on it dunno
21:40:09 <jussa_> no real use
21:40:20 <jussa_> graphene seems awesome
21:41:03 <jussa_> yeah id love to buy one if we come to ok agreement
21:41:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Let me know, probably should move to a private chat...you send a lot of messages in a row, lol
21:42:14 <antranigv> oh I see, for after tapping I'm not getting, is because it's not ready on the update server yet.
21:43:06 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat "so strong passphrase as the main"> This would be great
21:43:19 <strcat> people are welcome to help finally implement it
21:43:42 <jussa_> i need to reg
21:43:43 <BrokenCog> sorry ... laptop crashed.
21:46:28 <strcat> cdesai: I might start doing it your way
21:46:33 <strcat> first I need to figure out that camera thing :\
21:47:49 <cdesai> Maybe it's some proprietary blob?
21:49:37 <jussa_> i neeed to l4av3 now but in 4 houra
21:49:42 <jussa_> im back
21:49:48 <jussa_> n will reg
21:49:49 <jussa_> then
21:49:54 <strcat> cdesai: yeah but then it may be that it didn't get updated for Pixel 2 and needs to be omitted for those
21:50:00 <strcat> so I just didn't bother with it yet
21:50:03 <jussa_> lets pm eacg othwe
21:50:18 <jussa_> ty guys
21:50:34 <jussa_> nice fightin with ya n then chillin
21:50:43 <cdesai> strcat[m]: r35 seems to work fine on walleye either way.
21:50:49 <cdesai> Also not sure what ag/ means
21:50:51 <jussa_> lookin fowarw for more
21:51:11 <cdesai> ab/ is Android build I think, their ci / build system.
21:54:09 <jussa_> see yalater
21:58:03 <strcat[m]> cdesai: have you tested HDR+ via Open Camera though
21:58:26 <strcat> cdesai: it's an HDR+ fix so it wouldn't make a difference without it
21:58:35 <strcat> and the AOSP Camera app isn't set up to use it
21:58:40 <strcat> so it probably won't impact that
21:58:49 <strcat> it may only break in some obscure case covered by the CTS too
21:59:04 <strcat> I really don't want to have device branches
21:59:28 <strcat> so perhaps I should switch to using the r35 tag instead of r36 but I want to figure this out 1st
21:59:37 <strcat> there might be something calling this that wasn't updated hmm
22:00:33 <cdesai> strcat: enabled camera 2, seems to work
22:01:54 <strcat> cdesai: my plan is to get out everything else 1st asap
22:02:00 <cdesai> google camera works too
22:02:03 <strcat> just didn't want to block May sec update on something I don't understand
22:02:16 <cdesai> yeah that makes sense. I just pushed r35 for all
22:03:12 <cdesai> and it would be ugly but this could be ifdefed. ugly, but easier than device branches
22:04:52 <strcat> cdesai: it's painful to ifdef stuff based on device
22:05:09 <strcat> the build system it designed to make it hard to do it by accident
22:05:34 <cdesai> strcat: actually, this shouldn't even be built on anything else. it's hardware/qcom/camera/msm8998
22:05:48 <cdesai> we can just include the revert
22:05:49 <cdesai> yeah
22:06:09 <strcat> ahhh
22:06:16 <strcat> so it's no problem that I included it everywhere
22:06:24 <strcat> b/c everywhere is just msm8998 anyway
22:06:41 <strcat> ah that's good I thought I 'd have to do follow-up work
22:06:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> This "APN radio button goes null" issue is driving me fuckin batty, lol
22:07:00 <strcat> cdesai: alright I didn't get why they did it as a device specific release, now I do
22:07:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Any way I can capture logs when I reboot to see what it's doing/send them in? I have next to no apps installed on the phone, so I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing differently than everyone else.
22:07:11 <strcat> they don't respin releases when a change doesn't impact them and they already made tags
22:07:21 <strcat> that's why they end up with device tags like this
22:07:40 <strcat> from not letting a fix specific to a device result in less tested releases for other devices essentially
22:07:52 <strcat> although I think it's pretty dumb
22:07:57 <strcat> and they should just switch them all to the new tag
22:08:34 <strcat> QQ2A.200501.001.B2.2020.05.05.02 (Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL)
22:08:36 <strcat> QQ2A.200501.001.B3.2020.05.05.02 (Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, emulator, generic, other targets)
22:08:43 <strcat> cdesai: that's why I put generic, other targets, etc.
22:08:45 <strcat> with the newest one
22:09:28 <mxnorvak[m]> Strcat: i read in one of your reddit replies that you didn't go to uni for learning to be a developer
22:09:30 <strcat> cdesai: b/c in general, if it's the same branch, it just means the new tag only had changes for certain devices so they kept the build for the others
22:09:55 <cdesai> makes sense now
22:10:07 <mxnorvak[m]> It'd be awesome if you could talk about the route you took and how you have developed your skills
22:10:10 <cdesai> so either works then, r36 or r35
22:10:17 <cdesai> just need to adjust build id for non pixel 2
22:10:27 <strcat> cdesai: well you want r36 for Pixel 2
22:10:41 <strcat> r35 vs r36 is the same for other devices without that SoC
22:10:48 <strcat> so yeah I'll just adjust build id
22:11:06 <mxnorvak[m]> I personally am too eager to learn but I'm short on time and need to find good places to start
22:11:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> mxnorvak: Figure out what you want to be able to do, and read resources until you're able to do it. Honing your reading skills is step one. Hang out in the places where people are doing the things you want to be doing. Read their code.
22:12:31 <strcat> cdesai: the problem is you can't assume higher r## means anything
22:12:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> He codes in 8 different directions, lol, what specifically are you trying to replicate? It'll be easier for people here to point you to resources if you tell us what you want to be able to do.
22:12:40 <strcat> cdesai: need to look at the BUILD_ID / branches
22:12:42 <strcat> and figure out what it means
22:12:52 <cdesai> strcat: and the first thing I do is diff the tags
22:12:55 <strcat> cdesai: the r## is an arbitrary thing and is just the order they push to aosp
22:12:57 <strcat> yeah
22:13:36 <strcat> r## is based on order of tag creation but doesn't mean it's "further along" on the same branch
22:14:09 <cdesai> yeah, it was r33 -> r34, and r33 -> r35 -> r36
22:16:37 <mxnorvak[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "He codes in 8 different directio"> Tbh the more i discovered different fields the more confused and helpless i got as there is so many interesting fields and so lil time,i guess i need to know each a lil more in depth so that i can ask more specific questions and narrow my choices
22:17:27 <mxnorvak[m]> Is and are all over the place
22:17:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> mxnorvak: AOSP would be a good, well documented, place to start reading up on/hacking on
22:17:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> And relevant to this project, if you have the ability to stick with the topic.
22:18:43 <nuttso[m]> Strcat verified boot checks kernel and userspace. Does it mean it checks the pre installed apps also
22:19:01 <strcat> nuttso[m]: it checks the entirety of the OS images
22:19:17 <strcat> nuttso[m]: those apps are in the OS images
22:19:33 <mxnorvak[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "mxnorvak: AOSP would be a good, "> The documentations provided by Google itself you mean?
22:19:41 <nuttso[m]> So only apps installed by the user aren't included
22:20:00 <strcat> nuttso[m]: because those don't use an OS signing key
22:20:11 <strcat> nuttso[m]: they can and do have signatures verified by the OS
22:20:17 <strcat> but it doesn't enforce that they are signed with our keys
22:20:28 <strcat> so it's not really part of verified boot
22:20:30 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <mxnorvak[m] "The documentations provided by G"> By the AOSP project, and anyone that works/has worked on it. Some of those people (a lot of those people, arguably) are Googlers.
22:20:37 <strcat> nuttso[m]: the attestation feature allows apps to chain trust from verified boot though
22:20:42 <strcat> nuttso[m]: look at what Auditor does
22:20:51 <strcat> the attestation result includes the app id and app cert fingerprint
22:20:53 <nuttso[m]> I'm reading it at the moment
22:20:59 <nuttso[m]> To get a better understanding
22:21:04 <strcat>  you can chain trust from the OS to an app
22:21:06 <strcat> using attestation
22:21:17 <strcat> if you make an evil version of Auditor by modifying the official release
22:21:23 <strcat> it won't be usable
22:21:36 <strcat> because it will have the wrong signature or public key
22:21:51 <strcat> so either it won't install, or it will install but with a different key
22:21:57 <strcat> and the attestation result includes the fingerprint of the keyu
22:22:00 <strcat> which the other side checks
22:22:07 <strcat> so unless you exploit the OS
22:22:23 <strcat> it chains trust to the app for attestation, from verified boot
22:23:49 <nuttso[m]> Is it possible to place something in userspace that exploits the system after every reboot
22:24:56 <mxnorvak[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "By the AOSP project, and anyone "> https://source.android.com/ ? Would this be a good place to start,  I think I've read some sections of it in the past
22:25:06 <demonMachina> its working.... yassss
22:27:43 <nuttso[m]> <nuttso[m] "Is it possible to place somethin"> Maybe it is of course possible. But how is it preventable? Only by disabling installing additional apps
22:35:46 <demonMachina> @DannyWorkOrderPr: Finally got it up and running :smile:
22:36:36 <strcat> nuttso[m]: the attestation result includes hardware attested patch levels
22:37:03 <strcat> and there is downgrade protection
22:37:51 <strcat> so an attacker would have to be using a zero day for that and would need new zero days if the issue was fixed in an update - unless they block updates, which can be seen in the attestation result, they can't hide it
22:43:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> demonMachina: Good shit, glad to hear!
22:43:30 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Gday
22:45:49 <demonMachina> @DannyWorkOrderPr: it's cx2....name change...I should have specifired... I was able to get weechat up and running
22:55:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I didn't realize weechat was the Matrix CLI, thought you were talking about the shitshow from China earlier, lol
22:57:29 <JTL> lol
22:57:36 <JTL> It's also an IRC client
22:57:41 <demonMachina> lol...wait, which shitshow??
22:57:55 <JTL> Probably talking about WeChat
22:57:59 <JTL> (The Chinese IM app)
22:57:59 <demonMachina> OHHHH
22:58:07 <demonMachina> yeah f** no
22:58:21 <qyo3462572445[m]> I use to think they were the same thing too.
22:58:37 <JTL> Annoyingly Weechat is older
22:58:46 <demonMachina> want to install the matrix puglin but fedora is giving me trouble
22:59:02 <JTL> Surprised there was no form of trademark or other legal action, but then again the other IM client is China lol
22:59:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <JTL "(The Chinese IM app)"> IM/eCommerce/Social Network/"p2p" payment/everything but the fuckin kitchen sink Spytool
22:59:35 <JTL> DannyWorkOrderPr: I was oversimplifying there
22:59:38 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy JTL!
22:59:41 <JTL> Ahoy
23:00:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <JTL "Surprised there was no form of t"> They're both so vaguely named, and "wee" refers to "small" light client - not to mention, China may not even know about Matrix yet, lol
23:00:21 <JTL> Weechat dates back to circa 2005
23:00:34 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back on in a bit, I just have some stuff to do here >_<.
23:00:48 <JTL> So it predates Matrix and the Chinese WeChat app
23:01:20 <demonMachina> There has to be plugins for viewing links, etc. Yeah? Quote replying to messages, etc.
23:03:10 <demonMachina> <JTL "weechat dates back to circa 2005"> I would consider that a *long* time ago.... but if I did, i'd be showing my age >_<.
23:03:23 <JTL> Heheh
23:09:08 <strcat[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: weechat is an IRC client with plugin support - the Matrix support is via a Matrix plugin
23:10:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: Ah, that's neat. Didn't realize it was IRC first. Of course, the Matrix clients-list doesn't mention this
23:10:51 <strcat[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: it has a plugin-based architecture and IRC is technically an official plugin, but what it is out-of-the-box is an IRC client
23:14:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): hey what happened to vanadium prebuilts history?
23:14:37 <strcat> it broke github and had to be started over
23:14:42 <strcat> got too big
23:14:50 <strcat> now tags are going to have to be removed too
23:15:11 <strcat> distributing prebuilts via git is not something github handles well
23:15:15 <strcat> but it's how AOSP does it
23:16:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are no actual changes from the last head?
23:16:39 <strcat> which?
23:16:46 <strcat> depends what you mean by last
23:17:01 <strcat> it stopped syncing reliably so I had to do that and remake the tags
23:17:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay got it
23:17:51 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: what I could do is move it and make a new repo
23:17:53 <strcat> instead
23:18:18 <strcat> but I don't really care about prebuilts history since you can obtain it via the release and it has a reproducible build from source
23:18:32 <strcat> it's just too much data for github
23:18:37 <strcat> they don't allow big repos or files
23:18:42 <strcat> it's borderline on file size
23:18:52 <strcat> it warns on every push
23:19:01 <strcat> as do other AOSP repos
23:19:11 <strcat> some of the files they warn about are just massive profiles etc
23:19:29 <strcat> there's a cached PGO profile for clang
23:19:35 <strcat> and github rejects the clang repo due to it
23:19:49 * cx2[m] uploaded an image: #GrapheneOS weechat.png (3067KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/myalIzvxMJMbzWzmhMTCddNU >
23:19:50 <strcat> btw you can't upload chromium or linux to github as a new repo
23:19:58 <strcat> their source history is too large
23:20:07 <strcat> chromium you can't do at all
23:20:13 <strcat> linux you can do if you only do 1 branch tho
23:20:43 <strcat> that's why Vanadium's repo has patch files
23:20:45 <cx2[m]> shit.. my apologies strcat .... did not mean to dump that in the middle of what you were saying. Took a second to upload
23:20:47 <strcat> instead of commits
23:21:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): BTW it says on the grapheneos page you want to use a microkernel
23:21:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> How would you manage security on a microkernel?
23:21:24 <strcat> what do you mean?
23:21:55 <strcat> it's possible to work towards this goal as it explains there by deploying things like gVisor
23:22:00 <strcat> a userspace network stack is another example
23:22:19 <strcat> moving more drivers to being implemented largely / fully in userspace, etc.
23:22:28 <strcat> it will have to be a gradual thing
23:22:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Achieving the goals requires moving away from relying the Linux kernel as the core of the OS and foundation of the security model. It needs to move towards a microkernel-based model with a Linux compatibility layer, with many stepping stones leading towards that goal including adopting virtualization-based isolation.
23:22:50 <strcat> the next paragraph explains more
23:22:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> This one
23:27:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> I see but
23:27:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> With Linux you know all the code is at one place and we can just CFI it
23:28:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> How would this be achieved on a microkernel?
23:28:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> (I'm aware it gives more isolation)
23:29:13 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: it's no harder to enable CFI
23:29:31 <strcat> the core kernel would just be 10k LOC instead of 5 million
23:29:55 <strcat> everything else implemented in separate userspace processes instead of in the core kernel
23:30:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes but what about the components we moved out of it?
23:30:16 <strcat> those become separate userspace processes
23:30:18 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Yes but what about the component"> CFI exists in user space
23:30:39 <strcat> you can still enable CFI for them all in 1 place - it can still be built as 1 project, although it encourages making the organization of the project more modular
23:30:46 <strcat> it doesn't hinder enabling CFI at all
23:30:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "those become separate userspace "> Would qualcomm's gvm be an example of such a VM?
23:30:52 <strcat> it makes a lot easier to debug stuff like CFI
23:31:15 <strcat> dunno what gvm is
23:32:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's some kind of virtualization for automobiles
23:34:31 <renlord> is it coming to my toaster too?
23:35:23 <madaidan[m]> Can't wait for GrapheneOS toaster edition
23:49:20 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: xen, kvm, etc. work on snapdragon
23:56:09 <qyo3462572445[m]> Is scoped storage implemented yet on android, or was that pushed back till android 11? I know there was talk about it being in 10.
