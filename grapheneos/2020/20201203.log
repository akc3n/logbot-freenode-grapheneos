01:26:54 <njha[m]> anupritaisno1: even just ideas of what to look at would be appreciated
01:27:03 <njha[m]> logcat isn't nearly enough to get a good picture of what's going on
01:27:19 <njha[m]> but maybe I could compile the app from source in debug mode or something
04:15:47 <Thatcher[m]> Pixel 4a with GrapheneOS on T-mobile here, can't seem to figure out how to get voicemail's to playback in the Visual Voicemail portion of the dialer... Anyone have any ideas on how to get it working?
05:09:41 <madd_hatter[m]> Thatcher:  i have had similar questions about the advanced phone settings.  Do you still have a link for visual vm in the GOS phone app?
05:14:42 <madd_hatter[m]> I actually figured mine out as they switched the way its done.  The other was a Google not AOSP provided function in their app.
05:35:34 <Thatcher[m]> <madd_hatter[m] "Thatcher:  i have had similar qu"> I'm able to receive voicemails in visual vm but when i try to play them they wont connect to my voicemail, leaving me to call in to hear my messages
05:47:17 <madd_hatter[m]> Unfortunately, unless something has changed in the last few months the visual vn app is one buggy piece.  Sometimes a reinstall gets things working again; at least for awhile.  I know at least last yr specific to t mobile even they acknowledged how buggy the app was and were receiving tons of complaints.
05:47:17 <madd_hatter[m]> Sorry I have no idea if possibly something with GOS could be further complicating issues.  When Strcat or Anupritaisno1 are active in here see if they have an answer if no one else is helpful.
07:23:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> We need help against misinformation and libel being spread about grapheneos and the lead developer. The misinformation mostly comes from copperhead and James but a few others like calyx are also involved. Please pm me if you'd like to help us
07:45:18 <nscnt> anupritaisno1[m]: Re.: Calyx. Does this come from recognized contributors of Calyx or just random users of it?
07:49:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Both
07:50:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway calyx is a much lesser issue
07:51:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://nitter.net/DanielMicry have a look at what copperhead is up to
07:51:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have sources who have confirmed that they are behind this trolling account
07:51:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I seriously need help
07:52:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please pm me
07:52:30 <nscnt> lmao do they have to much time? god damn :D
07:57:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> nscnt: anyway this is serious
07:57:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Very few people are helping me with this
07:57:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I often end up handling it myself
07:57:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> That means I don't work on graphene when I'm handling this
07:58:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please ask in other channels too
08:05:08 <somenerd[m]> > https://nitter.net/DanielMicry have a look at what copperhead is up to

10:24:06 <arpysco[m]> Hey guys, I recently set up GOS and I'm very happy with it. What are some recommended resources for learning more about tech privacy and security?
10:24:50 <Lia[m]> grapheneos.org
10:25:01 <Lia[m]> developer.android.com
10:25:40 <Lia[m]> May help, also madaidans-insecurities.github.io is a good start too
10:28:46 <arpysco[m]> Thanks I've been going through the GOS site and that plus the dev's comments on reddit and twitter were what made me reevaluate my previous choices like firefox and linux. I'll check out the madaidans link right now
10:42:09 <anima[m]> you can also check Computerphile YouTube channel, its very interesting too
10:42:41 <anima[m]> but you should come in off topic channel to talk about that
10:53:54 <arpysco[m]> Sorry, I didn't realize there was an off topic channel. Joined it now.
11:25:12 <Thatcher[m]> I really love GrapheneOS. I feel like I truly own my device. At first I thought I needed microG, but I'm so glad that Signal has it's own push protocol. I hate Google.
11:29:00 <louipc> no need for hate my friend
11:32:00 <louipc> and google is multifaceted like any large org... the good, the bad, and everything else
11:33:26 <somenerd[m]> that is true
11:42:24 <anima[m]> well you can't deny they make the best android phones though
11:45:12 <louipc> at least for people who want to use an alternative OS
11:57:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> We need help against misinformation and libel being spread about grapheneos and the lead developer. The misinformation mostly comes from copperhead and James but a few others like calyx are also involved. Please pm me if you'd like to help us
15:01:50 <mmcblk0[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "We need help against misinformat"> Is it true? Because i thought that @nickcalyx help develop also for GOS or not?
15:13:45 <sb13x[m]> <mmcblk0[m] "Is it true? Because i thought th"> This should be in offtopic and if anupritaisno1 is all about help they'd know that add to the fact at least 3 of us now have questioned and asked for evidence tells me it's probably bunkum and should be treated like it's stirring the pot.
15:26:31 <strcat[m]> mmcblk0: no, they don't help us develop GrapheneOS
15:26:32 <strcat[m]> and have not
15:28:03 <strcat[m]> sb13x: anupritaisno1 said they are involved, not that the organization and developers have directly done it themselves
15:28:22 <strcat[m]> there are other ways to be involved and supportive of something than doing it directly
15:30:05 <strcat[m]> I don't think it was helpful to frame the messages that way but it's not me posting that
15:32:07 <strcat[m]> so for example, if there was someone in this channel spreading misinformation about one of their developers and trying to turn people against them and direct harass towards them
15:32:10 <strcat[m]> it would be dealt with not permitted
15:32:52 <strcat[m]> and I wouldn't tacitly support it by interacting them and being supportive of other things they say in the same conversation while just ignoring that
15:33:28 <strcat[m]> and that applies in general, not just to a project that we were supposed to be working with
15:33:46 <strcat[m]>  * so for example, if there was someone in this channel spreading misinformation about one of their developers and trying to turn people against them and direct harassment towards them

15:37:34 <Lia[m]> Not sure what Chromium has changed this time around for patches to not apply on 87.0.4240.86 (recent latest stable)
15:37:44 <strcat[m]> Lia: they're updated now
15:37:58 <strcat[m]> use the development branch if you want to build the latest

17:04:20 <niky> hey  guys hope you all are doing well
17:04:43 <niky> so now i have made a 2nd user acc for my gcam
17:05:12 <niky> i have installed lukaspiepper's fake gservice from github
17:05:58 <niky> i tried installing the latest gcam v8 which i had port from my pixel4a before flashing gos
17:06:28 <niky> but after installation the gcam app doesnt open
17:06:36 <niky> any suggestions?
17:07:10 <DC[m]> <madd_hatter[m] "I actually figured mine out as t"> I still cannot get visual vm to play in the GOS Phone app.  I see the messages, but they won't play. Keep getting error messages about not being able to update.
17:13:12 <niky> can anyone help with that gcam issue please?
17:14:12 <dakotah[m]> tacos?
17:14:30 <dakotah[m]> anupritaisno1
17:14:58 <anima[m]> <niky "can anyone help with that gcam i"> ask in offtopic
17:27:22 <Lia[m]> Try grabbing gcam from apkmirror instead?
18:59:26 <alzxjm[m]> <Lia[m] "Try grabbing gcam from apkmirror"> I think Gcam v8 on APKMirror is a bundle. I need to figure out a way to install those.
19:11:37 <anima[m]> opencamera offers good quality otherwise (granted you use camera API)
19:49:22 <Golli[m]> Got a Pixel 4 XL ready to be flashed. What battery % would be recommended for this process?
19:55:48 <bungeetaco[m]> I would say at least 50%, but it's always better to have the phone plugged in just in case.
19:58:38 * Lia[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LxwrOVQUsaikuyOuWCawDLnv/message.txt >
20:04:42 <mmcblk0[m]> <strcat[m] "mmcblk0: no, they don't help us "> i thought that backup solution SeedVault was integrated in a style Calyx, isnt? Am I wrong because I really don't know?
20:15:46 <strcat[m]> Seedvault existed before CalyxOS based on my proposal for it
20:15:49 <strcat[m]> Calyx is funding development work on it now but they didn't make the original thing
20:16:03 <strcat[m]> and that's not our project, it's an external app
21:12:47 <Golli[m]> Got a 4 XL flashed now :D
21:12:52 <Golli[m]> Easier than I thought it would be.
21:26:59 <majesticfruit[m]> https://iode.tech
21:27:12 <majesticfruit[m]> Any thoughts on this? Is it just a marketing ploy?
21:28:45 <Golli[m]> Just seems like a kind of firewall to me.
21:31:19 <anima[m]> off topic
