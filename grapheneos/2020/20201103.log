00:06:04 <strcat[m]> there's an unexpected Chromium security update today
00:06:15 <strcat[m]> so we'll need to make a Vanadium release first, will slow down the release process
00:07:21 <strcat[m]> https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2020/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html
00:08:04 <strcat[m]> Android release doesn't have a blog post yet

00:10:02 <louipc> still under "responsible disclosure"
00:28:33 <vata0[m]> Will it be difficult for the pixel 4a 5g to get support considering the 4a has a stable build now
00:29:53 <louipc> i've heard 4a 5g is more similar to pixel 5
00:30:12 <louipc> so theres some barrier there still
00:35:25 <vata0[m]> Gotcha
00:37:16 <vata0[m]> Which pixel are you running if you donâ€™t mind me asking
00:54:27 <vata0[m]> Lol google just allowed me for financing Iâ€™m real tempted to buy the pixel 5 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
01:19:40 <fr4[m]> In US?
01:25:30 <redibc[m]> Hello
01:25:57 <redibc[m]> I had a problem installing graphene os
01:38:41 <redibc[m]> After I type adb devices in the command it shows my device but on the unlock part it says <waiting for device>
01:38:48 <redibc[m]> Its after fastboot flashing unlock
01:38:54 <redibc[m]> I'm at the part wher the scree. In my phone is showing a different screen with the menu using the volume keys
01:39:01 <redibc[m]> Then when I try typing fastboot flashing unlock it says <waiting for device> under it
02:04:57 <dick[m]> <redibc[m] "I'm at the part wher the scree. "> You must confirm the unlock on the device
02:10:50 <waverider[m]1> <redibc[m] "Its after fastboot flashing unlo"> Windows or Linux? On manjaro I had to use sudo for fastboot commands. There's a way to fix that but I was too lazy
02:12:34 <dick[m]> <waverider[m]1 "Windows or Linux? On manjaro I h"> He has to confirm the unlock on the device
02:47:04 <redibc[m]> im on windows 1
02:47:05 <redibc[m]> 10
02:48:24 <redibc[m]> <dick[m] "He has to confirm the unlock on "> how do i do this? its just in the about section under settings right?
02:49:51 <dick[m]> <redibc[m] "how do i do this? its just in th"> When you send the unlock command
02:50:37 <redibc[m]> in the command prompt section with adb?
02:50:46 <dick[m]> You must confirm the unlock
02:50:51 <dick[m]> On the device
02:51:10 <dick[m]> Then the bootloader will reboot and show unlocked
02:51:21 <redibc[m]> how do i confirm the unlock on the device?
02:51:28 <redibc[m]> its under developer options?
02:52:13 <redibc[m]> it shows that its connected when i type in adb devices
02:54:37 <redibc[m]> oh hey
02:54:41 <redibc[m]> i think i know what it might be
02:55:06 <redibc[m]> it says when i enable oem unlocking i need internet connection. right now the phone has no sim in it and its offline. its still on stock android
02:56:13 <redibc[m]> do you think that is what it is? under oem unlocking it still allowed me to toggle it to on
03:11:42 <redibc[m]> what do i do ive been stuck all day
03:14:02 <louipcm> it should have a popup on the phone screen asking you if you want to unlock
03:14:39 <louipcm> btw are you in powershell
03:14:59 <redibc[m]> i dot even know what that is
03:15:29 <redibc[m]> when i plug my pixel 3 into the computer i have to open the top menu on the phone and go to th usb settinngs
03:15:40 <redibc[m]> then its called usb preferences
03:15:46 <redibc[m]> usb controllled by:
03:15:54 <redibc[m]> connected device and under it this device
03:16:49 <redibc[m]> there are options when i go to this device saying file transfer/ android auto, usb tethering, midi, ptp, no data transfer
03:19:03 <aeonsolution[m]> redibc: can you let me know where you are stuck on https://grapheneos.org/install
03:19:42 <redibc[m]> Unlock the bootloader to allow flashing the OS and firmware:
03:19:42 <redibc[m]> fastboot flashing unlock
03:19:46 <aeonsolution[m]> I can try my best to guide you from there but I need you to follow my instructions as closely as possible to avoid the hangups you are experiencing
03:19:59 <redibc[m]> i type that into the adb command prompt
03:20:00 <aeonsolution[m]> can you share the section from the link i sent
03:20:25 * redibc[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/vdLPCPlwPIErEBFmhtymTXSz/message.txt >
03:20:43 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
03:20:58 <aeonsolution[m]> this section?
03:20:59 <redibc[m]> thats it
03:21:03 <redibc[m]> yea
03:21:23 <aeonsolution[m]> Ok, turn off your phone.
03:21:43 <redibc[m]> okay i turned it off. i have adb closed
03:22:01 <aeonsolution[m]> https://source.android.com/setup/build/running
03:22:37 <aeonsolution[m]> Use any of the steps for Pixels to boot into fastboot mode
03:23:13 <aeonsolution[m]> It should be a black screen
03:23:17 <redibc[m]> volume down and power right? im on a normal pixel 3
03:23:43 <aeonsolution[m]> if that is what the instructions say, then yes
03:23:49 <redibc[m]> i did that and it just went to the normal screen
03:24:19 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, its booting to the OS because you are idle in fastboot
03:24:25 <aeonsolution[m]> hold the power button
03:24:56 <aeonsolution[m]> then choose to restart BUT hold the Volume Key Down
03:25:14 <aeonsolution[m]> this is a trick i learned from anu, so credit goes to him for this
03:25:48 <redibc[m]> okay im in it now
03:25:54 <aeonsolution[m]> nice
03:26:11 <aeonsolution[m]> well now plug in your USB, hopefully you are using a machine with proper USB support
03:26:15 <aeonsolution[m]> and follow the steps
03:26:22 <redibc[m]> i was already here
03:26:46 <redibc[m]> when i type that message it says <<waiting for device>
03:27:02 <aeonsolution[m]> what OS are you running
03:27:09 <redibc[m]> windows 10
03:27:28 <aeonsolution[m]> you are using a faulty USB it looks like
03:27:36 <aeonsolution[m]> is it A to C
03:27:53 <redibc[m]> when i type adb devices it shows up with the device
03:27:57 <redibc[m]> its usb c to usb c
03:28:55 <aeonsolution[m]> do you have a USB A to C somewhere
03:29:19 <redibc[m]> no the computer im on is a small one and i had to buy this cable just to try it
03:29:29 <aeonsolution[m]> ?
03:29:43 <redibc[m]> its not my computer i dont own one im borrowing it from someone
03:30:27 <redibc[m]> when i run minimal abd and type adb devices it shows up with my phone
03:30:27 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting
03:31:02 <strcat[m]> redibc: use the official instructions including the official platform-tools
03:31:14 <strcat[m]> don't use unofficial tools, don't install any drivers, etc.
03:31:36 <strcat[m]> by saying 'minimal adb' you seem to be implying you're following third party instructions and using a third party adb
03:32:33 <redibc[m]> i watched a video about techlore installing it and thats the one that i used
03:33:10 <aeonsolution[m]> that is most likely the issue
03:33:20 <louipcm> oops
03:33:36 <redibc[m]> so should i jut start everything over?
03:33:46 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
03:34:08 <aeonsolution[m]> Start from here: https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
03:34:33 <aeonsolution[m]> I would delete everything you downloaded and restart your Powershell session
03:35:14 <aeonsolution[m]> If you have issues at the end with flashing, you will need to get a USB A to USB C cable
03:35:37 <louipcm> theres problem with c-c ?
03:35:50 <aeonsolution[m]> See the troubleshooting section for more details on why that is.
03:35:54 <redibc[m]> the program i downloaded was called minimal adb fastboot 1.4.3
03:36:00 <redibc[m]> so dont use this at all right?
03:36:05 <aeonsolution[m]> In some cases there is louipcm
03:36:25 <aeonsolution[m]> redibc: delete that and follow the Official Instructions I linked to
03:36:38 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
03:37:08 <louipcm> oh its not the cable fault but the ports fault
03:37:30 <redibc[m]> sdk platform tools for windows right?
03:38:09 <aeonsolution[m]> louipcm: it can go either way, its hard to diagnose the issue remotely. If the cables are not high quality, the issue can be the cable.
03:38:28 <aeonsolution[m]> <redibc[m] "sdk platform tools for windows r"> yes
03:40:28 <redibc[m]> okay im extracting it now
03:41:23 <redibc[m]> okay now what
03:42:17 <aeonsolution[m]> please follow the instructions on the website, scroll down and see the next section
03:42:47 <aeonsolution[m]> if you get stuck please let us know the error and we can try to help diagnose the issue
03:43:03 <aeonsolution[m]> make sure however, that you only use one Powershell session
03:43:42 <aeonsolution[m]> do not open up multiple Powershells; one is all you need to download everything and flash your phone
03:43:53 <redibc[m]> i dont get this next part
03:44:15 <aeonsolution[m]> can you link me the section
03:44:18 <redibc[m]> curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip
03:44:18 <redibc[m]> (Get-FileHash platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip).hash -eq "413182fff6c5957911e231b9e97e6be4fc6a539035e3dfb580b5c54bd5950fee"
03:44:18 <redibc[m]> tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip
03:44:22 <redibc[m]> what is the purpose of this
03:44:47 <aeonsolution[m]> you run each command individually
03:44:56 <aeonsolution[m]> curl downloads the platform tools to your computer
03:45:11 <redibc[m]> what is curl
03:45:46 <aeonsolution[m]> https://curl.haxx.se/
03:45:51 <redibc[m]> i dont know what im supposed to do after i download this. there are a lot of programs in this folder
03:46:18 <aeonsolution[m]> if you follow the steps, you dont need to worry about other files
03:46:27 <redibc[m]> so i get curl now?
03:46:45 <aeonsolution[m]> its already about of Powershells command line tools
03:46:52 <aeonsolution[m]> you just run the command as it says
03:47:06 <aeonsolution[m]>  * its already a part of Powershells command line tools
03:47:06 <redibc[m]> i dont know what powershells is
03:47:37 <aeonsolution[m]> Powershell is windows new Command Line
03:47:52 <aeonsolution[m]> lets take a step back
03:47:57 <aeonsolution[m]> close everything you have open
03:48:25 <redibc[m]> okay
03:48:25 <aeonsolution[m]> open up your Downloads folder
03:48:30 <aeonsolution[m]> and delete everything in there
03:49:27 <aeonsolution[m]> *sidenote if you have questions about the commands, you can ask here or you search the internet to verify
03:49:49 <aeonsolution[m]> all the tools that you use to flash on windows are already about of windows
03:49:59 <aeonsolution[m]>  * all the tools that you use to flash on windows are already a part of windows
03:50:23 <redibc[m]> okay when i tried to delete that minimal adb it said it was already in use
03:50:35 <redibc[m]> it cant be deleted what do i do
03:50:35 <aeonsolution[m]> restart your computer then
03:50:45 <redibc[m]> okay ill be back
03:52:54 <redibc[m]> im back
03:53:00 <redibc[m]> it worked its gone now
03:53:30 <aeonsolution[m]> ok go to your downloads folder
03:53:38 <aeonsolution[m]> and delete everything there, let me know when you do that
03:54:44 <redibc[m]> okay
03:55:50 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, click on search bar in the Downloads folder and type `powershell` and press enter
03:55:55 <aeonsolution[m]> do not click on Downloads
03:56:15 <aeonsolution[m]> click to the right of Downloads
03:56:44 <redibc[m]> the only thing that came up is blueline factory that i had frm earlier
03:56:54 <redibc[m]> its the one i got from the graphene os website
03:58:02 <aeonsolution[m]> no, not the search bar on the task bar, I meant the the search bar in the file explorere
03:58:07 <aeonsolution[m]>  * no, not the search bar on the task bar, I meant the the search bar in the file explorer
03:58:28 <aeonsolution[m]> where it says This PC > Downloads
03:59:05 <redibc[m]> okay i typed that under this pc
03:59:19 <aeonsolution[m]> did it open up Powershell
03:59:33 <redibc[m]> theres a lot of things with the name powershell
03:59:53 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, that is not going to work
03:59:57 <aeonsolution[m]> close everything again
04:00:07 <redibc[m]> okay
04:00:15 <aeonsolution[m]> on your keyboard click the windows button and type 'Powershell'
04:00:26 <aeonsolution[m]> and choose the top most option that appears
04:00:33 <redibc[m]> okay i found it
04:00:37 <redibc[m]> do i run it as administrator?
04:00:40 <aeonsolution[m]> no

04:01:18 <aeonsolution[m]> type `cd ~/Downloads`
04:01:34 <aeonsolution[m]> make sure you keep this Powershell open, you do not need to open others
04:01:35 <redibc[m]> okay
04:01:45 <redibc[m]> i did that it changed the directory
04:01:55 <aeonsolution[m]> nice
04:02:11 <aeonsolution[m]> now follow the steps on https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
04:02:13 <aeonsolution[m]> for Windows
04:02:30 <aeonsolution[m]> copy and paste each command individually, one at a time
04:03:02 <aeonsolution[m]> and then just follow the steps from each subsequent section
04:03:06 <redibc[m]> is this the first line with the scroll bar on it?
04:03:10 <redibc[m]> or is it the one below it
04:03:26 <redibc[m]> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
04:04:21 <aeonsolution[m]> what?
04:05:23 <redibc[m]> i dont know what im doing here it is talking about downloading the folder that we already downloaded right
04:05:46 <aeonsolution[m]> no, i had asked you to delete everything in your Downloads folder
04:06:14 <aeonsolution[m]> you need to follow the steps otherwise you are going to get mixed up
04:06:20 <aeonsolution[m]> don't jump ahead
04:06:35 <redibc[m]> okay that is gone now its 100 percent gone. i still have the graphene os in there htough
04:06:46 <aeonsolution[m]> i need you to delete everything
04:06:49 <redibc[m]> i never opened it and i got it off the website
04:07:04 <aeonsolution[m]> yes, but please follow my instructions and be mindful of my time
04:07:07 <redibc[m]> okay its gone
04:07:26 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, now run the commands for windows to get the platform tools
04:08:11 <redibc[m]> curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip
04:08:17 <redibc[m]> this is the first thing i copy in there right?
04:08:26 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
04:08:50 <redibc[m]> okay its downloading
04:09:22 <redibc[m]> its 100 now
04:09:49 <aeonsolution[m]> now continue following the steps
04:09:53 <redibc[m]> okay all 3 lines
04:10:09 <aeonsolution[m]> now add the path
04:10:29 <redibc[m]> i pressed enter it said true
04:10:58 <aeonsolution[m]> cool now add the PATH
04:11:15 <redibc[m]> okay its scrolling with a lot of text now
04:11:31 <redibc[m]> okay its done now
04:12:06 <redibc[m]> now i type this $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path" with the quotes at the end?
04:12:16 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
04:12:37 <redibc[m]> okay it showed in green text
04:12:56 <redibc[m]> thats it for this first step right?
04:13:10 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
04:13:14 <aeonsolution[m]> now go to the next section
04:13:22 <redibc[m]> okay
04:13:22 <aeonsolution[m]> and follow the steps all the way down
04:13:24 <redibc[m]> signify
04:13:59 <aeonsolution[m]> since you are on windows you cant download signify
04:14:02 <redibc[m]> does my pixel need to be connected to the internet?
04:14:04 <aeonsolution[m]> you can skip that section
04:14:15 <aeonsolution[m]> no
04:14:18 <redibc[m]> okay
04:14:35 <redibc[m]> i did go to the developer optioss and made myself a developer and i did enable oem unlockig
04:14:52 <redibc[m]> at the end of this sentence though this is what it says
04:14:53 <redibc[m]> This requires internet access on devices with Google Play services as part of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) for anti-theft protection.
04:15:11 <redibc[m]> so i dont need to be on the internet with the pixel?
04:15:51 <aeonsolution[m]> is that what your phone says
04:16:00 <redibc[m]> no its what the website instructions say
04:16:19 <redibc[m]> its the last sentence under the step we are on: enabling oem unlocking
04:16:54 <aeonsolution[m]> hmm, you can try without the internet but it if it doesnt work then you have to
04:16:59 <redibc[m]> okay
04:17:10 <redibc[m]> i will try it without the internet for now
04:17:56 <redibc[m]> here is what i want to know to
04:18:25 <redibc[m]> when i plug in my pixel i have to go to the top menu on android and scroll down to open a menu called usb preference
04:18:42 <redibc[m]> then it says usb controlled by: connected device and the other option is this device
04:19:12 <redibc[m]> if i dont toggle this device on then the computer doesnt recognize it. i  have to go to the option use usb for file transfer/android auto
04:19:28 <redibc[m]> then i get a pop up on my computer screen showing the pixel 3 is connected
04:19:32 <aeonsolution[m]> please follow the instructions
04:19:42 <aeonsolution[m]> fastboot and adb are two different tools
04:19:49 <redibc[m]> okay
04:20:13 <redibc[m]> so should i unplug it and plug the pixel back in?
04:20:37 <aeonsolution[m]> i dont know what step you are on
04:20:43 <redibc[m]> and i use the volume down with restart to get to this next step right
04:20:51 <redibc[m]> unlocking the bootloader step
04:21:01 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
04:21:02 * redibc[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XsgHhVRfsXBxRVEFpovIXDhT/message.txt >
04:21:24 <redibc[m]> so i should just restart the phone now with the volume and power button
04:21:25 <aeonsolution[m]> just share the section link, no need to clutter the chat with commands
04:21:31 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
04:21:53 <redibc[m]> so i hold power then restart and press power down while doing it right
04:22:16 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
04:22:30 <redibc[m]> im in it ow
04:22:37 <redibc[m]> the dark screen fastboot mode
04:22:49 <aeonsolution[m]> cool, now run the command to unlock fastboot
04:23:01 <aeonsolution[m]>  * cool, now run the command to unlock bootloader
04:23:08 <redibc[m]> this one right
04:23:10 <redibc[m]> fastboot flashing unlock
04:23:25 <aeonsolution[m]> if that is what the instructions say then yes
04:23:46 <redibc[m]> <waiting for any device> under it
04:24:04 <aeonsolution[m]> did you plug in your phone
04:24:09 <redibc[m]> yea
04:24:15 <aeonsolution[m]> do you have another cable
04:24:20 <redibc[m]> no
04:24:49 <aeonsolution[m]> does the laptop have another port
04:24:55 <redibc[m]> yea
04:24:55 <aeonsolution[m]> or do you have a convertor
04:25:02 <aeonsolution[m]> try the other port
04:25:19 <aeonsolution[m]> press the CTRL + C keys
04:25:33 <redibc[m]> it makes the sound when i plug it in
04:25:33 <aeonsolution[m]> and plug to another port
04:25:34 <aeonsolution[m]> and try the command again
04:25:36 <redibc[m]> so its recognized somethig
04:26:08 <aeonsolution[m]> ok run the command again
04:26:12 <redibc[m]> same thig
04:26:13 <aeonsolution[m]> in the same Powershell
04:26:25 <aeonsolution[m]> did you press CTRL and C keys
04:26:30 <aeonsolution[m]> to cancel the last command
04:26:34 <redibc[m]> yea it restarted it
04:27:06 <aeonsolution[m]> its either your ports or the usb cable
04:27:06 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting
04:27:24 <aeonsolution[m]> if you unplugged the phone and cable
04:27:33 <aeonsolution[m]> killed the flashing command
04:27:38 <aeonsolution[m]> replugged phone
04:27:42 <aeonsolution[m]> and ran the command
04:28:13 <redibc[m]> this says its a common issue on linux, try it anyways?
04:28:28 <aeonsolution[m]> no
04:28:38 <aeonsolution[m]> the troubleshooting section has multiple parts
04:28:48 <aeonsolution[m]> the issue you have is in the following paragraphs
04:29:01 <aeonsolution[m]> ```A majority of failed flashes tend to be caused by substandard USB connectors, plugging in via hubs or bad cables which aren't properly up to the USB standard. The scrollback from a failed flash will contain valuable diagnostic information which is essential in knowing where and how the process went wrong.```
04:29:31 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: I wonder. Is there any PC case with decent front panel USB?
04:29:56 <JTL> My thoughts on the cause of the issue is all the cases I've seen use the same generic USB ports and unshielded internal cables
04:30:09 <aeonsolution[m]> JTL: your guess is as good as mine
04:30:16 <JTL> (Not a truth, just a suspicion)
04:30:22 <JTL> Okay fair
04:30:36 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah that is what I've seen too, but what sucks is the ADB works so everyone thinks we are not being truthful about it working
04:30:38 <redibc[m]> what should i do now i dont even see that section on that page
04:30:53 <JTL> Thankfully I purchaed a powered USB 3 hub with a special chipset so in theory that might be better
04:30:54 <aeonsolution[m]> its a struggle JTL
04:30:56 <JTL> (For my new workstation)
04:31:01 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: I get it
04:31:22 <aeonsolution[m]> redibc: my advice is to get a high quality USB A to USB C cable
04:31:37 <redibc[m]> okay im using a usb c to usb c cable
04:31:45 <redibc[m]> so do you think this is the issue?
04:32:13 <aeonsolution[m]> its the most likely issue
04:32:15 <redibc[m]> this computer doesnt even have a port for a usb a cable
04:32:21 <redibc[m]> thats why i had to get this one
04:32:37 <redibc[m]> if it doesnt have the port what can i do?
04:32:49 <aeonsolution[m]> try another computer that does
04:33:02 <aeonsolution[m]> or get a high quality USB C to USB C cable
04:33:16 <aeonsolution[m]> the one you have doesn't support flashing
04:33:45 <redibc[m]> how do i know if the usb c to usb a one will? do you think the one that comes out of the box with a phone will?
04:34:05 <dick[m]> <JTL "aeonsolution: I wonder. Is there"> No
04:34:12 <dick[m]> Use the USB that came with your motherboard only
04:35:01 <JTL> lol anu
04:35:11 <redibc[m]> so the reason it is not recognized is because it wont work off usb c to usb c. i need usb a to usb c and it has to be a cable supporting flashing. how do i make sure when i buy one it supports flashing?
04:35:20 <dick[m]> <redibc[m] "so the reason it is not recogniz"> No
04:35:30 <dick[m]> You just said
04:35:31 <JTL> dick[m]: I was asking more as an engineering question, not "can I use this right now to flash stuff with fastboot" or w/e
04:35:39 <dick[m]> That unlock worked
04:35:47 <dick[m]> Tbh I just
04:35:53 <dick[m]> Wtf is wrong with this app
04:36:03 <redibc[m]> when i type fastboot flashing lock in powershell under it i see
04:36:12 <redibc[m]> <waiting for any device>
04:36:13 <dick[m]> What
04:36:19 <dick[m]> What do you see
04:36:37 <dick[m]> Ok
04:36:54 * dick[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201103-100649_Element_(Riot.im).png (25KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/lZMgBtqYqOYvUlfrDEfcXpQB/Screenshot_20201103-100649_Element_(Riot.im).png >
04:37:03 <dick[m]> What the hell is this?
04:37:40 <bend[m]> redibc that's what happened to me when I was trying to flash using USB c to USB c that came with the pixel. I ordered a USB a to USB c and it worked fine then
04:37:49 <redibc[m]> okay
04:38:11 <bend[m]> I think mine was amazon brand
04:38:21 <redibc[m]> so that is the problem then. do you think the usb a to c that comes out of the box on a phone will work?
04:38:30 <aeonsolution[m]> redibc: if you aren't using the cable that came in the box, try that first.
04:38:42 <aeonsolution[m]> if not fallback to the other suggestions we provided
04:38:44 <louipc> what
04:39:08 <aeonsolution[m]> and refer to https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting
04:39:15 <redibc[m]> i cant use the cable that came out of the box becuase this laptop is a samsung galaxy book 2 and doesnt have that port. thats why i had to use usb c to  usb c. its not my computer and i dont have access to one where i can use a usb a port
04:39:16 <aeonsolution[m]> for the cable and port issues
04:40:06 <aeonsolution[m]> it is unforunate that the computer you are using doesnt have the proper ports to perform the flashing but that is where we stand
04:40:22 <aeonsolution[m]>  * it is unforunate that the computer you are using may not have the proper ports to perform the flashing but that is where we stand
04:40:34 <louipc> doesnt the phone come with a usbc-c?
04:40:42 <aeonsolution[m]> it does
04:41:02 <aeonsolution[m]> they arent using that cable for some reason
04:41:10 <redibc[m]> i think i know why
04:41:42 <redibc[m]> its because in order for it to be recognized when you plug it in with usb c you have to manually turn it on to be recognized in the scroll down settings in android
04:41:54 <louipc> weird
04:42:06 <redibc[m]> if i just have it plugged in without doing that it wont show up as a connected device. thats why i asked that question earlier
04:42:13 <aeonsolution[m]> no
04:42:24 <aeonsolution[m]> that is for adb to boot into fastboot
04:42:30 <redibc[m]> okay
04:42:34 <aeonsolution[m]> not for fastboot to perform flashing unlock
04:42:39 <aeonsolution[m]> they are not related
04:42:46 <redibc[m]> even with adb it said the same thing though
04:43:03 <aeonsolution[m]>  * that is for adb to boot into fastboot from the OS
04:43:20 <aeonsolution[m]>  * not for fastboot to perform flashing unlock in fastboot mode
04:43:44 <redibc[m]> so this computer it cant be done on because there is no usb a port. id have to find a way to use another one right
04:44:00 <aeonsolution[m]> do you have the original cable that came with the phone
04:44:20 <redibc[m]> no i have ones that came with phone chargers
04:44:37 <aeonsolution[m]> do you have a way to get the original cable
04:44:43 <redibc[m]> no
04:45:07 <louipc> bend[m] said his original cable didnt work anyways
04:45:21 <louipc> he needed a new cable
04:45:24 <aeonsolution[m]> ok so your next option is to get a new high quality USB C to USB C cable and hope that the ports on your laptop work to flash
04:45:29 <bend[m]> Yeah it didnt
04:46:00 <redibc[m]> yea i think i am just going to need to use usb a to usb c
04:46:02 <aeonsolution[m]> if not then you need to find a new machine with proper ports and get a USB A to USB C cable
04:46:16 <aeonsolution[m]> and make sure the port is connected to the motherboard
04:46:20 <redibc[m]> the videos i watched on youtube showed people using a to c
04:46:33 <louipc> thats the best bet i guess
04:46:55 <aeonsolution[m]> alright, that settles it
04:47:13 <faxing[m]>  I used an unofficial cable that came with an old phone that was USB A to USB C
04:47:16 <faxing[m]> and it flashed just fine
04:47:29 <faxing[m]> if that's worth anything lol
04:47:32 <redibc[m]> yea it has to be the cable issue
04:47:35 <louipc> google cheaps out on the cable
04:47:39 <redibc[m]> i have a usb a to c but i dont have a port i can use it in
04:48:25 <faxing[m]> You can pick up like a cheap cable off Amazon for like three bucks
04:48:40 <faxing[m]> If you want to go that route
04:48:57 <redibc[m]> yea i already have the cable this computer doesnt have a port
04:49:16 <faxing[m]> I mean a cable that your computer would support.
04:49:17 <faxing[m]>  * I mean a cable that your computer would support
04:49:20 <faxing[m]>  * I meant a cable that your computer would support
04:49:42 <faxing[m]> but up to you of course, it was just a suggestion
04:49:53 <redibc[m]> wouldnt that just be another usb c to c cable though? this guy said his didnt work c to c
04:50:12 <dick[m]> It works
04:50:17 <faxing[m]> C to C or A to C would work
04:50:17 <dick[m]> What guy?
04:50:28 <redibc[m]> bend
04:50:30 <dick[m]> Anyway the cable in the box is a C to C cable
04:50:38 <faxing[m]> as long as you can plug one end in to your phone and the other into your PC and the sable is reliable and supports data transfer
04:50:42 <faxing[m]> it should work perfectly
04:50:44 <louipc> but maybe usbc port is bad too
04:50:44 <dick[m]> So C to C is the way almost everyone is flashing
04:50:54 <faxing[m]>  * as long as you can plug one end in to your phone and the other into your PC and the cable is reliable and supports data transfer
04:51:03 <louipc> does everyone have usbc on their computer
04:51:10 <faxing[m]> <louipc "but maybe usbc port is bad too"> I mean rarely do people only have one port
04:51:18 <louipc> i guess adapter..
04:51:23 <faxing[m]> Can't imagine that none of their ports would work
04:51:43 <faxing[m]> Adapters can cause data loss or corupted installs and should only be a truly last resort
04:51:46 <faxing[m]>  * Adapters can cause data loss or corrupted installs and should only be a truly last resort
04:51:49 <louipc> faxing[m]: depends on if the ports are on a hub or direct to mobo
04:51:53 <aeonsolution[m]> the easiest thing to try is eliminating problems one at a time, since they dont have a computer with USB A ports, best to try first getting another USB C to USB C cable
04:51:55 <faxing[m]>  * Adapters can cause data loss on install or corrupted installs and should only be a truly last resort
04:51:56 <bend[m]> I'm sure it works for some. I was using a thinkpad that has USB c and USB a ports, it didn't work using the c port and did with the a port that's all I know
04:51:57 <redibc[m]> has anyone had the <waiting for any device> pop up happen? what did they do to fix it
04:51:57 <aeonsolution[m]> and trying the ports
04:52:24 <redibc[m]> bend what did it say when you tried usb c to c?
04:52:29 <aeonsolution[m]> and then go down the list of alternatives
04:52:40 <faxing[m]> <redibc[m] "has anyone had the <waiting for "> I just brought my phone out of and back into fastboot with the prompt still going
04:52:50 <faxing[m]> if you're talking about the adb or fastboot message
04:52:52 <aeonsolution[m]> anyway that is time, good luck redibc you are really close
04:52:56 <louipc> redibc[m]: you need to get the prompt on the phone
04:53:01 <louipc> or else you will never unlock
04:53:09 <faxing[m]> Yeah good luck man
04:53:10 <aeonsolution[m]>  * anyway that is my time, good luck redibc you are really close
04:53:11 <redibc[m]> what is the prompt on the phone?
04:53:26 <redibc[m]> okay thank you
04:53:39 <louipc> when the computer sends a signal to the phone, then there will be a popup menu thing for you to confirm to allow unlock
04:54:05 <louipc> but the problem is the signal is not arriving to the phone
04:54:21 <redibc[m]> yea it jut shows fastboot mode
04:54:33 <bend[m]> redibc that's the same message I was getting
04:54:47 <redibc[m]> so its in the cable then. all you did to fix it was use usb a
04:54:50 <louipc> aeonsolution[m]:goodjob :D
04:55:07 <faxing[m]> oh btw aeonsolution
04:55:16 <aeonsolution[m]> yes?
04:55:19 <faxing[m]> did you ever find out anything about the voicemail problem?
04:55:22 <faxing[m]> all good if you didnt
04:55:31 <faxing[m]> just checking
04:55:43 <faxing[m]> cause i still never got it to work
04:55:44 <bend[m]> Yes, but I'm guessing it had to do more with the port than the cable, at least as I understand it
04:55:55 <louipc> i have a bunch of bad cables too. i always get mixed up
04:56:08 <aeonsolution[m]> i havent gotten a chance to really look at it
04:56:17 <aeonsolution[m]> i have the notes anu gave me, but thats about it
04:56:26 <aeonsolution[m]> havent worked on it at all
04:57:01 <aeonsolution[m]> send me a message and we can share notes, ill be on tomorrow
04:57:24 <redibc[m]> what do i type to get rid of the waiting for any device message in powershell
04:57:39 <faxing[m]> Alright, thank you
04:58:34 <redibc[m]> when did they add this powershell thing? this is just cmd? i havent used a computer since windows 7 came out
04:59:03 <aeonsolution[m]> the internet is your friend on this one mate
04:59:27 <redibc[m]> now i have to think of how im going to use a usb a cable on this
05:00:47 <faxing[m]> PowerShell has been out for a long time
05:00:56 <louipc> redibc[m]: its a hyper version of cmd
05:01:07 <faxing[m]> "First appeared - November 14, 2006; 13 years ago"
05:01:25 <louipc> shoulda came out in 1990 tho lol
05:01:46 <faxing[m]> In my eight year span of using Windows I really can't remember a time when PowerShell wasn't an accessible option lol
05:01:51 <louipc> how were they so far behind in shell
05:02:10 <louipc> i always used bash lol
05:02:28 <faxing[m]> Oh wow I just realized that you can download PowerShell on Fedora and other Linux OSes
05:02:34 <faxing[m]> it also seems to be open source
05:02:45 <faxing[m]> <louipc "i always used bash lol"> Partial to zsh and fish, myself lol
05:03:19 <louipc> i'd prefer dash but whtev
05:03:32 <redibc[m]> alright well im going to have to try and find a way to get this to work with usb a thanks for the help it wont recognize this so it wont work
05:04:17 <louipc> you could still have success with another usbc-c
05:04:56 <louipc> if you dont have usba on your computer then you will need a different computer
05:05:07 <redibc[m]> i dont want to try it yea ill have to find another one
05:05:53 <dick[m]> louipc most issues are caused by people doing unnecessary bs they think they need to do
05:06:19 <dick[m]> Mostly it's just some additional driver they installed for some reason causing conflicts
05:06:38 <louipc> could be
05:07:00 <louipc> lol recommend system reset on computer to install grapheneos
05:07:00 <dick[m]> Using another PC to flash or even using another copy of the OS on the same machine should work
05:07:26 <redibc[m]> what else do you think i can do to get this to recognize it
05:07:40 <louipc> this is all very comical to me
05:07:46 <louipc> why dont computers work in 2020
05:07:51 <redibc[m]> yea i dont thik there is anything i can do
05:08:06 <redibc[m]> this computer isnt even mine so i dont want to give it back to the guy and have him say what did you do to my computer
05:08:12 <louipc> i thought this is the future. wheres my hovercar
05:09:09 <louipc> you could say the lithium exploded it
05:09:35 <redibc[m]> im going to give it back to the guy ill try it later when i can with usb a on a different computer. it should recognize it and work if bend even said he had the same problem
05:10:01 <louipc> yea i think it has a higher chance of success
08:03:38 <ltl2> hello, should i use the regular factory zip file or ota update zip file? i'm going to do the install on pixel 3a xl
08:08:37 <ltl2> i just saw it's in the guide lol
08:58:57 <strcat[m]> redibc: there's also the possibility you did something weird before following the official instructions such as installing a weird driver you need to remove now
08:58:59 <strcat[m]> only you know what you did before
08:59:19 <strcat[m]> you mentioned using a third party adb
08:59:31 <strcat[m]> you need to make sure that's fully removed along with any drivers you installed
08:59:58 <strcat[m]> I think it's most likely that the sketchy third party software you installed screwed it up
09:00:01 <strcat[m]> and it won't work now
09:00:23 <strcat[m]> we see these issues when people follow unofficial instructions recommending stuff like that
09:28:41 <ltl2> when i type in "fastboot -w --skip-reboot update image-bonito-2020.10.23.04.zip" it says partition product not found
09:29:03 <ltl2> pixel 3a xl
09:29:13 <ltl2> android 11
09:29:22 <ltl2> october build
09:34:22 <ltl2> i will start from the very beginning then
09:34:33 <ltl2> .
09:56:36 <Dylanger[m]> strcat: Any idea when you'll have the new tagged release up?
09:59:14 * Dylanger[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_2020-11-03_20-58-50.png (52KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/diagnostix.io/NiGFWocxdbDQsiFDevXRmJQk/Screenshot_2020-11-03_20-58-50.png >
09:59:15 <Dylanger[m]> I suspect it'll land in here shortly
09:59:29 <strcat[m]> takes a long time to do builds
10:00:00 <Dylanger[m]> +1
12:47:49 <bbqcore[m]> was Graphene affected by the recent Chroium bug?
12:48:30 <bbqcore[m]>  * Was Graphene affected by the recent Chromium bug?
13:19:05 <strcat[m]> which
13:19:31 <strcat[m]> need to be specific, there are multiple recent Chromium security fixes
13:20:19 <strcat[m]> and is your question about Vanadium on GrapheneOS, or Chromium in general on GrapheneOS?
13:20:35 <bbqcore[m]> vanadium
13:20:36 <bbqcore[m]> CVE-2020-16009
13:20:44 <bbqcore[m]> CVE-2020-16010
13:20:59 <strcat[m]> which one?
13:21:24 <strcat[m]> and you'll need to provide information on them to determine if they are present and if so whether they would be exploitable with the mitigations that are in place
13:22:12 <strcat[m]> Vanadium was updated to the latest stable release yesterday
13:22:30 <bbqcore[m]> there have been a number of 0 day exploits discovered recently
13:22:36 <strcat[m]> we didn't spend a bunch of time reversing the vulnerabilities from the patches and determining impact
13:23:00 <bbqcore[m]> was Graphene affected by any of them or did the security hardening protect against any or all?
13:23:14 <bbqcore[m]> also CVE-2020-15999
13:23:18 <bbqcore[m]> https://thehackernews.com/2020/10/chrome-zeroday-attacks.html?m=1
13:23:39 <strcat[m]> without more information, it's not possible to answer
13:24:13 <strcat[m]> as I said we didn't spend a bunch of time reversing the vulnerabilities from the patches fixing the bugs and determining their impact specifically on GrapheneOS
13:24:42 <strcat[m]> there are many security fixes in upstream projects, we don't invest 10 hours into researching each one rather than just shipping the fixes
13:25:03 <bbqcore[m]> That's not my question
13:25:04 <strcat[m]> you'll need to at least provide information on what kinds of bugs they are and link to the code if you want me to be able to even hypothesize
13:25:20 <bbqcore[m]> My question was whether the hardening work in Graphene protected against any of these before they were discovered
13:25:29 <strcat[m]> I answered above
13:25:31 <bbqcore[m]> Or was Graphene as vulnerable as other installs
13:25:38 <strcat[m]> read my answer
13:25:39 <bbqcore[m]> So the latter
13:25:43 <strcat[m]> no
13:25:45 <strcat[m]> read my answer
13:26:48 <strcat[m]> > without more information, it's not possible to answer
13:26:51 <strcat[m]> > as I said we didn't spend a bunch of time reversing the vulnerabilities from the patches fixing the bugs and determining their impact specifically on GrapheneOS
13:26:56 <strcat[m]> > there are many security fixes in upstream projects, we don't invest 10 hours into researching each one rather than just shipping the fixes
13:27:11 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: please don't start making false claims just because you didn't get the answer you wanted
13:27:29 <strcat[m]> the answer is that without doing hours of research into each bug, that is not known
13:28:28 <strcat[m]> unless the specific details of what happens are super obvious from the patch (rarely the case) to the point that it can be assumed that a mitigation that's in place prevents exploitation
13:28:56 <dick[m]> Does it need to be said that merely fixing CVEs doesn't help all that much?
13:29:08 <strcat[m]> I can confidently say that exploiting it on GrapheneOS will likely be substantially harder and would require specifically targeting GrapheneOS but without research that question can't be answered
13:29:18 <dick[m]> What about the other bugfixes?
13:29:20 <strcat[m]>  * I can confidently say that exploiting those kinds of bugs on GrapheneOS will likely be substantially harder and would require specifically targeting GrapheneOS but without research that question can't be answered
13:30:04 <strcat[m]> Chromium obtains CVEs for anything they consider a security fix, although there are still fixes that are probably security fixes but not classified as such
13:30:07 <strcat[m]> that's not really the topic
13:30:08 <dick[m]> There can be legitimate security issues solved by bug fixes never documented as fixing a vulnerability
13:30:19 <strcat[m]> it's not the topic
13:30:29 <dick[m]> Kk
13:30:57 <strcat[m]>  * Chromium obtains CVEs for anything they consider a security fix, although there are still fixes that are security fixes but not classified as such - probably not the case in this specific stable release though
13:32:20 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: need to at least have details like whether the bug is a heap overflow and which heap it is on and how much control the attacker has over it, etc.
13:32:53 <strcat[m]> can't answer anything based on a CVE id - at least link to the patch so at a glance some things can be determined based off it
13:34:23 <strcat[m]> there are at least a dozen Chromium security fixes every month, and you can't expect that I know them based on their CVE id and know the details of them, we don't deeply investigate every single security fix in every single project
13:35:11 <strcat[m]> we do research like looking into different past heap vulnerabilities and figuring out what led to them happening, what kind of control attackers tend to have over them, etc.
13:35:24 <strcat[m]> certainly don't do in-depth research on every single security patch to every project
13:35:57 <strcat[m]> if you want to ask me about a vulnerability you have to at least link to the patch
13:36:03 <dick[m]> Heap buffer overflow should be mitigated by our memory sanitization and hardened malloc, no?
13:36:10 <strcat[m]> ideally the commit
13:36:16 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you seem confused
13:36:37 <strcat[m]> read what I just wrote above
13:36:37 <dick[m]> * Heap buffer overflow should be harder to exploit by our memory sanitization and hardened malloc, no?
13:36:43 <dick[m]> Reworded
13:36:50 <strcat[m]> > I can confidently say that exploiting those kinds of bugs on GrapheneOS will likely be substantially harder and would require specifically targeting GrapheneOS but without research that question can't be answered
13:37:03 <strcat[m]> > need to at least have details like whether the bug is a heap overflow and which heap it is on and how much control the attacker has over it, etc.
13:37:18 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you're not rewording what I wrote at all
13:37:47 <strcat[m]> hardened_malloc hardens against use-after-free, overflows and other kinds of heap corruption with the malloc heap
13:38:17 <strcat[m]> and protects the stuff on the malloc heap from vulnerabilities exploited elsewhere
13:38:42 <dick[m]> Also I think we zero the leading heap canary byte too?
13:38:42 <strcat[m]> 'heap overflow' doesn't imply 'malloc heap overflow' - some applications use other allocators, Chromium is an example that uses several internal allocators
13:39:00 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you don't know enough about this to be giving input
13:39:01 <dick[m]> Kk
13:39:13 <strcat[m]> normal allocators don't have canaries at all
13:39:36 <strcat[m]> and you can't just draw the assumption that because we do substantial heap hardening, heap vulnerabilities aren't exploitable
13:40:38 <strcat[m]> you can often safely assume that heap overflows (involving the standard C and C++ heap) will not be exploitable with the same exploit code as elsewhere and that it will be substantially harder to exploit - not always, depends on the details
13:41:10 <strcat[m]> and many vulnerabilities won't be exploitable at all
13:41:24 <strcat[m]> but again you can't just be making such strong assumptions based on it being a heap memory corruption vulnerability
13:43:03 <strcat[m]> the general statement that can be made is that heap memory corruption vulnerabilities are the majority of serious vulnerabilities impacting the platform and we make them harder to exploit and often render them not exploitable beyond denial of service
13:43:04 <dick[m]> <strcat[m] "but again you can't just be maki"> Yeah sorry, just realized
13:43:13 <strcat[m]> you cannot just make an assumption about a specific vulnerability without knowing the details though
13:43:47 <strcat[m]> you have to know enough details to say that
13:44:07 <strcat[m]> like if it's a 1-8 byte overflow then sure it's not ever exploitable beyond denial of service
13:45:02 <strcat[m]> larger guarantee for larger allocations after a certain point
13:45:42 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of clear cut security properties provided by hardened_malloc
13:45:46 <strcat[m]> recommend looking at the README
13:45:56 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/README.md#security-properties
13:46:05 <strcat[m]> and this is just a portion of the hardening we do
13:46:32 <strcat[m]> you have to know the details of a vulnerability to determine how it's impacted by security features
13:47:13 <strcat[m]> so, if you want to ask this kind of question about a vulnerability, be specific and also present the details, including at the very least the patch fixing it
13:47:50 <strcat[m]> the patch fixing it isn't going to clearly show all the relevant details that's just a starting point for research into it
13:56:02 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: the post you linked is about older vulnerabilities than the ones fixed in the most recent release anyway, part of why you need to be specific about what you're asking about
13:56:11 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: I assumed you must have been talking about one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the most recent Chromium release, but it seems you weren't
13:57:11 <strcat[m]> so yeah, if anyone wants to ask a question like that, be specific about which vulnerability, and give the details on it, and don't be surprised if it can't be determined without in-depth research beyond looking over the commits (have yet to see any commits to look at though)
13:58:18 <dick[m]> From what I'm seeing, the problem is in an external library too this time?
13:58:22 <strcat[m]> I can't say anything based on non-technical news posts or vague information in a CVE database like "heap overflow" unspecific about which heap is even involved
13:58:27 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: is not clear what is being talked about
13:58:29 <strcat[m]> as I just said
13:58:36 <strcat[m]> be specific
13:59:32 <strcat[m]> the post bbqcore linked is not about the vulnerabilities fixed in the latest release, it's about an older release
13:59:37 <strcat[m]> so, what are we talking about?
13:59:48 <strcat[m]> which vulnerability
13:59:51 <dick[m]> The freetype vuln
13:59:57 <strcat[m]> which
14:00:06 <strcat[m]> there are multiple recent freetype vulnerabilities
14:00:30 <strcat[m]> there were also multiple vulnerabilities fixed in the past couple security fix releases of Chromium
14:00:41 <strcat[m]> how am I supposed to know which is being talked about or that people are even talking about the same one?
14:00:49 <dick[m]> *dies*
14:01:19 <strcat[m]> https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2020/11/chrome-for-android-update.html
14:01:26 <strcat[m]> https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2020/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html
14:01:37 <strcat[m]> the most recent Chromium release fixing security issues is from yesterday
14:02:04 <strcat[m]> there is nothing involving freetype
14:02:34 <strcat[m]> not all desktop ones are necessarily relevant to android
14:02:40 <strcat[m]> the android post is for ones specific to android
14:03:04 <strcat[m]> there was no freetype2 fix in this release - that was a previous one
14:03:09 <strcat[m]> and which vulnerability are you talking about
14:04:25 <strcat[m]> if people want me to analyze something they're going to need to do a lot better about actually telling me what they want me to answer
14:04:50 <strcat[m]> [$NA][1144368] High CVE-2020-16010: Heap buffer overflow in UI on Android.
14:04:52 <strcat[m]> so okay, this one
14:04:54 <strcat[m]> issue is not public yet
14:05:04 <strcat[m]> could guess which patch it is fixing the issue
14:05:11 <strcat[m]> the person asking the question needs to provide the details
14:05:29 <strcat[m]> (that's just an example of one anyway, I really have no idea which specific issue is being asked about)
14:06:03 <strcat[m]> so, based on a guess, that specific one is fixed by this commit
14:06:04 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tBVrhwuwYxvoPTJuDHwJZHPP/message.txt >
14:06:22 <strcat[m]> https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/c8b05f21a27fcc0287256d991d562d219551eb2c%5E%21/#F0
14:07:12 <strcat[m]> I don't know how JavaBitmap is implemented and whether it uses malloc
14:08:43 <strcat[m]> it looks like the vulnerability here is that computeByteSize() is attacker controlled
14:08:49 <strcat[m]> and they do a memcpy based on it
14:09:35 <strcat[m]> so that's an example of a sequential overflow
14:09:53 <strcat[m]> memcpy implementations vary in how they copy, but if you assume a basic one copying forward it would hit a guard page (if there's one there) and would clobber a canary (which would be detect when the canary check is done)
14:10:13 <strcat[m]> but again, don't know which heap this is on, don't know the details of how much control an attacker has over that size, etc.
14:10:22 <dick[m]> So basically probabilistic protection?
14:10:28 <strcat[m]> what?
14:10:37 <strcat[m]> don't understand the relevance to the topic
14:11:11 <strcat[m]> so, the answer is, further research is required to determine anything interesting about this vulnerability and how it's impacted by hardening
14:11:30 <strcat[m]> and I just chose that one arbitrarily as an example
14:12:39 <strcat[m]> starting with determining if this buffer is allocated with malloc, since this is Chromium, where there are several other commonly used allocators
14:15:06 <strcat[m]> most dynamic allocation in C and C++ is done with malloc, and there's a good chance of that being the case here, but this code is doing stuff with JNI (Java FFI) and graphics, and is part of Chromium
14:15:18 <strcat[m]> so can't assume that without looking into it
14:16:05 <strcat[m]> and I'm really just not interested in going through dozens of recent Chromium memory corruption bugs and doing source code analysis and then runtime testing of them to do write ups on the impact of our hardening features
14:16:10 <strcat[m]> something else is free to do it
14:17:28 <strcat[m]>  * someone else is free to do that
14:18:11 <strcat[m]> especially when they don't make the issues public for quite some time... it makes far more sense to do this kind of research with older, public vulnerabilities instead of ones that aren't fully disclosed
14:18:55 <strcat[m]> and it does no one any good to focus on the newer ones - the original issues being talked about weren't even the latest batches fixed in the release yesterday but rather weeks ago in an older release
16:11:26 <strcat[m]> need to redo some of the builds so it will take a while for this release
16:24:58 <cenapatop689[m]> the vim pay app (downloaded at pc - with racoon ) show a message that I cant use it because of rootet android. But grapheneos isnt rootet. Have anybody the same experentions (maybe with other apps )
16:29:22 <cenapatop689[m]> I have wrote them an email that this is impossible cause the read only image
16:31:52 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: they probably either have broken homegrown detection for it or don't properly communicate what they really mean
16:32:02 <strcat[m]> they probably mean "you aren't running the stock Google Android OS"
16:35:06 <cenapatop689[m]> Yes.. I think too. Hope they will answer me
16:51:21 <tonytonyistony[m> I was an unfortunate victim of google sending a Verizon model pixel 2 xl from the Google store. Do I have any options to get graphene installed on this phone since the oem option is greyed?
16:57:45 <cenapatop689[m]> <tonytonyistony[m "I was an unfortunate victim of g"> You have to unlock oem with adb
16:59:04 <nscnt> tonytonyistony[m: Is it actually a Verizon model or is the option just greyed out? Do you have internet access to escape the Factory Reset Protection?
16:59:05 <strcat[m]> tonytonyistony: they don't sell Pixel 2 anymore - and I really doubt they'd send a Verizon model - are you sure about that?
16:59:10 <strcat[m]> when did you buy that?
16:59:37 <nscnt> Maybe it's just an XY problem
16:59:44 <strcat[m]> tonytonyistony: we don't officially support the Pixel 2 / 2 XL anymore anyway - we may do a couple more legacy releases but they're unsupported mode now
17:00:07 <strcat[m]> for example the current release is not for 2 and 2 XL, 2 and 2 XL would have to be done later in the month as a separate legacy project
17:00:11 <tonytonyistony[m> 2018. I talked to google and gave them the imei number and they confirmed it's a Verizon model
17:01:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway at best we could do legacy releases until 12 is around
17:01:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then it's gone
17:01:18 <tonytonyistony[m> strcat yeah I thought about buying a 4a and juts tossing this locked phone
17:01:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> And there's no point to do those
17:01:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Vendor and firmware don't get security updates anyway
17:03:04 <strcat[m]> there might be another stock OS release for it in December
17:05:16 <tonytonyistony[m> I feel ya. I've been very pleased with this pixel 2 xl. It wasn't until I found out it was locked a few weeks ago that I now hate it. Lol
17:36:55 <strcat> tonytonyistony[m: it came that way new?
17:37:03 <strcat> tonytonyistony[m: or did you have to send it back at some point for repair
17:37:21 <strcat> it's hard for me to see how they screwed up so badly they sent a verizon one to you unless that's what you accidentally bought
17:37:42 <tonytonyistony[m> It came that way new
17:39:51 <tonytonyistony[m> I opened a support chat when I originally bought it to make sure I chose the right one, and they sent me the wrong one anyways. I do noticed now their website has been updated to clearly separate the Verizon model from the unlocked. It wasn't that clear back in 2018.
17:41:23 <tonytonyistony[m> But oh well, nothing I can do now. I need to get my girl friend off her samsung so I can get her on graphene so I'll probably just pick up a couple of the cheap 4a unlocked pixels
17:41:58 <tonytonyistony[m> I can get both phones cheaper than what I spent on this pixel 2 xl
17:57:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then go ahead
18:04:43 <cenapatop689[m]> Is it possible to build system critical Infrastrukturs to build with cpi or safestack? And could this implement ( https://dslab.epfl.ch/research/cpi/ )
18:19:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cenapatop689[m] "Is it possible to build system c"> No not yet
18:19:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've tried full system CFI except for glibc
18:19:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> A huge amount of stuff breaks
18:19:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Openssl breaks too
18:31:37 <fourstepper> Just a little question - how big of a problem from a privacy perspective are google maps installed and used? What do the maps actually know when not logged in?
18:33:09 <fourstepper> * Just a little question - how big of a problem from a privacy perspective are google maps installed and used? What do the maps actually know when not logged in? Just another device going from point one to point two?
18:39:31 <strcat[m]> Copperhead and James Donaldson are spreading misinformation and attacks on GrapheneOS across a bunch of platforms
18:40:33 <louipx> fourstepper: thats a big question. you need to do a traffic data analysis, maybe disassemble and analyse the source code, etc, etc
18:40:43 <strcat[m]> I would appreciate it if people are able to write articulate posts and know a fair bit about the project, etc. would counter misinformation at places like https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24979331
18:40:53 <strcat[m]> Copperhead has a dozen sockpuppet accounts posting there
18:41:04 <strcat[m]> they do the same thing on Reddit, Twitter and other platforms
18:41:23 <strcat[m]> you can watch for this happening via tweets and replies at James' Twitter account https://twitter.com/_copperj and elsewhere
18:41:37 <louipx> fourstepper: if you don't trust it, don't use it. privacy comes from your own behaviours, not from any app
18:41:41 <strcat[m]> don't respond to their misinformation with more misinformation, or trolling, etc.
18:41:47 <cenapatop689[m]> Copperheads are comerzer
18:41:55 <louipx> yea keep it above board
18:42:50 <strcat[m]> we need help defending the project from the misinformation war being waged against it
18:43:16 <strcat[m]> they're focused on promotion, marketing and slandering us rather than building something that actually keeps up with the base OS and has substantial private and security enhancements
18:43:20 <louipx> lol don't believe anyone when they say 'THE MOST SECURE IS US'
18:43:23 <strcat[m]> they can spend all day on this stuff
18:43:26 <strcat[m]> rather than building something
18:43:30 <strcat[m]> our developers can't spend time on this
18:43:33 <louipx> yea marketing
18:43:41 <strcat[m]> I need the community to step up and start defending the project from these endless, escalating attacks
18:44:16 <strcat[m]> take a look there, take a look at the twitter account of the Copperhead CEO at https://twitter.com/_copperj where he recently tried to project his own behavior as slander onto me
18:44:21 <strcat[m]> look at tweets and replies
18:44:40 <strcat[m]> they're active across a bunch of platforms including hacker news, telegram, matrix, etc. waging a misinformation war on GrapheneOS
18:45:00 <strcat[m]> if you want to help with this kind of thing reach out to madaidan.
18:45:23 <strcat[m]> send him a PM, he can answer a lot of questions about technical topics, the history of the project and this conflict, etc.
18:45:43 <strcat[m]> we need people to step up and help with this - it's a way for non-developers to make a substantial contribution and save a lot of time and stress for the developers
18:45:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyone who wants to volunteer for help, pm me right away
18:45:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat I'll take over from here
18:46:14 <strcat[m]> madaidan. is probably the best person to reach out to about it
18:46:30 <strcat[m]> we also need to find more people to help with community management including moderation of these channels and the subreddit
18:46:58 <strcat[m]> essentially, the project needs people in community management and engagement roles and a lot of people helping them
18:47:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "if you want to help with this ki"> Or send them to me lol
18:47:29 <strcat[m]> the developers including myself are focused on development - we are struggling to put together any response to these endless escalating attacks on us
18:47:38 <strcat[m]> just not enough time, and it can't be our focus
18:47:45 <strcat[m]> need other people to deal with most of this so we don't have to
18:48:52 <ThomCat[m]> I'd gladly help moderate this channel on the Matrix side
18:52:04 <ThomCat[m]> I started the +cybersec:matrix.org community which includes #cybersecurity:matrix.org , which has nearly 2,000 members
18:52:37 <cenapatop689[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "No not yet"> And what is with the idea to compile just the system critical areas with llvm cpi safestack?
18:53:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cenapatop689[m] "And what is with the idea to com"> I went for everything
18:54:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have an arch build from pkgbuilds with CFI enforced in almost every package that doesn't break with it
18:54:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> So I have a fair idea of what is broken with full system CFI on standard Linux
18:55:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Firstly
18:55:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> The compiler itself can't use CFI
18:55:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Several GNU libraries are broken
18:55:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Systemd seems to be fine with CFI but needs more testing
18:55:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Glibc and openssl have weird errors that aren't resolvable
18:56:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Afaik you can't compile glibc with CFI anyway
18:56:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> So I have tried to use libressl and boringssl but they hit similar issues with CFI
18:56:53 <madaidan[m]> <ThomCat[m] "I started the +cybersec:matrix.o"> Isn't that the community ran by that insane MMJD guy also hellbent on attacking Daniel or am I confusing communities?
18:57:10 <cenapatop689[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I went for everything"> yes I have same results with hardenedbsd
18:57:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> They just abort with SIGILL and blame a line in a header file
18:57:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> What's weird is that
18:57:26 <ThomCat[m]> <madaidan[m] "Isn't that the community ran by "> HA!  It used to be, Matrix.otg gave it to me after I asked nicely
18:57:31 <ThomCat[m]> > <@madaidan.:matrix.org> Isn't that the community ran by that insane MMJD guy also hellbent on attacking Daniel or am I confusing communities?
18:57:31 <ThomCat[m]>  * HA!  It used to be, Matrix.org gave it to me after I asked nicely
18:57:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> The line referenced in the error is a comment
18:58:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> And let's say I ignore that comment and just count the 4th effective line
18:58:18 <madaidan[m]> <ThomCat[m] "HA!  It used to be, Matrix.otg g"> That's good. MMJD is pretty crazy.
18:58:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> It still doesn't make sense how that code could violate CFI
18:58:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm also trying to unbreak arch's weird fhs
18:59:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> And bring it closer to gentoo so we could just use the refpolicy
18:59:26 <louipx> whats weird about it
18:59:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Main issue with selinux on arch is incorrect labelling anyway
18:59:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipx "whats weird about it"> They tried to make it simple
19:00:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> That didn't work out in their favor to say the least
19:00:18 <louipx> i duno works for me
19:00:20 <madaidan[m]> anupritaisno1: Have you tried just non-cross-DSO CFI? That's what HardenedBSD uses currently and it seems to work pretty well albeit not as secure.
19:00:30 <cenapatop689[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It still doesn't make sense how "> I think the problem are not in glibc .. its on cpi safestack algorithm
19:00:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Due to them trying to make it simple
19:00:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "anupritaisno1: Have you tried ju"> I haven't enabled cross DSO yet
19:01:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cenapatop689[m] "I think the problem are not in g"> There's nothing wrong there
19:01:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> And code pointer integrity is just a PoC right now
19:01:23 <louipx> try gobolinux :D
19:01:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> No compiler implements CPI
19:02:44 <cenapatop689[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "And code pointer integrity is ju"> It should find an alternative way if the normal way not work...
19:03:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
19:04:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is no production implementation of it
19:04:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's just a paper at this stage
19:05:16 <fourstepper> <louipx "fourstepper: if you don't trust "> Yeah I guess - I tried to osm and it worked great for the most part, except today it drove me into a shut down road and that sucked a lot - I am basically relying on the rest of my phone system on open source software, I was mostly curious as to what each app on the phone (such as Google Maps) can or cannot see
19:05:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless somebody actually does a production ready implementation, we don't even know if CPI is realistic enough to use in a real world case
19:05:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't know what problems may be found during the implementation
19:06:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or after it
19:06:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example shadow stacks were implemented for x86 but they were found to be racy
19:06:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> And had major issues
19:06:53 <cenapatop689[m]> I think then would it be easier to write a c , cpp to rust changer or translator (dont know how it would called )
19:06:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> That were discovered later
19:07:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cenapatop689[m] "I think then would it be easier "> Language translators are an abomination
19:08:33 <cenapatop689[m]> Hehe

19:32:12 <henry76[m]> What now
19:33:07 <henry76[m]> Iâ€™m a computer noob
19:33:21 <louipx> read it
19:33:23 <henry76[m]> Looking for privacy
19:33:41 <henry76[m]> Some of it I donâ€™t understand
19:34:16 <louipx> if you dont understand you can ask questions
19:34:32 <henry76[m]> What is the terminal?
19:34:43 <louipx> do you know about powershell
19:34:58 <henry76[m]> No
19:35:00 <strcat[m]> we really need that webusb installer
19:35:08 <strcat[m]> reached out to someone about it
19:35:09 <louipx> you require enhanced support henry76[m]
19:35:12 <strcat[m]> might hear back in a couple weeks
19:35:47 <louipx> henry76[m]: so i suggest you read the whole guide, and do research about the things you don't understand first
19:36:04 <louipx> then if you still dont understand maybe then you can ask some questions
19:36:15 <peertopeer12[m]> Henry, maybe you are a visual learner and read the guide + watch some youtube vids first
19:36:57 <peertopeer12[m]> then you can see the steps being done and can follow the guide yourself
19:37:27 <louipx> yea that may help. but dont use the youtube videos as the definite guide
19:37:49 <louipx> i think that guy that made a vid just like blabbing on camera more anyways..
19:38:07 <louipx> proper guides will be more focused on the computer/phone
19:38:09 <strcat[m]> henry76: open up powershell on Windows 10 and start working through the commands that are there
19:38:16 <strcat[m]> exactly as it has them there, no improvisation / changes to them
19:38:25 <strcat[m]> ask any questions you need to about it here
19:38:49 <strcat[m]> only change the device name / file name of the release, follow what it says to do for Windows
19:39:07 <strcat[m]> start by getting fastboot with the instructions there, setting up path and making sure it works with `fastboot --version`
19:39:17 <cenapatop689[m]> How can I use multiple vpns ( orbot with nextdns )
19:39:21 <strcat[m]> and make sure to keep the PowerShell window open
19:39:27 <strcat[m]> need to use the same one (or start over)
19:39:51 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: use them on separate profiles
19:40:16 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: you can set a DNS-over-TLS server while using a VPN service - no need for a VPN service to change DNS as long as there's a valid DNS-over-TLS server to use
19:40:25 <cenapatop689[m]> <strcat[m] "and make sure to keep the PowerS"> how can I create profils?
19:40:28 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: see the FAQ sections we have about DNS, it explains the details of this
19:40:52 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: Settings -> System -> Advanced -> Multiple users
19:41:02 <cenapatop689[m]> <strcat[m] "cenapatop689: see the FAQ sectio"> I want to insert some own entrys
19:41:19 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: it sounds like what you're really asking is how to use a custom DNS server so check out https://grapheneos.org/faq#custom-dns
19:41:26 <strcat[m]> this works fine with a VPN
19:41:44 <strcat[m]> Private DNS set to an explicit server has precedence over the VPN DNS which counts as being the network provided DNS
19:42:05 <strcat[m]> it will only use the VPN DNS to resolve the DNS-over-TLS server name, that's it
19:42:19 <strcat[m]> if you set to a specific DNS-over-TLS server
19:42:33 <strcat[m]> read the sections we have there on DNS
19:42:38 <strcat[m]> there are several
19:43:06 <strcat[m]> it's a very common question and it's covered well there
19:43:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos DNS when?
19:43:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat btw have you tested TLS 1.3 only private DNS?
19:43:52 <louipx> why
19:44:29 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no but should work fine, not much reason to bother with TLS 1.3 only though
19:44:32 <strcat[m]> due to compatibility issues
19:44:46 <strcat[m]> Android 10+ supports TLS 1.3 quite well via the OS TLS
19:44:52 <cenapatop689[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: no but should wor"> I want to block some own trackers
19:44:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: no but should wor"> I have a test server with TLS 1.3 only and it says can't connect
19:45:06 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: follow https://grapheneos.org/faq#custom-dns
19:45:08 <cenapatop689[m]> From the vivaldi browser
19:45:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> If I do TLS 1.2 + TLS 1.3 it works
19:45:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cenapatop689[m] "I want to block some own tracker"> Read the usage guide
19:45:35 <strcat[m]> faq in this case
19:45:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat but if I do TLS 1.3 only it says can't connect
19:46:07 <strcat[m]> don't know why that'd happen, maybe DNS-over-TLS can't use TLS 1.3, no clue
19:46:11 <strcat[m]> you'll have to look into it
19:46:47 <strcat[m]> I would expect it to work though
19:46:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "don't know why that'd happen, ma"> It does seem to be using 1.3 btw
19:46:47 <strcat[m]> unless they explicitly configured it to not work
19:46:48 <strcat[m]> or maybe your server was broken
19:47:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just that there seems to be a bug connecting to a server that doesn't support anything other than TLS 1.3
19:47:14 <strcat[m]> you'll just have to look into it, won't figure it out asking me
19:47:29 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: there isn't for the Android TLS stack - it works fine, I have tested it
19:47:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> K
19:47:52 <strcat[m]> until recently time.grapheneos.org was TLS 1.3 only and worked fine with the GrapheneOS HTTPS network time implementation we made via the standard TLS stack
19:48:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> So what happened?
19:48:25 <strcat[m]> it temporarily supports TLS 1.2 to shoo away bots with robots.txt
19:48:36 <strcat[m]> they started aggressively trying to index it
19:48:41 <strcat[m]> giving errors in google web console etc
19:48:50 <strcat[m]> got tired of it and am trying to make the bots go away
19:49:14 <strcat[m]> now they give an annoying error about it being indexed but robots.txt not allowing them to crawl it
19:49:15 <strcat[m]> good stuff
19:49:34 <strcat[m]> since something can be indexed even if robots.txt disallows crawling
19:49:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just support SSL3, no bot will ever index it then (sarcasm)
19:49:46 <strcat[m]> you have to serve a meta tag saying not to index it instead (and ALLOW crawling it)
19:49:57 <strcat[m]> and it's not HTML
19:49:58 <strcat[m]> so how is it supposed to do that?
19:50:31 <strcat[m]> I guess I could temporarily serve html telling bots to go away
19:51:30 <louipx> weird bots
19:52:46 <anonhat[m]> Implement cryptographic authentication with a pre shared public key in grapheneos ntp client and tell anyone without the key to fack off.
19:56:19 <louipx> the bots are relentless
20:00:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anonhat[m] "Implement cryptographic authenti"> Useless
20:00:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> By rejecting messages you are technically wasting CPU and bandwidth in sending the rejected messages
20:01:00 <peertopeer12[m]> it was hosted on a dedicated server with plenty of throughput? Can't imagine so many bots filling up the line
20:01:46 <anonhat[m]> Then just drop the packet entirely.
20:02:44 <mmcblk0[m]> Hi, is it possible pay via NFC in GOS, and how can do it, please?
20:05:07 <strcat[m]> anonhat: I mostly just want them to not index it because it's a blank response that's not even a web page
20:05:18 <strcat[m]> I guess I could redirect the URL for time.grapheneos.org instead
20:05:27 <strcat[m]> the protocol doesn't care what the HTTP response is
20:14:07 <peertopeer12[m]> still learning but the NTP protocol is not commonly used as attack vectors right? In what way would a working time.graphenos.org benefit the project besides not leaning on others e.g. pool.ntp
20:14:07 <strcat[m]> peertopeer12: NTP is not authenticated, an attacker doing MITM can change your time
20:14:08 <strcat[m]> peertopeer12: and now they can use recently expired certificates, etc. for other services
20:14:10 <peertopeer12[m]> Ah I see, pretty vital then
20:14:10 <strcat[m]> peertopeer12: also the NTP pool is not in any way trusted - you're just connecting to and relying on arbitrary untrusted third parties to get time
20:14:11 <strcat[m]> someone can spam the pool with their own servers
20:14:18 <strcat[m]> peertopeer12: instead we make an HTTPS connecting to a trusted server and retrieve time from the date header - which isn't very precise, but it's more than good enough for a mobile device, and if we wanted we could make it more sophisticated
20:14:20 <strcat[m]> not worthwhile
20:14:49 <strcat[m]> peertopeer12: this is explained in the FAQ including how it usually works without that (gets time from mobile network if connected to one, otherwise NTP)
20:16:43 <peertopeer12[m]> Thank you strcat for the clear explanation, this attack vector was unknown to me. Will read up on it, thanks
20:17:31 <strcat[m]> we plan to make other networking-related changes
20:18:09 <strcat[m]> with toggles to go back to how things work without our changes for avoiding being identified as a GrapheneOS device if you configure it that way
20:18:25 <strcat[m]> (i.e. if you want to blend in by not using a VPN and not having stuff that stands out)
20:18:43 <strcat[m]> (if you do use a VPN then might as well have all those improvements too)
20:21:16 <strcat[m]> I think that's just matrix catching up to people who logged out of irc
20:21:22 <strcat[m]> pretty broken bridge
20:21:57 <peertopeer12[m]> Yeah lol
20:22:53 <projectmoon> Freenode is going down
20:23:19 <louipx> where
20:24:00 <strcat> projectmoon: nah just chanserv
20:24:19 <projectmoon> For maintenance
20:24:39 <projectmoon> Oh, yes. It seems to have broken element mobile for me
20:28:23 <projectmoon> desktop client is fine
20:35:28 <anonhat[m]> I wonder if it would be possible to link to the phone's GPS as a primary source for NTP, rather than using a server. If so, spoofing would probably be more difficult.
20:43:27 * pluja[m] uploaded a video: GOSani.mp4 (113KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/AmzYkBetWhTUEZKRsViKcIZo/GOSani.mp4 >
20:43:29 * pluja[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/JsSpOLnJXFrjWQEDdytnLrvi/message.txt >
20:46:13 <louipc> nice
21:32:46 <strcat> anonhat[m]: the primary source is generally the mobile network unless you aren't connected to one
21:33:06 <strcat> anonhat[m]: it prefers mobile network > NTP
21:33:20 <strcat> anonhat[m]: GrapheneOS doesn't trust either and uses HTTPS
21:33:40 <strcat> anonhat[m]: and by NTP I mean network-based using a pool
21:34:37 <strcat[m]> pluja: atm we don't really have a boot animation at all, just a logo mask for the standard Android boot animation
21:34:54 <strcat[m]> pluja: need a proper bootanimation.zip
21:35:24 <strcat[m]> branding the OS is just a very low priority for us compared to security
21:35:41 <strcat[m]> we also want a different default wallpaper than the AOSP one
21:44:57 <MisterG> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a6xfFmwFwM
21:46:16 <peertopeer12[m]> offering a new boot animation with a pull request would not cost a lot of work though
21:48:13 <peertopeer12[m]> another suggestion: offering XMR as a donation option!
21:52:56 <dazinism> Tor Bowser updated to fenix
21:53:02 <dazinism> https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1003
21:53:35 <dazinism> Can safely update via the apk download if you already have it from a trusted source
22:25:39 <Dylanger[m]> <pluja[m] "GOSani.mp4"> I'll pull this in for my build, I like it
22:25:56 <Dylanger[m]> Is it available as a bootanim.zip?
22:55:45 <jacksen> High to everyone.
22:56:42 <echotunnelriver[> I'm trying to install Graphene now on my 4a. I'm coming from Calyx right now. I unlocked my bootloader and am at the point of running ./flash-all.sh . I just receive the message < waiting for any device > . I forget what error I made when flashing Calyx that caused a similar issue. Can anyone point out what I assume is an obvious error I am making again?
22:57:14 <echotunnelriver[> the command fastboot devices does show my device just fine.
22:59:09 <mrxx_0[m]> echotunnelriver you follow exactly the tutorial on GrapheneOS' website ?
22:59:15 <mrxx_0[m]> * echotunnelriver you followed exactly the tutorial on GrapheneOS' website ?
22:59:25 <echotunnelriver[> Yes, exactly as far as I can tell.
22:59:27 <dazinism> fourstepper: have a look at https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/what-can-apps-see
23:00:04 <dazinism> echotunnelriver: fastboot version
23:00:12 <mrxx_0[m]> Yep
23:00:31 <jacksen> Is it possible for me to enable adb before I setup my android phone I no its insecure  but I only need it for a bit
23:01:01 <echotunnelriver[> <dazinism "echotunnelriver: fastboot versio"> 30.0.4-6686687
23:01:12 <jacksen> I can use my pc just fine I just can't go to dev options since i can't see the screen
23:01:42 <jacksen> Once i have talkback running I will turn it off
23:01:52 <strcat[m]> echotunnelriver: on which OS, maybe you don't have permission to use it as non-root due to missing udev rules
23:02:12 <dazinism> echotunnelriver: sounds reasonable. Try different usb leads /ports
23:02:14 <echotunnelriver[> <strcat[m] "echotunnelriver: on which OS, ma"> Manjaro, I have android-udev installed as well
23:02:50 <dazinism> usb c is often unreliable, try usb A - usb c if you can
23:03:16 <dazinism> Could tey
23:03:21 <echotunnelriver[> <dazinism "echotunnelriver: sounds reasonab"> just tried the only other port available but now it doesn't show anything after entering .flash-all.sh. I assume it should be showing some kind of prgress of what's going on if it's working.
23:03:26 <dazinism> Trt
23:03:29 <dazinism> Lol
23:03:36 <dazinism> Try
23:03:43 <echotunnelriver[> <dazinism "usb c is often unreliable, try u"> I am using a USB A - USB C cable
23:03:44 <dazinism> fastboot getvar all
23:04:23 <echotunnelriver[> same, just says < waiting for any device >
23:05:01 <mrxx_0[m]> And fastboot never gave you an error ?
23:05:12 <echotunnelriver[> No, none that I can see.
23:05:14 <mrxx_0[m]> About udev rules ?
23:06:16 <dazinism> Think Manjero tends to have everything set up by default
23:06:33 <dazinism> Although it may get a bit behind at times?
23:06:37 <mrxx_0[m]> And I assume listing your device gets you the same output ?
23:06:47 <dazinism> I've used it before to flash Graphene
23:06:56 <echotunnelriver[> No, fastboot devices lists my device
23:07:05 <jacksen> I mean I am not sure if its possible to modify the graphine  source on my end to  include micro g  I don't mind helping out with the project but I can't do that since I have no idea on how graphine os works and I am finding it hard to get started
23:07:17 <mrxx_0[m]> OK that's weird
23:08:53 <dazinism> jacksen: the only way to enable adb is in developer options.
23:09:13 <echotunnelriver[> I was able to flash Calyx on this same machine maybe 3 or 4 weeks ago? I had a similar error then but ultimately used the device flasher and that worked.
23:10:02 <dazinism> Think the device flasher works with GrapheneOS?
23:10:09 <jacksen> Understood is there a way then I can add apps if I decide to custimise   the OS  on the source level so that when it turns on i can make it come up talking?
23:10:40 <echotunnelriver[> <dazinism "Think the device flasher works w"> I am not sure tbh. Not sure what the risk is in trying to run it.
23:11:00 <echotunnelriver[> Not looking to actually brick my only phone. Not to sound like a whiner
23:11:33 <dazinism> Think I heard it would work. Certainly don't think anything could go wrong
23:11:54 <dazinism> Its pretty hard to brick a pixel
23:12:57 <echotunnelriver[> Alright, I'll see if I can give it a try.
23:13:29 <dazinism> jacksen: don't think theres any easy way to do that. Although its not anything I've looked into.
23:16:36 <echotunnelriver[> Running it now, fingers crossed
23:19:31 <mrxx_0[m]> I am interested to know what Calyx  do if it works for you
23:19:31 <mrxx_0[m]> Gonna check their flash script later, night everybody

23:20:28 <echotunnelriver[> Hey guys, I figured out what I did wrong. ;_;
23:20:47 <Dylanger[m]> Anyone know if there's a permission I can give to Arorua Store to make it not ask this everytime I install an app
23:21:08 <echotunnelriver[> I enabled usb debugging but I didn't have it plugged into this laptop at the time
23:21:08 <Dylanger[m]> There should be a priv perm I can give it
23:21:33 <echotunnelriver[> Sorry for wasting your time but I appreciate the support you guys did give me.
23:21:59 <mrxx_0[m]> <echotunnelriver[ "I enabled usb debugging but I di"> xD
23:22:05 <mrxx_0[m]> Interesting
23:23:33 <echotunnelriver[> No, the flash script didn't tell me that. I guess I just figured it out on my own somehow.
23:24:04 <echotunnelriver[> The two brain cells I have were vibing on just the right levels at just the right time.
23:24:06 <mrxx_0[m]> OK, nice anyway !
23:24:08 <echotunnelriver[> The flash-all script worked after the usb debugging thing, didn't have to use device flasher
23:24:32 <mrxx_0[m]> Enjoy then
23:25:47 <echotunnelriver[> Thanks. I've been obsessively checking the releases since installing Calyx hoping for a stable release :P
23:27:17 <dazinism> I don't think turning on usb debugging should make any difference. Thats for adb, not fastboot.
23:28:05 <echotunnelriver[> That's literally the only thing I did different. Unless just rebooting and then reentering via adb (adb reboot bootloader) had some unrelated effect on it.
23:28:10 <jacksen> dazinism : I don't mind a challinge  although for now I will ask someone to turn on usb debugging for me and to authirise adb
23:28:22 <echotunnelriver[> Gremlins maybe
23:28:52 <jacksen> Android uses ce like linux so if I learn ce which I am doing alongside  python I will hopefully be able to help out with this project when it comes to accessibility support?
23:29:05 <dazinism> Dylanger: think theres an Aurora priv app that will allow updates from Aurora store or Aurora droid to auto update.
23:29:34 <Dylanger[m]> That's awesome, I'll check that out
23:29:35 <Dylanger[m]> Cheers
23:29:46 <Dylanger[m]> It is annoying having to manually update apps
23:29:48 <dazinism> Don't imagine it would ever be added to Graphene, but as you are making your own monster
23:31:02 <Dylanger[m]> Has anyone located where the "Theme" logic is on stock Pixels?
23:31:11 <Dylanger[m]> Guessing it's not in AOSP otherwise we'd already have it
23:31:31 <dazinism> ðŸ§Ÿ
23:31:50 <Dylanger[m]> Lol I didn't know that emoji existed
23:31:54 <Dylanger[m]> That's terrible
23:32:34 <dazinism> I just found super hero / super villain ones, that must be even newer....
23:32:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Dylanger[m] "Anyone know if there's a permiss"> Again, check glassrom
23:33:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> We used to ship Aurora services before they changed the license to GPLv3
23:33:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> It should still be there in the commit history
23:34:07 <Dylanger[m]> https://github.com/GlassROM/AuroraServices
23:34:13 <Dylanger[m]> (Moving to off-topic)
23:44:41 <echotunnelriver[> One last question before I'm set with Graphene. I installed the 10.23.04 release that I saw on the site. I saw on reddit there was a newer release today. Safe to assume my phone will get that update in the next 24-48 hours?
23:45:29 <Dylanger[m]> I think they're currently testing
23:46:53 <echotunnelriver[> <Dylanger[m] "I think they're currently testin"> Ah, mistakenly thought it was already released. All good then.
23:46:53 <dazinism> echotunnelriver: if it gets through testing without issues, yes.
23:47:32 <echotunnelriver[> Thanks again for the project
