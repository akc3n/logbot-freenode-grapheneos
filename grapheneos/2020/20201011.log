00:05:12 <technoph0bian[m]> Yeah, you don't need google play services.
00:06:47 <technoph0bian[m]> I am using the huawei version without google services, never tried the amazon version if there is one.
01:19:59 <yehnahyeh[m]> Hi guys. After the system update a day or two ago, my camera broke. It's a Pixel 3a. Never had any trouble before. Wife also on 3a, did the update, camera is fine.
01:43:05 <yehnahyeh[m]> * Hi guys. After the system update a day or two ago, my camera broke. It's a Pixel 3a. Never had any trouble before. Wife also on 3a, did the update, camera is fine. I get "Failed to start camera" and "Serious camera error" when I try to launch Open Cam.
01:43:05 <yehnahyeh[m]> Anyone else getting this? How can I troubleshoot it?
02:02:35 <louipc> you could try to get a log
02:40:50 <pencildeek> I'm very sorry I barely know how to use this site.i am disabled so you know. Can someone please tell me if they now of a device I can use to hook my pixel 3a to Ethernet? Thank you
02:42:46 <xander-salamande> pencildeek: that should be possible with a USB-C to Ethernet dongle, they're on Amazon and Newegg
02:42:54 <xander-salamande> I've never used one exactly but I've done similar stuff
02:46:16 <pencildeek> Thank you. I was reading that some of them don't work and was wondering if a certain one would be best
02:47:02 <xander-salamande> ohhhh huh, sorry I wish I had more info on that :/
02:48:10 <pencildeek> I'm going to try to go to school. I haven been since 7th grade and I'm almost 50. I have to do zoom classes and was hoping I could figure this out with help
02:48:54 <pencildeek> Thank you Xander
03:09:56 <RiotElement[m]> What coding language(s) would allow someone to contribute the most to the Graphene OS project?
03:12:28 <louipc> probably kotlin
03:14:01 <louipc> then C
03:14:46 <makingaliasesisa> ^^
03:14:51 <louipc> c++, python
03:15:41 <louipc> oh java still
03:16:29 <louipc> RiotElement[m]: just choose what you want to work on first, then learn that language(s)
03:19:08 <RiotElement[m]> <louipc "probably kotlin"> Any tips on places to learn these languages for free or cheap? Is Codecademy.com a good choice?
03:26:19 <louipc> no idea. please join #grapheneos-offtopic for further discussion
04:14:50 <renlord> there is more than just coding to contribute, you can test features and report issues
04:15:05 <renlord> or even starting out with writing tests
04:15:39 <renlord> it is a long, arduous (with very high attrition) path to learn coding just to contribute to the project.
04:16:05 <renlord> because well beyond coding, there are other things to understand just to get the ball rollin
04:16:34 <renlord> RiotElement[m]: ^
04:17:29 <renlord> xander-salamande: the emulator that ships with aosp uses qemu.
04:17:42 <renlord> if that even helps :/
04:17:55 <renlord> we use it for testing features on x86_64
04:18:38 <louipc> looks like tests are in java?
04:19:03 <renlord> louipc: grapheneos is a big project too, tests in hardened_malloc are written in python
04:19:25 <renlord> louipc: afaik, we dont add tests to test features we add on top of aosp
04:19:56 <renlord> we havent even had a discussion how to add tests (i.e. if we should expand CTS? or figure out how to run unit tests)
04:20:21 <louipc> sure. i think making nice degoogled apps would be the easier way to 'contribute'
04:20:34 <renlord> yep, that is also one avenue!
04:21:01 <louipc> a lot of those apps could use some love
04:21:19 <renlord> if people need some ideas, we are still looking for a substitute searchbar provider
04:21:39 <renlord> gallery and calendar
04:21:52 <louipc> and next project is the non-fdroid app store/repo
04:22:14 <renlord> or if somebody can figure out what apis to stub out to utilise google calendar, if that is pallatable for the userbase
05:13:03 <yehnahyeh[m]> <louipc "you could try to get a log"> How do I do that? Would it be on the level of the app or the system?
05:23:07 <louipc> yehnahyeh[m]: adb logcat
09:51:43 <devnull[m]3> Hi. I can see that the Pixel 4a is supported. Is also the Pixel 4a 5G supported?
09:53:18 <Sheru[m]> <devnull[m]3 "Hi. I can see that the Pixel 4a "> No it (4a) is not supported yet.
09:53:48 <Sheru[m]> <devnull[m]3 "Hi. I can see that the Pixel 4a "> Different hardware and 4a is not yet released
09:53:57 <Sheru[m]> (in AOSP branch)
09:56:42 <devnull[m]3> OK thank you
10:35:53 <brenneke[m]> <renlord "if people need some ideas, we ar"> People actually use searchbar? Thought most eliminate it, I know I do.....did.
10:39:25 <brenneke[m]> <renlord "or if somebody can figure out wh"> My vote is not palatable, plenty of good non-Google calendars exist.
12:29:22 <strcat[m]> it's not the search bar that matters but the search intent implementation

13:56:49 <redu321[m]> I Briar p2p messanger a safer way to communicate?
13:58:07 <redu321[m]> I know the theory that there is no server needed to chat (what is good) but is furthermore a safe way to chat. I am new to p2p
14:16:28 <mrxx_0[m]> <redu321[m] "I Briar p2p messanger a safer wa"> P2p doesn't mean security, BTW this is an offtopic. You can discuss it here : #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org

16:40:49 <uchihaitachi[m]> If I uploaded the backup, using SeedVault, on a cloud service, it will be encrypted, right?
18:14:55 <sheila923[m]> Is there any place where I could buy a phone with graphene OS preinstalled?
18:27:35 <louipc> i think so but none are endorsed by grapheneos
18:30:46 <Sheru[m]> <sheila923[m] "Is there any place where I could"> None of them are trustworthy.
18:30:59 <Sheru[m]> Just flash it yourself
18:31:13 <Sheru[m]> And ask here for help, why bother the price tax?
18:31:24 <istral[m]> The install process is pretty easy, a single bat script and 2GB download, you can even use windows
18:32:07 <Sheru[m]> Unsure if device flasher for Calyx also works for Graphene
18:32:11 <Sheru[m]> But that could help
18:32:43 <Sheru[m]> <Sheru[m] "Unsure if device flasher for Cal"> Thanks to them no need for somebody to buy at those scam companies lmao
18:33:38 <Sheru[m]> <sheila923[m] "Is there any place where I could"> No guarantee the profit is donated to the devs, they might as well kept it themselves
18:33:51 <istral[m]> Any battery benefit with using notifications vs disabling battery optimization for app background activity?
18:34:05 <Sheru[m]> That's a reason it's not recommended to buy it, as it could be tampered as well.
18:36:11 <Sheru[m]> Could have been a fork of GrapheneOS that was flashed with trackers in DRM or something else
18:36:22 <Sheru[m]> <istral[m] "Any battery benefit with using n"> Probably
18:41:41 <broda721[m]> Ive somehow lost my seedvault recovery phrase. How can I reset this ? I dont need access to my old encrypted backups, which are obviously inaccessible now, but I would like to start with a clean slate for new encrypted backups
18:44:07 <fll[m]> broda721: did you try turning off and on again? :P
18:44:36 <broda721[m]> :/
18:44:50 <fll[m]> If that doesn't do it, maybe try delete ng the backup destination and re-adding it
18:45:40 <Sheru[m]> <broda721[m] "Ive somehow lost my seedvault re"> Clear data the app
18:45:49 <fll[m]> <fll[m] "broda721: did you try turning of"> The backup I mean, not the phone ;)
18:46:14 <broda721[m]> Oh lol
18:47:18 <broda721[m]> <Sheru[m] "Clear data the app"> How would I do this? Its not listed in the app list
18:47:33 <broda721[m]> I could delete the backup files themselves
18:47:45 <broda721[m]> Since they arent needed anyways
18:49:39 <broda721[m]> This unfortunately didnt help
18:49:57 <NorbertTretkowsk> <uchihaitachi[m] "If I uploaded the backup, using "> Yes: https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android
18:56:16 * Sheru[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/kRpRZCIBEPraYPkxAbEPckTJ/message.txt >
18:56:48 <Sheru[m]> Or apps, see all, show system.
19:23:20 <broda721[m]> Yep I got it. Thanks for your help Sheru
20:24:50 <noob> hello
20:25:11 <noob> sorry for bothering but graphene works on phones other than pixels yeah?
20:25:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> <noob "sorry for bothering but graphene"> No
20:26:11 <noob> ah
20:26:18 <noob> shame
20:26:26 <noob> thanks
20:28:57 <noob> any alternatives you can recommend?
20:29:45 <louipc> os? nope
20:30:39 <noob> hey man it's just my first time doing android stuff
20:30:52 <noob> no need to be a troll
20:31:10 <noob> i just came here because i want to learn and didn't find enough resources elsewhere
20:33:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> There was glassrom
20:33:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> But I'm not sure if I want to continue it
20:33:59 <snowfur[m]> <noob "sorry for bothering but graphene"> No, there isn't and consider reading this as to why: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
20:34:34 <noob> thank you
20:43:45 <nightjar[m]1> <noob "any alternatives you can recomme"> There is CalyxOS which supports the Xiaomi Mi A2, but other than that it's all Pixels. These kinds of projects are focused on supporting a few devices with high standards that people obtain to run Graphene or Calyx OS specifically, rather than supporting a broad range of devices with lower standards.
21:14:47 <WokeBillKristol[> just checking to see if it's just my machine
21:15:26 <WokeBillKristol[> did anyone else see a large memory usage increase since the 11 update on their pixel 3a?
21:34:34 <dazinism> uchihaitachi someone looking at a seedvault backup can see which apps have been backed up, but not get any app data.
21:37:26 <dazinism> sheila923: Think ncrypt cellular in Australia have been selling devices. Also donating to the project. At least the spoke to the main developer about doing that some time back, and had devices listed on their site.
21:39:07 <dazinism> uchihaitachi also I think currently nextcloud backups are unreliable.
21:40:05 <dazinism> Its fixed and should be reliable with the next release of seedvault.
21:40:57 <dazinism> Last release was in March. Theres been a load of work on it since then, but no release
