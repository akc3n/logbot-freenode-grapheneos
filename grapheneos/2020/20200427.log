00:01:09 <status_active[m]> wait
00:01:17 <status_active[m]> something different
00:01:33 * status_active[m] uploaded an image: fastbo3.png (272KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/fCNLDVovWGZbzqSlCadnpOmf >
00:02:31 <zoraver[m]> It looks like is succeeded. Next step should be to lock the bootloader
00:02:45 <status_active[m]> before restarting?
00:03:00 <zoraver[m]> I would let it restart first
00:04:15 <status_active[m]> ouch too late
00:04:39 <status_active[m]> rebooting
00:04:44 <status_active[m]> we have a booting screen!
00:04:56 <status_active[m]> GrapheneOS
00:06:09 <status_active[m]> connecting to wifi
00:07:40 <status_active[m]> it's alive!
00:07:50 <zoraver[m]> Bootloader locked?
00:08:01 <status_active[m]> boot loader locked!
00:08:11 <analogpathy[m]> Congratulations status_active if bootloader is locked.
00:08:19 <analogpathy[m]> üëè
00:08:32 <status_active[m]> thank you so much guys!
00:08:42 <zoraver[m]> No problem
00:08:45 <status_active[m]> appreciate your time!
00:09:19 <fr4[m]> Just asking, with this OS we are still vulnerable from the "govs" spyware, i think yes, but i didnt still seen any argouments about this
00:09:36 <TheJollyRoger> ...! Splice the mainbrace! Thank you zoraver[m] !!!
00:10:19 <status_active[m]> Thank you TheJollyRoger zoraver !!
00:10:31 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship status_active[m] !
00:10:44 <status_active[m]> yeih!
00:21:56 <status_active[m]> It's running really smooth
00:22:29 <status_active[m]> awesome work on this OS
00:39:13 <status_active[m]> everything is working as intended.
00:39:39 <status_active[m]> üôÇ
00:41:36 <brenneke[m]> Guy like that can't die.
00:41:54 <TheJollyRoger> ^_^ Awesome
00:42:16 <status_active[m]> he'd reborn as a Fenix
00:43:13 <status_active[m]> some banking app are not working but I imagine is for the lack of a Google Play or Google Account
00:43:14 <izymandias[m]> what happens to graphene os if daniel dies?
00:44:06 <JTL> Someone tries to fork it?
00:44:11 <status_active[m]> but other than that, man, this phone is a daily driver, easily
00:44:11 <izymandias[m]> who will carry the torch>
00:44:17 <izymandias[m]> ?
00:48:31 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: I'm a pirate, not a fortuneteller. I can't see the future in a crystal ball.
00:48:47 <TheJollyRoger> status_active[m]: yep! Production quality releases :)
00:51:39 <status_active[m]> ü§ì yes sr!
01:05:00 <izymandias[m]> haha
01:05:25 <izymandias[m]> arrr sorry matii
01:07:32 <izymandias[m]> how much longer will the pixel 3 be supported?
01:16:38 <TheJollyRoger> Likely, until the security patches stop coming.
01:16:54 <TheJollyRoger> Once the security patches stop coming, then this community has a choice:
01:18:34 <TheJollyRoger> If the community has a whole pile of incredibly knowledgeable and skilled volunteers willing to essentially work for free and are really good with kernel fixes and backports and Android development, and they're all sitting around twiddling their thumbs and doing nothing, and have nothing better to do,
01:19:26 <TheJollyRoger> Then support for the Pixel 3 could in theory continue as a legacy device once that happens -- again, on the contingency we've got a huge surplus of volunteers that know Android In and Out and are willing to do the work for free.
01:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> And have nothing better to do and are sitting around bored.
01:20:28 <TheJollyRoger> Or -- or or or or or -- if this community gets up and /hires/ a bunch of those people to do it.
01:20:38 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise, once the security patches stop coming, the Pixel 3 gets discontinued.
01:22:41 <TheJollyRoger> Remember that GrapheneOS is not a business, it's an open-source project.
01:23:44 <TheJollyRoger> It's not a matter of money goes in, and products come out, it's a matter of "a gift, for a gift." If volunteers step up to do the work, they (as well as everyone who wants to) can enjoy the fruits of their labour.
01:28:03 <TheJollyRoger> So, if you'd like to continue the support of the Pixel 3 as a legacy device after the firmware updates stop coming... we should all get learning and committing right away.
01:28:22 <TheJollyRoger> Since it was released in mid 2018. It's now halfway to the end of its life.
01:44:34 <status_active[m]> so, those are not good news for the Pixel 2 XL
01:45:08 <TheJollyRoger> Well... not all hope is lost.
01:45:43 <TheJollyRoger> If we the community steps up to make substantial contributions to making the devices sustainable, it could happen. It'll dependent on the amount of hands and help that comes in.
01:45:56 <TheJollyRoger> Er, "it" being supporting legacy devices.
01:47:50 <status_active[m]> yeah, make sense
01:48:22 <status_active[m]> now I wonder how we "the mortals" who are no developer can contribute to the project
01:48:34 <status_active[m]> *developers
01:48:54 <TheJollyRoger> We could look out for, and pay and hire developers to do the work for us.
01:52:21 <TheJollyRoger> I've been trying to find some :(.
01:52:56 <TheJollyRoger> Something else "the mortals" can do is to continue to fight against the FUD that the project's come under attack by. A disgruntled business partner has launched a smear campaign.
01:53:17 <status_active[m]> are current donations a significant input stream for the project?
01:53:47 <status_active[m]> FUD?
01:54:57 <TheJollyRoger> At this moment, donations are the only significant input stream for the project. Daniel Micay gladly accepts Bitcoin, Paypal, and Github Sponsorship.
01:55:20 <status_active[m]> I'll contribute with something for sure
01:55:27 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, glad to hear it matey :)
01:56:12 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/donate will reveal a bitcoin address, a paypal address, and information about the Github Sponsorship program.
01:58:17 <status_active[m]> Do you know if Daniel accepts e-Transfers?
01:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hum. I don't think I've used that before.
01:59:43 <TheJollyRoger> So I don't know. I think you're probably safest to just stick to what's on that page.
02:00:01 <status_active[m]> oh I know he'd know it
02:00:17 <status_active[m]> :)
02:00:24 <TheJollyRoger> X3
02:00:50 <status_active[m]> e-transfers are popular across canada
02:00:51 <TheJollyRoger> I just use the Github Sponsorship because then Microsoft matches my donations for the first year.
02:01:09 <status_active[m]> oh really?
02:01:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah ^_^.
02:01:16 <status_active[m]> nice
02:01:16 <TheJollyRoger> Free money :D
02:01:37 <status_active[m]> for sure
02:03:24 <status_active[m]> well, time to go to bed. Thanks for everything and take care.
02:03:34 <status_active[m]> PS. I wont forget about you guys, I'll definitely contribute with some bucks
02:03:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, fare the well! ^_^
02:54:12 <izymandias[m]> @TheJollyRoger Which language does one need to learn in order to contribute?
03:09:19 <TheJollyRoger> Hi izymandias[m], at this moment, that depends on what you'd like to do with GrapheneOS and where you'd like to contribute:
03:09:44 <TheJollyRoger> If you're interested in contributing to the GrapheneOS app store and being an app developer -- that's something GrapheneOS sorely, DESPERATELY needs to be production ready --
03:09:58 <TheJollyRoger> You'll likely want Java and Kotlin.
03:10:20 <TheJollyRoger> Those are supported officially by the Android Studio, and present the lowest barrier to entry.
03:11:20 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, one thing that Daniel has often mentioned would be fantastic would be to have a first-party appstore, and possibly, a replacement mail app!
03:11:40 <TheJollyRoger> Or a replacement calendar app.
03:13:29 <TheJollyRoger> If you're interested in things like the Kernel, and Kernel hardening, or maintaining devices, then as unfortunate as this is, you may want to have some C, and you'll probably also want Rust.
03:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS wants to replace C with Rust for low-level code for safety.
03:14:30 <TheJollyRoger> If you're doing web applications (and some of this also has to do with apps) you'll want JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
03:14:50 <TheJollyRoger> And, for scripts, you'll probably want Python 3 and Bash on the side.
03:15:08 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/build#development-guidelines Consider these, possibly?
03:28:00 <TheJollyRoger> So if you have any of those languages, you're ready to join up.
03:34:38 <TheJollyRoger> Or, if you'd like to help me with testing, then you're welcome to it, but I'd caution you that testing is going to be a lot of work; because GrapheneOS does not include telemetry or analytics, this means that testing is going to be more than just selecting the option "Beta Channel" and occasionally sending a "Hey this app crashes" from time to time. It's going to mean doing things like running
03:34:40 <TheJollyRoger> the CTS, manually analyzing the data, and collecting and writing the reports. It will be a lot of work and diligence.
03:35:43 <TheJollyRoger> This is why I've sometimes said "Telemetry's not always a dirty word."
03:58:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, telemetry is useful, but without it, this is what we'll have to do in lieu of getting those reports directly from the users.
03:58:33 <TheJollyRoger> So any help here would be appreciated.
04:18:52 <renlord> network permission is a feature specific to graphene os right?
04:18:57 <renlord> and not available on Q?
04:19:08 <TheJollyRoger> Hi renlord, I believe so. I think network and sensors is unique to GrapheneOS only.
04:19:29 <renlord> can we add that to the usage documentation on grapehneos.org?
04:19:35 <TheJollyRoger> Whoop!
04:19:37 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! I'm on it!
04:19:43 <TheJollyRoger> Just a sec.
04:41:31 <TheJollyRoger> hi renlord, sorry about the delay, working on it now.
04:41:39 <renlord> no hurry
04:49:17 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to use Daniel's old writings from the old legacy documentation.
04:54:39 <aby23[m]> is it possible to develop grapheneos for redmi phones if there are substantial amount of funding happen
04:54:48 <renlord> no
04:55:00 <renlord> does not meet hardware security requirements
04:57:38 <aby23[m]> yeah i see, thanks for replying
04:57:56 <aby23[m]> and about samsung s series till s10?
04:58:09 <TheJollyRoger> Hi aby23[m], sadly not.
04:58:20 <aby23[m]> okay
04:58:31 <TheJollyRoger> The reason why is that Samsung phones have an eFuse that gets blown when the phone's bootloader is unlocked.
04:58:38 <TheJollyRoger> This then disables the bootloader security.
04:59:02 <aby23[m]> yes
04:59:10 <TheJollyRoger> Samsung does not allow us to provision the bootloader of the phone with our own verified boot keys, and instead just insists that you either use their image, or you get no security at all.
04:59:15 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS cannot support that.
04:59:22 <JTL> it's awful
05:00:05 <aby23[m]> <TheJollyRoger "GrapheneOS cannot support that."> totally agree that
05:00:12 <aby23[m]> without locked bootloader, there no point doing it
05:00:38 <aby23[m]> that is really sad for xiaomi and samsung owner like me
05:00:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:01:13 <TheJollyRoger> For a while there was some excitement that the Xiaomi Mi A2 would be capable of supporting GrapheneOS, but the community did not step up to sieze the chance and support the device.
05:01:50 <TheJollyRoger> We later found unfortunately that there were problems with the Mi A2's Verified Boot that apparently did not properly enforce verified boot with custom keying.
05:02:13 <aby23[m]> so i have to going the root of pixel 3a for cheap as of now
05:02:23 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, that's your best bet.
05:02:42 <aby23[m]> okay
05:03:04 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to supporting new devices, if you're curious, I can tell you a bit about what would need to happen.
05:03:20 <aby23[m]> okay
05:03:54 <aby23[m]> i am curious to know if possible there are any other device qualified for grephene os
05:03:57 <TheJollyRoger> The long story short is, we'd need the community to step up and properly support the devices we've currently supported, to allow our lead developer more time to focus on new devices.
05:04:01 <aby23[m]> other than pixel series
05:04:12 <aby23[m]> sure
05:04:12 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think so at this moment.
05:04:16 <aby23[m]> totally understandable
05:05:08 <TheJollyRoger> This includes ongoing commitments to do things like port the fixes, exploit mitigations, device specific work, driver hardening and kernel hardening to the device.
05:05:30 <TheJollyRoger> This is not a once-and-done-affair, but rather would be an ongoing commitment that would last the lifetime of the phone: three years from launch, to discontinuation.
05:05:46 <JTL> (and could get longer in the future)
05:05:57 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah.
05:06:08 <TheJollyRoger> If the community is interested in legacy support, the commitment time only gets longer.
05:06:13 <aby23[m]> i got the point
05:07:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Now for a device to be supported... it'd have to either meet or exceed the Pixels' amount of openness and forthcoming and support. This means the drivers for it need to be open source, the firmware for it preferably source-available like the Pixels are,
05:08:08 <TheJollyRoger> it has to allow for full hardware security features with customized keying for verified boot and it has to work with the existing open-source Android toolset. This includes things such a it has to be able to support debugging via the UART interface.
05:08:52 <aby23[m]> seems google pixels are more secure and supporting openness towards developer
05:08:57 <TheJollyRoger> They are.
05:09:29 <TheJollyRoger> Google actually is extremely helpful and forthcoming here, and they've even gone the extra mile by co-operating in the form of giving support, documentation, source code, and tools for doing so.
05:09:35 <aby23[m]> i think samsung and xiaomi is bad manufacturer towards customer at least for their security and freedom to do things with it
05:09:36 <TheJollyRoger> More so than any other vendor.
05:09:42 <TheJollyRoger> They are, after all, the reference implemention of Android.
05:11:35 <TheJollyRoger> Samsung is one of the worst, my biggest beef with them is their sledgehammer approach to security of "just vendor sign everything"
05:12:18 <aby23[m]> never going to buy samsung devices, as far as xiaomi goes their ui experience and overall force ad is unbearable. Never going to buying phones form these manufacturer
05:12:49 <JTL> In theory some of their devices might make interesting GrapheneOS targets, but other then that, meh
05:13:11 <TheJollyRoger> If more vendors were willing to co-operate with us, maybe things would change.
05:13:26 <TheJollyRoger> But it's more than just co-operation as well, it's also things like the quality of their own firmware.
05:13:55 <TheJollyRoger> For one, it's GrapheneOS mission to improve the security and privacy of the Android Open Source Project and provide a usable, production-quality experience while we're at it.
05:14:06 <TheJollyRoger> It isn't GrapheneOS' job to pick up after the vendors' mistakes.
05:15:55 <aby23[m]> what should i do with my old mi and samsung is selling is a good option? what you guys think about selling old devices
05:17:39 <TheJollyRoger> If you can, do it. If you can't, those devices are what I call "pop tarts"
05:17:55 <TheJollyRoger> Use 'em for battery packs.
05:22:28 <TheJollyRoger> Named because actual pop tarts supply energy and no other nutritional value :)
05:22:30 <aby23[m]> is there any consequences to selling used devices? any privacy concerns related '
05:23:37 <aby23[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Named because actual pop tarts s"> well, :D
05:24:10 <TheJollyRoger> aby23[m]: Depends on if you trust the secure deletion on those phones.
05:24:51 <TheJollyRoger> Google Pixel 3s, I completely trust their secure deletion/factory reset, because the Titan M chip will change its access token and change the 2kB partition header used for key derivation.
05:25:11 <TheJollyRoger> Other phones? I really don't know.
05:25:14 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know how they do it.
05:25:52 <aby23[m]> thanks for valuable information
05:26:36 <TheJollyRoger> If you've ended up with a lot of pop tarts, save them, they sometimes come in handy if you have a large amount of gadgets you need to charge and for some reason run out of USB battery packs.
05:27:17 <brenneke[m]> Any security/privacy advantages using Bromite over Vanadium on GOS?
05:28:26 <renlord> brenneke[m]: please read the logs
05:28:28 <renlord> and the FAQ
05:28:38 <renlord> tl;dr no, not really
05:28:50 <brenneke[m]> K.
05:29:59 <aby23[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If you've ended up with a lot of"> i have 3 pop tarts
05:30:18 <TheJollyRoger> Oh goodness O_O.
05:31:16 <aby23[m]> haha s9+, poco f1 and redmi note 5 - not in use though
06:08:29 <gervarouge[m]> Is iPhone not worth getting over the WebRTC leak? I know it's popular here
06:34:28 <joshman[m]> gervarouge what's your threat model? For me iPhone is no option. Nor is anything else on the planet
06:38:02 <gervarouge[m]> <joshman[m] "gervarouge what's your threat mo"> For me I want to keep targeted hackers away, advertisers away, and keep government dragnet away. US govt
06:38:33 <gervarouge[m]> iPhone seems to have the best permissions and minimal background use for apps. It seems like the best for privacy of 3rd party apps while GrapheneOS doesn't even have a good store option yet
06:39:21 <gervarouge[m]> Security wise it's definitely a mixed bag. A hacker probably would have an easier time penetrating an iPhone, but if they had a malicious app it would do more damage on GrapheneOS due to permissions like that Privacy Breacher app.
06:39:52 <gervarouge[m]> For US Government I guess I am screwed with either since I need proprietary stuff to get either to run
06:40:21 <gervarouge[m]> Overall it seems iPhone would be the obvious choice, but the only concern is the WebRTC leak
06:40:37 <gervarouge[m]> I usually only browse with JS off, but still
06:45:37 <joshman[m]> If I wanted to stay away US government I'd rather go with anything else but iPhone.
06:45:58 <gervarouge[m]> Huawei P40 Pro hell yeah
06:46:10 <gervarouge[m]> I just want to get the dragnet stuff out of the way
06:46:17 <gervarouge[m]> Which I can check with MITM
06:46:20 <gervarouge[m]> Not using iCloud
06:50:20 <joshman[m]> I'd consider iPhone if they drop mandatory account
06:50:34 <gervarouge[m]> It's not mandatory
06:51:00 <joshman[m]> How can I download apps without apple ID?
06:51:42 <gervarouge[m]> I mean if you don't mind having to sideload everything
06:51:56 <gervarouge[m]> You have to sideload :(
06:52:12 <gervarouge[m]> Which you can do with a third party app store, but not sure how many of those you can trust
06:52:22 <joshman[m]> Gotcha. A workaround. Though a very inconvenient one
06:52:58 <gervarouge[m]> Third party app stores are easy
06:53:06 <gervarouge[m]> They do have more flexibility though which could make all the extra protections of iOS mostly moot
06:54:42 <gervarouge[m]> So I guess having an account for app downloads is the way to go if you don't have a Mac
06:54:55 <gervarouge[m]> Which is not the end of the world for me
06:55:07 <gervarouge[m]> My main concern is the WebRTC leaks
06:55:13 <gervarouge[m]> Does that make it all pointless?
08:29:28 <TheJollyRoger> renlord - pr sent. I decided while I was at it to fix up and bring forward some old stuff from the usage guide.
08:38:57 <mxnorvak[m]> TheJollyRoger : if a pixel or an iphone aren't an available option, what do you consider to be the next best thing? Android one maybe?
08:39:39 <TheJollyRoger> Putting aside that money to get a pixel or an iPhone.
08:39:48 <TheJollyRoger> At a future date.
08:40:27 <TheJollyRoger> Honestly, I think that's probably going to be your best option.
08:41:08 <mxnorvak[m]> I know,rn those two arent even in the market in the place i am currently
08:43:05 <mxnorvak[m]> But still i would have liked to know what other option would be slightly better than others if there isn't any way to get a pixel or an iPhone
08:43:17 <TheJollyRoger> I honestly don't know.
08:44:58 <mxnorvak[m]> Thanks :)
08:45:12 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome. Sorry I couldn't give you a better answer!
08:46:25 <mxnorvak[m]> No worries, i've already learnt so much from you :)
09:18:03 <kookie9001> Is https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android snake oil?
10:00:56 <gervarouge[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Putting aside that money to get "> Is the WebRTC leak a deal breaker for the iPhone?
10:02:10 <gervarouge[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "But still i would have liked to "> On Reddit Daniel mentioned the Android One phones with gapps off as the poor man's GrapheneOS iirc. I could try to find it. Don't take my word for it. I wouldn't consider it as good as Pixel or iPhone of course not even remotely.
10:04:25 <renlord> they receive the latest software updates
10:04:38 <gervarouge[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/da15rg/comment/f1n7gfm
10:04:40 <renlord> but the vendor may not keep firmware patches up to date.
10:05:10 <gervarouge[m]> Suggesting Android One with gapps disabled over using an EOL GrapheneOS. Hope that's helpful
10:05:47 <gervarouge[m]> If you go this (not recommended) route make sure you get a Qualcomm chip not a MediaTek or anything else
10:08:35 <gervarouge[m]> mxnorvak: sorry I sent the wrong link  https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/da15rg/comment/f1n83b1?context=3
10:08:47 <gervarouge[m]> <renlord "but the vendor may not keep firm"> Android One? Or EOL GrapheneOS?
10:09:05 <gervarouge[m]> I take that to mean EOL GrapheneOS
10:11:44 <renlord> Android One.
10:11:53 <renlord> vendors participating in android one
10:12:07 <gervarouge[m]> * https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/da15rg/comment/f1n83b1?context=3
10:14:32 <gervarouge[m]> Oh gotcha, so they lie about patches like Lineage does?
10:14:47 <gervarouge[m]> Even with the Android One gig?
10:14:49 <renlord> please dont misinterpret what i'm writing here.
10:14:51 <gervarouge[m]> I'm surprised Google would be cool with that
10:16:17 <renlord> oh im sorry, i think i just confused myself between android one and treble.
10:16:45 <renlord> what i say is mostly directed for treble-compliant devices.
10:16:47 <renlord> not android one.
10:16:57 <gervarouge[m]> Haha that makes more sense
10:17:08 <gervarouge[m]> All good
10:17:22 <renlord> with android one, apparently google is involved with the hardware configuration process also, im guessing they will insist that they are patched consistently enough
10:17:34 <renlord> but I personally dont know if that is the case in real life.
10:18:04 <gervarouge[m]> So if you lived in a country where you couldn't get an iPhone or Pixel like mxnorvak would you get that with no gapps?
10:18:29 <renlord> i guess
10:18:39 <gervarouge[m]> <renlord "but I personally dont know if th"> That's the tricky part. Google and Apple are proven
10:21:33 <gervarouge[m]> I'd probably get a Nokia since they support for 3 years instead of the 2 most other Android One makers do. They also had a good track record with the 4 years of updates with Microsoft on the Windows Phones. They did have that telemetry scandal with the Android's though. I forgot what that was about...
10:21:57 <mxnorvak[m]> Im wondering with google being this much involved and android one being what it is, is it even possible to remove play services and gapps!
10:22:20 <gervarouge[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "Im wondering with google being t"> It is
10:22:30 <renlord> can you even flash aosp on it?
10:22:36 <gervarouge[m]> Google made it all able to be disabled lately
10:22:42 <renlord> and still keep secure boot and friends
10:22:52 <renlord> i see, you can disable
10:23:13 <gervarouge[m]> It's not different than a Pixel really in software wise
10:23:17 <gervarouge[m]> <renlord "and still keep secure boot and f"> It's essentially a Pixel rom
10:23:28 <gervarouge[m]> That's the point
10:23:39 <gervarouge[m]> Android One is essentially a budget Pixel experience
10:25:47 <gervarouge[m]> Android One probably on a Nokia x.3(very new) with gapps disabled is the closest thing to a poor man's graphene (sub $100 new for the 1.3)
10:26:20 <gervarouge[m]> Supported by Google mandate for 2 with OS and security. Nokia opts to offer a year more of support for security only
10:26:27 <mxnorvak[m]> I guess its between Nokia, Xiaomi and Motorola then
10:26:37 <gervarouge[m]> Just avoid the MediaTek older versions
10:26:49 <gervarouge[m]> Yes
10:27:02 <gervarouge[m]> A3 was almost supported by GrapheneOS
10:27:17 <mxnorvak[m]> Just read about it,Google offers 2 years of OS update and 3 years of security update
10:27:36 <gervarouge[m]> Google only offers 2 iirc
10:27:47 <gervarouge[m]> Nokia adds a year
10:28:01 <gervarouge[m]> Motorola is only 2 I think
10:28:01 <renlord> nokia has no titan m
10:28:35 <gervarouge[m]> <renlord "nokia has no titan m"> Yeah that's the big loss
10:29:48 <gervarouge[m]> mxnorvak: you can't just get an ancient iPhone? They are supported so long even a 3 or 4 year old one could be okay. iPhone 5s is going strong with 7 years of updates
10:29:50 <gervarouge[m]> An iPhone 7 for example?
10:30:43 <gervarouge[m]> I'd take an iPhone 7 over an Android One personally
10:31:58 <mxnorvak[m]> Yeah that's also an option, it'd probably need a battery replacement tho
10:33:23 <mxnorvak[m]> And i think i read that hardware wise it was from iphone 10 that things got really great with apples security chip but i might be wrong
10:33:42 <gervarouge[m]> iPhone 7 has the A10 which can perform very well
10:34:17 <gervarouge[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "And i think i read that hardware"> 8/X were really good, but 7 is great compared to say an Android One
10:34:42 <gervarouge[m]> You could try getting an 8
10:35:08 <gervarouge[m]> A10 on the iPhone 7 is still used on the newest iPad and iPod Touch. It's pretty fast still
10:36:00 <mxnorvak[m]> I guess this is where SE becomes an option
10:36:01 <renlord> the iphone se is pretty affordable
10:36:49 <gervarouge[m]> mxnorvak: I thought they don't sell them in your country?
10:37:07 <gervarouge[m]> Or are they just too expensive
10:37:58 <renlord> if something is too expensive for me, i usually say that its not up for sale
10:38:24 <gervarouge[m]> iPhone SE(old) used is like $50 here wow
10:40:27 <mxnorvak[m]> I didnt say they're not sold here, they're just not available rn and idk when they would be ,but yeah prices dont make much sense either, pixel 3a and my phone (mi 9t pro) are in the same price category however the pixel is twice more expensive here
10:40:58 <mxnorvak[m]> Its the same for iphones
10:41:42 <mxnorvak[m]> But i generally was just curious to know what is the next best thing
10:41:54 <gervarouge[m]> Interesting I'd go used
10:42:18 <gervarouge[m]> Android One is definitely okay, but it's not nearly as good
10:50:28 <mxnorvak[m]> Thanks :)
10:55:22 <dazinism> Its a pity Xiaomi messed stopped alternative OS verified boot working on Mi A2
10:56:37 <dazinism> Calyx has full working support for A2 but they dont release factory builds, guess because theres no verified boot
10:57:37 <dazinism> * pity Xiaomi stopped alternative OS verified boot working on Mi A2
10:58:50 <dazinism> Guess its still a nicer option than using Lineage, but a great shame not to have verified boot
10:59:24 <dazinism> They put in a load of work porting.
11:13:43 <gervarouge[m]> That sucks
11:36:53 <Zenithium[m]> gervarouge: Apple's WebRTC implementation doesn't leak iirc but I'm not totally sure
11:57:45 <hiya> Why is only Google devices supported?
12:00:47 <Zenithium[m]> Read https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
12:02:51 <Zenithium[m]> The Pixels fulfill all of the security and other criteria for GrapheneOS
13:34:52 <yekip[m]> my pixel crashed the other day, and I wondered if this is a known issue. It's a Pixel 3. I used the camera to take a new wallpaper shot. after taking the picture it locked up and wouldn't do anything. had to restart it and it came into recovery mode so I had to wipe it and start again.
13:35:20 <yekip[m]> anyone had this?
15:31:13 <cyborgninjaneer[> That sounds new.
15:50:08 <hiya> Zenithium[m]: I see
16:06:27 <joeri_poeri[m]> <yekip[m] "my pixel crashed the other day, "> did a restart not do anything?
16:38:14 <xudii> I can't access the internet through mobile data. "4G" appears underneath the mobile data icon in notifications, though. Calls and text work fine. I am pretty sure I have updated the stock rom without a sim card inserted. Is it possible I have missed some firmware updates while updating the stock rom because of that?
16:41:42 <xudii> I have also tried switching to 3G, including rebooting after that. No success.
16:59:09 <joshman[m]> Aurora Store is not getting API for weeks. Can someone confirm?
17:02:12 <xudii> joshman[m]: not weeks. can confirm 2-3 days. worked before that.
17:03:01 <Kurai> it will work if you logout and login again
17:05:02 <xudii> Kurai: i can also confirm that. thanks!

17:42:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> bseeinu: Update 29/12/19 There is a plan to test out Android 9 and 10. Also, we want to test usage during sleep. WireGuard has a mode where you don't send keepalives when the device sleeps, it will not initiate network connections at all. While OpenVPN needs keepalives so it will wake up the device from time to time and consume more battery.

18:07:59 <yojoe[m]> you can have multiple "virtual" numbers in many different countries with the same sim card!?
18:09:05 <nuttso[m]> U have 24 imsi on one sim card. You can change them all for 1 euro. I'm talking to the about esim support.
18:09:14 <nuttso[m]> <yojoe[m] "you can have multiple "virtual" "> Yes also
18:09:32 <nuttso[m]> Also number spoofing
18:09:53 <yojoe[m]> but only one of the 24 is active at any time?
18:10:12 <yojoe[m]> or multiple simultaneously?
18:18:42 <bseeinu[m]> Mullvad and private DNS (nextdns) are no friends, are they

18:28:25 <bseeinu[m]> True
18:28:43 <DannyWorkOrderPr> =P

18:34:10 <nickcalyx[m]> Mullvad posted to twitter that their wireguard VPN nodes are broken and they know about it
18:34:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If on desktop Linux, network-manager can be shitty about creating new Wireguard connections sometimes.
18:34:44 <bseeinu[m]> "No Wireguard key set"
18:34:47 <bseeinu[m]> Wtf
18:35:47 <bseeinu[m]> Oh like a thing happening now? Wow, nice first use experience
18:38:45 <cx2[m]> you could always setup and run your own instance running wireguard
18:39:11 <cx2[m]> in the three years of continuous use of mullvad.... this is one of the first times they have had issues. Sometimes.... just sometimes, things break.
18:41:04 <bseeinu[m]> Often times, just often times, I have a talent for this kind of synchronicity üòâ
18:41:24 <bseeinu[m]> I just assumed it was me being stupid.
18:44:07 <cx2[m]> I break things constantly.... I can't seem to get half of the shit I download to work properly.
18:44:27 <cx2[m]> Tarsnap? Nope....mat2? Nah, all dependencies installed... i can see them.... doesn't want to work.
18:44:44 <cx2[m]> I feel your pain
19:02:48 <izymandias[m]> are there any reddit threads where daniel talks about the security of linux(desktop)?
19:04:03 <JTL> Yes, and if you want to be pragmatic, no current desktop OS has proper isolation between applications so that's a strike against the desktop application model in general.
19:05:38 <yekip[m]> <joeri_poeri[m] "did a restart not do anything?"> It booted into recovery/bootloader thingie. with the option to use vol keys to select and power to choose. black screen with white and yellow text
19:05:48 <yekip[m]> but it wouldn't boot so i reset it
19:07:00 <joeri_poeri[m]> what a shame man. havent seen that happen luckily
19:08:54 <yekip[m]> yeah. no biggie, hopefully a one off. but leads me to ask again about backing up. jollyroger explained to me the manual process of backing things up, but I wonder if any updates since with more automated options? hate to say it, but as close to itunes type thing as poss? prefer local machine, but cloud would be doable
19:21:48 <gervarouge[m]> <JTL "Yes, and if you want to be pragm"> Even ChromeOS?
19:22:01 <JTL> ChromeOS has improvements in this area
19:22:22 <JTL> It's a complex topic I'm not going to reiterate because I'm busy with other things at the moment
19:22:49 <gervarouge[m]> Yeah and ChromeOS sucks for privacy anyway
19:23:19 <JTL> gervarouge[m]: I was referring to geneeral system hardening there, not privacy, but okay
19:25:22 <gervarouge[m]> Yes, I'm saying it's probably the best for security, but at a high cost
19:25:32 <gervarouge[m]> Rather less bad than good security
19:31:27 <yekip[m]> someone above mentioned Eddie, the VPN client from AirVPN. If you're stil about, were you takling about running it on Graphene and if so, does it work nicely? I have PIA but might try that instead as the servers run faster
19:31:32 <yekip[m]> *connections, not servers
20:15:47 <brenneke[m]> "The Camera app included in GrapheneOS is very basic and can't take full advantage of the hardware."
20:16:26 <brenneke[m]> <brenneke[m] ""The Camera app included in Grap"> Any good alternative camera apps for Pixel 2 XL?
20:16:38 <yekip[m]> <bseeinu[m] "What's the best battery saving s"> how did you find Eddie on Graphene? does it have a kill switch?
20:17:30 <cx2[m]> <brenneke[m] ""The Camera app included in Grap"> Simple Camera does a good job just getting the photo snapped.... then Edit it in Snapseed.
20:18:01 <cx2[m]> brenneke: as well if you're wanting to manually mess with settings
20:18:26 <jcpicard32[m]> I've had pretty good luck with OpenCamera so far. Just make sure you go in settings and enable the Camera2 api
20:19:09 <brenneke[m]> OK, if Simple is on one end of spectrum, what would be on other?
20:19:19 <brenneke[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "I've had pretty good luck with O"> Thank you.
20:19:35 <cx2[m]> Open Camera would be on the other probably
20:20:02 <brenneke[m]> <cx2[m] "Open Camera would be on the othe"> Will give it a go.
20:20:54 <cx2[m]> changing to Camera2 api is importnt there
20:21:23 <cx2[m]> like jcpicard32 suggested
20:21:42 <brenneke[m]> Is there an Open Camera F-Droid repository?
20:22:08 <bseeinu[m]> <yekip[m] "how did you find Eddie on Graphe"> It does. Besides the clunkiness of the interface, it was okay and definitely more choice than mullvad in regard to servers
20:22:41 <bseeinu[m]> But I can't really judge their code in itself. Last update seems a few months ago
20:22:45 <cx2[m]> Both Open Camera, and Simple camera are in F-Droid
20:27:09 <brenneke[m]> <cx2[m] "Both Open Camera, and Simple cam"> Found it now thank you.
20:27:37 <cx2[m]> üëçÔ∏è
20:32:37 <yekip[m]> <bseeinu[m] "But I can't really judge their c"> thanks
20:32:45 <brenneke[m]> <cx2[m] "üëçÔ∏è"> Wow.....Open Camera is a nice upgrade!
20:33:17 <yekip[m]> i have PIA. might try eddie out.
20:33:22 <yekip[m]> Open Camera is superb, if you're into photography, depth of field, apertures etc. If you just want FAST snaps nicely in focus with almost no features except flash, Simple Camera is the way to go. Simple Gallery is a nice accompaniment too ;)
20:33:31 <yekip[m]> OC is awesome, truly awesome
20:34:42 <cx2[m]> I'd add snapseed to the mix as well.... it's pretty powerful.
20:34:42 <cx2[m]> Google DID buy them. I just don't give it access to anything.
20:34:58 <bseeinu[m]> Simple camera supports Pixel Visual Core?
20:35:16 <bseeinu[m]> I had PIA but didn't like the acquisition by the shady marketing scam company
20:35:37 <yekip[m]> not sure
20:35:45 <yekip[m]> but i know it works, and fast shutter release

20:39:22 <cx2[m]> yekip: I don't get it.... the bike is completely out of focus. SMH
20:39:24 <yekip[m]> does anyone have advice for which app to choose between Newpipe and Freetube?
20:39:55 <yekip[m]> Newpipe seemed great,but just noticed it uses Youtube for sharing links, so not sure it's private at all
20:40:08 <yekip[m]> <cx2[m] "yekip: I don't get it.... the bi"> :D :D
20:40:26 <yekip[m]> actually wasn't me. was my kids frigging around with settings and playing with camera! not an example of the best pic, but for a quick snap with depth of field played with, i think its cool :D
20:41:03 <yekip[m]> besides i wanted the marijuana in focus
20:41:06 <yekip[m]> tick tick tick
20:55:12 <yekip[m]> is there any advntage to using Signal as default SMS app on graphene?
20:55:16 <yekip[m]> over the default app?
20:57:33 <strcat[m]> yekip: no, other than the convenience of using one app, but the downside is less clear separation between safe and unsafe
20:57:48 <strcat[m]> I would recommend leaving it separate and doing as much as you can in Signal
20:57:54 <strcat[m]> and it being separate is a feature reminding you not to use it
20:58:11 <strcat[m]> since it's not private or authenticated
20:59:14 <yekip[m]> brilliant
20:59:19 <yekip[m]> that was precisely why I hesitated as I would prefer the physical separation, colour differences etc
20:59:28 <yekip[m]> thanks
20:59:42 <yekip[m]> and it reminds me to keep bugging people to get over to signal :)
21:31:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> Signal at least has a color and icon on the send button to tell you what's private and what's not.

21:55:48 <strcat[m]> just click select on the $5 tier and see if it says they'll match
21:56:10 <strcat[m]> they should still be matching since it's < 12 months since I started using it and so far only ~3k has been matched
21:56:19 <strcat[m]> and they're supposed to match til 5k or 12 months
