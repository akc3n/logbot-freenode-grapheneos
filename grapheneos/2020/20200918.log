00:47:14 <linuxcrypt> Does anyone know if Bitwarden was in Fdroid? I thought it was, but doesn't seem to be there
00:52:03 <entry1[m]> linuxcrypt Nope, you have to add the Bitwarden repository to the F-Droid client app.
00:54:33 <linuxcrypt> Ahh, thank you!
00:56:36 <entry1[m]> Can anyone recommend a VOIP service I can port a number into compatible with GrapheneOS? I currently use Google Voice, which I want to get rid of obviously. I don't mind if it is a paid service. I've heard of MySudo, but you cannot port in.
01:20:53 <snowkeld[m]> I'm having this issue as well. And you can't forward Google voice to VoIP
01:25:42 <adeus[m]> <entry1[m] "Can anyone recommend a VOIP serv"> It’s a good question.
01:27:45 <s538gdek[m]> My phone continues to not let me restart with the new update.  It fails a few time than rolls back to the old OS
01:27:50 <s538gdek[m]> Is there a way to fix this?
01:34:01 <LinusSexTips[m]> Pixel 3a/XL?
01:34:07 <LinusSexTips[m]> running beta release?
01:35:36 <s538gdek[m]> Pixel 3a.   Switched to stable release
01:35:42 <s538gdek[m]> To see if that would change it
01:36:03 <strcat[m]> s538gdek: read release notes, you were using beta
01:36:06 <strcat[m]> important to do that

01:38:32 <LinusSexTips[m]> s538gdek:
01:39:11 <s538gdek[m]> Thank you.  I guess my question was, just waiting will it mean everything will be wiped?
01:39:18 <s538gdek[m]> I'm sorry I'm an idiot
01:58:23 <strcat[m]> s538gdek: it gives you 2 choices
02:04:22 <s538gdek[m]> Factory reset now, or wait, and factory reset then, or will it update without issue.   That's what was confusing. Again, my apologies
02:04:35 <s538gdek[m]> I'm not trying to be a pain in the ass
02:05:54 <strcat[m]> that's not what it says
02:06:00 <strcat[m]> read what it says, don't add stuff it doesn't say
02:06:29 <strcat[m]> repeating it here won't help
02:34:26 <YouCanGhostMyKat> Is it even worth being in beta if you aren't doing CTS testing?
02:36:37 <qt_pie[m]> after reading the documentation, you'd probably be doing a lot less unless you sat there and tried to recreate and document bugs and regressions a few hours a day.
02:36:53 <cn3m[m]> <YouCanGhostMyKat "Is it even worth being in beta i"> yes
02:37:00 <cn3m[m]> please use Beta if you can
02:37:09 <qt_pie[m]> like its really dependant on what you do with it

02:44:22 <qt_pie[m]> when working in teams in classes I was getting lots of feed back from other student devs, and it was more information than any of those posts have

I have messed around with the developer options before but I know that is a big no no. Messes with the display.

02:45:18 <qt_pie[m]> YouCanGhostMyKat: Same but developer options is mostly for debugging applications

02:47:23 <YouCanGhostMyKat> <qt_pie[m] "the names of the apps where be m"> Any app on the home screen the names would disappear. The fix would be to move them and the name would reappear.
02:47:53 <qt_pie[m]> is that in a bug report, you should file it. takes a min to make a github account
02:49:20 <qt_pie[m]> you should also check if thats an issue in upstream with AOSP as well and include that information
02:49:22 <YouCanGhostMyKat> I already have a github. Pretty sure I lost my old bug report I did a while ago. You aren't suppose to mess with developer options so I didn't know if that was a valid bug?
02:50:04 <qt_pie[m]> I mean it lowers security, but it's still important for developers to be able to write applications that work with graphene
02:50:53 <qt_pie[m]> the webview has had work done on it, so if an app doesn't work on graphene the dev options are there so that the community could potentiall make secure applications

03:56:57 <vartaa[m]> <qt_pie[m] "have you tried using a virtual m"> No

03:58:50 <qt_pie[m]> the docs say it's officially supported
03:59:23 <qt_pie[m]> your other 2 choices are arch and debian but tbh dont install arch unless you are committed to maintaining it
04:00:44 <aeonsolution[m]> if you are just installing GrapheneOS and you have Windows 10, use Windows

04:02:13 <aeonsolution[m]> and run this command `cd ~/Downloads`
04:02:53 <aeonsolution[m]> if you follow the instructions on https://grapheneos.org/build and do not close the powershell window, you'll be good to go
04:03:25 <aeonsolution[m]> the issue most users have is opening and closing multiple powershell windows that dont have the path to fastboot
04:03:44 <qt_pie[m]> come to think of it i didnt have android studio might have been the problem
04:04:05 <aeonsolution[m]> whoops, wrong link
04:04:06 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install
04:04:43 <aeonsolution[m]> you dont need android studio to flash GrapheneOS

04:05:25 <aeonsolution[m]> thats the problem
04:05:30 <qt_pie[m]> installing android studio fixed that
04:05:31 <aeonsolution[m]> why are you using xda's fastboot

05:12:46 <aeonsolution[m]> and get the certdigest
05:12:48 <aeonsolution[m]> You need to set trichrome_certdigest to the correct value for your generated signing key. You can obtain this with the following command:
05:12:48 <aeonsolution[m]> keytool -export-cert -alias vanadium -keystore vanadium.keystore | sha256sum
05:14:16 <aeonsolution[m]> save the output somewhere or add it args.gn, its really up to you
05:14:36 <aeonsolution[m]> Then, configure the build in the src directory:
05:14:36 <aeonsolution[m]> gn args out/Default
05:15:46 <aeonsolution[m]> Lia: hopefully thats enough to get you going
05:15:58 <Lia[m]> What is the latest beta version in 86?
05:17:20 <aeonsolution[m]> its still on 85
05:18:14 <aeonsolution[m]> https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/releases?platform=Android
05:18:30 <qt_pie[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "ryzen 5 but thats not the point"> just wanted to know what compile times would be like ^_^
05:18:47 <aeonsolution[m]> painful
05:19:03 <aeonsolution[m]> but im a glutton for pain so here i am
05:19:45 <qt_pie[m]> aeonsolution: installing gentoo now seems tame compared to android rom dev tbh
05:20:04 <aeonsolution[m]> oh you meant beta, sorry its actually 86.0.4240.42 on the site i sent Lia
05:20:51 <aeonsolution[m]> <qt_pie[m] "aeonsolution: installing gentoo "> for personal use yeah, but try building android without the dependencies you need on gentoo
05:22:04 <aeonsolution[m]> Lia: there is no science to the release schedule. what you can do is compare whats on stable and see where the cut was for the beta release so you can guesstimate when beta gets pushed to stable
05:22:33 <aeonsolution[m]> it would be cool, if you joined us on that front and helped with development there
05:22:41 <aeonsolution[m]> we could always use more people!
05:23:02 <aeonsolution[m]>  * Lia: there is no science to the release schedule. what you can do is compare whats on stable and see where the cut was for the previous beta release so you can guesstimate when beta gets pushed to stable
05:24:05 <qt_pie[m]> I saw strcat  post about fdroid not being fit for graphene os and honestly wondering what the issues in it are from your perspective aeonsolution
05:24:23 <webzoneus[m]> Hello, I've been trying to install graphene for a while and I'm having some issues. anybody that could help?
05:24:52 <qt_pie[m]> what os and what device webzoneus
05:25:16 <webzoneus[m]> Pixel 3a XL, I'm currently trying with Windows
05:25:52 <qt_pie[m]> scroll up aeonsolution helped someone a bit ago
05:26:08 <qt_pie[m]> what issure are you having?
05:26:49 * webzoneus[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GWzKoVbfzCiucSQhZrcAbdQN/message.txt >
05:28:00 <qt_pie[m]> well did you download the platform tools?
05:28:47 <aeonsolution[m]> <qt_pie[m] "I saw strcat  post about fdroid "> tl;dr a lot of the apps in the store are outdated and that alone to me is a no go, strcat goes into more detail about the fdroids shortcomings on security. you can find it in the logs
05:29:18 <qt_pie[m]> aeonsolution: what logs?
05:29:21 <webzoneus[m]> I believe I followed the instructions to the letter
05:29:29 <cn3m[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
05:29:30 <aeonsolution[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
05:29:57 <qt_pie[m]> webzoneus: okay but having out of date fastboot and following instructions can still fail
05:30:11 <aeonsolution[m]> webzoneus: are you using a video to install GrapheneOS
05:31:49 <qt_pie[m]> aeonsolution: that just brings up this chat.
05:32:06 * webzoneus[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/oPURjydeykUadMuxdnIhbgJw/message.txt >
05:32:14 <aeonsolution[m]> search fdroid or f-droid or f droid
05:34:10 <aeonsolution[m]> webzoneus: open up your folder explorere
05:34:14 <aeonsolution[m]> go to downloads
05:34:20 <aeonsolution[m]> delete everything in there
05:34:34 <aeonsolution[m]> on the search bar above type `powershell`
05:34:49 <aeonsolution[m]> close whatever youtube video you are using to install GrapheneOS
05:35:02 <webzoneus[m]> I'm not using a video
05:35:16 <aeonsolution[m]> close any powershell windows you have open minus the one i told you
05:35:30 <aeonsolution[m]> and run the commands on this section: https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
05:35:36 <webzoneus[m]> I'm following the official install instructions
05:35:46 <aeonsolution[m]> ok cool
05:36:02 <aeonsolution[m]> this is the only powershell window you need to install GrapheneOS
05:36:10 <aeonsolution[m]> dont close it
05:37:08 <aeonsolution[m]> after you finish on this section, jump to: https://grapheneos.org/install#enabling-oem-unlocking
05:37:20 <aeonsolution[m]> and go down the page until you finishing installing GOS
05:37:27 <webzoneus[m]> ok
05:37:38 <aeonsolution[m]> please read the steps carefully
05:37:57 <aeonsolution[m]> if you have questions, put them on the chat
05:38:13 <webzoneus[m]> I'll try with these right now
05:38:34 <aeonsolution[m]> sounds good, gl
05:39:24 <aeonsolution[m]> im off for the night, take it easy everyone!
05:39:49 <webzoneus[m]> those are the same instructions I followed before you know
05:40:16 <qt_pie[m]> aeonsolution: gn!
05:40:43 <qt_pie[m]> webzoneus: yeah but sometimes we all miss details
05:40:50 <aeonsolution[m]> webzoneus: use an A to C cable and put it on the side that is connected to the motherboard
05:41:02 <qt_pie[m]> also they are trying to help
05:41:36 <qt_pie[m]> aeonsolution: Also ty for pointing me in the right directiom I see the error in fdroid's ways
05:41:52 <Lia[m]> Good night ^^
05:42:14 <aeonsolution[m]> everyone's mileage varies, we can just try to re-do it until we get it, debugging backwards doesn't work most of the time because the flashing step doesnt tell you whats missing. my recommendation is always to start over webzoneus
05:42:43 <webzoneus[m]> fastboot too old
05:43:09 <aeonsolution[m]> where are you getting the platform-tools
05:44:15 <qt_pie[m]> google provides the official tools on their website
05:44:44 <webzoneus[m]> I downloaded Google's tools and that's where I screwed up
05:44:47 <qt_pie[m]> https://developer.android.com/studio/ scroll down to sdk tools
05:44:53 <qt_pie[m]> not the whole sdk
05:45:08 <aeonsolution[m]> just run the command
05:45:11 <aeonsolution[m]> in powershell
05:45:11 <aeonsolution[m]> curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip
05:45:12 <aeonsolution[m]> (Get-FileHash platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip).hash -eq "413182fff6c5957911e231b9e97e6be4fc6a539035e3dfb580b5c54bd5950fee"
05:45:12 <aeonsolution[m]> tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip
05:45:13 <webzoneus[m]> the files are still missing, but I am getting a different result this time
05:45:43 <qt_pie[m]> I think you need to fetch the files again
05:47:09 <webzoneus[m]> it was the boot.img and other ones, but it did work. It was the platform tools that I didn't download
05:47:25 <webzoneus[m]> It did boot up. Sorry, thank you very much and good night
05:47:27 <aeonsolution[m]> -.-'
05:47:38 <qt_pie[m]> hahaha gn aeonsolution:
05:48:02 <webzoneus[m]> I was trying with the adb driver
05:48:25 <webzoneus[m]> then with the sdk, but not with this one
05:48:36 <aeonsolution[m]> -.-'
05:48:46 <aeonsolution[m]> just follow the instructions on the website and itll work
05:49:11 <aeonsolution[m]> i promise you
05:49:17 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, going to sleep now
05:49:20 <aeonsolution[m]> gl
05:49:26 <qt_pie[m]> i mean google tends to treat android like it's child
05:49:37 <webzoneus[m]> thank you guys. Sorry :(
05:49:54 <qt_pie[m]> webzoneus: so it worked?
05:50:12 <webzoneus[m]> it did work! yes
05:50:23 <qt_pie[m]> Lock the bootloader if you didn't
05:50:34 <qt_pie[m]> you can get it to work without that but its crucial for security
05:50:41 <webzoneus[m]> I did lock it yes
05:50:41 <qt_pie[m]> hope you didn't overlook that
05:50:46 <qt_pie[m]> good
05:50:50 <qt_pie[m]> enjoy!
05:51:02 <webzoneus[m]> will do, I've been looking forward to this for many months
05:51:15 <qt_pie[m]> are you a dev?
05:52:02 <webzoneus[m]> yeah, but more on security for financial institutions. I realized how bad it was, and changed to tails as my main OS and now graphene
05:53:25 <webzoneus[m]> basic stuff, c#
05:53:47 <qt_pie[m]> if you enjoy the rom, contribute what you can! 6 devices have been maintained by Micay since pixel 2
05:54:58 <webzoneus[m]> Actually I was going to do so. I'm ready to commit fully to this, we need a private os and there's nothing else out there
05:55:41 <qt_pie[m]> right now pixel 3, 3xl, 3a, 3axl and 4xl need amintainers
05:57:51 <qt_pie[m]> I hope to at least bug fix and send pull requests for pixel 3, hopefully become maintainer. I'm gonna try thats for sure, I'm setting up a build environment rn
05:58:45 <webzoneus[m]> nice. I'm ready, we all need this and can't let it fail
05:59:11 <webzoneus[m]> should I allow location services?
05:59:17 <qt_pie[m]> <webzoneus[m] "nice. I'm ready, we all need thi"> do you have a spare device?
05:59:37 <qt_pie[m]> <webzoneus[m] "should I allow location services"> wont report to google, if you need it and have no opsec concerns
05:59:46 <webzoneus[m]> ok
05:59:58 <qt_pie[m]> also try Cubes OS instead of tails
06:00:24 <webzoneus[m]> really? will try. Tails is a bit complicated to get things done.
06:01:07 <qt_pie[m]> you think tails is complicated? damn get ready for everything being a virtual machine
06:01:14 <qt_pie[m]> which btw is the goal of graphene
06:01:27 <qt_pie[m]> to put everything in a hypervisor
06:01:37 <qt_pie[m]> with a micro kernel
06:02:49 <webzoneus[m]> complicated because everything you try it blocks. It comes with remmina but it doesn't work because it resets the ssh connection automatically and so on.
06:03:09 <webzoneus[m]> that's amazing
06:03:37 <webzoneus[m]> everything's virtualized then?
06:04:16 <qt_pie[m]> no thats the goal
06:04:59 <webzoneus[m]> can't believe how cool and finished this is
06:06:22 <webzoneus[m]> looks great
06:06:53 <webzoneus[m]> g'night, I'm gonna go play with it :)
07:18:34 <deetot> Sounds awesome to me
07:21:04 <qt_pie[m]> A: what does
07:55:05 <deetot> Putting everything in hypervisor
08:13:48 <anon_reee> why is Vanadium/Chromium recommended? I thought even these were compromised by Google. I've heard despite being open-source, Google has still implanted some code in there that is closed. not sure if it's true, though. it's obviously more secure than Firefox, but if this is true shouldn't we not be using this?
08:15:23 <cn3m[m]> anon_reee: Google doesn't do anything weird to Chromium
08:15:43 <anon_reee> cn3m[m]: so I should be using this instead of Firefox?
08:15:52 <anon_reee> hmm, I've heard conflicting things so I don't know who to trust
08:16:28 <cn3m[m]> Firefox is not a reliable project for either privacy or security
08:16:32 <cn3m[m]> not very robustly designed
08:17:23 <citypw> https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/gl-redteam/red-team-tech-notes/-/tree/master/firefox-android-2020
08:17:41 <anon_reee> really? strange. I've seen a lot of people recommend it. guess I'll switch, then
08:18:01 <anon_reee> citypw: will take a look cheers
08:18:27 <cn3m[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/browser-tracking.html
08:18:27 <cn3m[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html
08:18:48 <cn3m[m]> anon_reee: madaidan from Whonix has done some excellent writeups
08:19:16 <cn3m[m]> and the questions are also covered in GrapheneOS FAQ https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
08:20:28 <anon_reee> wow. why does DuckDuckGo recommend their tracking blocking extension? and Firefox do the same sort of thing? surely these companies would know better?
08:23:00 <cn3m[m]> tracker blocking can make sense and generally you want to do it
08:23:10 <cn3m[m]> but it is not at all a robust mechanism
08:24:15 <anon_reee> what do you recommend for things such as development extensions (I'm a web dev and use dev tools for different stuff like React/Redux), or ad blocking?
08:24:26 <anon_reee> because extensions can be used to fingerprint you
08:24:42 <anon_reee> but I need some of these for work. plus ads are annoying and also a privacy threat
08:25:14 <cn3m[m]> Network blocking means you don't have to trust the extension
08:25:18 <cn3m[m]> read the FAQ on
08:25:25 <cn3m[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking
08:26:56 <anon_reee> ok thanks
08:28:03 <cn3m[m]> I personally use Vanadium with AdGuard with PrivateDNS on GrapheneOS. On macOS I use Chrome(jitless) and AdGuard extension
08:30:53 <Quan7um> Humm
08:32:37 <Quan7um> Do you use FDroid to download apps to GrapheneOS? Or would something like GitHub be a good source?
08:33:20 <jpds> Not many projects offer APKs on Github
08:33:44 <jpds> f-droid has the advantage of one not having to hunt around for updates
08:35:37 <Quan7um> True.
08:40:02 <anon_reee> F-Droid is good I use it
08:40:39 <anon_reee> cn3m[m]: what is the difference between Chrome (jitless) and Chromium?
08:41:03 <cn3m[m]> either chromium will work
08:41:33 <cn3m[m]> jit complies your js to machine code
08:41:48 <cn3m[m]> so it does work with a lot of mitigations chrom* uses
08:42:04 <anon_reee> and regarding those extensions for work. would it be a bad idea to install them on Chromium? I kinda need them for work. unless I just install them on another browser and only use that one for work, but since I'm a front-end dev I often have to test sites on different browsers, meaning I need these extensions on each of them. I could just disable them until I need them, but this is a bit of a pain
08:42:06 <cn3m[m]> cfi for one, jit spraying can be used to bypass aslr, etc
08:42:27 <cn3m[m]> you can install extensions per profile in chrom*
08:42:32 <cn3m[m]> it is easy enough to change profiles
08:42:39 <anon_reee> oh sweet
08:42:42 <anon_reee> I'll do that, then
08:42:49 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has a Vanadium issue for adding a toggle for jit
08:42:59 <anon_reee> is there a jitless version of Chromium?
08:43:25 <cn3m[m]> you need to start it with flags https://v8.dev/blog/jitless#faq
08:43:41 <cn3m[m]> iOS for instance doesn't really allow jit
08:43:49 <cn3m[m]> but you can run v8 on iOS with this
08:43:51 <cn3m[m]> so it does work
08:44:10 <cn3m[m]> Safari uses JIT, but the pages are execute only
08:44:23 <anon_reee> is this worth enabling? it says it makes it slower. speed is pretty important to me
08:44:30 <anon_reee> not sure if it's a worthy tradeoff
08:45:12 <cn3m[m]> it is not noticeable unless you do something really heavy for me anyway
08:45:20 <anon_reee> oh ok, then yeah I'll do it
08:45:28 <cn3m[m]> jslinux is very heavy and you will notice it is like 2x slower
08:45:48 <cn3m[m]> some cases like MotionMark can be 3x slower, but these aren't real world tests
08:45:49 <anon_reee> I'm on Ubuntu
08:45:59 <anon_reee> so maybe I won't then
08:46:24 <cn3m[m]> jslinux is a webpage that runs linux in js
08:46:39 <anon_reee> oh, I assumed it was the library for JIT on Linux or something
08:47:41 <louipc> lol
08:48:04 <cn3m[m]> follow this thread if you want to get a feel for how JIT interacts with security features in browsers
08:48:07 <cn3m[m]> https://nitter.net/halvarflake/status/1294178895231582209#m
08:48:40 <anon_reee> cheers
08:48:52 <cn3m[m]> 👍️
08:50:18 <anon_reee> out of curiosity, though, aren't you worried about Apple tracking you if you use Mac?
08:50:31 <anon_reee> it's closed-source. they say they don't track you, but how do you know that?
08:50:41 <cn3m[m]> no
08:51:00 <anon_reee> why not?
08:51:36 <cn3m[m]> open source is essentially a guarantee of nothing there are contests dedicated to slipping backdoors in open source code past auditors http://underhanded-c.org/
08:51:40 <cn3m[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underhanded_C_Contest
08:52:39 <cn3m[m]> closed source makes it harder for attackers and researchers. The only people it is easier for the internal security team
08:52:45 <citypw> anon_reee: yeah it's a neat bug
08:53:24 <anon_reee> right, but isn't open-source still better than Apple? IMO it's extremely likely they track people. for instance, they installed the COVID tracking app on everyone's phone without permission, which shows their integrity
08:54:00 <anon_reee> is it just me or did everyone else's chat just get spammed by people quitting?
08:54:48 <Beave29192> whats with the genocide?
08:54:55 <Beave29192> 600+ ppl just dc'ed
08:55:07 <anon_reee> happened to me, too. must be a bug or something /shrug
08:55:57 <Beave29192> matrix died apparently
08:56:13 <Beave29192> only ppl on irc are here, as it seems
08:58:40 <louipc> anon_reee: yea thats matrix junk
08:59:07 <anon_reee> I don't know what matrix is
08:59:11 <anon_reee> I barely use IRC
08:59:57 <Beave29192> just something else you need to register for :D
09:00:02 <louipc> just another horrible chat thing that likes to spam irc in particular
09:00:07 <Beave29192> thats why I never went for it.
09:00:55 <anon_reee> lol
09:01:02 <anon_reee> what happened to cn3...
09:01:09 <anon_reee> I guess he was in matrix too
09:01:12 <louipc> yea
09:01:21 <anon_reee> I was looking forward to his response, I really want to know his opinion on that
09:01:51 <anon_reee> IMO nothing closed-source should be used, even if the company has a paid security team + the code can't be viewed by hackers
09:02:13 <anon_reee> I don't think any big tech company can be trusted at this point
09:02:25 <anon_reee> they can very easily install backdoors and tracking, and you'd have no idea
09:02:37 <anon_reee> with open-source, you know exactly what you're running
09:02:59 <anon_reee> given the fact Apple installed the COVID tracing without anyone's permission, I think this alone should be enough evidence to show they're not to be trusted
09:03:13 <louipc> ouch
09:03:31 <anon_reee> lol I don't mean to offend, just sharing my opinion that's all
09:03:38 <jpds> anon_reee: Not really, you have no way of knowing for sure that the open-source code made the APK
09:03:50 <anon_reee> jpds: wdym?
09:03:55 <louipc> but you have the option of building yourself
09:04:10 <anon_reee> as in F-Droid could exploit the APK file?
09:04:11 <louipc> and auditing, or hiring someone to audit the code
09:04:17 <jpds> anon_reee: I could give you a 'app' APK right now
09:04:22 <Beave29192> with open source it may be the same, they at some point introduce something you dont like. so the predicament is the same.
09:04:34 <louipc> so source availability opens up some options that closed doesnt allow
09:04:38 <jpds> anon_reee: And you would have no way of knowing that it came from a source repo or now
09:05:01 <jpds> You can't claim that with open-source, you know exactly what you're running
09:05:15 <anon_reee> Beave29192: yeah, but do you see open-source devs installing anything like covid tracking? stuff like this is very unlikely. with a big tech company, it's super likely. that's the difference
09:05:40 <louipc> well like sourceforge used to inject adware into builds or something
09:05:44 <anon_reee> if I were to trust anyone, I'd trust open-source devs over big tech
09:05:51 <louipc> so you dont know either way unless you are building/auditing yourself
09:06:05 <louipc> but thats not possible with close source at all
09:06:08 <anon_reee> true. I should probably build my software from source from now on, then
09:06:27 <anon_reee> what about package managers?
09:06:41 <anon_reee> I assumed F-Droid or anything like apt would have vetted the repos
09:06:46 <Beave29192> pacmans build from source, dont they?
09:06:50 <louipc> same. but you gotta decide your own level of trust
09:07:00 <Beave29192> with verified hash or whatever thats called
09:07:14 <louipc> arch linux package maintainers build from source
09:07:38 <anon_reee> is there a way to configure apt to do that?
09:07:56 <louipc> some source code is verified by pgp, i think some still might use md5 hash tho...
09:08:16 <anon_reee> because I'd honestly consider switching to arch for that reason alone
09:08:21 <anon_reee> if it's not
09:08:32 <louipc> yea but i think debian maintainers do basically the same thing
09:08:47 <jpds> anon_reee: APT does GPG verification of all packages installed
09:09:06 <anon_reee> https://askubuntu.com/a/45257/395029
09:09:11 <louipc> probably better take this to -offtopic now
09:09:11 <anon_reee> looks like you can
09:09:48 <anon_reee> I'm an IRC newb how do I switch to that channel if this is all under #grapheneos?
09:10:09 <louipc> do /join #grapheneos-offtopic
09:10:14 <anon_reee> oh ok thanks
09:11:30 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Lol a friend just looked at my phone and was so confused when he saw only 8 apps in total installed 😂
09:11:30 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Trying to convert him away from evil googleeeee
09:11:30 <lickidyspl1t[m]> He has a pixel 4a. Has zero technical skills so he can't be a maintained unfortunately. But when it gets released for 4a I'll be flashing graphene to his dev for sure
09:11:31 <cn3m[m]> <lickidyspl1t[m] "He has a pixel 4a. Has zero tech"> just disable gapps for now if you can convince him
09:11:31 <cn3m[m]> <lickidyspl1t[m] "Lol a friend just looked at my p"> that's great
09:11:31 <dazinism> snowkeld adeus  entry1 I'd have a look at jmp.chat if I was in  the US or Canada. Can port number. SMS is relayed over XMPP. Calls can be via SIP or use the XMPP linked calls feature recently added to conversations.im
09:11:31 <dazinism> Quantum: check out https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
09:12:22 <lickidyspl1t[m]> I'm making him watch snowdens documentary. Lol
09:12:33 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Oh jeez spammers incoming?
09:12:59 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Mass migration in a few seconds 🤔
09:13:06 <louipc> lol incoming matrix spam
09:13:32 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Inb4 gore spam
09:14:02 <Beave29192> but its was fun to see mass exodus of 600 people before :D
09:14:40 <lickidyspl1t[m]> 🅱anhammer
09:15:06 <louipcm> check
09:15:40 <cn3m[m]> it is irc stuff
09:21:37 <dazinism> Yeah think its just the irc<>matrix bridge being a bit weird/slow
09:22:00 <lickidyspl1t[m]> https://appcloner.app/
09:22:00 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Anyone use this ? 🤔
09:22:16 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Identity & tracking options
09:22:16 <lickidyspl1t[m]> : • Change or hide Android ID, IMEI / IMSI, Wi-Fi & Bluetooth MAC • Change Google Advertising ID & Google Service Framework (GSF) ID • Change WebView User-Agent • Hide Wi-Fi info, hide SIM & operator info • Randomize build props to prevent device fingerprinting
09:22:50 <cn3m[m]> if you pay and trust their signing it should be fine
09:23:15 <cn3m[m]> better than XPrivacyLua xD
09:23:22 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Yeah they're a swiss company too.
09:23:35 <null[m]> Lol
09:25:22 <Beaver29192> USD 1.49 - USD 300.00 per item
09:25:27 <Beaver29192> eh wut?
09:25:51 <lickidyspl1t[m]> $300 is a "huge donation"
09:26:07 <lickidyspl1t[m]> You can unlock most features with just the premium add on.
09:26:35 <Beaver29192> is that "donation" for an IMEI number change? :D
09:26:39 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Which is 2 USD or something. I paid 4.50 aud
09:27:05 <lickidyspl1t[m]> No u don't need to donate. Just purchase the premium
09:27:17 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS already fixes a lot of stuff
09:27:18 <cn3m[m]> like the IMEI
09:27:29 <cn3m[m]> and some of these things they change are bypassable
09:27:42 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Donations are for extras, like sending changes to the cloned app without having to reclone it
09:28:50 <Beaver29192> does graphene somehow integrate fdroid privileged extension?
09:28:53 * lickidyspl1t[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200918-192834.png (164KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/mZJiWtVuNZjkqPfJvdziLJUe/Screenshot_20200918-192834.png >
09:28:53 <lickidyspl1t[m]> ^ eg.
09:29:18 <cn3m[m]> <Beaver29192 "does graphene somehow integrate "> no it is not up to the security standards of the project
09:30:29 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Footys on boys 👍👍👍👍 I'm off for the night
09:30:39 <Beaver291292> good night
09:30:58 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Catcha lads
09:31:43 <Beaver291292> did my last question come through before i got booted?
09:31:56 <dazinism> Yeah a lot of those tracking methods have been blocked in recent versions of android.
09:32:42 <hanetzer> Beaver291292: it did, and the answer was no due to security stuff :)
09:32:55 <dazinism> Some of them dont exist in grapheneos (ad ID & GSF ID
09:33:55 <Beaver291292> thank you, got to plan around updating apps then. like it being a social ever, invite a few friends over for a couple of hours to keep me company. :D
09:36:11 <Beaver291292> does anyone here use N26 bank app on graphene?
09:37:14 <null[m]> Also the privileged extension is buggy in my experience
09:38:18 <jpds> Beaver291292: https://github.com/techlore-official/plexus/blob/master/src/data/Plexus.csv has a note for it
09:39:30 <cn3m[m]> <Beaver291292 "did my last question come throug"> it doesn't meet the security standards of the project
09:43:16 <Beaver291292> thanks. I know about plexus, but my experience with one specific app differs from what is on that list so I kinda just mentally disregarded it.
09:43:27 <Beaver291292> with n26, I'm outta luck it seems.
09:45:25 <jpds> Beaver291292: So, put in a pull request with your experience
09:48:29 <Beaver291292> I went as far as looking for a I topic or something where I could discuss it because for the life of me, I cant figure out how git works.
09:53:28 <Lia[m]> Microsoft apps and most adobe apps need network permission...
09:55:22 <jpds> Beaver291292: https://github.com/techlore-official/plexus#contribute-method-2-non-github-method
09:58:59 <louipc> lol
10:00:33 <null[m]> You can learn to do that elsewhere
10:00:58 <null[m]> I recommend making a repo for a personal project - literally anything.
10:01:25 <null[m]> A python script, shell script, a text file
10:01:25 <null[m]> And just getting familiar with git that way.
10:03:25 <Quan7um> <dazinism "Quantum: check out https://hub.l"> Thanks, I'll have a look
10:56:34 <deetot> Hi hi
11:18:06 <anon_ree1> does anyone know how to install kill switches on a Pixel? I have no knowledge of electronics or how to do this. Snowden and another privacy guy I've seen advocate it as a precaution. they install backdoors into Intel/AMD CPUs so it's very likely they do the same with phones (IIRC I saw evidence of this a while ago too)
11:19:26 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1 there is no evidence of Intel or AMD chips having any backdoors or any legal precedent for that
11:19:33 <anon_ree1> watch this
11:20:14 <anon_ree1> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr-9aCMUXzI
11:20:15 <cn3m[m]> you could remove the microphone and camera, but kill switches have a fatal flaw. They assume the device is compromised. If a device is compromised you likely have greater issues than those switches
11:20:21 <anon_ree1> Intel Management Engine
11:20:27 <anon_ree1> AMD has their own version of it
11:20:57 <anon_ree1> cn3m[m]: well considering the hardware is built by Google, it probably is IMO :P
11:21:31 <cn3m[m]> that is not a backdoor
11:21:36 <anon_ree1> how not
11:21:39 <anon_ree1> they say it isn't
11:21:49 <anon_ree1> why would you trust what any these companies claim? they're all corrupt
11:21:51 <cn3m[m]> There is zero proof that there is any issue with these chips(ME and PSP). They offer some utility and security features.
11:21:51 <cn3m[m]> Apple who is famously anti-ME(they replaced some crypto functions and got custom firmware to disable as much as possible). They even admit it has uses here at a Black Hat conference. invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=3byNNUReyvE
11:21:51 <cn3m[m]> Attacks are extremely rare compared to essentially any other part of the CPU it is totally night and day. It is does DRM, crypto, and management tasks. I wouldn't worry about it. Probably one of the last hardware things to worry about. Qubes also requires Intel ME for Anti Evil Maid(which has some issues).
11:22:23 <anon_ree1> I mean maybe it's not
11:22:44 <anon_ree1> but given the fact how malicious big tech is, I'd say it shouldn't be trusted
11:22:45 <cn3m[m]> There is always evidence left behind
11:23:00 <cn3m[m]> even from disk and network activity
11:23:07 <anon_ree1> the NSA would know people are going to switch to alternative operating systems, and probably have another strategy for tracking like this
11:23:10 <cn3m[m]> you can decompile code and examine it
11:23:24 <cn3m[m]> hiding a backdoor is a monumentally bad idea
11:24:10 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: the NSA wouldn't want a backdoor built in. That would damage national security. They do store and use 0days to some degree, but they aren't the FBI or CIA(which are a lot toothless)
11:24:12 <anon_ree1> right, but NSA and the big tech companies are in bed with each other. I don't understand why you'd trust their claims. they can easily come up with some technical excuse like this to make it seem like it's fine. I don't buy it
11:24:38 <anon_ree1> well, Google and other big tech companies like Facebook are literally funded by the CIA
11:24:41 <cn3m[m]> it is good to question everything
11:24:47 <cn3m[m]> though the solutions are limited
11:25:01 <cn3m[m]> Google Pixels are definitely the best bet right now on user control
11:25:18 <anon_ree1> all the intelligence agencies are basically a single conglomerate
11:25:21 <cn3m[m]> they have insider attack resistance and even support for custom verified boot keys
11:25:41 <anon_ree1> yep I think Pixel is the way to go
11:25:59 <anon_ree1> the other thing I'd consider is the Librem 5 but the OS is shit and probably has more security flaws than Graphene
11:26:00 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "all the intelligence agencies ar"> no you obviously have never worked with government before
11:26:07 <cn3m[m]> respectfully
11:26:12 <cn3m[m]> they are anything but cohesive
11:26:17 <wrfhf[m]> is there anything as secure as a pixel with graphene?
11:26:19 <anon_ree1> well, this is where it gets into conspiracies lol
11:26:31 <wrfhf[m]> as secure and private*
11:26:41 <anon_ree1> yes, there is bureaucracy for sure
11:26:47 <cn3m[m]> <wrfhf[m] "is there anything as secure as a"> iPhones and iPads are the only thing the project considers equivalent in security and privacy
11:26:58 <cn3m[m]> that is more off topic though
11:27:05 <anon_ree1> but they're all being run by the same entity and in bed with each other. they just split it up into different sub-organisations
11:27:06 <cn3m[m]> I use a Google Pixel and iPad as my main devices for that reason
11:27:41 <wrfhf[m]> <cn3m[m] "I use a Google Pixel and iPad as"> which pc do you use? and OS?
11:27:52 <anon_ree1> I simply don't trust anything by default, I think that's a sensible stance
11:28:07 <wrfhf[m]> <anon_ree1 "I simply don't trust anything by"> +1
11:28:07 <cn3m[m]> if we could move this to the offtopic chat for discussing other OSes that would be ideal wrfhf:
11:28:17 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "I simply don't trust anything by"> no one disagrees with that
11:28:28 <cn3m[m]> that is why the project focuses on well audited devices
11:28:40 <wrfhf[m]> <cn3m[m] "if we could move this to the off"> There's graphene OT too?
11:28:50 <anon_ree1> cn3m[m]: right, then why would you trust Intel or whatever that IME isn't a backdoor?
11:29:00 <cn3m[m]> look at the shit GlassROM has to go through with OnePlus
11:29:28 <anon_ree1> they say it isn't, but AFAIK no one knows what's running. I watched a video where System 76 disabled it and they said there's still a moment where it executes on boot and they have no clue what it's doing
11:29:35 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "cn3m: right, then why would you "> there is no motive and that is the last place I would backdoor. And why would a company choose to do that?
11:29:38 <Beaver291292> #grapheneos-offtopic
11:29:53 <cn3m[m]> Snowden even noted how much better US privacy laws are and they weren't doing that stuff back then
11:30:23 <anon_ree1> cn3m[m]: because if big tech companies like Google and IBM are funded by the CIA, what makes you think Intel wouldn't be either? it's pretty likely. in which case they could easily have a contract with them to install it
11:30:31 <cn3m[m]> <wrfhf[m] "There's graphene OT too?"> yes
11:30:50 <wrfhf[m]> Thanks
11:31:04 <cn3m[m]> cheers I can explain my setup more in depth there wrfhf:
11:31:19 <anon_ree1> the NSA actually asked for IME to be disabled on their devices. so they're clearly concerned about it
11:31:25 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1 you take a PinePhone
11:31:29 <cn3m[m]> if the government wants to hack that
11:31:30 <cn3m[m]> they intercept the package and reflash the firmware
11:31:41 <cn3m[m]> you can install your own OS and still are backdoored
11:32:10 <anon_ree1> yeah of course
11:32:13 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "the NSA actually asked for IME t"> yeah and so does Apple, Purism, Dell, and a few others
11:32:35 <anon_ree1> you can always be attacked, I'm simply just saying that I would not be surprised at all if they have backdoors in CPUs
11:32:37 <cn3m[m]> it is a tiny amount of attack surface
11:32:38 <cn3m[m]> but it could still be a security concern
11:32:39 <cn3m[m]> there is just zero reason to be a backdoor
11:32:39 <cn3m[m]> which is a very different claim
11:33:27 <anon_ree1> I'm not convinced. while I'm not an expert in this area, I don't trust them at all. I've seen several security/privacy people raise concerns about this
11:33:50 <anon_ree1> I could be wrong but yeah
11:33:50 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: I would be. Why on earth would they be?
11:34:19 <anon_ree1> because their goal is mass surveillance. if someone installs Linux on their machine for instance, this would enable them to easily still track them
11:34:54 <cn3m[m]> Linux is even easier to track someone with(hacking or fingerprinting)
11:35:03 <bypassbobby[m]> https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/chinese-spy-chips-are-said-to-be-found-in-hardware-used-by-apple-amazon-apple-denies-the-bloomberg-businessweek-report.html
11:35:25 <anon_ree1> people who are smart enough to use Linux would also probably be a more significant target than the average person with potentiall more to hide, hence giving them more motive to do so
11:36:47 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone have any thoughts on EDS LITE for encryption strength
11:36:49 <anon_ree1> bypassbobby[m]: if it's true, they'd obviously deny it
11:36:50 <cn3m[m]> bypassbobby: supply chain issues aren't impossible, but firmware signing and hardware verification is growing and limiting these concerns
11:36:57 <cn3m[m]> however one thing that doesn't do that
11:37:06 <cn3m[m]> is Pine64 and Librem
11:37:23 <anon_ree1> they don't do verification? really
11:37:39 <cn3m[m]> <bypassbobby[m] "Anyone have any thoughts on EDS "> it uses XTS right which is for disk encryption. I don't think you should use it in the cloud
11:37:48 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "they don't do verification? real"> for firmware no
11:37:55 <cn3m[m]> you can backdoor the devices in transit
11:38:03 <cn3m[m]> then the user can flash a new OS
11:38:08 <anon_ree1> oh yeah. another I was going to ask. what do you guys recommend? Syncthing or Nextcloud?
11:38:10 <cn3m[m]> and it will still be backdoored
11:38:44 <cn3m[m]> Apple takes this the furtherest in protection with insider attack prevention and hardware verification(long term goal for GrapheneOS)
11:38:46 <cn3m[m]> PinePhone is the worst for this
11:38:57 <cn3m[m]> PinePhone is by far the most likely device to be backdoored
11:39:11 <anon_ree1> yeah I wouldn't get one anyway the specs are shit and the OS sucks
11:39:51 <cn3m[m]> specifically the iPhone 11 line is the only line offering robust protections for hardware verification(and it still likely isn't perfect).
11:41:25 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: madaidan a security researcher from whonix has an insightful writeup on linux phones https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html
11:41:45 <cn3m[m]> generally your best bet is an iPhone or Pixel(with GrapheneOS) if you have a high threat model
11:41:53 <anon_ree1> cheers, I'll give it a read
11:42:12 <cn3m[m]> they are commonly owned by security researchers and those devices are used for bug bounties primarily
11:42:30 <cn3m[m]> Google and Apple have far more reputation to lose as they are the stewards of their platform
11:42:32 <cn3m[m]> for example
11:42:45 <cn3m[m]> if your sketchy vendor of Android does something worng
11:42:59 <cn3m[m]> Google will get blamed
11:43:05 <cn3m[m]> Xiaomi isn't going to take the fall
11:43:14 <cn3m[m]> generally speaking
11:43:54 <cn3m[m]> iPhones and Pixels also while very advanced on security are also the only ones that get the basics right like day one updates(which customs can't fix magically)
11:45:11 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: that whole site is worth reading
11:45:57 <anon_ree1> yeah I'm taking a look now
11:46:24 <anon_ree1> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html if Linux is insecure then why would hackers, security researchers like Snowden, or anyone else use it? and why would it be used on servers
11:46:28 <cn3m[m]> he covers almost every misconception common out there
11:47:29 <anon_ree1> I assumed with such a large development community behind it, and so many companies depending on it, it would have a lot of backing behind it
11:47:30 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: That is a more complicated answer than it seems. Linux gets worse every year and the competition keeps getting better for one, but there are also other considerations beside security and privacy in choosing an OS
11:47:45 <cn3m[m]> it is also worth noting server and desktop security are vastly different
11:47:55 <anon_ree1> because of the GUI?
11:48:13 <anon_ree1> and lack of software installed
11:48:52 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "I assumed with such a large deve"> no it is much more fun to add code or fix an issue your company suffers from than fix an on slaught of memory bugs(in 6 weeks the number doubled on syzkaller)
11:49:12 <cn3m[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU
11:49:27 <anon_ree1> yep but I meant wouldn't some big tech companies hire security teams to work on it because it benefits them
11:49:28 <cn3m[m]> watch this great talk from Brad Spengler(10 year update from a few months ago)
11:49:37 <anon_ree1> sure
11:49:57 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: I mean Google does great work
11:50:07 <cn3m[m]> Kees Cook at least
11:50:13 <cn3m[m]> he is 15% of the mail traffic on KSPP alone
11:50:24 <cn3m[m]> which shows you how dismal Linux security is
11:50:37 <cn3m[m]> there are a handful of people patching most security issues
11:50:59 <anon_ree1> mhm, well even if this is the case I'd honestly still choose Linux over something like Apple personally
11:51:05 <cn3m[m]> the motivation is not there to just work through a list of 900 public bugs right now that are probably security issues https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream
11:51:09 <cn3m[m]> it is a culture issues
11:51:22 <cn3m[m]> companies still want more performance and compatibility out of Linux
11:51:46 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: yeah I am not telling you what to use
11:51:47 <jpds> You'll find that the vast majority of open-source projects are a handful of people
11:52:30 <cn3m[m]> yeah Linux security has a few passionate people
11:52:43 <cn3m[m]> though it is discouraging work
11:53:02 <cn3m[m]> Google has been trying so hard to get their ChromeOS changes moved over(vastly better kernel)
11:53:04 <anon_ree1> yeah, I just think security without privacy doesn't make much sense. both are obviously really important. but given the fact something like Apple is closed-source, and other big tech companies have been funded by the CIA (who knows if they are too), I just don't trust them
11:53:14 <cn3m[m]> but they won't even take CFI(which is pretty light for the massive security jump)
11:53:54 <cn3m[m]> Apple systems are almost entirely open source for any critical areas and like I covered already today(I will link this) open source guarantees nothing
11:54:04 <anon_ree1> cn3m[m]: out of curiosity what's your speciality? I'm guessing you work in cyber sec or something?
11:54:22 <cn3m[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200918#c5146722
11:55:05 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "cn3m: out of curiosity what's yo"> I worked in ad tech and have become involved with the project as a volunteer moderator. My goal is to move into infosec, but it is just a hobby right now. My focus is in assembly and RE currently
11:55:22 <cn3m[m]> breaking sandboxes is still my strong suit
11:56:59 <cn3m[m]> I am more of a privacy minded user than a security minded user
11:57:06 <anon_ree1> cool. in regards to open-source being infiltrated. yeah I'm not surprised. but what about the parts of Apple systems that are closed-source? what about the fact how they complied with installing COVID tracking without the permission of users, for instance? these things make me not trust them. I also haven't seen Snowden recommend them either
11:58:27 <anon_ree1> I will say though their OS is super good in many other ways. it's just these things that have prevented me from using it. I'd say it's superior to Linux in many ways
11:58:33 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: I'd recommend reading what Daniel(lead dev) has to say on contact tracing apps https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/fz3i77/covid19_contact_tracing_api/fn49s34/
11:58:42 <anon_ree1> sure
11:58:44 <cn3m[m]> In general I believe they are well designed and generally a double opt in design
11:59:16 <cn3m[m]> yeah personally I use macOS, but I put a lot of work and research into that decision
12:00:12 <anon_ree1> oh I wasn't talking about Graphene. I meant how it was enabled in Apple/Google devices with stock OS (I know it's not in Graphene OS)
12:01:12 <cn3m[m]> >  in regards to open-source being infiltrated.
12:01:12 <cn3m[m]> That isn't what I am saying. It is not a guarantee of anything. The proof is essentially the same regardless of closed or open source code. You can't hide something from someone if they are running MITMs, REing the binary, Checking storage, etc. In some ways the workload isn't that different
12:01:15 <cn3m[m]> take for example
12:01:16 <strcat> anon_ree1: you have to explicitly install an app to use the COVID tracking feature
12:01:22 <strcat> and explicitly grant it access to it
12:01:24 <strcat> please no FUD
12:01:35 <cn3m[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p512McKXukU
12:02:34 <anon_ree1> really? I heard it was installed without permission. I even saw someone recently where it was activated on their device without consent, in the device settings
12:02:47 <cn3m[m]> p0 was slow to release this zero day they mentioned that Apple fixed in iOS. So some researchers decided to find it by checking the decompiled source of iOS. They found it. The difficult part in building it was not at all the source code
12:03:06 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: the code for the double in is installed as an update
12:03:09 <cn3m[m]> to use it you need an app
12:03:18 <cn3m[m]> which is part of the double opt in
12:03:55 <cn3m[m]> Google and Apple designed a good system for what they believe is the common good. The issues with contact tracing typically come down to custom government apps
12:04:19 <cn3m[m]> though those are almost entirely failed at this point. The systems using Google/Apple APIs are far far better designed
12:04:31 <anon_ree1> I'm not sure honestly. I never noticed it was installed when I was using stock Android on my Pixel. I didn't check. maybe it was?
12:05:10 <cn3m[m]> It probably was by a play update
12:05:26 <anon_ree1> I just saw other people talking about this and also screenshots of it in their Android settings, claiming they never downloaded the app
12:05:26 <cn3m[m]> but regardless you need to go through several steps to enable it
12:05:29 <cn3m[m]> and it is private by design
12:06:06 <cn3m[m]> the FUD about it is purely misunderstanding or misleading intentionally
12:06:17 <anon_ree1> what does FUD mean?
12:06:23 <anon_ree1> I can't find the definition for some reason
12:06:29 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: the system in the OS is added, but it requires the user to double opt in and it is private by design
12:06:45 <cn3m[m]> if Google was going to spy on your location there are a lot better and less controversial ways to do it
12:06:52 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "what does FUD mean?"> Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt
12:07:09 <cn3m[m]> there is a lot of that in the privacy community
12:07:59 <anon_ree1> right. well, I mean if you've looked into what's going on I'd be seriously concerned about governments having access to that kind of data. who knows if they'll come and forcibly detain you because you walk past someone who was apparently, sick for instance. this kind of thing isn't really out of question at this point
12:08:18 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS one of the core goals of the project(check the website) is to offer robust meaningful solutions. Which requires examining situations critically. This means the project avoids any privacy and security theater
12:08:23 <anon_ree1> e.g look at what's happening in Australia
12:08:56 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: they are designed in a way they don't need information(though that can be lessened if you use the app to alert others you have covid)
12:09:51 <anon_ree1> yeah, I haven't investigated the details but I just don't trust it by default xd
12:10:19 <anon_ree1> anyway I gtg. nice chatting. thanks for the info
12:10:25 <cn3m[m]> the thing is to threat model appropriately
12:11:21 <cn3m[m]> if Google is going to spy on your location how would they go about it? A very simply designed highly examined health initiative designed with another company? Or by location services?
12:11:27 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "anyway I gtg. nice chatting. tha"> cheers take care
13:02:22 <bypassbobby[m]> What's your opinions on installing spotify on graphene
13:03:00 <cn3m[m]> bypassbobby: it's fine
13:05:06 <alzxjm[m]> bypassbobby: I requested my data from Spotify. I've been a premium member for like 6 years. I didn't find the data to be objectionable.
13:08:51 <bypassbobby[m]> Is there any advantage to getting the apk from sources other than aurora?
13:09:56 <bypassbobby[m]> Like apkpure
13:11:42 <alzxjm[m]> bypassbobby: Not really. The APK is the same everywhere, as long as it has Spotify's signature.
13:12:07 <bypassbobby[m]> OK thanks

13:57:20 <derpy> any idea how to get bluetooth so it auto connects? I have to go through the pairing process every time for some reason
14:06:02 <strcat[m]> going to be working on Beta releases for Android 10 GrapheneOS
14:06:11 <strcat[m]> possibly a fair bit broken still, we'll see
14:06:26 <strcat[m]> also seems possible that the camera stability issues are fixed and we might even be able to revert our workarounds
14:06:36 <strcat[m]> but in the initial release we won't be reverting that
14:07:25 <Lia[m]> 11?
14:07:43 <Lia[m]>  * 10?
14:08:18 <fll[m]> <derpy "any idea how to get bluetooth so"> Hmm...that's a weird one. I have 2 devices that reliably auto connect whenever I turn them on. Pixel 3
14:08:24 <strcat[m]>  * going to be working on Beta releases for Android 11 GrapheneOS
14:08:26 <strcat[m]> Lia: 11, sorry
14:08:40 <strcat[m]> been writing Android 10 and Android 11 so much in different contexts I write the wrong thing
14:10:41 <fll[m]> derpy: do your devices show up in the list of known devices but still don't connect?
14:10:54 <derpy> fll[m] yep that's what happens.
14:11:02 <derpy> going to try to forget and reset the device (bluetooth headphnoes)
14:11:05 <derpy> again
14:14:14 <alzxjm[m]> strcat: Stupid question but might be helpful for others considering testing beta: is it the expectation that users have a separate device for beta testing? I.e. it might cause problems on a daily driver device?
14:15:39 <fll[m]> derpy: do you have a 2nd device available to test with? To see if this happens to only those headphones or others too
14:17:49 <alzxjm[m]> Or at least be prepared for resets and/or thinks breaking?
14:19:29 <strcat> I mean it's beta testing
14:19:36 <strcat> so yeah by definition there might be problems
14:19:38 <strcat> that's the point
14:19:47 <strcat> catching problems so they don't get to stable
14:20:47 <renlord[m]> <anon_ree1 "e.g look at what's happening in "> What exactly is happening in australia?
14:20:52 <derpy> fll[m] well the same headphones work with other pixel phones... I'm noticing if I reset it, then it works - until I just turn off bluetooth, then when it autoreconnects it doesn't work. If I just click "disconnect" and "connect" without turning off bluetooth, then no problem
14:24:00 <derpy> gonna try "disable Bluetooth A2DP hardware offload" in dev options
14:24:11 <derpy> suggestion from GOS reddit thread
14:26:07 <derpy> Nope that didn't change the behavior(
14:26:37 <derpy> it autoconnects & then disappears immediately
14:30:46 <derpy> "pairing rejected" when clicking on it in available devices. Have to reset it and then repair
14:34:47 <derpy> OK I figured out where the bug is: if bluetooth is turned off on GOS, then that connected device can never connect again until it is reset. If I turn the bluetooth device on/off, then it reconnects fine... So somehow turning off bluetooth in GOS while it is in use borks it.
14:40:38 <fll[m]> I didn't try that since the last update, but earlier I didn't see that behaviour on my pixel 3
14:51:21 <propertype[m]> Can you create an issue on github?
14:53:49 <derpy> propertype[m] me? sure
14:57:22 <pixel24> Hi@all, I have two wishes for my new cell phone. It should be produced sustainably and fairly, easy to repair and have a secure operating system. As hardware I found the Fairphone and as operating system GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS apparently does not support the Fairphone. Does anyone know if this is planned in the future?
14:58:03 <Lia[m]> Nope, and never will
14:58:53 <pixel24> ok, thanks for the information
14:59:32 <Lia[m]> Locking the bootloader on Fairphone requires an EDL exploit
15:00:10 <Lia[m]> Or rather, making an alternative OS in that phone have verified boot
15:01:34 <Lia[m]> See: hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/verified-boot
15:01:49 <pixel24> a pity but apparently not to change. Thanks for the info
15:02:14 <alzxjm[m]> pixel24: I very much agree with you. I wish Fairphone were up to the security standards of GrapheneOS. Repairability is a priority for me.
15:04:07 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone have any methods for SMS verification codes like apps or sites? I don't even have a sim in my phone
15:04:08 <pixel24> yes, we cannot be so careless with the raw materials of this earth :-( ... Has anyone ever tried to avoid contact with the manufacturer?
15:23:48 <derpy> bypassbobby[m] its a huge pain because most SIP providers don't support shortcodes... And the ones who can say they don't guarantee it.
15:24:30 <derpy> the only way I know of are those devices... forgot what they're called (simbox?)
15:25:38 <derpy> people say voip.ms but there are several sources I couldn't receive SMS shortcodes from
15:26:48 <derpy> bypassbobby[m] 1) avoid all OTPs via SMS, too unreliable 2) switch to email shortcodes, if available 3) try to get a SIP provider who can receive the ones you have left
15:27:10 <derpy> not totally sure about #3 - maybe the simbox is better, but those might be detectable if international anyway - or not supported.
15:29:43 <renex> I'm wondering how updating works. I recently installed on my pixel3a GOS with build number that ends in 2020.08.07.01. There's now a newer version, right? When I go to System update settings and click on Check for updates, nothing happens.
15:32:59 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone know how to get Spotify playing on airpods I can't get the audio to go through them
15:33:13 <bypassbobby[m]> Just on the phones speaker
15:34:57 <Lia[m]> <renex "I'm wondering how updating works"> First, check if the update is configured over wifi only
15:35:40 <renex> It's permitted on any network
15:37:19 <Lia[m]> Try again?
15:38:19 <renex> It's been on any network since yesterday
15:38:26 <Lia[m]> If seamless update client has network permission enabled (it should by default)
15:38:38 <Lia[m]> More or less it should update
15:38:49 <Lia[m]> Unless some DoS is happening
15:40:05 <renex> how long has the latest version been GA?
15:46:52 <hi[m]1> It can take a while. Try rebooting. It doesn't download immediately
15:46:52 * bypassbobby[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200918-164550.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/xnuwIvOlYKEIsNxSQasVhbSj/Screenshot_20200918-164550.png >
15:47:24 <bypassbobby[m]> It won't play through the air pods has anyone has success?
15:49:05 <strcat> renex: sounds like you've done something that's blocker the Updater app like using a malfunctioning filtering system / VPN service
15:49:19 <strcat> s/blocker/blocking/
15:49:57 <renex> I do use VPN
15:50:05 <strcat> it's probably blocking the connection
15:50:21 <strcat> not much the Updater can do about a user using a VPN that's blocking a connection to releases.grapheneos.org
15:50:34 <strcat> some VPNs use misguided content blocking
15:50:50 <strcat> can you connect to releases.grapheneos.org in a browser?
15:50:59 <strcat> on the phone
15:52:01 <renex> Yes, I can reach releases.grapheneos.org in Vanadium
15:52:10 <renex> when vpn is active
15:56:54 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone manages to output Spotify to airpods?  There definetly connexted. The connection noise comes through when connected and disconnected
15:58:22 <Hugh[m]> Are they just connected as regular bluetooth headphones or using a particular app?
15:59:21 <Hugh[m]> If they are bluetooth headphones make sure you go to settings next to the device in bluetooth and enable 'Media audio' slider
16:15:29 <derpy> Hugh[m] regular headphones
16:15:49 <derpy> does anyone here use a translator app? or just translate.google.com or deepl.com in a browser?
16:16:52 <derpy> Hugh[m] ya media audio was always enabled
16:18:14 <Hugh[m]> hmm, can't help then. I dont actually have any but that sometimes happens with other headphones
16:19:52 <derpy> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.mitzuli/ -- looking for something like this that is updated within the last year
16:19:57 <derpy> Google Translate app replacement
16:21:46 <renex> I've also tested when vpn i deactivated, but nothing happens when I press Check for updates, except it gets a grey background for half a second
16:37:07 <strcat[m]> renex: what else have you configured from defaults that may be relevant?
16:37:08 <strcat[m]> renex: custom Private DNS server?
16:37:10 <strcat[m]> undo your changes
16:37:19 <strcat[m]> if you can't remember what you did to break it, I guess you can always factory reset
16:38:00 <strcat[m]> did you disable Network access for a bunch of apps?
16:38:10 <strcat[m]> there's a reason that you have a problem no one else has had
16:39:34 <renex> No private DNS server, haven't disabled network access for apps, haven't hardly fiddled with any settings
16:40:23 <cdesai> did you try to check logcat yet?
16:40:56 <renex> no, not yet
16:41:50 <cdesai> start logcat, grep for updater / releases.grapheneos.org / just tap 'check updates' and see if it says anything
16:42:03 <cdesai> maybe clear data of the Updater app and then try logcat and check for updates once again
17:15:22 <renex> how can I clear the data for the Updater app?
17:15:57 <strcat> in app info like other apps
17:16:00 <strcat> show system apps there
17:16:03 <strcat> find the app, clear data
17:16:21 <strcat> then perhaps reboot so it starts up again
17:18:27 <renex> hmm, I don't have a Updater app in app info (Settings -> Apps and notifications -> See all apps)
17:19:34 <Lia[m]> Show system apps
17:20:06 <Lia[m]> On the three dots
17:22:24 <renex> Is it the Dynamic System Updates?
17:26:25 <renex> Anyway logcat shows the following when I hit Check for updates
17:26:37 <renex> Service : fetching metadata for sargo-stable
17:26:45 <renex> Service : targetBuildDate: 1599834742 not higher than sourceBuildDate: 1599834742
17:26:54 <renex> Service : release wake locks
17:37:25 <strcat> renex: sounds like you're already on the latest release
17:37:32 <strcat> how are you checking the version?
17:38:09 <strcat> Look in Settings -> About phone -> Build number (at the bottom)
17:38:17 <strcat> seems you're already on the latest stable release
17:38:26 <strcat> and that there wasn't an Updater problem
17:38:33 <strcat> maybe you just hadn't noticed that you'd been upgraded
17:38:44 <strcat> and you rebooted into the new OS version without noticing
17:39:50 <renex> oh, now it is on 2020.09.11.14, earlier today it was definitively on something earlier
17:40:45 <renex> some feedback to the user would be nice, I haven't seen any notifications about this update
17:44:14 <strcat> it provides notifications
17:44:23 <strcat> I'm not sure how you missed it
17:44:49 <strcat> I assume you got the notification that asks you to reboot and rebooted?
17:44:54 <strcat> saying you got an update
17:45:06 <strcat> maybe you just didn't realize what was happening, don't know
17:45:24 <strcat> but you did get an update and then you presumably manually rebooted (unless you've enabled the off-by-default automatic reboot during idle feature in Updater)
17:45:27 <renex> No, no such notifications, I'm 100%
17:45:42 <strcat> maybe you accidentally turned off the notifications from it? don't know
17:46:22 <renex> I did reboot it just a while ago
17:47:22 <renex> Come to think of it, Fdroid doesn't provide any notifications either, like it does on an other android device I have
17:47:46 <strcat> sounds like you've disabled notifications from those then
17:47:54 <strcat> or set it to a do not disturb mode where you get them
17:47:57 <strcat> I don't know
17:48:02 <strcat> these aren't issues other users have
17:48:06 <strcat> it's something on your device
17:48:09 <strcat> that you've changed
17:48:22 <strcat> because I know you have an identical install of the OS
17:49:42 <renex> Well I have do not disturb set but I haven't made any apps specific adjustments
17:51:28 <strcat[m]> sounds like you have made changes to block notifications
17:52:04 <renex> I checked, both Fdroid and Seamless Update Client have Show notificatiosn turned on
17:52:26 <strcat[m]> you'll need to figure out what you've done
17:52:29 <strcat[m]> use an app like F-Droid to figure it out
17:52:34 <strcat[m]> or as I suggested earlier
17:52:48 <strcat[m]> do a factory reset if you don't want to investigate what you've changed that causes problems
17:53:12 <strcat[m]> you need to actively resolve the problem - start by turning off do not disturb
17:53:17 <strcat[m]> it has various settings

22:59:54 <adeus[m]> Does GrapheneOS support ARM “Memory Tagging” extension ? People who are leaders in field are discussing this as a game changer for security on mobile devices ... anyone have insight ?
23:06:13 <anon_reee> hey guys, I have some questions about setting up a Nextcloud in #nextcloud if anyone is available atm to help. cheers
23:07:32 <alzxjm[m]> anon_reee: not available right now but I could help tomorrowish
23:07:41 <anon_reee> much appreciated
23:08:23 <alzxjm[m]> Feel free to message me anytime. I'll get back you when I'm back around.
23:09:09 <cn3m[m]> adeus: It is supported in ARM v8.5-A
23:09:17 <cn3m[m]> which is only on the A14 chip at this point
23:09:28 <cn3m[m]> the latest Qualcomm is on is ARM v8.2-A
23:09:32 <cn3m[m]> (last I checked)
23:10:38 <cn3m[m]> general pace is new version per year so if we get 8.3 this release we should see 8.5 by the Pixel 7 era hopefully
23:10:58 <cn3m[m]> at that point it is very possible Android will have fully moved over to 64bit which would be ideal
23:12:27 <cn3m[m]> Kostya Serebryany from Google has suggested MTE should be a more powerful mitigation than everything previously combined
23:13:40 <cn3m[m]> Daniel has mentioned this once on reddit
23:13:51 <cn3m[m]> "Many OS security features need to be based on hardware security features. GrapheneOS is going to make extremely good usage of the ARMv8.5 memory tagging feature, more than than the stock OS. Other than that, the hardware-based security features are generally already well integrated into a standard production AOSP build, rather than the messy partial debug builds with various disabled / missing security features in a
23:13:51 <cn3m[m]> typical alternative OS."
23:13:54 <cn3m[m]> http://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/cnk7uf/security_on_pixel_devices_are_great_arguably_better_than_the_iphone._but_wh/ewbb3dy?context=3
23:14:53 <cn3m[m]> though he has mentioned it several times on twitter https://nitter.net/DanielMicay/search?f=tweets&q=memory+tagging&since=&until=&near=
23:14:57 <cn3m[m]> should be worth checking out
23:16:41 <cn3m[m]> The other scenario is we could see Google make their own chips, but I can't see that really coming out that on much of a different time frame
