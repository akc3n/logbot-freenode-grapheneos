00:56:17 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah it does
00:56:28 <aeonsolution[m]> its not stuck, the process is still running
00:56:49 <aeonsolution[m]> you have to turn the verbose option on to see whats happening
01:09:28 <aeonsolution[m]> cn3m: thanks to the video i understand the purpose of mainline and cuttlefish
01:17:05 <aeonsolution[m]> my takeaways is the kernel work on GrapheneOS isn't going to get easier lol
01:17:42 <cn3m[m]> Hi, I am glad you liked it. Yes, that seems to be the case for now :/
01:18:04 <aeonsolution[m]> i did!
01:18:14 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, but they are at least trying to make it less painful
01:18:21 <aeonsolution[m]> so thats nice
01:19:01 <cn3m[m]> Definitely, crazy how low the margin is for software support with some devices shipping with a 2 year old kernel and the XTLS only being supported for 6 years
01:19:11 <cn3m[m]> the 3 year support is cutting it close if I understand correctly
01:21:13 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, its just how its setup sadly
01:21:57 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, but its the hardware constraint that makes it that way
01:22:21 <aeonsolution[m]> still super interesting, i wonder what their next play is
01:23:49 <cn3m[m]> Yeah, I feel like they could never go mainline since every OEM would call it too much work and quit
01:24:20 <aeonsolution[m]> yup
01:25:15 <cn3m[m]> At least Google hardens the kernel and then GrapheneOS does on top. I am sure there are a lot of botched backports. Even in 4.14 on the Pixel 4
01:25:20 <cn3m[m]> but the mitigations are a lot better
01:28:27 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: btw if you are ever bored
01:28:34 <cn3m[m]> Daniel added a link to this writeup https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1

01:30:44 <aeonsolution[m]> putting it on the top ðŸ¤“
01:31:00 <cn3m[m]> great :) you did watch the Google talk on MTE right?
01:34:19 <aeonsolution[m]> which one was that about
01:35:22 <cn3m[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLEcbXidK2o
01:35:28 <cn3m[m]> memory coloring
01:35:38 <cn3m[m]> but in hardware efficiently
01:35:48 <aeonsolution[m]> i hadnt seen that one
01:35:53 <aeonsolution[m]> bookmarked
01:36:16 <cn3m[m]> it is the future for sure
01:36:27 <cn3m[m]> think ASAN, but almost no performance cost and robust
01:37:12 <cn3m[m]> it is in the ARM spec now when it will come to new phones not sure
01:37:24 <cn3m[m]> hopefully iPhone 12s or Pixel 6
01:38:10 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 has some tools to make it easier to prepare since it is going to be so effective
01:39:33 <aeonsolution[m]> cool, i need to check it out
01:41:40 <cn3m[m]> you are looking worst case 90% failure rate for use-after-free and buffer-overflow etc
01:44:21 <cn3m[m]> so if you have a 3 exploit chain you have best case a 0.1% chance at success
01:48:21 <cn3m[m]> from my understanding the weak point is JIT or wasm so you could get a foot hold in the browser
01:48:46 <aeonsolution[m]> right
01:49:02 <aeonsolution[m]> thats why we need to get the option to disable
01:49:08 <aeonsolution[m]> JIT
01:50:54 <cn3m[m]> I would use it
01:51:31 <cn3m[m]> I was talking to Daniel and he pointed out really heavy programs can be really slow though
01:51:50 <cn3m[m]> jslinux is twice as fast startup on Safari than my jitless chrome
01:51:58 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, you mentioned that to me. it can be for specific use cases
01:52:12 <aeonsolution[m]> and having the option, give you more flexibility
01:52:22 <aeonsolution[m]> gives*
02:09:17 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "yeah, you mentioned that to me. "> sorry my memory is bad lately
02:19:53 <owlthebird[m]> Finally got a pixel 3a and put on GrapheneOS. Yahoo. Question. When I now turn on the phone, there is always a bootup message something about no the original os on phone. Is there a way to not show that?
02:25:10 <cn3m[m]> owlthebird: it is the yellow green icon right?
02:27:30 <owlthebird[m]> <cn3m[m] "owlthebird: it is the yellow gre"> Yes
02:27:51 <cn3m[m]> and you locked the bootloader?
02:27:55 <cn3m[m]> then that is totally normal
02:29:11 <owlthebird[m]> fastboot flashing lock
02:29:11 <owlthebird[m]> Disabled OEM
02:29:11 <owlthebird[m]> And USB debugging
02:29:20 <owlthebird[m]> Okay cool thank you
02:29:28 <cn3m[m]> it shows the fingerprint too which you could check (I have mine memorized) it is helpful since you could see if someone physically swapped your phones and built a special version of a custom OS to capture and phone home your authentication to the real phone in their possession
02:29:53 <cn3m[m]> since Google obviously isn't going to allow that in the stock OS so there is no warning since the stock OS is inherently trusted
02:30:06 <owlthebird[m]> Ahhh gotcha okay that's good to know. Thanks for explaining
02:31:12 <cn3m[m]> of course that just raises the complexity. You probably could do the same with a screen replacement(iPhone 11 fixes this). Though at some point you keep moving the challenge. If someone tries hard enough they will find a way to make a phone swap attack work

17:37:33 <rojiro> what's the latest on graphene support for pinephone? this seems like a very holy alliance, happy to read an external release, saw some things online but i did want the latest information. i'd like to get involved here if there is already an ongoing effort.
17:39:13 <rojiro> *happy to read any update online (not sure what i meant by external release, lol)
17:42:30 * rojiro main thread must have been corrupted by a side thread :)
17:45:02 <rojiro> Also I am curious if there is an analysis that someone could recommend of the various flavors of mobile OSS software that breaks down pros and cons, re: native .apk support, secure boot, binary blobs, build re-producibility, etc.
17:45:37 <rojiro> postmarket vs graphene vs lineage, ...
17:46:32 <jneplokh> Please go read through the website and IRC logs
17:46:33 <jneplokh> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
17:50:02 <rojiro> jneplokh: thanks, i have read this, if it's truly the latest, that's a fine answer, i was just curious if anyone knew of any side efforst to support pinephone. The stance that current supported devices aren't even well enough supported is a fine answer. It's not uncommon for websites to not be completly current, re: ongoing or new efforts
18:14:09 <ride[m]> <jneplokh "https://grapheneos.org/faq#devic"> Is there a timeline for when Pixel 2 (xl) will stop being support? Support from Google ends is supposed to end in October.
18:16:07 <jneplokh> The PinePhone will probably never ever get support
18:16:19 <jneplokh> <ride[m] "Is there a timeline for when Pix"> Not sure
20:24:48 <rojiro> jneplokh: why do you say that?
20:25:30 <cn3m[m]> rojiro: PinePhone has virtually no security model
20:25:40 <cn3m[m]> and no official development team
20:25:43 <cn3m[m]> there is no reason to support it
20:26:24 <rojiro> cn3m[m]: so security model, what aspects of security? e.g. secure boot? or some missing hardware for keeping encryption keys? if you have a chance please elaborate.
20:26:50 <JTL> Both are issues for sure
20:27:20 <rojiro> cn3m[m]: when you say no development team, do you mean no dev team from the graphene side? because of course there is a dev team for the pinephone hardware...

20:30:12 <cn3m[m]> strcat and madaidan have written extensively on the subject
20:34:31 <rojiro> cn3m[m]: awesome. that was a good overview, thank you for taking the time to respond. I still don't understand your point about community maintained vs a 'development team' are you talking about the hardware of the pinephone? e.g. the community model of developement doesn't meet your definition here of a 'development team'? To better understand the counter point, who does have a 'development team'?
20:35:00 <rojiro> i loved that madaidan write up by the way.
20:36:39 <rojiro> i have been seeing a lot of hype on the pinephone and have been very confused about why they are going the route of linux phone vs an open android platform, so I am a bit relieved that I was not completely off base to be skeptical...
20:39:17 <rojiro> is there reason to be concerned in any way about the google phones having hardware backdoors or similar in the binary blobs of the firmware, is there an analysis of what the risks could be there, e.g. what an attacker would be able to pull off if in those instances? i think that seems to be the main counter argument from the pinephone folks in terms of the reasons to go the route they are going. Is
20:39:23 <rojiro> there non open source binary code in the graphene os itself (excluding the firmware)?
20:39:30 <cn3m[m]> Community Developed is not a reliable base to build off of. Though the real concern is the lack of any security model
20:39:58 <rojiro> cn3m[m]: what is the alternative to community developed, are you saying graphene is not community developed?
20:40:28 <cn3m[m]> <rojiro "there non open source binary cod"> one sec I have a big writeup on backdoors and blobs and why you shouldn't worry about it on GrapheneOS one sec
20:41:09 <cn3m[m]> <rojiro "cn3m: what is the alternative to"> Qualcomm makes and audits all the vendor images etc. Google makes and maintains AOSP. GrapheneOS is great, but it is built on a solid foundation
20:41:50 <cn3m[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/htwm9t/why_is_grapheneos_supported_only_on_pixels/g19f0fa/
20:43:39 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS + Pixels are by far the best at curbing risks that would make coercion unlikely
20:44:19 <cn3m[m]> I mean iPhone too, but there are pros and cons there
20:45:07 <cn3m[m]> It also helps we haven't actually seen a real confirmed backdoor anywhere
20:50:18 <rojiro> it sounds like graphene is not taking community contributions? Is it build-verifiable on github? e.g fully open source and buildable by the public?
20:53:17 <cn3m[m]> <rojiro "it sounds like graphene is not t"> GrapheneOS is taking contributions, it is buildable(dngray builds everything himself even his own attestation server), everything is open
20:53:32 <cn3m[m]> Though GrapheneOS builds on a foundation of an already secure ecosystem
20:53:48 <cn3m[m]> Pixels are the only devices really pushing hardware privacy and security forward
20:55:06 <rojiro> cn3m[m]: awesome. thank you so much for your time. i am trying to find mobile project to help out on. So I really appreciate your time to answer my questions.
20:56:00 <rojiro> when people release to f-droid do they need to re-work thier app to remove google specific api calls to be free of the play store? and to run well on graphene?
20:56:58 <cn3m[m]> rojiro: F-Droid really isn't actively recommended here due to many security shortcomings. Though yeah there is an approval process where that stuff has to go
20:57:05 <cn3m[m]> anything on F-Droid that works without root is fine here
20:57:27 <rojiro> what is the recommended signes distribution model then?
20:57:30 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS first and foremost is an Android hardening project for meaningful privacy and security improvements
20:57:41 <cn3m[m]> partial solutions are not actively encouraged
20:57:52 <cn3m[m]> <rojiro "what is the recommended signes d"> sorry repeat that?
20:58:14 <rojiro> how do you get signed packages to run on graphene? the play store?
20:59:18 <rojiro> or just from each prospective apps site online? and then check a sha256 with a gpg signature?
20:59:43 <strcat[m]> apks aren't signed with GPG
20:59:58 <strcat[m]> the OS is not capable of installing an apk that isn't signed
21:00:36 <rojiro> strcat[m]: they aren't but you could distribute a signature file if you wanted to, just trying to determine what the software aquisition flow is like on graphene, does it include the play store?
21:00:46 <strcat[m]> rojiro: also developers do not release their apps to F-Droid, F-Droid packages their apps
21:00:50 <strcat[m]> please read the site and the FAQ
21:00:59 <strcat[m]> rojiro: apks are signed
21:01:05 <strcat[m]> there is not use in distributing a separate signature file
21:01:17 <strcat[m]>  * there is no use in distributing a separate signature file
21:01:47 <strcat[m]> the signature of an apk can already be verified and the OS does that for each update - it is not possible to install an apk that is not correctly signed, and it is not possible to install an update that's not correctly signed with the same signature
21:01:54 <strcat[m]> the package manager doesn't support doing that
21:02:31 <rojiro> thanks. you have a package manager, i'll go read more, then ask questions.
21:02:38 <strcat[m]> frontends like F-Droid sit on top of that, they provide their own signing/verification for repository metadata but the baseline apk signing is not something they choose, that's just how the package manager works
21:03:07 <strcat[m]> rojiro: there is an apk package manager as part of AOSP and every apk is signed with the signature verified, there is no such thing as an unsigned apk that could be installed
21:03:21 <strcat[m]> having a valid signature is part of it being correctly formed
21:03:43 <rojiro> aww okay, i think the thing i was missing was AOSP, I'll go dive into that. very cool
21:03:45 <strcat[m]>  * the signature of an apk can already be verified and the OS does that for each update - it is not possible to install an apk that is not correctly signed, and it is not possible to install an update that's not correctly signed with the same key
21:03:47 <strcat[m]> and it is not possible to install an update using a different key
21:03:55 <strcat[m]> as the baseline
21:04:11 <strcat[m]> so a frontend like F-Droid is only responsible for verifying the initial update
21:04:23 <strcat[m]> the OS package manager underneath it performs apk signature verification and downgrade protection already
21:04:33 <strcat[m]>  * so a frontend like F-Droid is only responsible for verifying the initial install

21:43:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> For apps that implement some other way to get notifications usually whitelisting them within battery optimization is enough
21:43:51 <Autopsy[m]> Get a work phone.
21:44:15 <Autopsy[m]> The amount of times I see this is beyond me. If work require you to use certain apps, demand a phone or don't use the service.
21:44:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> rojiro: the android package manager is called pm. All apps must go through pm
21:45:35 <rojiro> who is bringing the apps into pm? is the catalog pretty robust?
21:45:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well there's also a permissioncontroller app that acts as the frontend to call pm, some call it the package installer
21:45:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> rojiro: well no
21:47:02 <rojiro> anupritaisno1[m]: e.g. what is the mechanism or process for an app to get into pm?
21:47:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageInstaller
21:47:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is no catalog
21:47:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> See the link above
21:48:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> You also never directly call pm
21:48:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> That will always fail unless you are root
21:49:27 <rojiro> anupritaisno1[m]: how does a user of the phone get apps onto the phone? what store is used?
21:51:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> rojiro: by using the package installer?
21:51:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just pass the application into the package installer
21:52:13 <rojiro> to be more clear let's say i want users to be able to use my new app 'awesome app' that i just devleoped, how do i get it available to users of graphene os?
21:52:14 <M56439978381[m]> What version of Android is the latest version of GrapheneOS based on?
21:52:24 <jpds> M56439978381[m]: 10
21:52:32 <M56439978381[m]> thx
21:53:06 <jpds> rojiro: You could host your own f-droid repo
21:53:43 <M56439978381[m]> Also around how soon are new Android releases adopted into Graphene?
21:53:52 <M56439978381[m]> in general
22:02:57 <jpds> I think there's only been the 9->10 bump, but as soon as someone's done the work to update all the repos and testing to make sure it works
22:24:35 <strcat[m]> jpds: the project existed before that
22:24:52 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/#history
22:31:31 <strcat[m]> it has gone through 4.4.4 -> 5.x -> 6.x -> 7.x -> 8.x -> 9.x -> 10.x
22:32:12 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has gone strong for 6 years
23:01:31 <aeonsolution[m]> <rojiro "to be more clear let's say i wan"> If you build an app that works on Android without Google Play Services it will work on GrapheneOS. Ideally, if you have questions, you check the logs to see if its been asked before. Once you exhaust that, then please reach out to the community. You'd be surprised how many times the same questions get asked everyday.
23:02:28 <aeonsolution[m]> here's the log link thats found on the description/banner of the channel https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
23:03:29 <aeonsolution[m]> here's another link to help us help you when you do have a question that isn't clear in the logs or hasn't been asked before https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask
23:04:07 <aeonsolution[m]> if you want to contribute to the project with code start here https://grapheneos.org/build
23:04:20 <atasuke> hey I have a problem  generating  a signed factory images after building  grapheneos
23:07:11 <atasuke> when I do `script/release.sh target` I get an error

23:07:31 <atasuke> OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
23:23:19 <h3rb_> Eyy hoW to iNstall gcam?
23:25:28 <dazinism> jpds: Have a look here https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
23:26:32 <dazinism> Sorry I meant rojiro
23:34:22 <rojiro> dazinism: this was exactly what i was looking for and not finding. Thank you. Would be good to include some of this info on the graphene website FAQ. e.g. there is no app store. One thing this didn't address is whether it's possible to contribute an app into the AOSP package manager, which I assume is possible, i'll go look in the AOSP docs for more info there.
23:37:39 <aeonsolution[m]> atasuke: are you using a pixel 3 family device?
23:37:58 <dazinism> rojiro: no AOSP pm is used, largely out of site of the user, for installing, updating and uninstalling apps on the device.
23:38:30 <atasuke> aeonsolution[m]: yes pixel 3a
23:38:53 <rojiro> dazinism: got it, the AOSP is used only for the OS then.
23:39:27 <rojiro> sounds like secure distribution of the actual apk's is an unsolved problem in this space
23:39:29 <aeonsolution[m]> did you make the directory keys/sargo
23:39:52 <aeonsolution[m]> ive never done a signed release but i imagine its that or maybe you are missing python2
23:39:59 <aeonsolution[m]> the error isn't really helpful
23:40:28 <dazinism> rojiro: Theres plans for a GrapheneOS app 'store' which initially would have the bundled apps
23:40:50 <atasuke> I have the keys/sargo with all my keys and I have python 2.7
23:41:08 <dazinism> So they could be updated without needing a full OS update
23:41:20 <aeonsolution[m]> is that the only error you got?
23:41:38 <atasuke> the traceback is longer  but not more helpful
23:42:16 <rojiro> yes, that would be great. an apk manager like snap or something would be nice. something lineage might be able to use too..
23:42:41 <dazinism> Folks tend to use FDroid and/or Aurora store. Some just download apks from the github or site of the developer

23:44:52 <dazinism> Generally Play Store apps are signed with the same cert as the developers use with their own app builds  elsewhere (fdroid tends to build and sign most apps themselves)
23:45:13 <aeonsolution[m]> it has to exist, the traceback gives you a line
23:46:04 <dazinism> rojiro: the wiki shows where you can find signatures of apps in the playstore
23:46:06 <atasuke> cat: prebuilts/build-tools/linux-x86/bin/py2-cmd/internal/stdlib/subprocess.py: Not a directory
23:46:20 <aeonsolution[m]> add ./
23:46:26 <atasuke> py2-cmd is a binary not a directory
23:47:20 <aeonsolution[m]> when you built GOS
23:47:27 <aeonsolution[m]> was it a clean build
23:47:32 <atasuke> yes
23:47:38 <aeonsolution[m]> or did it have an out/
23:47:40 <dazinism> rojiro: the idea for the GrapheneOS app store is to use the code from the GrapheneOS updater as the base. Apparently wouldnt be too much work to get the basics up and running.
23:47:41 <aeonsolution[m]> hmm
23:48:08 <atasuke> I did m target-files-package
23:48:29 <aeonsolution[m]> after rm -r out
23:48:39 <atasuke> yes
23:49:15 <atasuke> I can retry the build but it took me almost 2 hour
23:49:47 <aeonsolution[m]> i cant relate, my dev builds take 3+ hours lol
23:50:08 <atasuke> what hardware ?
23:50:12 <aeonsolution[m]> its worth a redo
23:50:42 <aeonsolution[m]> i build on a vm that is provision 3 cores and 8 threads
23:50:58 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] i build on a vm that is provisioned with 3 cores and 8 threads
23:51:26 <aeonsolution[m]> ~16 gigs of ram
23:51:59 <atasuke> I build directly on archlinux with  6 cores 12 threads  32gib ram
23:52:10 <aeonsolution[m]> nice
23:52:17 <aeonsolution[m]> that'll do it
23:52:26 <aeonsolution[m]> i would just try it again
23:53:01 <atasuke> ok thanks you i'll try tomorow tho cause it's 2 am here
23:54:21 <aeonsolution[m]> @d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix.org: did you make any progress on building Vanadium?
23:54:52 <aeonsolution[m]> atasuke: ask the question tomorrow again, maybe some else can help with it
23:55:22 <aeonsolution[m]> ill be here, but it might be better to get help from someone that has done a signed build before and has experience with that error
23:55:23 <atasuke> ok I hope a second try do it
23:55:32 <atasuke> thanks you
23:56:30 <aeonsolution[m]> thank you too, take care!
23:56:38 <atasuke> you too
