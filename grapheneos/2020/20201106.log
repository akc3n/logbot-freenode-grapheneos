00:06:20 <strcat[m]> it will take a while before this is available via Beta
00:06:26 <strcat[m]> we won't keep it in Beta for long though
00:25:48 <leadfoilcat> It is very sad there seem to be quite a few people who are convinced that high-quality and secure products must be paid (w/o donation) and closed source only. I think Copperhead parasitizes on this human flaw.
00:30:03 <strcat[m]> and yet they are putting themselves at risk using it
01:19:16 <ludicrous_speed[> Most people, phone users, are never going to be able to have time or the knowledge to audit code for themselves, thus there is a trust cascade, that cascades all the way down to closed source projects. Maybe that is how some devs justify closed source security projects.
01:24:27 <timeistruevalue[> Another factor is it's just basic human ignorance; People think if its low cost or free, then it is cheap. Majority of paying customers have NO idea about cryptography. I sell encrypted phones and my market has no any idea wtf is going on. And majority of them are there for the network, they just don't know it
01:25:51 <louipc> those users seem to think that hackers/crackers read code to find vulns. as far as i know thats not how they find vulns generally

04:02:37 <renlord> strcat[m]: probably a stretch, but imo google does make it challenging, if not difficult for android users to use aosp w/o play services
04:02:56 <renlord> even generic android dev guides routinely recommend devs to just use play services
04:03:02 <renlord> asif it is a core component of android
04:03:17 <JTL> renlord: Sad but true
04:04:09 <renlord> the guide for implementing location service is an example, the android dev guide routinely just recommend using fused api provided via play services.
04:04:59 <renlord> and make little to no effort providing alternate guides to implementing location if fused api was not available.
04:05:16 <renlord> one has to go back to kitkat documentation to find these guides
04:25:14 <Remu[m]> <renlord "one has to go back to kitkat doc"> Yeah, those are some of Google's unlikable practice
04:25:56 <Remu[m]> Not going out of the way to show guides in implemetation of gms-free apis, because it would be convenient to use theirs
04:26:14 <Remu[m]> Still better than masquerading as secure and private os company there tho
04:26:54 <renlord> problem is that gms is supposedly optional on android, but the guide is written for android
04:27:38 <renlord> its like publishing a guide that teaches you how to shop and then they say it requires installing the Amazon shopping app to do that on android.
04:27:46 <renlord> how ridiculous would that be?
04:29:22 <renlord> btw, not trying to compare between copperhead and google here. One is a completely fraudulent company and the other engages in more subtle tactics to consolidate their market dominance
04:31:00 <Remu[m]> Yeah, the latter was still not likable due to their subtle tactics
04:32:30 <Remu[m]> <renlord "how ridiculous would that be?"> Sounds ridiculous, but it's how they push users/devs to use gms
04:43:15 <louipc> renlord: could just be because thats what they're used to
04:43:51 <renlord> not sure how is a developer meant to be used to an optional dependency
04:44:05 <louipc> i wouldnt be surprised if many learn javascript programming courses start with "install node.js"
04:44:39 <renlord> it'd be like an AL guide on wireless connections and they just recommend `iwctl` full stop
04:44:46 <renlord> and pretended nothing else existed.
04:44:57 <louipc> couldbe
04:45:22 <louipc> just make a new/better guide i guess :p
04:48:44 <Remu[m]> <renlord "not sure how is a developer mean"> Agreed. It seemed like it was on them partly why the Android app ecosystem is horrible, besides on making them encouraged to use the optional dependency, they also make the devs comfortable to what is convenient to use, which is not exactly bad unless closed source apps start to implement broken codes here and there, or deciding to stick on convenience by not moving to new API
04:48:44 <Remu[m]> level until the mandatory push which they get scrambled on how to rewrite parts of codes
04:49:01 <Remu[m]> Does not apply to all Android devs
05:38:37 <dar_gomml[m]> is copperhead now a rebranded GrapheneOS with some small chnages or are they doing their own thing?
05:40:46 <strcat[m]> dar_gomml: it's primarily a ripoff of our legacy code with some newer stuff taken too
05:40:49 <strcat[m]> it's far behind GrapheneOS
05:40:54 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have much actual hardening
05:41:07 <strcat[m]> they missed the September and October security updates until just recently, etc
05:41:25 <strcat[m]> they add tracking to the Updater app as part of enforcing their expensive licensing scheme
05:41:51 <strcat[m]> it's a closed source OS now, and while they claim it's somehow source available, they have rejected letting researchers see the code
05:42:11 <strcat[m]> they don't comply with the licenses for the code
05:42:19 <strcat[m]> and fraudulently claim ownership and credit for our work
05:42:35 <strcat[m]> including stuff done after they split from the open source project

08:29:43 <renlord[m]> Ddg is so useless as a search engine. Worse than bing or searx
08:30:39 <renlord[m]> I can't even stand using it for more than a day
08:30:51 <dan-v[m]> <renlord[m] "Ddg is so useless as a search en"> Yeah gave up on that long ago
08:31:04 <renlord[m]> Always have to end up putting the !g into the query
08:31:10 <renlord[m]> It is a hopelessly bad search engine.
08:31:11 <dan-v[m]> I was !g all day
08:31:15 <dan-v[m]> Lol yes
08:31:32 <r0tt0r[m]> well ddg is no multimillion $ company
08:31:58 <r0tt0r[m]> what alternatives are there that respect privacy
08:32:05 <renlord[m]> If they can't pivot on selling on their key feature which is search, they might as well just throw in the towel and give up
08:32:22 <renlord[m]> And stop calling themselves a search engine company.
08:33:09 <renlord[m]> Anyways switched back to Google as default search engine.
08:33:30 <renlord[m]> Even without personalization google performs way better than ddg.
08:33:56 <r0tt0r[m]> <renlord[m] "Even without personalization goo"> hmm thats possible?
08:34:06 <renlord[m]> Especially on search queries on technical topics.
08:34:24 <dan-v[m]> the thing I don't understand is how their results are so bad. are bing results that bad?
08:34:50 <r0tt0r[m]> i miss altervista from ancient times
08:34:55 <renlord[m]> Google probably has built a shadow profile on the technical stereotype so they know what sort of results to dish out more accurately.
08:35:05 <projectmoon> i usually have to use google for software, and ddg for everything else. i should keep track of the % i use for each one
08:35:22 <renlord[m]> Bing is definitely better than ddg
08:35:48 <renlord[m]> I can't even find a reasonable cooking recipe on ddg.
08:37:33 <renlord[m]> Fucking hell

12:34:37 <thytoast[m]> Hi all I'm not able to add an exception for Clock with update. On a pixel 3a
12:34:43 <thytoast[m]> Any idea why
12:35:25 <dazinism> cenapatop689 The work continues in another (I imagine very expensive) proprietary android fork.
12:40:00 <dazinism> cenapatop689: Think that the issue is, with changes like they make, it becomes harder to port the work onto new Android versions. They target Pixels, so to get all security updates they needed to move quickly to Android 11 I imagine they have fun trying to keep everything up to date.
12:44:08 <cenapatop689[m]> Yes
12:45:46 <dazinism> cenapatop689: lol... took them a year to move from Android 9 to Android 10

12:47:15 <dazinism> At a quick scan I can't see any mention of Pixels, but I'm pretty sure thats the devices they target
12:48:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> dazinism OT
12:48:54 <dazinism> Soz, mi bad
12:53:26 <dazinism> Bringing it back on topic. Improving the usability and functionality of user profiles is a good Ting.
12:53:34 <dazinism> Thing
12:54:16 <dazinism> The trick is doing it in ways that are easy to port forward to new versions
12:54:58 <cenapatop689[m]> Yes.. it would be nice to have the contacts isolated and the network settings seperat
12:54:58 <dazinism> The feature, that was added recently to GrapheneOS,  to log out of secondary user profiles is a very nice thing to have
12:56:27 <dazinism> It is something that is already part of AOSP, just part of the managed devices functionality, thats not normally exposed to users
12:57:27 <dazinism> Google will keep that working in future versions of AOSP, so its easy for GrapheneOS to keep
12:57:56 <cenapatop689[m]> <dazinism "Google will keep that working in"> maybe
12:59:01 <dazinism> cenapatop689: contacts and VPN settings are already a feature of user profiles
13:00:10 <dazinism> Another good way to add functionality to user profiles is by writing stand alone apps to implement them
13:00:58 <dazinism> Eg. Someone could write an app that used the VPN functionality to block all network connections from the user profile where it is active
13:01:51 <dazinism> Or write an app that uses on device local networking to securely transfer files between user profiles
13:02:28 <dazinism> The bonus of using apps is that they would also work on other android OSs

15:20:46 <inpharmaticist[m> Okay that worked for a 1min alarm hopefully it works overnight. Thanks.
15:25:33 <louipc> there was a bug with alarm, should be fixed on next update
15:26:08 <louipc> unlock phone and open clock app to make sure alarm works
15:26:15 <louipc> until then
15:27:12 <louipc> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/384
15:27:18 <strcat[m]> Remu: the reason there are there issues with Clock at all is that AOSP has active development for it
15:27:46 <strcat[m]> but for these user-facing AOSP apps, they're basically just a snapshot of master that passes the CTS, unlike the rest of AOSP (the actual core OS) that is heavily tested for releases
15:27:57 <strcat[m]> and then they are largely frozen until the next major release
15:28:18 <strcat[m]> that's why we need to backport changes from master - it's super actively developed in master, but it actually makes it hard to backport
15:28:32 <strcat[m]> they rewrote the whole thing in Kotlin so we can't backport anymore without fully moving to master for it
15:28:43 <louipc> oh lol
15:28:47 <strcat[m]> everything is going to start being rewritten in Kotlin
15:28:50 <strcat[m]> from Java
15:29:01 <strcat[m]> they've also started using Rust as a substitute for C++
15:33:39 <ludicrous_speed[> Looks like you can change bios splash screen by "fastboot flash splash xxxxx.IMG" ? Anybody confirm? Does that change google splash screen?
15:40:25 <strcat[m]> according to who?
15:42:08 <strcat[m]> it's the early bootloader splash and you can't change it
15:43:09 <strcat[m]> if we supported a Sony device, it'd say Sony, it's the branding of the hardware
15:43:49 <strcat[m]> manufacturers would have to go out of the way to make it configurable and would have to implement support for verifying it with the AVB key or something like that
15:44:02 <strcat[m]> easier just to not include the splash especially since it'd delay showing it anyway
15:45:15 <ludicrous_speed[> Its minor, I would just rather not see it. I guess if it can't be changed, that's it.
15:50:27 <strcat[m]> the way to do that would be supporting a device from another manufacturer that still meets the requirements
15:50:40 <strcat[m]> which may mean getting in touch with one and trying to push them to do better
15:54:02 <louipc> foxconn fone
15:57:00 <strcat[m]> well, Pixels are Foxconn phones nowadays
15:57:07 <strcat[m]> like iPhones

18:25:50 <doobry[m]> After flashing GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4a the first time, the setup wizard seems to have issues.
18:26:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> doobry please describe
18:26:40 <doobry[m]> I selected language, timezone and wifi, but when trying to enable mobile data, the wizard stopped and now says something like "no recently used elements"
18:27:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> doobry language?
18:27:15 <doobry[m]> now I only see "no recently used elements" and when I choose "next", the same is displayed.
18:27:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can I get a screenshot of what you see?
18:27:25 <doobry[m]>  anupritaisno1: german
18:27:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> You are not really supposed to change the system language
18:27:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> That is not supported
18:28:08 <doobry[m]> hu, that's the first question the installer asks. so I'm supposed to leave it to english?
18:28:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
18:28:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are working to remove support for others
18:28:36 <doobry[m]> uh, then this should be mentioned at https://grapheneos.org/install üòâ
18:28:45 <doobry[m]> ok, I'll reboot and leave it to english
18:28:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Main issue being it's impossible to get translations for everything
18:30:53 <mrxx_0[m]> Aosp doesn't support these translations ?
18:33:04 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: we're not going to remove support for other languages
18:33:27 <strcat[m]> please don't make claims like that
18:33:38 <strcat[m]> there is nothing wrong with people selecting another language
18:33:45 <doobry[m]> strcat: good to hear üòä Maybe it's enough to do the setup wizard in english and change system language afterwards?
18:33:45 <strcat[m]> if there are bugs with that we need to fix
18:34:10 <strcat[m]> we are not going to be making translations of our own strings right now and we need to disable translations for strings we've modified
18:34:19 <strcat[m]> but we're not going to remove existing support for other languages
18:34:37 <strcat[m]> we just can't currently provide translations for our own stuff because we'd need trusted people to write it since we can't review it
18:34:46 <strcat[m]> and we'd need a way of maintaining it without a high burden
18:35:19 <strcat[m]> there may be issues with the SetupWizard app in certain languages - some translations may be out of sync, we're using a fork of the LineageOS setup wizard, we could rebase onto the latest release from them
19:05:21 <ultracard[m]> hey guys, I don't know if this is the right place for a bug report, if not, sorry. I have been using GrapheneOS on the Pixel 4a for over a week now without any issues. But yesterday, I installed the new update. Since then I am not able to connect to my Wifi any more. We have two Routers in our Home, I am able to connect to one of them, but since the update i can no longer connect to the other one.
19:05:46 <ultracard[m]> maybe teh issue is my router
19:05:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> ultracard strange. What's the error?
19:05:59 <ultracard[m]> but the issue appeared directly after updating graphene OS
19:06:15 <ultracard[m]> and no other devices have trouble connecting with the other wifi router
19:06:24 <ultracard[m]> it's just my pixel 4a
19:06:35 <ultracard[m]> It doesn't give me any error
19:06:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> ultracard what's the error
19:06:53 <ultracard[m]> when I try to connect, it always says "obtaining IP adress"
19:06:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Explain what happens then
19:06:56 <ultracard[m]> and then it stops
19:07:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> This seems to be a problem with your router
19:07:29 <ultracard[m]> and connects to  another wifi
19:07:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can you try one thing?
19:07:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Restart your router and only connect 1 device to it
19:07:53 <ultracard[m]> could that have got to do something with MAC randomisation?
19:08:02 <ultracard[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Can you try one thing?"> sure
19:08:06 <ultracard[m]> will do that
19:08:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is likely you've connected way more than the router's limit
19:08:13 <ultracard[m]> Ok
19:08:14 <ultracard[m]> thanks
19:08:20 <ultracard[m]> i'll try and report back
19:08:33 <ultracard[m]> could take a few minutes
19:18:43 <ultracard[m]> I restarted my router
19:19:03 <ultracard[m]> (unplugged it and then waited for 10second until I plugged it in again)
19:19:35 <ultracard[m]> and when i try to connect to the router I still have the same issue
19:19:45 <ultracard[m]> it stops after "obtaining IP adress"
19:20:00 <ultracard[m]> all other devices directly reconnected after the router restarted
19:22:56 <num8[m]> did you try to forget the network and re-add?
19:22:56 <num8[m]> what if you set a static IP ?
19:23:14 <ultracard[m]> yeah, I tried "forget network"
19:23:17 <ultracard[m]> didn't change anything
19:23:38 <ultracard[m]> but i only tried connecting using DHCP
19:23:44 <ultracard[m]> i'll try using a static IP
19:23:50 <num8[m]> no MAC filtering on the router side, right ?
19:24:01 <ultracard[m]> <num8[m] "no MAC filtering on the router s"> not that i'm aware of
19:24:15 <num8[m]> (just to double check the mac randomization thin, but no, I don't think)
19:24:43 <num8[m]> I'd try with a static IP, just to get come clue
19:25:33 <ultracard[m]> when I try to use a static IP,  the "connect" button is greyed out
19:25:42 <ultracard[m]> I cannot tap on "connect"
19:26:02 <num8[m]> uhm
19:26:11 <ultracard[m]> would you try connecting with my actual MAC adress
19:26:20 <ultracard[m]> or would that be a severe privacy problem
19:27:05 <ultracard[m]> now, when i try to connect to the router it says "IP configuration failure"
19:27:30 <num8[m]> well, if that's your router and exposing your MAC is fine per your threat model, then yes
19:27:57 <dontdisturbme[m]> I have the same issue previously. Your DHCP address might be filled up. Either wait for the DHCP lease to expire or increase the DHCP limit if your router supports it
19:28:17 <num8[m]> yeah
19:28:29 <num8[m]> do you have admin access on the router, btw ?
19:28:57 <ultracard[m]> connecting with by real MAC adress doesn't change anything
19:28:58 <num8[m]> <dontdisturbme[m] "I have the same issue previously"> also, he already rebooted the router
19:29:12 <ultracard[m]> <dontdisturbme[m] "I have the same issue previously"> how long could that take?
19:29:27 <dontdisturbme[m]> DHCP lease doesn‚Äôt expire on reboot I think
19:30:08 <ultracard[m]> <num8[m] "do you have admin access on the "> yeah
19:30:12 <ultracard[m]> it's my dad's router
19:30:26 <ultracard[m]> but if i ask him he'll give me the password
19:30:31 <dontdisturbme[m]> That depends on your router or if you made any changes. Mine is 3 days
19:30:58 <dontdisturbme[m]> I just increase the limit and disable randomisation by SSID. That solves the issue permanently
19:31:18 <num8[m]> <dontdisturbme[m] "DHCP lease doesn‚Äôt expire on reb"> oh, true
19:31:36 <ultracard[m]> ok
19:31:53 <ultracard[m]> i'll try configuring my router
19:31:59 <ultracard[m]> what sort of setting should i look for
19:32:28 <num8[m]> look around dhcp settings, active leases, stuff like that
19:32:38 <ultracard[m]> ok
19:33:27 <dontdisturbme[m]> Alternatively you can also delete those unused DHCP leases previously issued. Really depends on the router type if it supports this function
19:40:58 <jpds> strcat[m]: This is what Signal uses for their localization: https://www.transifex.com/signalapp/public/
19:41:20 <jpds> strcat[m]: Free for open source projects: https://www.transifex.com/pricing/
19:41:54 <strcat[m]> jpds: it's more difficult for us outside of projects like Auditor due to being based on an upstream repository
19:42:02 <strcat[m]> we could use an approach like that for Auditor, AttestationServer, etc.
19:42:22 <jpds> Could be good to try it :-)
19:42:28 <strcat[m]> but it's more difficult for anything forked from AOSP because we have to keep rebasing our patches onto new releases, and we can't hold back releases for translations
19:42:47 <strcat[m]> also will lose all the translations when moving to new releases a lot of the time because it'll all conflict
19:43:00 <strcat[m]> also care a lot about making sure everything is properly reviewed
19:43:19 <strcat[m]> which means if there is a German translation of Auditor for example, I don't just want to have 1 person do it
19:43:32 <strcat[m]> there need to be multiple people able to review it and make sure it's a correct translation and gets across the same meaning
19:43:55 <strcat[m]> for Auditor and other projects that are standalone (not forked from AOSP), I think that's realistic
19:44:04 <strcat[m]> it's a more difficult problem for AOSP forked repos
19:44:07 <strcat[m]> similarly, for Vanadium
19:44:17 <jpds> I'm sure there's plenty of German-speaking graphene users (including myself)
19:44:38 <strcat[m]> jpds: I'm open to the idea of coming up with an approach for translations for stuff like Auditor
19:44:47 <strcat[m]> but for the forked repositories it's just much harder
19:45:00 <strcat[m]> someone would have to develop tooling capable of dealing with it well
19:45:04 <strcat[m]> in a way that doesn't hold back development
19:45:06 <jpds> It's always weird to have my phone set to German and just randomly have an English phrase in app :D
19:45:35 <strcat[m]> jpds: in some cases we change strings in English while leaving translations, which is worse, since they're out-of-date
19:45:55 <strcat[m]> for example we renamed "Google Play system updates" to "Mainline updates" since the AOSP name for it is mainline and it has nothing to do with Google Play unless you use their builds of it
19:46:01 <strcat[m]> but we only changed that for English
19:46:07 <strcat[m]> so it will say the wrong thing in other languages atm
19:46:19 <strcat[m]> we need to have a script that deletes the out-of-date translations as a starting point
19:46:27 <strcat[m]> so, the issue is a new release comes out, with substantial changes
19:46:33 <strcat[m]> often they renumber all the translation string ids
19:46:45 <strcat[m]> a commit changing them is going to have a ton of conflicts
19:46:53 <strcat[m]> we need a tool for automatically generating a new translation commit
19:47:08 <strcat[m]> so we can just drop the old commit and generate a new one from the translations
19:47:11 <ultracard[m]> I am now in my Routers configuration
19:47:25 <strcat[m]> jpds: it's harder than it seems, essentially
19:47:36 <ultracard[m]> the list of previously connected devices is insanely long
19:47:38 <strcat[m]> we want our changes to be a clean patch set that's straightforward / easy to audit / review
19:47:45 <strcat[m]> and port to new releases, upstream, etc.
19:48:49 <strcat[m]> jpds: sometimes the issues are worse, for example we added a MAC randomization option, and that makes the array of options longer
19:49:11 <strcat[m]> jpds: what ended up happening is for other languages, it misaligned the translations, and they got applied to wrong entries + were missing one of them
19:49:19 <jpds> I wonder how they do https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/71250afd2c4ef0c45e48cb2faf41e3425b49b395
19:49:22 <strcat[m]> jpds: we ended up addressing that a long time ago, just an example of it
19:49:51 <strcat[m]> jpds: we need something like that which is automated (I'm sure that is) but also designed to generate everything from scratch
19:49:55 <ultracard[m]> there's the names of my family's devices and then there's hundreds of devices which all start with PC- and then continue with some string of hex numbers
19:50:02 <strcat[m]> jpds: we may just need to figure out a workflow for doing it
19:50:07 <strcat[m]> jpds: and write scripts to automate it
19:50:14 <jpds> strcat[m]: I'll try and see what signal has
19:50:28 <ultracard[m]> could it be that every time graphene OS connects to wifi, it behaves as if it was a completely different device?
19:50:37 <ultracard[m]> filling up the list of connected devices
19:51:37 <dontdisturbme[m]> ultracard: that‚Äôs what happen to me. Hence I whitelist my SSID to not use MAC randomisation. All other public SSID will continue to use MAC randomisation
19:51:53 <strcat[m]> ultracard: yes by default, it does that
19:52:04 <strcat[m]> dontdisturbme: I'd recommended using the per-network randomization option
19:52:07 <strcat[m]> dontdisturbme: rather than disabling it
19:52:21 <strcat[m]> per-network will reuse the same MAC address for each connection until the DHCP lease expires
19:52:30 <ultracard[m]> ok, sounds nice
19:52:35 <strcat[m]> per-network is the AOSP default
19:52:49 <strcat[m]> we add the option of randomizing each time and set that as the default
19:52:49 <dontdisturbme[m]> strcat: I didn‚Äôt disable it. I whitelist my home SSID to not use it only
19:53:03 <strcat[m]> dontdisturbme: I mean I'd recommend not disabling it for your home SSID
19:53:10 <strcat[m]> but rather using per-network randomization for it
19:53:49 <strcat[m]> per-network won't add any extra DHCP table entries because it will reuse the MAC address for that network until the DHCP lease expires
19:54:27 <strcat[m]> so each connection will have the same MAC
19:54:40 <strcat[m]> unless the DHCP lease expires and the network has forgotten about the device
19:54:45 <strcat[m]> then it just starts over
19:55:00 <strcat[m]> (this is the upstream AOSP approach)
19:55:01 <dontdisturbme[m]> strcat: ok got it
19:55:27 <strcat[m]> basically AOSP has 2 settings: per-network random MAC or device MAC
19:55:41 <strcat[m]> we make it 3: per-connection MAC, per-network MAC, device MAC
19:56:25 <strcat[m]> Android 11 made the per-network MAC a bit more clever by letting it expire when DHCP lease expires, since the network has forgotten about the device anyway, so it might as well pick a new random MAC
19:56:38 <ultracard[m]> smart
19:57:01 <ultracard[m]> i guess the problem is that the router now has got an endless list of previously connected devices
19:57:08 <ultracard[m]> but i cannot delete the old entries
19:57:17 <strcat[m]> ultracard: well that's not an issue it'll just forget about them when the table gets full
19:57:20 <louipc> sound like android translation system is rekt
19:57:20 <strcat[m]> or when their DHCP lease expires
19:57:27 <strcat[m]> ultracard: it's just an annoyance, at most
19:57:46 <dontdisturbme[m]> strcat: would it be possible to set per network randomisation by default instead? I took quite a while to figure this out. Not everyone has admin access to their router to figure this out on their own
19:58:01 <strcat[m]> ultracard: the router should distinguish between devices that are connected with a lease and those that are disconnected with a lease not expired
19:58:15 <strcat[m]> dontdisturbme: no we really want Wi-Fi anonymity by default
19:58:20 <strcat[m]> we consider this change pretty important
19:58:45 <strcat[m]> filling up the DHCP lease table isn't really a problem
19:59:05 <strcat[m]> I don't think most users are going to look at their router DHCP lease table
19:59:06 <ultracard[m]> ok i found the setting
19:59:19 <ultracard[m]> it says that the DHCP lease will expire after 10 days by default
19:59:41 <dontdisturbme[m]> strcat: I actually took a hour or so to figure out it was the DHCP table filling up. Didn‚Äôt realise it until I use another phone and found it weird why it couldn‚Äôt connect to WiFi either
20:00:00 <strcat[m]> if the router actually stops being able to handle new devices because of this
20:00:05 <strcat[m]> it's really broken
20:00:15 <strcat[m]> imagine if a coffee shop router behaved that way
20:00:37 <ultracard[m]> yeah it sucks
20:00:40 <strcat[m]> it should have a certain limit on the table size and when it's full it should be forgetting the oldest device
20:00:52 <ultracard[m]> so should I set the expiry date to 1 day now?
20:01:07 <strcat[m]> ultracard: well it should just force expire them if it fills up really
20:01:14 <dontdisturbme[m]> strcat: I wouldn‚Äôt say its broken. Consumer routers don‚Äôt give a large lease by default. 20 or so is the default. it gets filled very quickly. Corporate type of routers have a much bigger lease by default because the target audience is different
20:01:29 <ultracard[m]> yeah, but seems like that stupid box isn't doing that
20:01:38 <strcat[m]> dontdisturbme: coffee shops, etc. use consumer routers generally
20:01:42 <ultracard[m]> it probably has filled all 256connections
20:01:44 <strcat[m]> and it handles thousands of people coming and going
20:01:55 <strcat[m]> because it just forgets the oldest leases if it runs out of room
20:02:21 <strcat[m]> the main reason for the per-network randomization existing is to deal with cases like universities where you have to whitelist a MAC
20:02:22 <strcat[m]> silly stuff
20:02:39 <strcat[m]> it could be used as a workaround for this kind of router bug
20:02:41 <strcat[m]> but it's definitely a bug
20:03:31 <strcat[m]> I think Windows first introduced saving the random MAC per-network, and then Android did that for their implementation of connected MAC rand
20:03:42 <strcat[m]> we want our default to be more anonymous than that
20:03:58 <strcat[m]> and yeah it could cause issues with silly routers / setups - but it shouldn't
20:05:47 <dontdisturbme[m]> strcat: Not trying to argue for the sake of arguing but not all routers have this function or expose it to the users. Lease expiry is by lease duration not a FIFO queue that I see. Haven‚Äôt see many routers that adopt auto purging also. If it does, and if the duration is set to reasonably low, then auto purging will simply DOS the earlier customers also
20:06:45 <strcat[m]> I would expect that what a normal router does is use fairly short leases that are renewed when those devices are actively connected
20:06:52 <ultracard[m]> I found an option to delete all unused connections
20:06:59 <strcat[m]> and when the table fills they drop oldest devices
20:07:04 <strcat[m]> otherwise it's just broken
20:07:11 <ultracard[m]> oh yeah
20:07:16 <strcat[m]> just think about a coffee shop situation - only ever ~30 at most people connected
20:07:16 <ultracard[m]> and now it works
20:07:19 <strcat[m]> but thousands come and go
20:07:36 <strcat[m]> if a router is broken by default if a coffee shop, dental office, etc. uses it
20:07:38 <strcat[m]> that's broken
20:07:40 <dontdisturbme[m]> Mine defaults to 43200. That‚Äôs 12 hours of DOS if I hadn‚Äôt realise it when I first encountered it
20:08:30 <strcat[m]> each time you connect, you're just a new customer - it'd have the same problem if you held a party with a lot of people coming and going and a wifi password posted
20:08:31 <dontdisturbme[m]> Perhaps would you consider to put this into one of the FAQ? At least people might realise it when reading?
20:08:48 <strcat[m]> there's a section on Wi-Fi anonymity in the usage guide
20:08:55 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
20:09:31 <strcat[m]> we could add an FAQ section about the issue you encountered but it's basically the first I'm hearing of it actually breaking anything
20:09:51 <strcat[m]> people have noticed having entries build up in their router's known devices but it hasn't broken anything for them that I've heard of before
20:10:25 <ultracard[m]> thanks guys
20:10:28 <dontdisturbme[m]> strcat: technically it didn‚Äôt really break. I encountered it but managed to solve it. Didn‚Äôt it is worth mentioning until ultracard also encountered it. Else usually i would just lurk here
20:10:34 <ultracard[m]> you saved me tons of hours or even days
20:10:46 <ultracard[m]> networking stuff really can be frustrating
20:10:50 <ultracard[m]> you are amazing
20:10:53 <ultracard[m]> thanks
20:11:27 <strcat[m]> dontdisturbme: just filling up the table isn't a problem unless it fails to handle purging stuff when it's full
20:12:19 <strcat[m]> I can see it being an annoyance if people actually use their router UI to configure stuff like port forwarding and it doesn't distinguish between active devices and recently seen ones
20:12:22 <dontdisturbme[m]> strcat: At least I confirm that my Edgerouter doesn‚Äôt do it. Can‚Äôt say for others since I do not use multiple routers but ya its a pain when it happen. Because the lease runs dry really quickly
20:12:57 <dontdisturbme[m]> Like less than 30 mins as I was testing something then
20:13:50 <dontdisturbme[m]> Default lease quantity is 20. I am already using 10 or so devices already. Just to mention for my particular scenario
20:23:48 <the5000[m]> Is there a way to change your IMEI on a pixel?
20:30:00 <cenapatop689[m]> ...
20:30:21 <louipc> no
20:32:04 <cenapatop689[m]> üòü
20:34:07 <faxing[m]> <the5000[m] "Is there a way to change your IM"> Certainly not that I'm aware of. I think it's set and unchangeable on any phon

20:50:01 <dazinism> Seedvault dev is asking for folks to run a test app to see if the new seedvault architecture works well https://nitter.snopyta.org/t_grote/status/1324795194617827328
20:50:37 <dazinism> The app is available from their fdroid repo

22:38:42 <strcat[m]> here's one of the CopperheadOS resellers involved in scamming users trying to argue otherwise
22:38:43 <strcat[m]> funny stuff
22:39:19 <strcat[m]> CopperheadOS shipped the September security updates 2 months later, and the October security updates 1 month late
22:39:40 <strcat[m]> they misrepresent the Pixel 2 as still being a secure device and they're more than willing to set a dishonest patch level
22:39:52 <strcat[m]> they rip off our work, poorly, and fraudulently claim credit for it
22:40:03 <strcat[m]> including describing work done AFTER they split from the project as somehow being theirs
22:40:11 <strcat[m]> "CopperheadOS hardened allocator" is such a joke
22:40:23 <strcat[m]> they don't even understand the work they're copying
22:40:51 <strcat[m]> they sell extremely expensive devices with ongoing payments required for updates and have a tracking scheme for enforcing that
22:41:01 <strcat[m]> which puts users at risk of being targeted with malicious updates
22:41:11 <strcat[m]> their devices are a scam, plain and simple
22:41:24 <strcat[m]> it's the worst of the 'secure phone' industry
23:04:53 <doobry[m]> anupritaisno1 and strcat : I just wanted to report back that going through the setup wizard in english and switching to german as system language afterwards worked like a charm üòä
23:09:10 <louipc> kool
23:20:43 <strcat[m]> doobry: we plan to switch away from the CalyxOS SetupWizard fork to using the upstream LinageOS SetupWizard they forked
23:20:44 <doobry[m]> is there a way to hide apps from the app list in GrapheneOS? I'd like to hide some apps that cannot be disabled since I use alternatives (e.g. the Files app).
23:20:55 <strcat[m]> no, not with the standard launcher
23:21:01 <strcat[m]> but you could use another launcher with features like those
23:21:15 <strcat[m]> the standard launcher has special integration into the OS letting it have some neat minor UI features though
23:21:42 <strcat[m]> I don't think the gesture support would be 100% there with another launcher
23:21:47 <strcat[m]> just how it works in AOSP / Android in general
23:21:51 <doobry[m]> strcat: thanks, good to hear. I was super happy to learn that GrapheneOS and CalyxOS join some forces recently though ü¶π
23:22:13 <strcat[m]> we've collaborated with them on various things
23:23:33 <strcat[m]> there is some conflict between the communities driven by people involved with either project
23:23:40 <doobry[m]> yeah, that's great news! the backup tool e.g. looks really promising. I just invoked it for the first time, yet have to further look into it.
23:23:51 <strcat[m]>  * there is some conflict between the communities driven by people  that aren't involved with either project
23:24:01 <strcat[m]> (made an important typo above, reread it)
23:24:33 <doobry[m]> <strcat[m] "there is some conflict between t"> that's sad to read. I totally understand that the projects have slightly different angles but still there's a lot of common goals, no?
23:24:50 <doobry[m]> ah, good to read your correction ;)
23:27:08 <mrxx_0[m]> <strcat[m] "I don't think the gesture suppor"> Quickstep made the gesture not available to non OS launchers, you basically can't open multitask and swipe back to go to last opened apps
23:44:34 <doobry[m]> Mh, do you know how to install GoogleCamera via Aurora Store? I installed [Gcam-Services-Provider](https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider but I don't find the Google Camera app in Aurora Store ü§î
