00:52:14 <Banekroft[m]> Salve o/ been using GrapheneOS for over a year now on my main Android device. Much love to the project. Been a bit foreign to the devs, but I'm curious if it's doing well?
01:48:52 <louipc> Banekroft[m]: could use more devs - device maintainers in particular
01:51:17 <Banekroft[m]> What are the responsibilities and experience requirements for a device maintainer?
01:57:45 <louipc> build, test, patch and release the regular updates for your device basically
01:59:40 <louipc> experience... you should be competent at patching and building software, communicating on issue trackers, cryptographic key management, source control via git
02:00:11 <louipc> c, c++, python, java, and kotlin experience is a plus
02:01:47 <Banekroft[m]> I see.
02:02:53 <louipc> having a kind of analytical mind, being able to spot potential vulnerabilities would be good too
02:04:10 <Banekroft[m]> Is there any place for someone without such experience to volunteer time and effort, or would the assignments be too complex to participate in?
02:05:32 <louipc> if you are motivated and passionate enough you could pick up everything you need to know in an unofficial capacity
02:06:49 <louipc> actually i think the final builds are only done by dan. but you should still know how to do releases
02:07:04 <louipc> and cryptographically sign your builds, etc
02:07:38 <louipc> which you can tinker with on the side
02:08:44 <Banekroft[m]> I'm currently in a place where I have both time to contribute and an interest to learn how to, especially for a project I genuinely care about. I'll take a look at the requisites you listed and see what I can expand on alone.
02:08:59 <louipc> i think help is needed for pixel 4, pixel 4a and theres absolutely no one for pixel 5
02:09:38 <Banekroft[m]> I currently have a 3a. Have not had a reason to upgrade, especially since my main mobile device is the most recent iPhone model.
02:10:32 <louipc> Banekroft[m]: good thing to try first is to do a build https://grapheneos.org/build
02:10:59 <louipc> thats ok. you could still learn the process on your current device
02:11:31 <louipc> its advisable that is not your main daily use device tho
02:13:07 <Banekroft[m]> I understand the concerns. Being a technology enthusiast, I embrace certain privacy risks in order to enjoy usability, especially since I also use an Apple Watch and AirPods pro as daily drivers.
02:14:56 <Banekroft[m]> That said, I feel very strongly that one should first explore and learn about all aspects of a certain subject before choosing one, especially if that which is chosen is generally the 'easier' option.
02:15:47 <Banekroft[m]> And I've just realized you were referring to the device I do testing on. Okay :]
02:24:28 <louipc> yea hehh
02:30:57 <Banekroft[m]> Thanks for the answers. I'll come back once I've tried building and exploring the subjects you mentioned.
02:57:04 <louipc> Banekroft[m]: nice :)
03:12:01 <Ornahe> Has anyone built & installed sunfish on pixel4a yet? I saw there's one dev/maintainer on it
03:13:48 <louipc> Ornahe: contact anupritaisno1[m]
03:16:52 <Ornahe> I'll give a shout, thx
06:33:33 * DC[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/vaLaMgZgvtZqCyogQGrZPmBx/message.txt >
06:38:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> [D~C](https://matrix.to/#/@colljrdam:matrix.org) seems you've done a bunch of stuff
06:38:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> I really recommend sideloading the full OTA now
06:47:55 <DC[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I really recommend sideloading t"> Side loading the full stock OTA seemed to work well before flashing Graphene. Thanks for hot tip! üòâüëç
06:52:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <DC[m] "Side loading the full stock OTA "> The grapheneos OTA
06:52:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're not supposed to edit that installer script
06:52:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> You deleted a sanity check and did something very unsafe with your phone
06:56:12 <DC[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "You deleted a sanity check and d"> Oh, I see what you mean. I couldn't get it to install without deleting the sanity check. I'll side load the full Graphene OTA tomorrow.
07:00:19 <xander-salamande> maybe your phone is insane now :curious:
07:00:41 <xander-salamande>  * maybe your phone is insane now ü§î
07:01:43 <xander-salamande> but for reals, flashing is dangerous if conditions aren't perfect
07:02:52 <DC[m]> Lol, yeah. I know whatcha mean. I'll do it up right tomorrow.
07:04:34 <DC[m]> My phone starts up and a splash screen immediately says something about a different OS being loaded. Blah blah blah. Wish it would skip that!
07:28:42 <lpcvoid[m]1> No, that's the bootloader and it's good that it does this
07:29:48 <Biv[m]> Aren't themes a feature in 11?
07:30:04 <Biv[m]> Or at least a diluted version of theming
07:31:17 <Biv[m]> No option in GOS
07:32:54 <Biv[m]> I also read somewhere that Miracast support on Pixel 3a was some sort of driver issue? Where the issue was it was lacked.
08:09:07 <dazinism> Banekroft: this might be of interest. It was written a while back, but I think mainly holds true
08:09:19 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os
08:52:38 <strangefinder[m]> Hi, is there any possibility for istalling a second instance of an app for example wazap?
08:52:38 <strangefinder[m]> with a different account? telnummer?
09:08:16 <dazinism> strangefinder: yeah put it in another user profile. Have access/control of a different phone number that WhatsApp will accept
09:09:32 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
09:11:20 <dazinism> Can be a good way to use WhatsApp as it allows full functionality without giving them access to all  your contacts
09:12:47 <dazinism> (Having your WhatsApp set up in a different user profile than the one where you keep your contacts details)
11:51:28 <strangefinder[m]> <dazinism "strangefinder: yeah put it in an"> works so far, is there any chance to get notification ro the main user?
12:02:25 <dazinism> strangefinder
12:02:25 <dazinism> Only way I know to do that is use a work profile
12:05:59 <dazinism> Think it could be done across user profiles if the operating system and apps were modified to support it.
12:06:46 <dazinism> SMS apps currently can function in multiple profiles (have to enable the toggle)
12:08:17 <duggalsu[m]> I'll jump in with a quick question - if you setup a profile without phone access,  does it isolate the profile from the modem?
12:08:34 <dazinism> No
12:08:53 <dazinism> It can still connect to data
12:09:42 <dazinism> I think you can however use the VPN functionality in a user profile to block all network connections from that profile
12:10:43 <dazinism> The way NetGuard works, I think it should do this
12:11:58 <dazinism> If you set the android VPN settings for NetGuard to 'block connections without VPN' it doesn't appear to let anything through to the network.
12:12:24 <dazinism> I've not tested this by monitoring the network.
12:13:44 <duggalsu[m]> OK, is the phone connectivity a big security risk though?  I had read in the replicant docs about it and how to disable telephony
12:15:09 <dazinism> Connecting to any network always has risks.
12:15:32 <dazinism> Pixel devices have pretty top notch security
12:15:39 <duggalsu[m]> True
12:16:21 <dazinism> The devices that replicant support are ancient. Things have changed quite a bit since then
12:17:40 <duggalsu[m]> Ok
12:28:35 <doobry[m]> anupritaisno1: so my Pixel 4a arrived, just in case you need someone to test early betas of the ROM üòä
13:36:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Thanks
14:39:31 <alex-resist> An entire Conversations message ended up on my GrapheneOS lock screen, although it's not supposed to show message content. This is quite serious. I couldn't replicate it so far, I have the suspicion that this happened when a Conversations message arrived at the exact time I locked the screen
14:41:07 <aeonsolution[m]>  did you change the system message notifications default?
14:41:09 <fr4[m]> Use microg to install app like  banking will miming another imei or the proprietary of phone?
14:41:45 <alex-resist> aeonsolution no, how could that make a difference?
14:41:47 <aeonsolution[m]> fr4: https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
14:42:15 <aeonsolution[m]> alex-resist: try it and let me know if you still have the issue
14:42:57 <alex-resist> What setting do you mean?
14:43:51 <aeonsolution[m]> "Notifications on lock screen"
14:44:14 <wjhrdy[m]> I'm having trouble with a newly flashed pixel 4xl soft bootlooping on lock screen I couldn't find a way to search this thread any help on either would be helpful
14:44:41 <alex-resist> Well no, I obviously didn't change that. Messages do not appear on the lock screen usually. However one message made it through, which is concerning
14:44:54 <aeonsolution[m]> wjhrdy: what step on this page did you have problems with https://grapheneos.org/install
14:45:24 <aeonsolution[m]> alex-resist: cool? so then its an issue with the app.
14:46:11 <alex-resist> That means the OS is only asking apps to not show message content? Is it not enforcing that?
14:47:02 <aeonsolution[m]> <alex-resist "That means the OS is only asking"> i literally did not say any of that.
14:48:05 <wjhrdy[m]> aeonsolution: I installed it and I'm  using it to type this message. But every time I lock then unlock the screen it shows me the graphene logo and I havd to re login
14:48:13 <aeonsolution[m]> alex-resist: change the system notifications and let me know if it still shows the message.
14:51:26 <aeonsolution[m]> wjhrdy: you can try to do a factory reset or try install GrapheneOS
14:51:56 <aeonsolution[m]> if you still have the problem please create an issue on Github, it might be a bug
14:52:21 <aeonsolution[m]> you will need to make a logcat file to help the maintainer debug the issue https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat at that point
14:52:43 <aeonsolution[m]>  * wjhrdy: you can try to do a factory reset or try re-install GrapheneOS
14:53:07 <alex-resist> aeonsolution I already said I cannot replicate it. You said it's an issue with the app. I would expect the OS to enforce not showing message content even if the app has a bug
14:53:25 <alex-resist> If message content still appears, contrary to the settings, it seems like there is an issue with the OS
14:53:41 <aeonsolution[m]> how does it enforce it if you didn't change the default to show notifications
14:54:23 <alex-resist> The default is not showing message content, at least that's what I expect. If that is not the default, I disabled showing message content
14:54:47 <alex-resist> Anyway, message content should not appear on the lock screen, with this setting.
14:55:46 <aeonsolution[m]> that
14:56:01 <aeonsolution[m]>  * that's not the system default though
14:56:15 <alex-resist> Okay, but that is a side issue then. I was mistaken what the default is
14:57:04 <aeonsolution[m]> its not a side issue because it if the app fails to hide content then it defaults to what the system does
14:57:27 <aeonsolution[m]> if the system defaults to show notifications then youre privacy is "vulnerable"
14:57:50 <aeonsolution[m]> but at the end of the day the original issue is with the app and not the system
14:58:03 <aeonsolution[m]> and this would be the only way you would notice this
14:58:24 <alex-resist> I don't understand why GrapheneOS allows showing message content at all. It is disabled in the system wide settings
14:58:45 <alex-resist> This doesn't make any sense to me
14:58:47 <aeonsolution[m]> what?
14:59:16 <alex-resist> Okay, I guess I should start from scratch.
15:00:15 <aeonsolution[m]> the project isn't a silverbullet for security and privacy, the user still needs to take responsibility for their opsec
15:00:21 <alex-resist> I'm running Conversations on GrapheneOS. I changed the system-wide setting that message content is *not* shown in the lock screen. And this is what usually happens.
15:00:37 <alex-resist> Today, one message from Conversations still appeared on the lock screen, contrary to the settings
15:01:17 <alex-resist> There are only two options. A) this is a bug with GrapheneOS or B) GrapheneOS is not enforcing that setting and apps can misbehave. Both options are problematic.
15:03:10 <aeonsolution[m]> if you have the system notifications to not show messages and a message appears unhidden, then you would need to help us recreate the issue so we can investigate further
15:04:13 <alex-resist> Yes I know, and I already mentioned in the very beginning that I could not replicate it so far. My suspicion is that this happened when a message arrives at the exact time I'm locking the screen. It somehow appeared unhidden on the lock screen, although that should never happen. Is this a bit clearer now?
15:06:25 <aeonsolution[m]> a little bit, none of what you mentioned was actionable and there was a lot of gaps in information that didnt help narrow down if it was an OS issue or an app issue
15:06:56 <aeonsolution[m]> i suggest you try testing your theory and locking your phone when you receive messages
15:07:47 <alex-resist> Well I tried to make it clearer, but you should never assume just "bad opsec". My first description was this "An entire Conversations message ended up on my GrapheneOS lock screen, although it's not supposed to show message content.". I do not find that overly imprecise
15:07:57 <aeonsolution[m]> bugs are bugs, doesn't matter if they are problematic or not. we have to fix them.
15:09:37 <aeonsolution[m]> uhh...
15:10:38 <aeonsolution[m]> i did not assume you had bad opsec. i explained the chain of responsibility of privacy and security on mobile from app to os.
15:11:21 <aeonsolution[m]> asking for clarification is not an attack, we just actionable information to move forward
15:11:32 <aeonsolution[m]>  * asking for clarification is not an attack, we just need actionable information to move forward
15:12:17 <alex-resist> Clarification is fine, seriously. Some messages from you made it appear as if Conversations was responsible for overriding system-wide lock screen settings, which absolutely should not be the case. That's why I became quite confused
15:16:15 <aeonsolution[m]> i think you mistook me asking for clarification on your notifications defaults to be that case
15:16:28 <aeonsolution[m]> i could of been a little more detailed so thats my fault
15:16:50 <alex-resist> Yes, I was mistaken there. I did not expect "show all message content" to be the default setting, and I'm still surprised it is
15:17:20 <alex-resist> I was expecting the "hide message content" setting to be the default, as that is what people should use
15:19:02 <alex-resist> Anyway, the issue remains, and I will try to replicate it. It might be a split-second race condition or something
15:20:39 <aeonsolution[m]> thanks for sharing, hopefully we can figure out if this is a bug
16:32:37 <Golgatha> On Aurora Store I'm seeing an update for   android system web view from 85.0.4183.127 to 86.0.4240.99. Should I update it or wait for it in the next months release for GrapheneOS
16:33:51 <Golgatha> Also is it possible to change the android system webview to Bromite system web view?
16:36:05 <engulf[m]> You should not update Android system Web view via Aurora Store
16:38:05 <lpcvoid[m]1> Just wait for hardened chromium with new update
16:40:52 <Golgatha> OK will do
16:42:16 <Golgatha> Just out of curiosity is the installed system web view on GOS different than the Bromite web view?
16:45:24 <lpcvoid[m]1> Vanadium uses hardened malloc, for one
16:46:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lpcvoid](https://matrix.to/#/@lpcvoid:matrix.org) no it does not
16:46:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Vanadium uses the system malloc, which happens to be hardened malloc
16:46:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> We do not reimplement hardened malloc inside vanadium
17:11:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> So basically we have a couple commits in vanadium
17:11:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like "use 64-bit processes"
17:12:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since hardened malloc is 64-bit
17:12:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> We use these commits to force 64-bit so that more of vanadium uses hardened malloc
17:12:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Bromite doesn't have these for compatibility reasons
17:12:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> So it mostly uses hardened malloc
17:13:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it can sometimes fallback to scudo
17:13:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> We also use more secure defaults in vanadium
17:14:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example strict site isolation is enabled by default
17:14:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise most of the remaining hardening is present in Bromite too
17:15:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> * But it can sometimes fallback to scudo if it runs 32-bit processes
17:22:05 <lpcvoid[m]1> <anupritaisno1[m] "Vanadium uses the system malloc,"> Ahh thanks for that distinction!
17:49:50 <DC[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I really recommend sideloading t"> Done! OTA fully installed via ADB sideload. Working great, thanks!
17:50:00 <rwarr627[m]> Has anyone experienced audio lag when using Bluetooth in some apps (including Vanadium)?
18:14:08 <lev[m]> <rwarr627[m] "Has anyone experienced audio lag"> no, but bluetooth is kludgy in general
18:14:31 <lev[m]> does it happen reliably?  or just sometimes it gets out of sync?
18:21:30 <LinusSexTips[m]> Would it be pointless to enable Wi-Fi enhanced MAC randomization in developer options?
18:48:42 <rwarr627[m]> <lev[m] "does it happen reliably?  or jus"> Very reliably. Going to Vanadium and playing a YouTube video with Bluetooth headphones I get the issue, but no issues when viewing the same video through Bromite. I don't think this is a Vanadium issue though. I've experienced weird behaviour when Bluetooth headphone are connected in other apps as well.
18:48:56 <mastercakex[m]> Anyone tried Google Meet on GOS? I did webapp few times it works untill you get dropped out of the meeting without ability to reconnect. Is it something google dependancies related ?
18:49:13 <mastercakex[m]> Never tried app, website only
18:49:44 <aeonsolution[m]> onigirisrev: the latest version of GrapheneOS has the new webview already, you probably haven't updated to the latest version. in anycase, you wouldn't be able to update the webview from Aurora Store because the one on GrapheneOS is signed with different keys. you can look at the logs for more information.
18:52:32 <mastercakex[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "onigirisrev: the latest version "> It doesn't. It has v85 where as Aurora offers v86
18:55:16 <aeonsolution[m]>  you are right, i misspoke. Vanadium 86 is available on github but it hasn't been pushed to the latest version of GrapheneOS
18:56:18 <aeonsolution[m]> in any case, Aurora Store wont be able to update the Webview because it doesn't use the signing keys used by the GrapheneOS project
18:57:01 <aeonsolution[m]> its just a temporary webview because Android 11 did not yet support Chromium 86 when it came out
19:00:22 <aeonsolution[m]> this is a good segway into what i actually wanted to tell the channel today, we need help from people with Vanadium. its great that people want to help with device support but the browser also needs help from you!
19:03:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "its just a temporary webview bec"> Wat
19:04:58 <joltman[m]> Getting a pixel 3xl on Monday and will be using it for daily driver, so I'm sure I'll be using Vanadium a lot pretty soon.
19:06:57 <aeonsolution[m]> i said that poorly, what i mean to say is that GrapheneOS wasn't using the the Vanadium Webview until Chromium 86 because that is the version that has support upstream
19:07:31 <aeonsolution[m]> for Android 11
19:14:02 <aeonsolution[m]> <Golgatha "Just out of curiosity is the ins"> Yes, their patchsets are different and the goals of each project differs. https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing. Both are implemented differently too. Vanadium Webview is a part of GrapheneOS while Bromite Webview is something that is installed separately.
20:11:58 <DC[m]> Any advice for getting LastPass to run? I installed via Aurora. It crashes after login. I installed the latest MicroG thru the added repo on F-droid. There are a lot of settings/permissions on MicroG, and I'm not sure what to do (to maintain a reasonable level of privacy).
20:16:15 <aeonsolution[m]> If LastPass requires GSF (Google Services Framework) it won't work. Use another password manager that doesn't require it. (ie Bitwarden, etc.)
20:28:33 <lpcvoid[m]1> What, how is installing microg from a store going to work
20:29:10 <lpcvoid[m]1> It requires signature spoofing afaik
20:29:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> [D~C](https://matrix.to/#/@colljrdam:matrix.org) thanks for the report. I am looking into it
20:34:51 <DC[m]> Thanks. Trying to figure out what will and will not work. If I have to switch to Bitwarden, I suppose I can do that.

20:56:38 <j0cye56[m]> Maybe my expectations are utopian and I have been mislead, but how many years of use can I expect from a phone nowadays? This smartphone was my first proper one and it only lasted like 3 years.
20:57:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can use a smartphone until it has died
20:57:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Though security updates will not be a thing by the time that happens
20:57:30 <j0cye56[m]> Which is now after just about 3 years... :P
20:58:21 <DC[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I'm literally the maintainer "> ...of the Pixel 4. Thank you!!
20:59:06 <j0cye56[m]> If I buy a pixel 4 now (4a support is not a thing, right? - it's not listed), how long would it take until I have to buy another phone again?
20:59:57 <j0cye56[m]> (referring to software support here, not how long it takes to break)
21:00:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> [j0cye56](https://matrix.to/#/@j0cye56:matrix.org) idk, ask the 4a maintainer
21:00:20 <DC[m]> <j0cye56[m] "If I buy a pixel 4 now (4a suppo"> I think Google supports Pixels with security updates for three years. So, two years, if that matters to you enough.
21:01:25 <j0cye56[m]> Well, I guess there is no real way to get a phone that is supported for longer, the tech changes too fast. I guess I can do more to stop waste by eating differently since I eat every day and only buy a phone every few years
21:02:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> [j0cye56](https://matrix.to/#/@j0cye56:matrix.org) OT
21:03:04 <j0cye56[m]> Yes, sorry. Shutting up.
21:11:55 <jard[m]> I've got an issue with image editing, is it just me? If I save an edited (e.g. cropped) image via gallery or the screenshot editor the app crashes, doesn't save the edited image, and deletes the original.
21:12:22 <fourstepper> j0cye56 i would call this a fair trade off for now until either A. Google extends the support B. The grapheneos has the manpower to get devices running faster C. A+B combined.
21:12:22 <fourstepper> What you are getting in return is a supported, functional Android that respects your privacy
21:14:53 <j0cye56[m]> fourstepper: I do not need a lot of performance, the 3a would be a good fit for me I think, but the prospect of support for it ending is concerning to me. Do you think shelling out an extra 230‚Ç¨ is worth it?
21:17:51 <jard[m]> <j0cye56[m] "fourstepper: I do not need a lot"> To comment on the environmental aspect that you brought up, I feel like as long as you're buying second hand you're not really part of the problem. I got a refurb'd 3XL for cheap and intend to sell it once support is dropped. Maybe I'll then get whatever refurb is cheap and supported by GrapheneOS
21:21:44 <j0cye56[m]> jar.d: Okay, what do I have to watch out for with refurbs? I would want the XL variant for the longer-lasting battery alone. So either the 3a XL or straight to the 4 XL, or is this irrational? Even taking a gamble (marked as ""good"") it's still 450‚Ç¨. But that's just the way it is. Would you consider getting the older model in my situation if you wanted to use GrapheneOS?
21:22:35 <emergencyfood[m]> Anyway
21:23:40 <emergencyfood[m]> Just buy a supported device
21:23:53 <emergencyfood[m]> Pixel 4 has good support right now
21:25:04 <sphinxcat[m]> [jar.d](https://matrix.to/#/@jar.d:matrix.org): https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/330
21:25:04 <sphinxcat[m]> I recommended using another gallery app. It needs to be replaced anyway.
21:26:24 <j0cye56[m]> Okay, then it will just be the 4 variant, it's about as big as what I had until now and I am tired of past decisions that went on and on, so I won't let it get to that. I will get a Pixel 4 if I can justify it and not think more about it. You probably know much more than I could anyways, thanks for the patience. :D
21:26:44 <jard[m]> <j0cye56[m] "jar.d: Okay, what do I have to w"> I dunno man, as long as its a reputable company they should have accurate descriptions of condition, so find out what "good" means. In my case it was perfect condition except for a scuffed screen which didn't bother me. GrapheneOS appears to use less battery than an OEM OS, and  you're not going to be able to run games or anything that require google play services anyway.
21:26:44 <jard[m]> Buy the model based on what you can afford and the hardware features. Remember the *a phones have a headphone jack ;)
21:27:57 <emergencyfood[m]> [jar.d](https://matrix.to/#/@jar.d:matrix.org) games will run as long as they don't use unity
21:28:33 <jard[m]> > <@sphinxcat:matrix.org> [jar.d](https://matrix.to/#/@jar.d:matrix.org): https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/330
21:28:33 <jard[m]> > I recommended using another gallery app. It needs to be replaced anyway.
21:28:33 <jard[m]> Haha, I can't believe that title and desc perfectly matches my question. I'll definitely search github next time. Thanks.
21:29:03 <j0cye56[m]> jar.d: Yeah, the jack is a sell, but I guess if it's properly implemented BT headphones are alright. I assume security is better for BT under GrapheneOS too. I don't care for games, so the only reason I'd buy a 3a instead of 4 is for the support timeframe.
21:30:22 <j0cye56[m]> But the idea of the phone charge lasting more than 1,5 days, maybe stretching to 2 days with a little reserves is really attractive.
21:30:34 <emergencyfood[m]> [j0cye56](https://matrix.to/#/@j0cye56:matrix.org) digital output through the USB port is a thing
21:32:06 <j0cye56[m]> emergency food: I guess I didn't listen to any music the past 4 months on my phone anyways and only have BT right now. But yeah, worth a consideration if they break and need to be replaced.
21:32:29 <joltman[m]> For buying refurbs, you mostly need to watch out for the Verizon versions as they are often bootloader locked and you may not be able to get GOS on it. Have the seller show that "OEM Unlocking" option in advanced developer options isn't grayed out.
21:33:23 <jard[m]> Is Verizon only carrier? Jocye speaks in euros so they're liked not in the u.s.
21:33:34 <jard[m]> Verizon the only bad* carrier
21:34:03 <jard[m]> Likely*, jeez
21:34:15 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: How do I tell in advance?
21:35:01 <j0cye56[m]> And yes, I am in central Europe.
21:35:05 <joltman[m]> Can't say for certain, but that one is the most problematic carrier-specific version of the phones. Also, Google was taking in bad phones and refurbing them and they were still locked.
21:36:22 <joltman[m]> In the advanced developer system settings screen, there is an "OEM Unlocking" toggle switch. You need to make sure that option isn't grayed out and that it can be toggled on and off. On the Verizon versions (and possibly others), it says connect to the internet or contact your carrier.
21:37:04 <joltman[m]> In theory, the locked versions could end up anywhere, I would think.
21:37:37 <joltman[m]> The ones originally bought (new) from Google Store are good.
21:37:58 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: So it's basically a terminal corporate disease from birth lol
21:38:03 <Dinjector> Hello my dears
21:38:05 <joltman[m]> Yes
21:38:17 <Dinjector> Are nicks with [m] bridged through matrix?
21:38:25 <jard[m]> <joltman[m] "In theory, the locked versions c"> Yeah, maybe hopefully tagged with "U.S. model" or something though? In Aus we usually get a tag like that since the mobile network bands are different between countries or whatever
21:38:28 <joltman[m]> Some Pixels have that birth defect, so to speak.
21:38:40 <Dinjector> Or rather, IRC channel is bridged to matrix, I see
21:38:44 <j0cye56[m]> Jokes aside, this is pretty annoying. So it's a gamble no matter how I dice it?
21:39:55 <joltman[m]> I'm not sure if there's an easy way to tell without looking at the setting screens.  I think you might be able to tell from the first two digits of the IMEI if the seller will give you that. Some are paranoid.  I think the first two digits may be "35" on the Verizon ones and "99" on the Google ones for the Pixel 3XL.
21:40:49 <joltman[m]> Look at reviews if you can't get the seller to send you a screen shot or otherwise assure you that "OEM Unlocking" is not grayed out.
21:41:16 <joltman[m]> Then, it's not a gamble
21:41:21 <joltman[m]> Unless they send a fake screen shot
21:41:39 <jard[m]> Or even just where the model is from
21:41:51 <joltman[m]> They all have the same model number
21:42:10 <emergencyfood[m]> Go to the store and enable OEM unlocking
21:42:14 <j0cye56[m]> aeonsolution: Oh and by the way I don't really like apple and their approach and would rather be using something that has the potential to change than go for apple, which may be "better" now but have a long-term cap due to their overall mentality.
21:43:27 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: Okay, then I have something to do tomorrow.
21:43:39 <joltman[m]> Some sellers might actually advertise "bootloader unlocked" or something like that. That would be helpful.
21:44:39 <joltman[m]> That "OEM Unlocking" setting is what allows you to unlock the bootloader, which is required to be able to load GrapheneOS.
21:45:24 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: Yeah, I think I'll set my sights on the 4xl variant, since it is about the same size as what I had until now. Or is the plain 4 version "better supported" - am I missing any details other than "bigger screen and more battery, guess I'll take that"?
21:45:36 <joltman[m]> If you can't get a good assurance from the seller, then next best thing is to check their return policy.
21:46:50 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: Okay, I will check it out and make myself a list.
21:47:00 <jard[m]> One other thing I'd say is, check reddit for complaints. I didn't realize until after I ran into the issue myself, the 3XL fingerprint scanner *sucks*. Apparently it doesn't affect the 3 or 3a
21:47:24 <j0cye56[m]> >https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-XL-Unlocked-Renewed/dp/B0824BR684
21:47:24 <j0cye56[m]> Goddamn import fees, this would have been it lol
21:47:33 <joltman[m]> If you're able to purchase in person, then you can check it personally. Just make sure you know how to get to it, obviously.
21:48:11 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: Okay. Looking it up right now.
21:50:11 <joltman[m]> I would avoid Amazon renewed phones.  Read through all of the reviews. Very difficult to be certain that they are really unlocked. Many of those refurbs were originally Verizon phones. You're just rolling the dice on those. But Amazon does have a good return policy, at least.
21:50:46 <joltman[m]> Also, there are lots of different sellers you could be dealing with on those, so some may be better than others.
21:50:54 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: Ah, thanks for that detail. It said unlocked. Oh well, the import isn't doable for be anyways.
21:51:37 <jard[m]> "Unlocked" likely means just not locked to any network, I'm not sure that guarantees that the bootloader can be unlocked
21:53:00 <joltman[m]> Most places, including "unlocked" really only mean that it's carrier unlocked, meaning that you can take it to any carrier and use it. That's true if you keep stock Android on it, but it's different from being able to unlock the bootloader if the "OEM Unlocking" is permanently turned off. There are various people on the internet that have allegedly found heavy handed ways to overcome this, but many more have bricked
21:53:00 <joltman[m]> their phones trying to unlock the locked bootloader problem.
21:53:02 <j0cye56[m]> jar.d: So there is another factor for interference if I want to install GrapheneOS
21:53:31 <j0cye56[m]> Oh...
21:53:43 <j0cye56[m]> That's a little disheartening. Sorry for assuming it was the same thing.
21:53:55 <joltman[m]> Yes, the GrapheneOS install instructions talk about avoiding carrier-specific versions of phones possibly causing problems, but doesn't really go into detail about that.
21:54:22 <jard[m]> Not really, 99% of phones would be networked unlocked, at least where I live.
21:54:22 <jard[m]> Bootloader is, I'm pretty sure, the only thing you have to worry about
21:54:57 <joltman[m]> Correct...most are going to be carrier/network unlocked
21:56:03 <j0cye56[m]> I found one that is network unlocked, it's an eBay listing from someone. There are details given on the deivce, it's a pixel 4 XL. Is there any S/N, Number or other tidbit that tells me, if it's bootloader locked?
21:56:10 <joltman[m]> Some of the Amazon reviews are from people complaining that their "unlocked" phones weren't even carrier unlocked as advertised.
21:56:42 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: Yeah, I think I'll steer clear of Amazon for this one.
21:57:18 <emergencyfood[m]> [j0cye56](https://matrix.to/#/@j0cye56:matrix.org) it is recommended to buy new if you can
21:57:39 <joltman[m]> I think there is a way to tell from the IMEI, but the problem is that most people, if they're smart, won't give you the IMEI in advance. If you have the IMEI, you might be able to call Google and they might tell you. A carrier might also be able to tell you if they understand what you're talking about.
21:57:58 <j0cye56[m]> emergency food: Yeah, I just wanted to buy used to be a litle less wasteful.
21:58:22 <joltman[m]> If you buy new from Google, then you shouldn't have any problem. Even new from other carriers might be ok (except Verizon).
21:58:54 <emergencyfood[m]> <j0cye56[m] "emergency food: Yeah, I just wan"> Wasteful how exactly?
21:59:02 <emergencyfood[m]> Pixel 4 isn't being manufactured anymore
21:59:05 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: https://www.channelreply.com/blog/view/ebay-buyer-wants-numbers-finance Ah yes, makes sense. How frustrating.
21:59:15 <emergencyfood[m]> You're buying something that's just sitting on a shelf
21:59:37 <j0cye56[m]> emergency food: It's OT, just so as to not directly feed the demand and instead buy used (muh environmentalism)
21:59:41 <joltman[m]> On eBay, you need to ask the seller if the bootloader can be unlocked or if they can show you a screen shot of that "OEM Unlocking" setting to ensure that it can be toggled and isn't grayed out,.
22:00:39 <jard[m]> Yeah, its tricky to see the impact it might have, but in my mind there's a difference between giving google money and buying second hand. You're still funding the pixel 5 for example
22:00:54 <joltman[m]> I tried to get just the first two digits of the IMEI on a 3XL and the seller wouldn't provide it.
22:01:20 <j0cye56[m]> Oof
22:01:46 <joltman[m]> You may find some ebay sellers who will advertise "unlocked bootloader" or something similar. Those are probably safe.
22:01:46 <j0cye56[m]> jar.d: Yeah, but even then it would create a certain tendency
22:02:22 <joltman[m]> Not sure if you can buy from www.swappa.com, but those sellers are more knowledgeable and often include proof right in their listings.
22:03:10 <jard[m]> Anyway, my opinion is that you shouldn't have any trouble in Europe. I agree with jolt, if you can do it in person or otherwise find out ahead of time, you might be saving yourself time and postage money for returns. This was not a fear I had when buying outside the U.S.
22:04:14 <joltman[m]> I just don't have any way to know how many used phones in Europe have issues with not being able to unlock bootloader.
22:04:27 <j0cye56[m]> jar.d: Okay, so the main problem is "just" the bootloader locking (I already see that most offers advertise carrier unlocked anyways)
22:04:56 <jard[m]> Yep. As far as I know.
22:04:58 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: Yeah. I guess I have to meet someone in person in the worst case then, right?
22:06:33 <emergencyfood[m]> <j0cye56[m] "emergency food: It's OT, just so"> Sounds like some righteous bs
22:06:43 <joltman[m]> Well, carrier unlocked (or just unlocked) IS important, but it's usually NOT a problem because most of the sellers are going to be selling unlocked phones and if they're selling a carrier-specific phone that isn't unlocked, they'll usually say which carrier it can be used on and that's usually fine if you're going to use the phone on that carrier. Occasionally, you'll get a phone being sold which the previous carrier
22:06:43 <joltman[m]> got left with an unpaid bill and they won't unlock it to another carrier until that bill gets paid.
22:06:55 <emergencyfood[m]> Regardless of the demand there is no production so the supply is nonexistent
22:07:02 <jard[m]> <emergencyfood[m] "Sounds like some righteous bs"> Bruh, ewaste is a problem, feel free to duck duck go it ;)
22:07:25 <emergencyfood[m]> <jard[m] "Bruh, ewaste is a problem, feel "> I'll google it
22:07:36 <jard[m]> :D
22:07:38 <j0cye56[m]> emergency food: Y-yeah, maybe you are right. I want to try at least.
22:07:38 <j0cye56[m]> >I'll google it
22:07:38 <j0cye56[m]> Devilish
22:09:13 <joltman[m]> When you buy chargers and blocks for the pixel phones, you have to do your homework if you care about fast charging. Most cables and blocks will be compatible as long as they're USB-C, but won't necessarily support fast charging.
22:09:57 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: The eBay offers I am seeing are with the original charger/cable - do they not support it?
22:10:12 <j0cye56[m]> Not that I really need it anyways, my phone charges over night.
22:11:07 <joltman[m]> If they come with original charger/cable and they aren't defective, they should support fast charging...at least with pixel 3/4/5. Not sure about 2.
22:11:28 <joltman[m]> A lot of refurbs don't come with original chargers, though.
22:11:46 <joltman[m]> Last one I bought off ebay came with a samsung charger
22:12:08 <joltman[m]> Often it's a generic
22:12:26 <j0cye56[m]> Is there any good tutorial on seeing if the Pixe 4 XL is bootloader locked or not? I could try to see if any seller wants to go into the settings and look at it for me - or is this unlikely and unreasonable?
22:13:25 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: It isn't that important to me anyways, even better would be no charger at all, then I could just use the chargers I already have, who cares if it't charged at 1:30 instead of 23:50
22:14:14 <j0cye56[m]> In the worst case - how do these heavy-handed approches to unlocking a locked bootloader look?
22:14:52 <joltman[m]> https://www.androidsage.com/2017/06/14/what-is-oem-and-how-to-enable-oem-unlock-on-any-android-device/
22:15:53 <joltman[m]> The heavy-handed methods involve using particular fastboot commands after connecting the phone via USB to your computer...killing certain processes and deleting critical keys and such.
22:17:01 <joltman[m]> It varies from seller to seller whether they will go through the trouble of checking the settings for you.
22:17:50 <joltman[m]> Usually only private sellers selling an individual phone, not a place that's selling tons of them, but not out of the question.
22:17:56 <j0cye56[m]> So basically as long as the OS version hasn't patched the method and I can follow the instructions on a rested saturday afternoon it should work, right?
22:18:41 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: With the eBay dudes that is what I could try. I might just have to send a message and ask.
22:19:37 <emergencyfood[m]> Just buy new by now dude
22:19:50 <j0cye56[m]> I know someone that was in the custom ROM scene for some time. I might be able to consult them for tips when things get a little critical if I have to unlock the phone after the fact.
22:20:18 <j0cye56[m]> emergency food: Would buying new alleviate the issue of having to be sure that the bootloader is locked or not?
22:20:40 <emergencyfood[m]> <j0cye56[m] "emergency food: Would buying new"> Obviously

22:21:08 <joltman[m]> basically, you don't want to see that
22:21:30 <jard[m]> Bootloader is some low level stuff, I wouldn't rely on anyone outside of google to know how to change it to be unlockable, ROM scene included
22:22:06 <j0cye56[m]> emergency food: Okay, then maybe an extra 180 is just the price to pay for certainty.
22:22:19 <joltman[m]> agree with jar.d
22:22:20 <joltman[m]> that's playing with fire
22:22:21 <jard[m]> And yeah, the one other thing you need to know if you're new to this, that dev menu isn't there by default, you have press some buttons to reveal it
22:22:32 <j0cye56[m]> jar.d: Okay, then this is a bullet I'll have to bite heh
22:23:00 <jard[m]> Fine by me, you're conscious of the small impact it makes at leasr
22:23:07 <jard[m]> * Fine by me, you're conscious of the small impact it makes at least
22:23:24 <joltman[m]> I saw more people accidentally bricking their phones than were actually successful overcoming the lock
22:23:36 <emergencyfood[m]> Okay now this is rather suspicious
22:24:54 <emergencyfood[m]> [louipcm](https://matrix.to/#/@louipc:matrix.org) [cn3m](https://matrix.to/#/@cn3m:privacytools.io) you might need to check these 3 accounts starting with J

22:28:29 <jard[m]> I'm sure that also extends to the hardware you can install it on, and the best way to buy it
22:28:29 <emergencyfood[m]> Or about how you could save a couple bucks off a phone
22:28:44 <emergencyfood[m]> * Not about how you can become environmentalists
22:28:54 <j0cye56[m]> emergency food: Yes, sorry, that wasn't really relevant. You're right.
22:29:23 <j0cye56[m]> Then I'll either buy the 4xl or go down to 3a xl period.
22:31:16 <joltman[m]> 4xl doesn't have fingerprint, if you care
22:32:18 <emergencyfood[m]> [joltman](https://matrix.to/#/@joltman:matrix.org) ideally it shouldn't matter
22:32:44 <emergencyfood[m]> Biometric manager uses the same methods for both fingerprint and face
22:32:52 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: It was incredibly convenient, but in principle fingerprint isn't that safe anyways or so I have heard.
22:33:01 <emergencyfood[m]> However most apps don't use biometric manager
22:33:38 <DC[m]> <j0cye56[m] "jar.d: Yeah, the jack is a sell,"> It's my understanding that if you want location privacy, turn off GPS, Bluetooth, and WIFI. Access points, etc., will see your phone pinging them as you travel around, which logs your presence. There are Bluetooth detectors on most major freeways now, logging you as you drive by.
22:34:36 <hypergenesis[m]> D~C: And also turn off cellular radio
22:35:28 <j0cye56[m]> So basically just switch off the phone and optionally put it in a wire net üòÖüòï
22:35:37 <hypergenesis[m]> Exactly
22:35:59 <j0cye56[m]> I wish it weren't so unrealistic to just do what you do on smartphone on a laptop.
22:36:03 <hypergenesis[m]> Location privacy is fundamentally incompatible with mobile phones
22:37:24 <j0cye56[m]> hypergenesis: But at least general privacy in other areas would increase with GrapheneOS oveer others
22:37:52 <joltman[m]> most phones (non-GrapheneOS) are still trackable when turned off. you have to take the battery out which most new phones don't even let you do any more.
22:38:09 <hypergenesis[m]> I agree that GrapheneOS is a good step if your threat model includes things like malicious app developers
22:38:20 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: Oh, well then there is a tangible benefit even in this hard-to-reconcile area
22:38:31 <hypergenesis[m]> However, it will do nothing to protect location tracking by your mobile provider and anyone they sell data to
22:38:48 <joltman[m]> Airplane mode in other OSes don't mean what people think they mean
22:39:15 <j0cye56[m]> hypergenesis: I guess if I really wanted to go all out I would have to live without a (smart)phone - there are no other options no matter how you slice it.
22:39:38 <hypergenesis[m]> That's right
22:39:45 <j0cye56[m]> joltman: I suspected that but never looked up, what remains active.
22:40:31 <joltman[m]> Not much way around the information your carrier necessarily has unless a competing carrier that guarantees privacy pops up, and even that isn't possible in most countries if you're worried about the gov't. US gov't can demand the data and demand that the carrier not tell you that they gave up the info.
22:41:04 <joltman[m]> Same with VPN services unless, but at least you can choose VPN services from other countries
22:42:48 <jard[m]> I was under the impression that leaving location on in grapheneos wasn't so bad. I thought apps needed to request a location before it actually pings a satellite. The reason that's bad on every other OS is that google play services requests that with some frequency
22:45:03 <j0cye56[m]> Well, maybe trying to live without a phone isn't that insane haha. Just kidding, it's too convenient.
22:47:35 <jard[m]> Ive seen a few discussions with the lead dev on reddit, the sentiment seems to be that in 2020, a phone is way more secure than a desktop can be
22:48:13 <jard[m]> Sensors are a problem, but in terms of app sandboxing and stuff its supposedly the way to go.
22:49:36 <jard[m]> Check out apps like greentooth that turn off your Bluetooth after an inactivity timeout. Don't make your phone a paperweight but turn off sensors when you don't require them
22:56:23 <timont[m]> With grapheneOS you can disable sensors
22:58:19 <jard[m]> Whachu mean
23:00:00 <timont[m]> In developer settings
23:01:53 * timont[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201018-010038.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/sDfwBhMwhHrEUpdcEEeEGtYK/Screenshot_20201018-010038.png >
23:02:13 <jard[m]> Any settings in particular you're referring to? I literally just meant mobile data/Bluetooth/gps
23:02:21 <jard[m]> Oh, like accelerometer?
23:02:55 <jard[m]> I was just talking about things that can be used to track you
23:03:12 <timont[m]> The camera, mic, barometer, compass
23:03:27 <timont[m]> Those sensors
23:04:39 <jard[m]> Ah, neat. I'll consider getting that toggle too. It'd be cool if we could get an iPhone style "camera is being used by X app" in graphene instead of having to turn them off
23:05:38 <timont[m]> There id a app for that as well :D
23:06:32 <timont[m]> There is*
23:07:20 <jard[m]> I saw one on fdroid I think but everyone was saying the implementation was scary.. I think it used draw over other apps instead of just a notification
23:07:33 <jard[m]> But if you've got one to recommend I'll take a look
23:07:50 <timont[m]> Is call "privacy indicator* on play store
23:08:19 <timont[m]> It doesnt use network permission
23:08:38 <j0cye56[m]> jar.d: What makes a mobile platform more secure than a laptop/dekstop?
23:08:55 <j0cye56[m]> The more narrowly defined hardware environment?
23:10:13 <jard[m]> You'd have to go find the discussions on reddit, but I think it came down to crypto hardware being more mature, and the sandbox-y nature of mobile from the ground up
23:11:04 <jard[m]> Desktop OS's are essentially "rooted" from the get go, since most users run as admin or allow apps to the second they ask
23:11:16 <j0cye56[m]> Why didn't "they" make use of better sandboxing on Desktop?
23:11:34 <j0cye56[m]> Nvm, now I know what you mean.
23:11:45 <jard[m]> They probably didn't think about that in the 70's
23:11:54 <j0cye56[m]> So basically a access-privilege model that isn't from the 70s hehe
23:11:58 <jard[m]> And everything's been built, layer on layer
23:12:04 <jard[m]> Yeah
23:12:11 <j0cye56[m]> Historic ballast then
23:12:23 <j0cye56[m]> *historical deadweight
23:12:55 <jard[m]> Yeah, and things are definitely moving forward, but two big companies leading the way for hardware and software has allowed mobile to be pretty secure
23:13:02 <j0cye56[m]> Is there any "clean" Dekstop OS out there that is usable? I am just running some binary-based linux distro.
23:13:08 <j0cye56[m]> NVM, that's OT. Sorry.
23:14:00 <jard[m]> Honestly I'm just repeating talking points really. I can't give you much more than this
23:14:48 <j0cye56[m]> jar.d: Yeah, I think it's hard for anyone to truly get a deeper grasp on this overall picture if they aren't a dev or very deeply involved.
23:15:13 <jard[m]> If you're using Linux on your desktop you're clearly self sufficient. I'd just keep reading stuff and investing your time into security projects like graphene
23:18:30 <j0cye56[m]> jar.d: It's an eternal battle haha
23:19:53 <j0cye56[m]> I will order the 3a XL tomorrow if I don't have another major change of heart Having read the roadmap and the general plans of the project makes me want to see more of it.
23:19:53 <j0cye56[m]> How much shorter will the 3a XL be supported compared to the 4 XL?
23:20:05 <j0cye56[m]> (guessing - no guarantees on the future of course)
23:21:50 <aeonsolution[m]> <j0cye56[m] "aeonsolution: Oh and by the way "> i didn't recommend apple and talking about personal inclinations towards companies defeats the purpose of modeling decisions based on security and privacy especially when it is based on personal feelings
23:22:32 <aeonsolution[m]> its also OT
23:24:50 <j0cye56[m]> aeonsolution:  Sorry. Yes, I head that Apple has some perks when it comes to privacy. I just like the idea of GrapheneOS and it being open, whereas this will not happen with Apple, that is what I was trying to refer to.
23:27:15 <tester2> hey guys, I've already flashed Graphene to my device. is there any way to verify the OS at this point, besides Auditor on another device?
23:40:12 <RiotElement[m]> I Don‚Äôt believe so

23:48:26 <j0cye56[m]> kopolee11: So GrapheneOS follows in very close sync to the dev cycle at Google? I mean, it said it on the website, but that's the way it is huh. I guess May VS August really isn't a big difference. I just thought there might be some factors internal to the GrapheneOS Project that might have shifted this end of support time for the 4 XL in a major way compared to the 3a XL, but there is nothing more than that shedule,
23:48:26 <j0cye56[m]> right?
23:48:26 <j0cye56[m]> So when Google drops it, it'll be running on fumes for the GrapheneOS project?

23:54:45 <j0cye56[m]> kopolee11: Okay, then my understanding from the faq was right, it's just good to make sure - I didn't want to mess up on my choice. All things considered, am I better off just getting the newest device? It's painful because it's pretty expensive to be honest (even if this concern is OT). Or is it a better strategy to buy the older phones more frequently rather than buy a new phone rarer in order to get support?
23:54:45 <j0cye56[m]> What has the lower annual cost?
23:54:45 <j0cye56[m]> Ah this isn't worth thinking about. I don't have any other choice.

23:57:35 <anon_reee> I'm using an Android device for some machine I have. I unfortunately have to use that. it has stock Android installed. I put tape over the cameras, but I haven't been able to mute the mic. any ideas?
23:57:45 <anon_reee> I tried putting bluetac and tape on the mic, but that didn't work
23:58:33 <anon_reee> it's just a tiny hole on the corner of the screen's bezel. I should be able to put something soundproof over it (but I don't know what works)
