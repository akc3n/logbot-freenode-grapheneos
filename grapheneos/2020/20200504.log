00:04:28 <strcat[m]> as I keep saying
00:04:42 <strcat[m]> I need the community to defend the project against James embedding himself in communities and contacting tons of people
00:04:50 <strcat[m]> and turning them against the actual open source project
00:05:06 <strcat[m]> he's out there EVERY DAY brainwashing people and spreading his fraudulent claims and misinformation
00:05:10 <strcat[m]> I need people to start acting and helping
00:05:47 <strcat[m]> people keep asking how they can help without being a developer but when I talk about the harm being done to us like this I don't see much support
00:08:07 <aeonsolution[m]> <BrokenCog "[*] All actions completed succes"> nice!
00:08:59 <BrokenCog> strcat[m]: have you applied to the EFF for a cease-desist help request?
00:09:26 <JTL> BrokenCog: EFF is American. Don't know how much work they can do with Canadian issues
00:09:46 <JTL> (Just something to keep in mind)
00:10:26 <BrokenCog> would depend on where the cloner project is located, but, I think the EFF has a Canadian version.
00:10:50 <JTL> Yeah. I don't think so though
00:13:16 <JTL> I know Cory Doctorow (of Boing Boing and such fame) is Canadian and I think he specifically went to the US to help the EFF becasue the Canadian equivalents were a patchwork of for-profit "marketing" institutions and underfunded academic projects
00:13:35 <JTL> lol
00:13:36 <JTL> > OpenMedia is a fucking joke. They use clickbaity headlines and over-dramaticize everything they do to get attention, and no one in the industry or government takes them seriously. Hopefully they'll straighten out soon, but they're the teenagers everyone cringes at for the moment.
00:13:46 <JTL> The only sensible thing I've read on /r/privacy
00:14:56 <BrokenCog> I don't know ... I have adblocker and their page looks normal to me :).
00:15:05 <JTL> What page?
00:15:05 <BrokenCog> I see they did save the .org tlp
00:15:09 <BrokenCog> https://openmedia.org/en/int
00:15:36 <JTL> I wouldn't call that their work though
00:15:43 <BrokenCog> no
00:15:52 <JTL> .ORG is US based
00:16:00 <BrokenCog> I meant to type "I see they say they did save ..." ...
00:16:08 <JTL> Yeah okay
00:16:51 <JTL> There was a lot of public pressure from California's attorney general, who could press ICANN with legal discovery and other action if they were to approve the sale
00:17:14 <JTL> And California has jurisdiction because ICANN operates there
00:18:07 <JTL> In any case I think that's evident of a larger problem. ICANN is almost accountable to no one and they're basically printing money at this point from sales of gTLD domains
00:18:10 <JTL> Anyway...
00:18:47 <JTL> (they make $0.18 from each registration and/or renewal of a gTLD domain, and for each "new TLD" they charge about $6000/year)
00:18:56 <JTL> Doesn't sound like much, but it adds up
00:20:41 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: I need the community to help
00:20:49 <strcat[m]> I have a lawyer and I don't need suggestions on what I should do
00:21:02 <strcat[m]> what I need is for the community to start countering James running his misinformation war against the project and myself
00:21:21 <strcat[m]> need people to start actively figuring out where he's spreading misinformation, who he's contacting and brainwashing / turning against the real project
00:21:35 <strcat[m]> and start countering his misinformation and giving people the facts
00:21:43 <strcat[m]> link them to information providing what he says is false, etc.
00:21:53 <strcat[m]> be actively figuring out where he's doing this and counter it
00:22:10 <strcat[m]> this is extremely important and the lack of help in this area takes away 50%+ of my time/energy that could go towards development
00:22:28 <strcat[m]> I literally spend HALF the time and energy working on the project as I would if people were providing substantial help with this non-technical issue
00:22:39 <BrokenCog> so, just to be clear, the problem isn't that he's using GrapheneOS for his project but that he's not giving credit?
00:22:43 <strcat[m]> I'm sure there is overlap between the GrapheneOS community and the Samourai Wallet community
00:22:46 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: no
00:23:38 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: the problem is that he stole hundreds of thousands of dollars of donations and revenue, took over the infrastructure for the project, threatened me and tried to coerce me into compromising the security of the users and handing over ownership/control of the project to him
00:23:53 <strcat[m]> he has spent 2 years spreading misinformation and slander about myself and GrapheneOS
00:24:11 <strcat[m]> he makes fraudulent and false claims and is fighting this war on a daily basis
00:24:26 <strcat[m]> and look, you folks don't seem to care much about my health and well being
00:24:33 <strcat[m]> or the project continuing / succeeding
00:24:46 <strcat[m]> because I've repeatedly asked for help on this and yet only a handful of people 4-5 at most
00:24:49 <strcat[m]> actually care enough to help
00:25:08 <strcat[m]> there's a huge community (it is not just the people here, and lots of people here come and go via IRC)
00:25:11 <BrokenCog> where did he steal money from?
00:25:13 <strcat[m]> and yet where is the support, aside from donations
00:25:34 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: he was trusted to intake donations for the open source project - the donations were not for him, he was delegated the task of dealing with it
00:25:35 <JTL> BrokenCog: He stole money from past project donations
00:25:59 <strcat[m]> and he stole all the Bitcoin donations, most of the Stripe donations and probably a small amount of the PayPal donations
00:26:09 <strcat[m]> I think we most of the PayPal donations from that time at least
00:26:13 <BrokenCog> so, he was acting as the "treasurer" for the project? and embezzeled funds?
00:26:20 <strcat[m]> since I had access to the account and was able to supervise it and withdraw
00:26:22 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: yes
00:26:33 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: but he did far more than that
00:26:38 <strcat[m]> he took over the infrastructure and the company and pushed me out
00:27:09 <strcat[m]> he's completely dishonest and when he didn't get his way trying to threaten / coerce me into giving him ownership/control and my signing keys
00:27:24 <strcat[m]> he tried to rewrite history and has gradually come up with a completely false account of what happened
00:27:33 <BrokenCog> and, you have a lawyer looking into this?
00:27:43 <strcat[m]> and he's gone as far as making fraudulent tax filings based on his retroactive editing of accounting and history
00:28:09 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: I have a lawyer and we are defending against James filing a bogus lawsuit against us, and we'll file counter-suits
00:28:23 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog:  I need the community to help counter his endless misinformation/slander
00:28:32 <strcat[m]> I keep asking for help and I'm not getting enough help
00:28:37 <BrokenCog> I mean, just to be clear - this is a "he said she said" problem, and not anything public community can address.
00:28:47 <strcat[m]> he's actively damaging GrapheneOS and causing harm to me on a daily basis
00:28:56 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: no it's not a "he said she said" at all and it obviously is something the community can address
00:29:13 <strcat[m]> what I'm saying is verifiable and a lot of people here were around for a long time and experienced this themselves
00:29:52 <strcat[m]> trying to portray this as you just did is not a neutral position but rather is support for fraud
00:30:15 <strcat[m]> you can't take an issue where there is a clear right and wrong and try to hold the high ground by staying neutral
00:30:25 <madaidan[m]> <BrokenCog "I mean, just to be clear - this "> There is plenty of evidence for what strcat is saying and the community can do tons to counter James
00:30:27 <strcat[m]> like supporting anti-vaxxers or BSV / Craig Wright
00:30:39 <strcat[m]> lots of this community has been around for all this
00:30:46 <strcat[m]> and I can provide lots of evidence as can other people
00:30:55 <strcat[m]> there were other people involved who can back this all up too
00:31:53 <strcat[m]> people who know James can back up the fact that he's completely dishonest and manipulative, with a background a drug dealer, etc. and few technical or business skills despite him presenting himself as a 'business person'
00:32:03 <strcat[m]> he has scammed a lot of people and they will attest to that
00:32:14 <strcat[m]> a lot of companies
00:32:26 <strcat[m]> including the ones he falsely presents as 'partners' based on having any past association with them
00:32:36 <BrokenCog> the problem isn't "social" the problem is "litgation" ... you aren't going to have any benefit from popular public opinion because if he as "tax filing with accounting" to show his claim then he is "right" not you.  I don't twit, but, if I encounter something He's spouting as his own I'll let you know.
00:32:40 <strcat[m]> just ask nickcalyx who had Calyx posted as a partner by Copperhead on their site despite them not being partners
00:32:47 <strcat[m]> and he's doing that with most of the others too
00:32:49 <strcat[m]> he's a scammer plain and simple
00:33:07 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: it is largely a social problem
00:33:15 <strcat[m]> if people were not still promoting his fraud and giving him money
00:33:20 <strcat[m]> there would be no lawsuit ongoing
00:33:31 <strcat[m]> he would have had to move on to other things
00:33:45 <strcat[m]> he would not still be maliciously / spitefully trying to cause whatever harm he can to myself and GrapheneOS
00:33:56 <BrokenCog> that's the nature of fraud.  hence why you need a lawyer.  not twitter.
00:34:03 <strcat[m]> he literally sent bogus legal threats to renlord in particular his university
00:34:09 <strcat[m]> to try to get renlord in trouble with his university
00:34:12 <strcat[m]> it's not just me that he attacks
00:34:27 <BrokenCog> Defamation is a thing.
00:34:36 <strcat[m]> is the community going to allow this guy to threaten, intimidate and screw over the developers of the project?
00:34:45 <strcat[m]> just sit back and let it happen without voicing anything about it?
00:34:56 <strcat[m]> people aren't going to counter his false claims about myself and the project, and other contributors?
00:35:06 <strcat[m]> he's in communities right now actively slandering us and causing harm
00:35:11 <strcat[m]> turning people against us, tricking people into falling for his scams
00:35:21 <BrokenCog> it's not up to "people".  it's up to you.
00:35:28 <BrokenCog> for instance ...
00:35:31 <nickcalyx[m]> If someone does something fraudulent on tax forms you can report that
00:35:32 <strcat[m]> no it is not up to me
00:35:45 <strcat[m]> it is up to the community to do their part, it is not MY JOB to counter his misinformation, I am a developer
00:35:52 <strcat[m]> it's up to the people who keep claiming they want to help but aren't developers
00:35:53 <strcat[m]> to help
00:36:02 <JTL> nickcalyx[m]: I think strcat is looking into that but if I know right he's having some problems with the CRA (which is Canada's IRS)
00:36:08 <JTL> :/
00:36:10 <BrokenCog> you don't need to counter his misinformation -- and even if the entire community did so it wouldn't stop his fraud.
00:36:22 <strcat[m]> yes we need to counter his misinformation
00:36:31 <strcat[m]> yes, we need to stop people being turned against GrapheneOS and spreading misinformation about it
00:36:32 <strcat[m]> this is important
00:36:44 <strcat[m]> if people are not going to support me I will work on something else where people don't treat me like shit
00:37:22 <strcat[m]> my work on GrapheneOS is conditional on people providing help with this
00:37:42 <strcat[m]> I'd currently say I spend 50% of my time dealing with this stuff that the community could be dealing with
00:37:45 <strcat[m]> instead of working on development
00:38:18 <strcat[m]> and I have increasingly less time and energy left for development dealing with stuff like the legal issues and his escalating misinformation war against us
00:39:16 <strcat[m]> there are some other people contributing to development but I hardly have time/energy to review / merge their code after all the baseline maintenance / development work for the project, I need people to start helping with these non-technical issues
00:39:29 <strcat[m]> this is essentially going to be another half day lost to this BS
00:39:35 <strcat[m]> and I probably won't be doing work on the project tomorrow
00:42:51 <strcat[m]> how am I supposed to have time left for development if I spend my time dealing with correcting what he pulled with the CRA, getting his false copyright filing revoked and filing lawsuits against Copperhead and James
00:43:09 <strcat[m]> guess I should just wrap up the project and focus on that since people will neither help significantly with the non-technical or technical aspects of the project
00:43:10 <nickcalyx[m]> nobody else is going to deal with CRA but you
00:43:20 <nickcalyx[m]> or the copyright
00:43:24 <strcat[m]> I am having my lawyer deal with that
00:43:24 <nickcalyx[m]> nobody has standing
00:43:34 <strcat[m]> other people do have legal standing against James
00:43:42 <strcat[m]> they had money stolen by him and were scammed by him
00:44:10 <strcat[m]> he has scammed many people and companies
00:44:26 <strcat[m]> most people seem totally willing to just write it off rather than going after him
00:44:38 <strcat[m]> but that means they gave him money he used to harm us
00:44:41 <strcat[m]> so they enabled what he's doing
00:45:31 <strcat[m]> any individuals / companies that have given Copperhead any money after ~July 2018 enabled the harm that has been done and is still being done, they should be trying to make things right
00:46:22 <strcat[m]> funding a sociopathic scam artist that has screwed over my life and this project
00:46:35 <strcat[m]> and promoting him
00:46:38 <strcat[m]> nothing okay about that
00:46:56 <strcat[m]> people have a responsibility to do their due diligence before endorsing / promoting something
00:48:18 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: and what I am asking for is for people to start countering his misinformation by reaching out the communities and people/companies he is scamming and brainwashing with his fraudulent claims / misinformation
00:48:28 <strcat[m]> why would it need to be me that does that
00:49:35 <strcat[m]> I want other people to deal with this so I don't have to do it
00:49:55 <strcat[m]> I don't see why it needs to be me going into these Twitter conversations, Telegram rooms, etc. and contacting all these people he has brainwashed
00:50:12 <strcat[m]> is that really how people want me to spend my time? because it is how I will spend my time if the community doesn't do it for me
00:50:28 <strcat[m]> I'm more concerned about addressing this problem than continuing development
00:50:51 <jcpicard32[m]> <strcat[m] "nickcalyx: and what I am asking "> Is there a list of companies somewhere to reach out to?
00:50:52 <strcat[m]> this is an ongoing issue that needs people to work on all fronts to deal with it
00:51:02 <jcpicard32[m]> I should have some free time coming up and I'd be happy to reach out to a few
00:51:23 <strcat[m]> jcpicard32: no I don't have a list, I don't know who is falling for their scams and continuing to support them
00:51:38 <strcat[m]> just look at this Samourai Wallet thing where it turns out he has spent 2 years in their channel brainwashing people with his misinformation
00:51:58 <strcat[m]> and he recently started doing something like giving certain people free copies of his ripoff of my work
00:52:06 <strcat[m]> so that they'd promote the project for him
00:52:14 <strcat[m]> and that seems to be working out well for him
00:52:25 <strcat[m]> people are so easily flattered and scammed by con artists like this
00:52:42 <strcat[m]> he chose them as special ambassadors to test and promote it so that's why they are doing it
00:53:01 <strcat[m]> and why they are reluctant to look into it and what they are doing
00:53:24 <strcat[m]> the reason this is happening is because people have not countered him being able to run free spreading misinformation for 2 years in a community with major overlap with this one
00:53:52 <jcpicard32[m]> Makes sense. I just pulled the Samourai website to take a look at that.
00:53:54 <strcat[m]> so he created a bubble of hostility towards this project and support for a ripoff of it stealing the code and fraudulently claiming ownership over it
00:54:29 <strcat[m]> but that only happened because I haven't gotten the help I keep requesting with this
00:54:38 <strcat[m]> now I'm spending my time dealing with weeks of people in this community spreading misinformation about GrapheneOS and promoting a ripoff of it by a scammer
00:54:58 <strcat[m]> this is the end result of James being allowed to wage his misinformation war without the GrapheneOS caring or intervening
00:55:09 <strcat[m]>  * this is the end result of James being allowed to wage his misinformation war without the GrapheneOS community caring or intervening
00:55:15 <jcpicard32[m]> I want to help with this. What's happening isn't right. I want to help this project and this is something I can do now
00:55:32 <strcat[m]> JollyRoger has put together some initial information on what happened
00:55:35 <strcat[m]> and archived links etc
00:55:38 <strcat[m]> a lot more can be put together
00:55:46 <TheJollyRoger> One moment.
00:55:56 <strcat[m]> I put a basic history section at https://grapheneos.org/#history in response to the escalating attacks from James
00:56:05 <strcat[m]> this is not just something that happened 2 years ago
00:56:14 <strcat[m]> there has been a recent massive escalation of his attacks on multiple fronts
00:56:23 <strcat[m]> he's getting far more aggressive, nasty and dishonest
00:56:26 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/tree/master/Twitter%20and%20Reddit jcpicard32[m]
00:56:33 <jcpicard32[m]> I'm not surprised
00:56:56 <strcat[m]> he has gradually come up with this bogus story and fraudulent claims about what happened through talking to accountants/lawyers and then adjusting his fake story about what happened to what they say should have happened for things to go his way
00:57:16 <strcat[m]> people in this community who have been around since before this can see that he's a completely dishonest scammer lying about all these things
00:57:32 <strcat[m]> people who are entirely new to this don't know what happened and are very easily brainwashed by a manipulative sociopath
00:57:51 <strcat[m]> so it is a serious problem for this community to not be countering what he's doing because he is very successful in brainwashing people
00:58:01 <jcpicard32[m]> I've only been around since January, but I've seen some of what he's written on Reddit. It's pretty disgusting
00:58:01 <strcat[m]> and then those people waste my time and energy
00:58:04 <strcat[m]> and cause harm
00:58:30 <strcat[m]> he's trying to build a community around his fraudulent claims
00:58:46 <strcat[m]> he finally found an actual group of people that he managed to brainwash
00:58:51 <strcat[m]> it's a first
01:00:30 <madaidan[m]> James is scarily manipulative
01:00:53 <aeonsolution[m]> is he just going into crypto circles or is there a pattern for groups he targets?
01:01:04 <jcpicard32[m]> I know someone who's a lot like him. Also a James. He's a real piece of shit. I want to fix this. I'm reading the site and JollyRoger's stuff rn
01:01:16 <madaidan[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "is he just going into crypto cir"> He goes for far more than crypto circles
01:01:48 <madaidan[m]> I had a run in with him recently in the Whonix group for example
01:04:16 <strcat[m]> he is also contacting companies, organizations, open source projects and individuals
01:04:31 <strcat[m]> you need to assume that he has contacting any relevant projects or anyone he sees supporting us or talking about relevant things
01:04:39 <strcat[m]>  * you need to assume that he has been contacting any relevant projects or anyone he sees supporting us or talking about relevant things
01:05:02 <strcat[m]> I need the community to proactively counter his misinformation campaign and I mean by reaching out to people and helping to inform them and set them on the right track
01:05:33 <strcat[m]> this is a seriously bad situation where he has successfully brainwashed a little chat channel bubble around a related open source project
01:05:47 <strcat[m]> people need to be on the lookout for this and work to counter it
01:05:57 <strcat[m]> if he's peddling lies in an open source project's community like that
01:06:14 <strcat[m]> we need to have people in the overlap between our communities correcting it and stopping him from getting away with it
01:06:31 <strcat[m]> can't have him peddling misinformation and fraudulent claims to cause harm to us without it being contested
01:06:34 <strcat[m]> it's massively damaging
01:06:37 <jcpicard32[m]> Completely agree. Would it be helpful if I drafted a letter tonight to go to one of them?
01:06:56 <strcat[m]> instead of collaboration with this community we now have them pushing misinformation about us they heard from him
01:07:04 <strcat[m]> and people repeat what they've heard about things like that
01:07:12 <strcat[m]> they may not realize it was the scammer himself who told them those things
01:07:40 <strcat[m]> this is not the only community where he is doing this
01:07:54 <strcat[m]> he was banned from some of them but he's largely successful in causing harm like this
01:08:18 <strcat[m]> don't think people realize how manipulative and downright fucking evil he is
01:08:19 <strcat[m]> it is not just online
01:08:26 <analog[m]> strcat Are you Steve Tech Jesus on Telegram that's debunking James' FUD?
01:08:46 <strcat[m]> https://renlord.com/posts/2020-03-25-copperheados-legal-threat/
01:08:48 <strcat[m]> analog: no
01:08:52 <strcat[m]> I don't use Telegram
01:09:05 <strcat[m]> look at what they did to renlord
01:09:14 <strcat[m]> volunteer contributor to an open source project
01:09:26 <strcat[m]> and they try to intimidate him and get him in trouble with his university based on totally bogus claims
01:09:35 <strcat[m]> and scary legal letterhead
01:09:49 <strcat[m]> do people not think it's a problem for contributors to GrapheneOS to be threatened / intimidated?
01:10:18 <strcat[m]> it's not just me that James is waging a war against
01:10:22 <jcpicard32[m]> It absolutely is. I'm appalled and frankly disapointed that he's been able to do as much as he has.
01:10:30 <strcat[m]> it's primarily me but he is waging a war against the whole community / project
01:10:46 <strcat[m]> he stole most of the donations people made pre-June-2018 to support the project
01:11:14 <strcat[m]> people are always telling me I should do X via legal means or whatever but no one tried to fight that even though it was their money he stole
01:11:49 <jcpicard32[m]> People just don't like to take accountability for themselves. It's a sad fact I've come to realize during my time in college.
01:12:38 <strcat[m]> not going to get done the work I wanted to get done today including reviewing and merging a pair of pull requests adding a new feature before the release tomorrow
01:12:48 <strcat[m]> and I won't have the energy to do tomorrow's release properly
01:12:54 <TheJollyRoger> Fuck.
01:13:09 <strcat[m]> going to be taking a break and doing something else for now
01:13:17 <jcpicard32[m]> Well shit. Anything I can do to immediately help?
01:13:29 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: yeah... take care of yourself man.
01:13:37 <strcat[m]> well we've identified why this is happening with the Samourai Wallet community
01:13:44 <strcat[m]> so we know James has been spreading misinformation there for 2 years
01:13:49 <madaidan[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "Well shit. Anything I can do to "> Join https://t.me/SamouraiWallet and shit on James with me
01:14:10 <jcpicard32[m]> I'd be happy to.
01:14:20 <strcat[m]> right now
01:14:27 <strcat[m]> I really want to figure out where else he has been doing this
01:14:35 <strcat[m]> who else has he successfully scammed / brainwashed
01:14:43 <jcpicard32[m]> Speaking of donations, I'm just made a donation to this amazing project. Thank you so much for all your hard work :)
01:14:58 <jcpicard32[m]> But yeah, I'm happy to help with looking into things for this
01:15:10 <jcpicard32[m]> I've come to care a lot about this project in the last couple months and I want ti to succeed
01:15:11 <strcat[m]> he did the same thing with the tor project
01:15:22 <strcat[m]> embeds himself in the community
01:15:24 <strcat[m]> brainwashes people
01:15:35 <strcat[m]> then they spread misinformation and get into a conflict with me
01:15:54 <strcat[m]> he's hard at work screwing us over long-term
01:16:15 <strcat[m]> even once his scams fall apart, if ever
01:17:00 <strcat[m]> he could end up in jail for all the illegal shit he has been a part of like his associations with organized crime and business deals with shady as hell companies serving criminals
01:17:04 <strcat[m]> but that won't undo all this damage
01:17:15 <strcat[m]> it is a serious problem that he's still out there actively causing new damage
01:17:39 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
01:17:40 <strcat[m]> the best case scenario would be that he immediately stops and turns over everything he stole to me, recants his lies / fraud and so on but obviously that's not going to happen
01:17:45 <jcpicard32[m]> Maybe not, but if he gets what's coming to him and goes to jail it should help prevent future damage, no?
01:17:46 <strcat[m]> and even if it did happen it's not like it would undo all the damage
01:17:53 <jcpicard32[m]> He's a snake. I'm going to treat him like one
01:17:57 <strcat[m]> jcpicard32: the damage spirals out of control
01:17:58 <jcpicard32[m]> That's how I deal with his kind
01:18:05 <jcpicard32[m]> ah
01:18:05 <strcat[m]> he creates enemies for us
01:18:22 <strcat[m]> leads to all these new conflicts that are hard to keep track of
01:18:41 <strcat[m]> it's hard having someone super determined to cause harm to you largely by turning people against you that you've never talked to
01:18:48 <strcat[m]> by spreading lies about you
01:19:01 <strcat[m]> seriously if you go and read what he writes and how he writes
01:19:10 <strcat[m]> you will see how manipulative and dishonest he is
01:19:17 <strcat[m]> look at videos of him talking / promoting stuff
01:19:24 <strcat[m]> super obvious what he is
01:19:33 <strcat[m]> but most people seem to fall for it super easily
01:19:45 <strcat[m]> he can get away with nearly anything
01:19:46 <strcat[m]> it works
01:20:03 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "seriously if you go and read wha"> He pretends to be all friendly
01:20:06 <madaidan[m]> It's creepy
01:20:18 <strcat[m]> yeah he prides himself on how manipulative he is
01:20:21 <strcat[m]> he used to brag about it
01:20:32 <BrokenCog> how did you start working with him?
01:20:34 <strcat[m]> he's into pickup artist stuff
01:20:43 <strcat[m]> and similar manipulative / fucked up things
01:20:55 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: he used to run Toronto Crypto
01:21:07 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: so I met Dan McGrady and him through that
01:21:28 <strcat[m]> and we ended up workign together and eventually founding the company together (the 3 of us)
01:21:38 <strcat[m]> I primarily worked with Dan McGrady who knew James previously, not James directly
01:21:46 <strcat[m]> so I was insulated from him and didn't get to know him
01:21:56 <strcat[m]> until after Dan McGrady left (largely due to his conflicts with James)
01:22:07 <strcat[m]> and then I was stuck in an existing setup with existing users with James
01:22:35 <strcat[m]> he tricked me into letting him be the only director - I still own 50% of the shares of Copperhead by the way
01:22:35 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh.
01:22:46 <strcat[m]> it was supposed to be divided 3 ways
01:22:51 <strcat[m]> but Dan McGrady wasn't involved anymore
01:22:57 <jcpicard32[m]> Yikes
01:22:59 <strcat[m]> this NEVER would have happened if it hadn't ended up just being myself and James
01:23:15 <strcat[m]> Dan McGrady believed in it being open source and is a decent person
01:23:30 <strcat[m]> ended up realizing James is a manipulative sociopath long before things fell apart
01:24:17 <strcat[m]> just imagine how successful the project could have been with a competent business person who wanted the best for the project instead of looking out for themselves and betraying it
01:24:21 <strcat[m]> without all this damage done
01:24:30 <strcat[m]> without throwing away all those partnerships and screwing them all as he does
01:24:53 <strcat[m]> think about the position it could be in now with all that money / resources / collaboration and partners
01:25:03 <strcat[m]> he screwed it all over
01:25:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah....
01:25:13 <strcat[m]> spent years manipulating me and lying to me
01:25:21 <strcat[m]> and then goes back and pretends he never agreed to everything he agreed to
01:25:26 <JTL> Got it
01:25:30 <strcat[m]> explicitly agreed with me that I owned / controlled the open source project
01:25:36 <strcat[m]> over and over again
01:25:46 <strcat[m]> now claims otherwise because the truth is inconvenient
01:26:00 <strcat[m]> he's completely and thoroughly dishonest to an UNBELIEVABLE extent
01:26:24 <status_active[m]> Guys, can anyone confirm if  GPS on the Pixel 2 XL works on GrapheneOS?. OsmAnd is not able to pick any GPS activity
01:26:31 <strcat[m]> yes it does
01:26:35 <strcat[m]> it's only GPS atm
01:26:37 <jcpicard32[m]> It should work just fine
01:26:42 <jcpicard32[m]> Do you have location on?
01:26:51 <strcat[m]> it doesn't offer network-based location so you actually need to get a GPS lock
01:26:52 <strcat[m]> go outside
01:27:05 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "go outside"> But lockdown :(
01:27:11 <renlord[m]> Need clear line of sight to GPS satellites.
01:27:20 <renlord[m]> Use satstat to gauge coverage.

01:27:40 <renlord[m]> Won't work in CBD
01:27:47 <strcat[m]> it starts working better once it had an initial lock during that boot
01:27:48 <renlord[m]> Fkin skyscrapers.
01:27:49 <strcat[m]> it caches stuff
01:28:06 <strcat[m]> the network based location stuff wouldn't make the actual GPS work any better btw
01:28:34 <strcat[m]> I guess we probably don't use the supl crap aside from emergency calls so
01:28:35 <strcat[m]> that could be part of it
01:28:53 <strcat[m]> we do have the GPS almanacs etc.
01:29:28 <renlord[m]> If almanacs are kept up to date they work better
01:29:41 <strcat[m]> it downloads them
01:29:57 <renlord[m]> But they do go stale quite quickly
01:31:47 <status_inactive[> guys, have anyone experienced issues with the GPS using OsmAnd?. It's not getting my location. I'm on Pixel 2XL
01:32:26 <jcpicard32[m]> Try going outside. It will work much better
01:33:06 <strcat[m]> it needs to get an initial lock
01:33:17 <strcat[m]> which generally requires being outside / having a clear view of the sky
01:33:18 <TheJollyRoger> status_inactive[: a number of people have experienced the issue with GPS. Can you get to a large, open space where you'll have satellites overhead, wait a few minutes out there, and reboot your phone and wait for it to calibrate?
01:33:25 <strcat[m]> unless you happen to be next to a window or something in a clear area
01:33:33 <strcat[m]> don't need to reboot really
01:33:41 <strcat[m]> there are no known issues with GPS aside from it being GPS

01:34:32 <renlord> dont know about other cities, but in melbourne at least, its impossible to use GPS
01:34:45 <strcat[m]> I barely even get mobile access
01:34:48 <strcat[m]> I can barely receive a text
01:35:09 <strcat[m]> I have to go onto the patio to even make a traditional phone call without it cutting out
01:35:25 <strcat[m]> on the positive side my phone doesn't even ring most of the time I just eventually get a missed call message
01:35:30 <strcat[m]> and I turned off voicemail

01:43:44 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know, honestly.
01:43:57 <TheJollyRoger> Cost of living in Toronto is sky-high.
01:44:30 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "what does that even mean?"> "The world's most livable cities is an informal name given to any list of cities as they rank on an annual survey of living conditions. In addition to providing clean water, clean air, adequate food and shelter, a ‘livable’ city must also generate a sense of community and offer hospitable settings for all, especially young people, to develop social skills, a sense of autonom

01:45:02 <status_inactive[> <TheJollyRoger "Cost of living in Toronto is sky"> I believe even worst than Vancouver
01:45:39 <strcat[m]> depends on how you define city
01:45:51 <strcat[m]> cost of living in downtown / core Toronto is immensely high due to rent
01:46:10 <strcat[m]> and buying a house is not something most people can do in the actual city
01:46:49 <strcat[m]> cause you're talking about 1.6m for a 1000 square foot semi-detached 2 floor home

02:02:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <madaidan[m] "It's a security researcher https"> So, this evaluation is a bit flawed, IMO. #1, your target market isn't DEFCON attendees who, once they hear "GrapheneOS", they can build and flash themselves. Target market is people who want security, but don't know what Firefox is (or why they shouldn't use it, lol)
02:04:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It also takes into account giving subsidised devices to people in need right out of the gate, as per the writeup. A lofty goal, but, a lovely one. But, that's the sort of thing a stable, active, up and running operation can do - not a brand-new endeavor. Too altruistic, there - something I never thought I'd type/say.
02:04:58 <aeonsolution[m]> Read the FAQ at the bottom of the post.
02:06:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> "After the recent spike in visibility and interest, I am in talks with people who may have larger markets and potentially be able to help creating a business or non-profit.
02:06:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I very much hope this works."
02:06:28 <aeonsolution[m]> Also on that note, strcat wants to focus on the misinformation campaign carried out against the project too.
02:06:49 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Article date reads September of last year. Would be interested what he's up to/how someone can get involved.
02:07:07 <aeonsolution[m]> You can reach him on Twitter if you'd like.
02:07:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <aeonsolution[m] "Also on that note, strcat wants "> Yes, I asked a few very pointed questions regarding that above, and he doesn't seem to want to engage on that topic anymore tonight.
02:08:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Which may or may not have something to do with the fucking IRC bridge not actually showing multi-line messages, just showing a bullshit link that shows the message in browser if clicked.
02:17:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> (That is still the case, right, IRC-friends?)
02:24:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
02:24:40 <TheJollyRoger> I have to "curl $LINK | cat" to see it.
02:27:25 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Assuming images are the exact same?
02:28:35 <TheJollyRoger> yeah if you send an image I need to wget or curl it to /tmp/something and open it.
02:33:25 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Obviously a sensitive topic, and one I never thought I'd be asking: any particular reason y'all are holding out on IRC? A little tough to collaborate when you can't reply to a message from the past with context, or send a multi-line thought - or images showing social media posts that we as the community are being tasked with responding to to increase available dev time.
02:34:30 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderPr: Largely it's been quality of service issues with Matrix.
02:34:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Love simplicity, am a long-time IRC user, but...doesn't seem to be adequate to handle this communities goals. Destroys the flow of conversation more than it enables it.
02:35:29 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <TheJollyRoger "Danny@WorkOrderPro: Largely it's"> So, let's put up a homeserver (www.modular.im?) and get off of the Matrix.org homeserver. It's not Matrix that's the issue - it's their free sample server that's getting its ass kicked daily, hahaha
02:36:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Easy to bridge in this room, to pull the stragglers over.
02:36:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> This is the only room I still use my Matrix.org account, I've since moved onto the dozens of other free servers out htere, many of which have higher availability than Matrix.org.
02:52:35 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If anyone would like a list, and can't find it, just ask!
02:53:26 <hitchhooker[m]> what's advantage of modular over running synapse?
02:53:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Modular = Matrix.org devs offering paid homeservers, for basing your rooms/accounts
02:54:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> However, in addition to that, there are many FREE to the community options (as in, free registration, just like Matrix.org) that are all perfectly compatible with each other (the point of Matrix)
02:55:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> There are some people in this room right now not on @user:matrix.org accounts.
02:55:20 <hitchhooker[m]> matrix-docker-ansible-deploy seems pretty cool
02:56:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Indeed - but we're just looking for non-latent, reliable, more-than-single-line and able to send images, communication - not further server-administration tasks for our short list of devs
02:58:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "Good morning anupritaisno1! Can "> With what?
02:59:56 <aeonsolution[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "With what?"> Hey! It was an issue I had with the downloading the vendor files. I got it resolved. Thanks for asking.
03:00:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "Hey! It was an issue I had with "> You can extract them off a running device
03:02:48 <JTL> DannyWorkOrderPr: I don't see creating another HS as solving things in the short term
03:03:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> That's what I just said above.
03:03:13 <JTL> Oh okay
03:03:19 <JTL> (Was just catching up on scrollback after eating)
03:03:22 <DannyWorkOrderPr> We don't have to - we just need to create a room on another homeserver that isn't dogshit
03:04:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> So the <5% of people using this room via IRC feel comfortable using Matrix, without wondering if their messages are being sent/if their receiving messages will be delayed by minutes/hours.
03:04:27 <JTL> I still don't see that as helping things because of the matrix.org bridge, and the fact that the matrix.org HS likes to keel over, meaning when it goes down it's kind of a moot point because it still affects me (and others) using matrix.org
03:05:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> That would be the point where you would move youself to tchns.de, or another Matrix homeserver that isn't used by every single person just trying out Matrix, because it's a sample server
03:05:30 <JTL> Would be easier if Riot (or other clients) had proper multiaccount support
03:05:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> The Matrix team doesn't want to admit it, but I wouldn't consider it reliable for shit...it's just a nice-to-have free sample to PoC the technology.
03:05:59 <JTL> Unfortuantly it seems the Riot/Matrix team is busy bailing things out and trying to sort their own issues before working on functionality such as this
03:06:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <JTL "Unfortuantly it seems the Riot/M"> Web-browser = every tab is able to run another account
03:06:50 <JTL> That's true, but still not ideal
03:07:01 <JTL> I'm aware though
03:07:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Multiple desktop clients/phone clients offer the same, if that's really what you require. But again, just having a single account on a server that's not getting kicked in the cock every single hour would solve a lot of issues haha
03:07:15 <JTL> I bet
03:07:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> There's, what, 4 Matrix clients on F-Droid alone?
03:07:29 <JTL> I'm just speaking of desktop clients here
03:07:39 <JTL> I'd run my own HS too, but I have my own infrastructure issues
03:07:42 <JTL> :p
03:08:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> You don't have to - there are like 50+ free ones, just like matrix.org, that you can sign up for, and use as a drop-in replacement.
03:08:35 <JTL> Right
03:10:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> https://matrix.org/clients Desktop section here lists 7 clients.
03:11:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> At least one is MacOS only, but, yeah. Just trying to spread the word/lower the friction for getting us collaborating on the important shit mentioned in this room above (organizing and backing up Daniel/GrapheneOS in the face of disinformation/people promoting Graphene out of ignorance or malice)
03:12:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> There are also multiple command line matrix clients. You can have as many accounts on one machine as you can shake a stick at =]
03:18:57 <strcat[m]> or just use IRC
03:18:58 <strcat[m]> it works
03:19:08 <strcat[m]> this doesn't lol
03:19:20 <strcat[m]> the channel is ultimately an IRC channel rather than a Matrix channel
03:19:36 <JTL> ^
03:19:42 <strcat[m]> I kinda wish I used oftc instead of freenode but not going to be changed at this point
03:19:43 <JTL> That's what I was trying to hint at
03:19:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Including the Matrix users is great, but if they can't be heard if they're replying to messages, or sending images, then...
03:20:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It's been admitted by the IRC users here that they don't click the links to read "long" (lol) messages.
03:21:22 <JTL> THe bridge should solve some of that prolbem by wrapping long lines
03:21:29 * JTL fails under "bad design"
03:21:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> well - it doesn't.
03:21:40 <JTL> yeah
03:21:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> And it's been that way for some time.
03:22:01 <JTL> Someone should go poke whoever is responsible for the matrix irc bridge with a stick
03:22:13 <JTL> Don't need to state the obvious to me
03:22:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> IRC is a lovely technology, especially for socialization, but for asynchronous community action (aka, responding to messages older than a few minutes, when there's constantly messages in a channel), it falls flat.
03:22:26 <JTL> I don't disagree
03:26:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> So - what's more important? Holding onto IRC, or enabling this community to collaborate? That's what I'm trying to hint at, haha
03:31:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "this doesn't lol"> What issues are you personally experiencing, strcat? Any that wouldn't be resolved by using an account on a different, free-to-register homeserver?
03:31:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Fuck, I did it again....nonreply version: What issues are you personally experiencing, strcat? Any that wouldn't be resolved by using an account on a different, free-to-register homeserver?
03:42:35 <DannyWorkOrderPr> JTL: > Someone should go poke whoever is responsible for the matrix irc bridge with a stick. this has been an issue since 2016. https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/56#issuecomment-233281832
03:42:47 <JTL> Can't say I'm surprised
03:42:50 <JTL> My comment was more in jest
03:46:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > I'm not following your thought pattern here. Bridging will still work, just large (for whatever definition of large) messages will be uploaded into Matrix first (effectively as a .txt file) and then that URL will be sent instead - much like how we currently do for images. What am I missing here?
03:47:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> and then the Closed the issue. What a ridiculously frustrating situation.
03:51:35 <DannyWorkOrderPr> My second-to-last message probably got turned into a link, too, huh? puts palm through forehead
04:30:47 <hitchhooker[m]> what are you talkign about, there is merge where they made autopastebin for over 3 lines
04:31:10 <hitchhooker[m]> or is it jus terrible?
04:35:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It has been discussed in here before =[
04:35:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Those 9 or 10 IRC users (some being the most important to the project) don't regularly click those links
04:37:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> So either you skip the Reply feature (which adds context of what you're replying to)
04:37:27 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Or you risk your message falling on deaf ears, as it were
04:38:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Also, it's pretty tough to quote docs, code, or social media posts, if you don't get more than 3 lines
04:38:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It's also wildly unclear what constitues another line. How many characters is a line? Is it chosen by line-breaks?
07:52:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: pinged ya =]

07:58:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Currently feeling stupid from this as we speak! hahaha
07:59:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <dazinism "Theres a community wiki up"> Fucking excellent, mate - very exciting.
08:00:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I will elaborate/add this to the wiki itself tomorrow (assuming I can figure it out after some sleep), but my vote is for DokuWiki due to its ability to pull in from any git source - which means we can have PRs on GitHub, or wherever Daniel wants to work on the project in the future, with little friction!
08:00:43 <DannyWorkOrderPr> ttfn, all =]
08:19:15 <renlord> the new history and copyright section on https://grapheneos.org does clear things up alot
08:19:19 <renlord> cheers for writing that up
10:23:17 <nscnt> vendor/android-prepare-vendor/execute-all.sh -d DEVICE -b BUILD_ID -o vendor/android-prepare-vendor
10:23:27 <nscnt> What are examples for DEVICE and BUILD_ID?
10:24:36 <nscnt> My target is the Pixel 3a
11:12:29 <nscnt> DEVICE seems to be the name in the brackets like at https://source.android.com/setup/build/building-kernels#downloading
11:13:27 <nscnt> BUILD_ID seems to be the 'Build' under https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers#source-code-tags-and-builds (or well, in the Version of the GrapheneOS release, I guess)
11:28:19 <nscnt> I used DEVICE=sargo BUILD_ID=QQ2A.200405.005
11:28:39 <nscnt> for Pixel 3a. Not sure if that's correct
11:29:56 <nscnt> I'm running into an error
11:29:58 <nscnt> ImportError: No module named google.protobuf
11:30:05 <nscnt> [-] OTA data extract failed
11:33:44 <seaclown> Caught up on all the messages, I will work on monitoring/refuting the communities I am currently following, however I have been disconnected for the last number of years (fucking kids...), so just an observer/learning the new scene hangouts
11:34:07 <seaclown> No issues speaking up now that I have greater context
12:54:44 <cdesai> strcat: I figured out the issue, it's https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/update_engine/+/refs/tags/android-10.0.0_r33/libcurl_http_fetcher.cc#301
12:55:02 <cdesai> specifically, CURLOPT_CAPATH - our Let's Encrypt certs don't verify against that root
12:55:58 <strcat[m]> try serving DST cross-signed chain?
12:56:07 <strcat[m]> or does that not work
12:57:16 <cdesai> releases.grapheneos.org doesn't verify either
12:59:16 <cdesai> its's set for update_engine IsOfficialBuild() which is ro.secure == 1
12:59:48 <cdesai> i.e. !eng
12:59:51 <aeonsolution[m]> nscnt: google.protobuf is module in python that needs to be installed, if you send me a message I'll try to help you out
13:01:16 <strcat[m]> cdesai: probably can't help atm really don't feel well
13:01:18 <strcat[m]> sorry
13:01:56 <strcat[m]> dunno how I'll get done the release today
13:02:00 <cdesai> strcat: np, just wanted to let you know I figured it out. Hope you feel better
13:02:22 <strcat[m]> could really use more help than usual today
13:02:42 <madaidan[m]> Does the Pixel 4 have any security/privacy advantages over the Pixel 3?
13:02:54 <cdesai> some people here were volunteering to run cts, perhaps they could help test the OTAs?
13:04:26 <strcat> madaidan[m]: newer LTS branch for the kernel
13:04:31 <strcat> probably other advantages
13:04:39 <strcat> newer LTS branch is 'kinda' an advantage
13:04:50 <strcat> newer kernels get more backported patches and maintenance
13:04:54 <strcat> but have more attack surface
13:05:19 <strcat> so I can't promise it's an advantage but it *feels* good
13:05:33 <strcat> linux has a downwards security trajectory
13:05:35 <strcat> not upwards
13:05:56 <strcat> each release is less secure, lots of new attack surface / complexity, and some minor hardening not making up for it
13:06:14 <strcat> also I don't have much faith in the hardening in this context especially with the details of most of it
13:06:21 <strcat> it doesn't work the same way in the kernel context
13:09:58 <madaidan[m]> It doesn't seem very important then. Just a possible slight advantage.
13:10:27 <madaidan[m]> I couldn't find any info on the Pixel 4's security elsewhere other than the better face unlock stuff.
13:29:19 <minoas[m]> would macos be a better choice than linux regarding security and privacy? i remember reading some time ago that it randomly uploads user files to icloud to scan for malware.
13:30:40 <madaidan[m]> <minoas[m] "would macos be a better choice t"> Yes, MacOS is far better.
13:30:53 <madaidan[m]> Linux has no real security model. It's a massive mess.
13:31:25 <madaidan[m]> MacOS puts more work into sandboxing, verified boot etc.
13:35:15 <joshman[m]> Better for security. Privacy is questionable. Linux might be better bet
13:36:29 <madaidan[m]> <joshman[m] "Better for security. Privacy is "> Privacy requires security. What tracking is there in MacOS that cannot be disabled?
13:36:34 <joshman[m]> This group is so versatile. Thanks guys. I installed Krita and it definitely feels better than Gimp
13:37:07 <joshman[m]> <madaidan[m] "Privacy requires security. What "> I don't know for sure. Do you?
13:37:43 <madaidan[m]> <joshman[m] "I don't know for sure. Do you?"> I've yet to see any evidence of tracking.

15:51:34 <cx2[m]> * Anyone using weeMatrix? Running into some hangups getting going on fedora
16:25:47 <BrokenCog> I'm at the "Browser and Webview" section in the build, it says to use 'gclient -r $VERSION' ... with VERSION the latests Android release - should that be the "8.0" release number or the build number? or something else?
16:34:35 <BrokenCog> and, how long does this step take?  I started the gclient command roughly 45 minutes ago and it hasn't emitted any output nor finished, is that normal??
16:58:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> madaidan.: I dunno how you deal with the Techlore room. Fucking hell, it feels like a Facebook thread! Disagreements are one thing, even heated, but an unwillingness to do a little reading? No wonder the devs here hate Matrix - some of the rooms are pretty gross.
16:59:04 <madaidan[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "madaidan.: I dunno how you deal "> Techlore was usually good but it got far worse even since Shipp joined.
16:59:08 <madaidan[m]> ever*

17:21:42 <nscnt> I was in the Techlore Matrix room once. There was just nothing interesting there. Just superficial conversation.
17:23:28 <nscnt> Even though I don't understand everything, the GrapheneOS channel sets a high bar with the depth of the technical discussions. E-mail as a good example.
17:24:39 <nscnt> Not always deep for sure, but way way better

17:44:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Shit, I did it again. nscnt: ^We are the 99%
17:45:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I think at last count I saw 9 IRC users in the room. There's 500+ here total.....
17:45:23 <nscnt> DannyWorkOrderPr: I get pinged by your 'answer' thing
17:45:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But does it show the whole message? Or abridge it because too many lines?
17:46:01 <nscnt> It's just the first few words
17:46:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> that's been a huge issue here. At least, it has for me, because I'm too fuckin verbose for the bridge, aha
17:47:14 <nscnt> You're called DannyWorkOrderPr here lol. I think that's cut, right?
17:47:48 <nscnt> I wasn't aware you're using Matrix, because your [m] is cut too
17:48:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Can't tell if it auto completes via bridge, but it's "Danny@WorkOrderPro", no quotes obviously
17:48:21 <nscnt> DannyWorkOrderPr: *autocomplete*
17:48:22 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Here, you have a nifty little # badge for IRC!
17:48:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> No contstraints
17:48:32 <nscnt> thank you
17:48:40 <nscnt> feeling special
17:49:55 <seaclown> lol, stopped using matrix as the bridge had too much lag.
17:50:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> The bridge did not have lag. The Matrix.org server, where the room the bridge is bridging, had lag.
17:50:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Not sure how easy it is to search the logs on your end, but, I spouted off about this yesterday.
17:51:04 <nscnt> DannyWorkOrderPr: Very easy.
17:51:55 <nscnt> But having no logs out of the box is relieving, too
17:52:25 <nscnt> I don't feel pressured to read everything when I e.g. slept
17:52:37 <nscnt> Which is the norm as I live in a different time zone

17:53:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> nscnt: I'm the opposite, haha, I at least skim everything. This is regularly one of my favorite resources!
17:54:21 <nscnt> Mine, too. But it comes with a price. It's energy draining, too
17:55:17 <nscnt> And I can't justify to use my energy for reading histories atm
17:59:22 <seaclown> I skim them as well but agree nscnt, draining and only so much energy, especially with work using email, SMS, WhatsApp, teams, hangouts and a few others depending on the item. Head is about to explode, lol
18:00:20 <nscnt> Exactly. Prioritisation is needed.
18:03:33 <zaxxa[m]> Im confused about googles various communication tools, there seem to be many which do very similar things
18:33:28 <BrokenCog> after the build completes, out/release-crosshatch-* should contain the image to write to the device, is that correct?
18:34:58 <BrokenCog> I ask because after the build I got a "completed successfully" but out/ doesn't contain any release-* directory.
18:59:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <zaxxa[m] "Im confused about googles variou"> Google has historically had multiple teams making competing products in an effort to fight to the death the best one to the top
19:10:35 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <dazinism "Platform page has considerations"> This no longer a thing, eh?
19:42:58 <WokeBillKristol[> anyone able to give me a tutorial on proper use of user accounts for grapheneos?
19:45:18 <renlord> huh? dont you just create a user profile and then it's just like using a brand new phone
19:49:26 <WokeBillKristol[> I guess. I was under the impression it had added security benefits and its use was encouraged
19:51:46 <TheJollyRoger> WokeBillKristol[: yep, those security benefits don't come at any change to the user experience. GrapheneOS deliberately elects not to have any knobs, buttons, tunables, etc, or where possible, have as few as them as possible.
19:53:51 <WokeBillKristol[> so basically its another way to sandbox?
19:54:21 <TheJollyRoger> The security benefits delivered by GrapheneOS come in the form of mitigating exploits (especially when it comes to handling memory), reducing attack surface, safe-by-default settings that won't allow for downgrading or falling back to insecure modes. Most of those won't change your user experience.
19:55:00 <TheJollyRoger> Profiles allow you to essentially to create another, disparate identity living on the same phone which shares nothing with the main profile.
19:55:39 <TheJollyRoger> When not in use even, the files in another profile are encrypted with different keys, which are ejected from the phone's memory when that profile is closed.
19:57:15 <WokeBillKristol[> very cool thanks
19:57:24 <TheJollyRoger> Go to Settings -> System - > Multiple Users and you can add what you like there.
19:57:36 <TheJollyRoger> Try with one for now.
19:58:35 <TheJollyRoger> As renlord said, it's just like setting up a new phone, that's all. If you want to run multiple instances of say, Signal, this is a good way to do it.
19:59:52 <TheJollyRoger> Note that the profiles /do/ share the same wifi and network, but unless you specifically switch on the permission to control the phone, only the main account can use the phone.
20:00:04 <TheJollyRoger> Tap the gear next to it.
20:01:03 <renlord> WokeBillKristol[: app sandboxing comes default with android
20:01:14 <renlord> there's no need to do backflips to enable sandboxing
20:02:13 <renlord> the only additional work on your part is to micromanage permissions to grant to applications

21:12:53 <TheJollyRoger-M> Ahehehe not much.
21:13:04 <JTL> Okayy fair
21:13:07 <TheJollyRoger-M> Just a sec though. Will return to the computer in a bit
21:18:02 <cx2[m]> roger, Roger
22:16:47 <renlord> how does the apple t2 chip on their macbook series compare to the titan m
22:21:08 <renlord> and also is it reasonable to expect that security chips like the titan M will eventually trickle to laptops?
22:21:51 <JTL> I think they're less useful with the legacy "PC" approach of doing things
22:22:08 <JTL> But I could see some value anyways, in the context of things like a hardware backed keystore
22:27:42 <renlord> JTL: how do you mean by "less useful"?
22:27:50 <renlord> due to the curbed flexibility?
22:29:59 <JTL> Sure, like how EFI secure boot only validates the bootloader (iirc) and everything else is up in the air

22:46:05 <strcat> cdesai: that works

22:46:21 <strcat> I will just switch the targets realized it's a manifest issue
22:46:23 <strcat> AndroidManifest
22:46:39 <strcat> I and I figured out the extra thing for the normal target is not used
22:46:44 <strcat> I wanted to avoid needing to expand these others
22:46:55 <strcat> cdesai: it's not 64 that's needed but 64_32, at least for the library
22:47:04 <strcat> and probably browser too due to naming
22:47:05 <strcat> of files
22:48:59 <cdesai> webview looks confusing but I'm guessing that's handled by your patches

22:52:02 <strcat> I wanted to patch it to make the normal ones work that way but I guess this makes more sense and is easier
22:52:07 <strcat> since it would be more invasive than I realized
22:52:12 <strcat> they have a manifest template for each
22:53:03 <cdesai> and this'll probably keep working without having to keep patching things each release.
22:54:14 <strcat> cdesai: hopefully
22:54:21 <strcat> I still need the WebView patch
22:55:39 <cdesai> would trichrome_webview_apk not work?
23:10:50 <strcat> cdesai: that works but it's 32-bit processes by default
