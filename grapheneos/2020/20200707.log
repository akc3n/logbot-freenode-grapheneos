00:01:28 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "and broadcom wanted to takeover "> the beautiful things if you under audit and under publish security issues you can then point to cves and say you are more secure than your competitor
00:01:58 <renlord> market does not seem to care
00:02:04 <cn3m[m]> Google, Qualcomm, Apple, and even Microsoft suffer this far more than everyone else for doing the right thing
00:04:18 <cn3m[m]> people do care about privacy, but then again that is mostly marketing that they like. Look at Mozilla vs Apple in privacy. Mozilla isn't really doing anything noteworthy. They get all the praise.
00:04:21 <cn3m[m]> Security people don't care about
00:04:23 <cn3m[m]> at all
00:04:32 <cn3m[m]> it usually confused with privacy
00:04:45 <cn3m[m]> meaningful security*
00:04:52 <renlord> cn3m[m]: the privacy marketing by mozilla, i doubt is even true.
00:05:10 <renlord> its mostly just brand marketing -- "we are less evil than google, use us"
00:05:32 <cn3m[m]> Yeah, it is really not their methods are not effect as other browsers
00:06:00 <renlord> people are suckers to brand marketing
00:06:19 <cn3m[m]> they use intentionally kneecapped blocking lists instead of the more reasonable(but still flawed approach) of Safari blocking third party cookies and using intelligent anti tracking
00:06:20 <renlord> look at how many times they re-rendered the firefox logo
00:06:21 <renlord> lol
00:06:26 <renlord> it just works
00:06:28 <cn3m[m]> Even Chrome looks like it will block third party cookies first
00:07:10 <renlord> if strcat[m] bothered to re-render grapheneos' logo every month, we probably become the most popular mobile OS by now
00:07:15 <cn3m[m]> Firefox is likely one of the least private browser especially with the terrible differential privacy
00:07:16 <cn3m[m]> they are entirely ridding all trust on their brand
00:07:24 * renlord chuckles
00:07:45 <JTL> I thought the same lol
00:08:14 <cn3m[m]> Yes, move over One Ui here comes GraphXOS
00:08:27 <JTL> :D
00:09:18 <cn3m[m]> Seriously though, out of the box Firefox is simply one of the worst privacy browsers. Edge auto opts out of data collection if Windows is set too. Chrome asks you at install or setup
00:09:27 <cn3m[m]> they both use better differential privacy
00:09:39 <cn3m[m]> Safari has actually useful(but still flawed) privacy features on the web
00:09:58 <cn3m[m]> I would put it at the bottom
00:10:28 <cn3m[m]> If it was Mozilla Chrome and Google Firefox everyone would see that
00:11:01 <cn3m[m]>  * Safari has actually the most useful(but still flawed) privacy features on the web
00:11:26 <cn3m[m]> Safari is still the only browser that asks on a residential ip for a Captcha when searching Google for the first time
00:11:45 <cn3m[m]> Even "hardened firefox" won't do that
00:12:32 <cn3m[m]> Safari does that on iOS of course there is also zero uniqueness between the same devices everyone knows that. On macOS though? That's impressive
00:12:59 <cn3m[m]> Firefox tries so little for meaningful improvements it is astounding
00:13:26 <cn3m[m]> not touching on security at all which is more bleh
00:13:29 <JTL> Mozilla is too obsessed with their "side projects" imo
00:13:52 <JTL> But I see more problems with Mozilla as an organization
00:14:02 <cn3m[m]> Firefox is great for customization, but if you want privacy or security look elsewhere
00:14:15 <cn3m[m]> it is 100% marketing it is the worst by far
00:15:02 <SEL[m]1> <strcat[m] "there might be other devices tha"> What about OnePlus devices?
00:15:13 <strcat[m]> don't meet the requirements I listed
00:15:18 <strcat[m]> look at the requirements I listed out
00:15:20 <cn3m[m]> <SEL[m]1 "What about OnePlus devices?"> never
00:15:27 <strcat[m]> doesn't have full security support on a monthly basis
00:15:28 <SEL[m]1> Ahh sux
00:15:40 <strcat[m]> doesn't have working verified boot for alternate OSes
00:15:59 <strcat[m]> and I wouldn't be surprised if they got stuff like setting up IOMMUs wrong
00:16:11 <strcat[m]> based on their past security is not something they care much about
00:16:13 <cdesai> that rules out most if not all devices. Not many with fully working verified boot in the first place.
00:16:21 <renlord> maybe the nokia phones
00:16:26 <renlord> qualcomm SoC
00:16:33 <cdesai> bootloader can't be unlocked
00:16:34 <JTL> bootloader unlock is janky on some of them
00:16:35 <SEL[m]1> Yeah that's seems likely
00:16:36 <JTL> ^^
00:16:42 <cdesai> otherwise with android one those would be good targets
00:16:47 <strcat[m]> it's a low bar since it's a standardized feature that should work if they support unlocking
00:16:48 <renlord> oh sad :(
00:16:48 <cdesai> all price points, decent update speed
00:17:10 <renlord> is someone maintaining a list of potential candidates?
00:17:23 <renlord> aospalliance?
00:17:24 <cdesai> dazinism
00:17:27 <cn3m[m]> The only devices I can think of is possibly the Samsung Galaxy S devices if they could prove custom verified bootloader unlockability and consistent updates. I have seen some rumors, but still looking
00:17:36 <cdesai> but yeah we can add some stuff about testing to aospalliance
00:17:37 <SEL[m]1> @strcat:matrix.org: BTW I suggested OnePlus because I knew @anupritaisno1:m.apex.to was working on it
00:17:43 <SEL[m]1> Glassrom
00:18:01 <JTL> cn3m[m]: Knox eFuse breaks certain functionality
00:18:16 <JTL> unless that's different for exynos devices
00:18:26 <cn3m[m]> even on the Exynos?
00:18:27 <cn3m[m]> oh gotcha
00:18:33 <cdesai> half are exynos, and then qualcomm variants have a dicey bootloader unlock situation
00:18:37 <JTL> ^
00:18:40 <strcat[m]> SEL: and what anupritaisno1 has discovered is that it's not a suitable target for GrapheneOS at all
00:18:48 <cdesai> exynos would be harder to support
00:19:02 <renlord> just design our own SoC
00:19:05 <renlord> lol
00:19:09 <SEL[m]1> Yeah sadly that's true
00:19:12 <strcat[m]> there might be devices that are reasonable targets
00:19:15 <strcat[m]> but not those
00:19:23 <JTL> cdesai: I remember the Galaxy Note 3 (SM-N900W8) had a bootloader image leaked from inside Samsung that would prevent the Knox eFuse from going off and would also circumvent bootloder security in certain situation
00:19:28 <cn3m[m]> I highly recommend everyone read what Daniel wrote on Reddit here. "OnePlus devices will never be supported due to the company's disregard for security. Devices from vendors like Motorola, Samsung, etc. can be considered but OnePlus is completely off the table. Ultimately, the goal is custom hardware, and devices from other vendors eventually won't need to be supported. Broad device support is not a goal of the project.
00:19:28 <cn3m[m]> As explained there, the expectation is that people purchase a device for use with GrapheneOS, and eventually a device designed and built to run it that ships with it."
00:19:28 <cn3m[m]> http://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/g2b5nd/oneplus_6_support/fnqbc2b?context=3
00:19:31 <JTL> (blast from the psat lol)
00:19:53 <renlord> long long term goal
00:19:55 <cdesai> JTL: lol I was just talking about note 3 with a friend, it was a good device.
00:20:03 <JTL> I used to have one back in the day
00:20:05 <cdesai> renlord: risc-v right?
00:20:07 <JTL> How funny
00:20:21 <renlord> is android even ported to risc-v?
00:20:25 <cn3m[m]> Motorola has supported custom verified boot devices to some degree and has timely updates(generally)
00:20:27 <cn3m[m]> they are quite promising
00:21:07 <SEL[m]1> Is Motorola Android One?
00:21:15 <cn3m[m]> Yes
00:21:26 <SEL[m]1> Oh that makes things easier
00:21:41 <cn3m[m]> Moto X4 I believe was Android One and was supposedly compatible with custom verified boot keys
00:22:05 <renlord> any cheap risc-v sbcs
00:22:11 <renlord> i'd like to get one
00:22:34 <cn3m[m]> it is old now, but that would have been worth looking at if anyone cared. Personally I think Pixels are far more appealing until there are more maintainers
00:24:08 <renlord> hi5 is still so expensive
00:24:25 <renlord> not quite sure if it'll ever beat ARM
00:24:52 <renlord> and arm is just getting more and more mainstream
00:25:06 <cn3m[m]> risc-v to to extremely risc and x86 to too extremely cisc. I think ARM has a great middle ground appeal
00:27:02 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: if the newer motorolas are compatible too that'd be great
00:27:33 <cdesai> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_One#Products_by_year_of_announcement_or_release
00:27:36 <strcat[m]> it will be nice when 32-bit ARM support is finally dropped from both the hardware and OS
00:28:15 <cdesai> strcat[m]: https://twitter.com/luca020400/status/1276566566776320001
00:44:15 <cn3m[m]> cdesai: that is why I couldn't have a mac
00:47:54 <nickcalyx[m]> I don't think apple has made a 32 bit mac for like 13 or 14 years though
00:53:03 <aeonsolution[m]> if i can gripe for a bit everyone there's too much to read on Chromium
00:53:40 <aeonsolution[m]> i would like to kick whoever is in charge of the docs
00:53:59 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: they have great docs
00:54:06 <cn3m[m]> they are the best in that way
00:54:14 <aeonsolution[m]> cn3m: they are, its just soo much
00:54:30 <cn3m[m]> not if you really need to find something
00:54:40 <cn3m[m]> the alternative is far worse
00:55:27 <aeonsolution[m]> that's a fair point, im just trying to cram in so much a little bit of time and im failing
01:03:22 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "that's a fair point, im just try"> have tts read it to yu
01:03:30 <cn3m[m]> Cortana is great there is a registry tweak
01:12:27 <john_doe2[m]> Is it known for how long  grapheneOS will support pixel 3a? Perhaps i should get pixel 4 for longer life span?
01:19:27 <BalooRJ> john_doe2 apparently until May of 2022
01:35:40 <john_doe2[m]> Thanks
01:44:32 <aeonsolution[m]> john_doe2: you can search these questions online by look for end of life
01:44:36 <aeonsolution[m]> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705
04:00:15 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1280350848179191809
04:01:03 <JTL> Saw that on the site earlier, good work
04:01:39 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.07.06.20
04:05:21 <jcpicard32[m]> Great to see Daniel. Looks like Pixel 4 is officially stable? That's awesome to see. Thanks for all your hard work!
04:05:52 <renlord> and contributors that led to pixel4 support
04:07:44 <strcat[m]> just not marked experimental other than FAQ
04:09:05 <dolores0[m]> <TheJollyRoger "https://github.com/Peter-Easton/"> and then what about the skills required once the build environment is set up? where exactly do I start learning them? is there any community specifically for that? resources?
04:25:02 <dolores0[m]> I mean anybody can answer, I really need some help as I am big dumb
04:26:05 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/hmnc8h/grapheneos_2020070620_release/
04:33:27 <nitroneurons[m]> Time to order a pixel 4
04:36:14 <nitroneurons[m]> Or - looking at the price - maybe stick with the 3a
04:36:56 <nitroneurons[m]> Only 6 months difference in vendor support afaict
04:40:33 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a might be October
04:40:35 <dolores0[m]> if u buy used u can get them for ~$400
04:40:39 <strcat[m]> will probably  then be 4 months or so
04:40:41 <strcat[m]> before we can add it
04:40:45 <strcat[m]> cause I don't want a device branch
04:45:04 <ruddo[m]> Device branc
04:45:15 <ruddo[m]> Branch?
05:32:20 <strcat[m]>  they tend to branch the stable branch into a device specific branch
05:32:25 <strcat[m]> for devices launched afterwards
05:32:45 <strcat[m]> and then it takes a couple months for the next maintenance release merging it in so it's all the same
05:32:54 <JTL> Assumed as much, thanks!
05:33:04 <JTL> (I was going to ask too)
05:33:10 <strcat[m]> so for example when the Pixel 4a comes out it will be running something between Android 11 and the Android 11 first quarterly release
05:33:16 <strcat[m]> often closer to the first quarterly release
05:33:19 <strcat[m]> or 2nd, whatever
05:33:53 <strcat[m]> so it runs a newer branch of the software generally
05:33:55 <strcat[m]> for a few months
05:35:04 <strcat[m]> each major release like Android 10 is supported for 3 years, but for at least 1 year it gets substantial updates beyond just security updates via quarterly (or more frequent?) maintenance releases
05:35:48 <strcat[m]> a new Pixel device often uses a branch of the NEXT quarterly release because they add support to the upcoming maintenance release branch
05:35:56 <strcat[m]> since they don't make non-trivial changes to the existing one
05:36:12 <strcat[m]> and adding a device is non-trivial especially when they have new hardware features requiring new software bits and pieces, etc.
05:37:09 <cn3m[m]> does this mean the Pixel 4 is officially suppoted now? I don't see an experimental tag
05:37:52 <cn3m[m]> ah yes
05:37:53 <cn3m[m]> just saw the FAW
05:37:57 <cn3m[m]> FAQ*
05:39:18 <strcat[m]> cn3m: it's experimental but it actually has a device maintainer so...
05:39:28 <strcat[m]> I removed the experimental warning on the releases page
05:39:43 <jalb> Google Pixel 5: https://pigtou.com/blogs/android/google-pixel-5
05:39:52 <cn3m[m]> Gotcha, but it is officially supported so is it okay to say the Pixel 5 is supported?
05:39:58 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4*
05:40:06 <cn3m[m]> sorry brain wandered
05:40:06 <strcat[m]> yes
05:40:14 <strcat[m]> it was supported when it was marked experimental too
05:41:05 <strcat[m]> it would be good if they added back fingerprint scanner because it's easier to use that for the 2-factor unlock feature I want
05:41:11 <strcat[m]> it could be done with face unlock
05:41:16 <strcat[m]> but it requires different code
05:41:24 <cn3m[m]> Just checked the https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
05:41:26 <cn3m[m]> that is all I needed to know my bad
05:41:30 <strcat[m]> enter passphrase/PIN -> check for 2nd factor face
05:41:41 <cn3m[m]> little out of it
05:41:42 <strcat[m]> vs fingerprint unlock having a PIN/passphrase entry after doing it
05:42:06 <strcat[m]> too hard to do both
05:42:07 <strcat[m]> and maintain both
05:42:28 <cn3m[m]> there would be no fallback or a recovery key?
05:42:39 <strcat[m]> it's separate from the main passphrase
05:42:40 <cn3m[m]>  * there would be no fallback or would you use a recovery key?
05:42:48 <strcat[m]> it's a 2nd factor added to biometric unlock (a PIN / passphrase)
05:42:59 <strcat[m]> the only thing you can't forget is the main unlock method
05:43:05 <cn3m[m]> oh right
05:43:09 <cn3m[m]> I gotcha
05:43:10 <cn3m[m]> my bad
05:43:36 <strcat[m]> we COULD support both but
05:43:45 <strcat[m]> considering it has been 4 years with nearly no progress on implementing this one way
05:43:53 <strcat[m]> can't see that happening
05:44:00 <strcat[m]> you never know
05:44:34 <cn3m[m]> Better to wait for the fingerprint reader to die(which is relatively soon)
05:44:56 <cn3m[m]> no point adding support for a feature that won't exist in a year and a half
05:45:59 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] "no point adding support for a fe"> But what if the a series continue to have it
05:46:21 <JTL> I sure hope so, but I'm not Google.
05:46:25 <strcat[m]> g2g for now
05:46:30 <JTL> Be well strcat
05:46:50 <cn3m[m]> take care strcat
05:46:50 <strcat[m]> cn3m: well face unlock is harder to bypass so it's good in that sense but it's trivial to trigger by accident, etc.
05:47:04 <strcat[m]> cn3m: and it's not on all the devices
05:47:11 <strcat[m]> we could do 2 factor unlock with face unlock only
05:47:14 <strcat[m]> but then it'd be Pixel 4 only
05:47:29 <strcat[m]> dunno if the Pixel 4a will have the high res IR scanning stuff
05:47:37 <cn3m[m]> require attention on iOS seems to work well. is Pixel 4 detection not as good?
05:48:01 <cn3m[m]> I don't use faceid, but I tried it
05:48:32 <strcat[m]> cn3m: the main functionality is as good and you can require that eyes are open and perhaps looking at the device but still
05:48:50 <strcat[m]> if you just pick up the phone and glance at it, it'll unlock - so in this case
05:49:05 <cn3m[m]> that is fair, as a 2nd factor not sure how big of a deal accidents are
05:49:08 <strcat[m]> looking at your phone would make it trigger the secondary PIN/passphrase prompt if it was done in that order
05:49:15 <strcat[m]> I feel like that might be really annoying
05:49:22 <strcat[m]> if you just want to look at quick settings
05:49:25 <strcat[m]> it'll open a PIN menu
05:49:40 <strcat[m]> maybe it should still be done in that ordr
05:49:42 <strcat[m]> it's a UX thing
05:49:48 <cn3m[m]> Could it be checking your face only while putting in the pin?
05:49:57 <strcat[m]> fingerprint unlock -> enter PIN is really convenient b/c you don't need to press power and start unlock
05:49:59 <cn3m[m]> gotcha
05:50:03 <strcat[m]> cn3m: yeah it just makes it more annoying
05:50:34 <strcat[m]> fingerprint unlock + enter PIN is as convenient (almost even more convenient) than power button + trigger unlock + enter PIN
05:50:42 <strcat[m]> could do the 2nd factor for face unlock the same way
05:50:52 <strcat[m]> maybe it can mostly share code
05:50:56 <strcat[m]> I dunno
05:51:06 <strcat[m]> it's more complicated than it seems to do it right
05:51:42 <cn3m[m]> yes, very true
05:51:59 <cn3m[m]> the main advantage would be for shoulder surfing right?
05:52:23 <strcat[m]> yes someone can't just observe you enter your main passphrase
05:52:27 <strcat[m]> then steal your phone + enter it
05:52:30 <strcat[m]> like recording you on camera
05:52:40 <strcat[m]> because you AREN'T going to enter your main passphrase
05:53:03 <strcat[m]> and without being able to get in with just the biometric unlock method
05:53:30 <cn3m[m]> that is true
05:53:31 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "because you AREN'T going to ente"> It's awesome
05:53:55 <cn3m[m]> one thing I would like is a quicker way to access lockdown mode that is the more robust solution of course
05:54:46 <strcat[m]> or just have a quick way to turn it off
05:54:54 <strcat[m]> that feature seems kinda pointless to me rather than just turning it off
05:55:17 <strcat[m]> unless it logged out of the profile
05:55:19 <cn3m[m]> that is fair, it is non destructive to what is running in the background
05:55:29 <strcat[m]> which it doesn't do, it just disables secondary unlock mechanisms
05:55:43 <strcat[m]> logging out of the profile is almost as good as powering off
05:56:09 <strcat[m]> except there might be relevant stuff lingering in kernel memory, etc. despite having zero-on-free for various things, etc.
05:56:14 <cn3m[m]> That brings up a good question. Cellebrite says they can break a Pixel AFU(after first unlock) Lockdown mode fixes that right? Shutting down isn't better
05:56:49 <cn3m[m]> I get asked about that a fair amount, I am confident in Lockdown. I want to make sure that isn't misplaced
05:56:55 <strcat[m]> lockdown mode doesn't log out
05:57:21 <strcat[m]> a logout option would do more
05:57:31 <strcat[m]> reboot is basically logout just takes longer tho
05:57:52 <cn3m[m]> so right now if people were concerned they should shutdown or reboot
05:58:12 <strcat[m]> yes because then everything is gone
05:58:14 <cn3m[m]> thanks, I was wrong on that
05:58:47 <strcat[m]> cn3m: the initial unlock (logging in) derives the main encryption key for the profile and that stays active
05:58:52 <strcat[m]> until reboot / poweroff / logout
05:59:10 <strcat[m]> it ALSO unlocks hardware-backed keys tied to lock state
05:59:17 <strcat[m]> and THOSE become at rest again when locked
05:59:27 <cn3m[m]> Supposedly Cellebrite claims the A12 chip fixes this on iPhones. Is that even a possible problem to fix?
05:59:46 <cn3m[m]> thanks so much this is something I was very wrong about
05:59:50 <strcat[m]> the 'lockdown' option just disables secondary unlock mechanisms so all it does is protect the UI lockscreen and keystore keys
06:00:04 <strcat[m]> it doesn't undo having the main profile encryption key
06:00:08 <strcat[m]> it's not different on iPhones
06:00:24 <strcat[m]> cn3m: take what a company says in vague, inaccurate marketing material that people misinterpret with a grain of salt
06:01:01 <cn3m[m]> Thanks, ideally just reboot if you are ever worried someone else will have your phone
06:01:15 <strcat[m]> a new hardware generation fixing a security bug they were exploiting doesn't mean it actually improved security systemically
06:01:26 <cn3m[m]> that is the only applicable advice
06:01:28 <strcat[m]> certain bugs can't be fixed without new hardware
06:01:41 <dolores0[m]> reboot as in factory reset?
06:01:44 <strcat[m]> cn3m: yes if you are actually that concerned you should reboot
06:01:51 <strcat[m]> dolores0: not what is being said
06:01:59 <strcat[m]> reboot as in reboot
06:02:04 <cn3m[m]> <dolores0[m] "reboot as in factory reset?"> restart
06:02:06 <cn3m[m]> turn off/turn on
06:02:50 <strcat[m]> cn3m: also original pixels didn't have Titan M or Android Verified Boot 2.0
06:02:54 <strcat[m]> among other improvements since then
06:03:03 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 has AVB at least
06:03:19 <cn3m[m]> It says it works on Pixel 2-4 technically
06:03:23 <cn3m[m]> but in general doing anything other than reboot seems like bad advice
06:03:53 <cn3m[m]> I definitely was wrong on that so I really apperciate it
06:04:02 <cn3m[m]>  * I definitely was wrong on that so I really appreciate it
06:04:05 <strcat[m]> cn3m: if you exploit the OS via something like a USB driver vulnerability
06:04:07 <strcat[m]> or a wifi vulnerability
06:04:09 <strcat[m]> whatever
06:04:19 <strcat[m]> cn3m: then if the device was just locked - but already logged into a profile
06:04:32 <strcat[m]> the only data that isn't accessible is data encrypted with keystore keys set to be tied to lock state
06:04:41 <strcat[m]> cn3m: similarly on an iPhone
06:04:50 <strcat[m]> most data will be accessible if you exploit the OS after first unlock
06:04:58 <cn3m[m]> if you fixed that then you would break notifications
06:04:59 <strcat[m]> because the default class of encryption is available after first unlock
06:05:02 <strcat[m]> same as android
06:05:12 <strcat[m]> cn3m: among other things
06:05:26 <strcat[m]> cn3m: it's not that it needs to be 'fixed' really but that apps need to take advantage of the keystore much more
06:05:31 <strcat[m]> and do a good job with it
06:05:37 <strcat[m]> and the OS could provide an easier way to do it
06:05:46 <strcat[m]> g2g for now
06:06:18 <cn3m[m]> take care thanks again
06:06:53 <strcat[m]> cn3m: ideally tho way it would have been done is nothing available locked
06:06:58 <strcat[m]> unless you mark the data as available
06:07:07 <strcat[m]> but it's more complicated than that
06:07:29 <strcat[m]> should the OS kill every single app process when the screen locks? probably not, so even with really strict disk encryption it doesn't really work
06:08:06 <cn3m[m]> thanks, so faster reboot would be the ideal feature to add
06:08:14 <strcat[m]> actually logging out (kills all kernel threads / userspace processes for that profile) or ideally rebooting (so all the kernel state is gone) is ideal
06:08:22 <cn3m[m]> not lockdown or any large architectural changes
06:08:30 <strcat[m]> there is logout functionality
06:08:35 <strcat[m]> it could be an option in that menu
06:08:46 <cn3m[m]> that would allow people to still use cameras
06:09:00 <cn3m[m]> wait testing that
06:09:05 <cn3m[m]> nope wouldn't
06:09:15 <cn3m[m]> there's no storage for that
06:09:16 <cn3m[m]> I am dumb tonight
06:09:30 <strcat[m]> there is a toggle in GrapheneOS for if camera can be used on lockscreen anyway
06:09:36 <strcat[m]> cya later
06:09:43 <mxnorvak[m]> Thanks
06:09:59 <cn3m[m]> see you man thanks again
06:13:21 <jalb> Wow logging out users/profiles would be fantastic!
06:43:59 <cn3m[m]> welcome
06:44:18 <aceace> hey
06:44:43 <aceace> came to ask for assistance :)
06:44:48 <aceace> hi, i'm currently in ukraine and for some reason ukranian sims dont get signal, when trying to choose network manually it finds all 3 of them and lets me choose but even when its connected there is no signal. other sims from other countries are working
06:45:37 <aceace> is there anything that I can do about it?
06:48:29 <aceace> pixel 3a xl by the way
07:50:16 <alicebobandeve[m> Hey
07:51:10 <alicebobandeve[m> Does anyone else have a software update button that doesn't result in an action?
07:51:26 <alicebobandeve[m> The button doesn't work
07:52:25 <alicebobandeve[m> No toast, nothing in the notification bar etc
08:04:26 <dallemon[m]> <alicebobandeve[m "Does anyone else have a software"> In the system update settings menu? It's normal that it doesn't show anything, but it works.
08:06:03 <alicebobandeve[m> No user facing feedback?

08:06:31 <dallemon[m]> <alicebobandeve[m "I thought there was something"> Nope
08:06:49 <dallemon[m]> But if there is an update available it will start downloading it
08:06:57 <alicebobandeve[m> Didn't Daniel release an update? I can't get it via the updater, it shows nothing yet
08:07:34 <dallemon[m]> <alicebobandeve[m "Didn't Daniel release an update?"> Give it a bit of time. There is always a delay from announcement to availability
08:08:40 <alicebobandeve[m> Ah, ok. Thanks. I haven't been up to date on announcements before this, I think that's probably why I haven't come across this.
08:08:52 <dallemon[m]> I find that keeping an eye on the releases page is the best way to know when to press that update button if you can't wait for it to check automatically
08:09:14 <alicebobandeve[m> <dallemon[m] "I find that keeping an eye on th"> Perfect, thanks for the help.
08:10:42 <dallemon[m]> <alicebobandeve[m "Perfect, thanks for the help. "> Also the beta channel will get it first. If no issues pop up it will roll out to stable a day or two later
08:11:21 <alicebobandeve[m> Cool

08:16:15 <greenmoon[m]> * Why did u installed a malware crabbles
08:17:24 <crabbles> fdroid is hijacked, every app runs through a local dns so i cant see whats poppin ; only chrome and signal send to their servers but also log to local
08:18:13 <greenmoon[m]> What do that even mean
08:20:06 <greenmoon[m]> And what's going on with that big bezel, is that a pixel??
08:24:05 <crabbles> malware intercepts and adds back code or bad apks when i try to get an app. root certs are failing to connect and got rewritten by random ones
08:24:17 <crabbles> its a 3a
08:27:09 <greenmoon[m]> Huh I don't think there is any malware on ur phone yesterday u sent a picture where u literally disabled all default certificates and u wonder why they are failing to connect?

08:34:50 <greenmoon[m]> ...
08:36:27 <greenmoon[m]> What make u believe that u got a malware and what do auditor said
08:37:23 <crabbles> some of these permissions seem really out of wack . system ui on google comes up as a virus for example
08:37:24 <greenmoon[m]> What dis u sent to virus total?
08:38:43 <crabbles> android.cts.shim
08:38:58 <greenmoon[m]> So you just typed 'system ui' on Google search and there was results about virus??..
08:40:00 <crabbles> no i downloaded a few random apks from bad sources and my phone started getting glitchy
08:40:12 <greenmoon[m]> Ho ok
08:40:15 <crabbles> and i noticed new aystem apps i havent seen before
08:43:23 <greenmoon[m]> Well anyways if auditor is failing it mean the phone is done and you need to reinstall
08:56:05 <crabbles> actually i think your right about the lack of malware , i kept getting these errors and assumed it was the certs since they all expiry like 2020/2040 but i think downloading new ones mucked my web connectivity via stuff like this ; https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/backdoor-malware-is-being-spread-through-fake-security-certificate-alerts/
09:00:48 <greenmoon[m]> But u said auditor is failing
09:47:07 <strcat[m]> crabbles: you can't disable all those CAs...
09:47:09 <strcat[m]> and expect the internet to work
09:47:19 <strcat[m]> you don't have malware - you just screwed stuff up yourself
09:47:25 <strcat[m]> do a factory reset and don't do that again

10:08:00 <alzxjm[m]> Yes. Pixel 4 XL. Definitely CalyxOS and I think also Graphene.
10:08:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Are you on grapheneos right now?

10:24:09 <strcat[m]> it takes a while
10:24:17 <strcat[m]> it's annoying af actually
10:24:22 <crueltekk[m]> Didnt want to show my face here. But even when i look into it it doesnt work
10:24:37 <strcat[m]> what does doesn't work mean
10:24:39 <strcat[m]> it takes a really long time
10:24:46 <strcat[m]> you need to use slightly different angles
10:24:48 <strcat[m]> it's annoying
10:25:09 <strcat[m]> it might be because I have my beard grown so it can barely see most of my face out but the registration process is really bad
10:25:16 <strcat[m]> just how it is
10:25:19 <strcat[m]> be patient with it
10:25:22 <strcat[m]> it works well after
10:25:30 <strcat[m]> it makes sure it has everything it needs beforehand
10:25:41 <crueltekk[m]> I get this directly he do not even starts to scan the face
10:27:09 <alzxjm[m]> The Stock install wizard shows you a convex grid. You need to rotate your face a bit to hit every angle in the grid. Not the easiest to explain, but you just kinda keep the phone in front and move your face around.
10:27:57 <alzxjm[m]> I just flashed CalyxOS on my Pixel 4 XL and it was pretty easy to enroll my face. It was identical to the GrapheneOS process.

10:28:26 <crueltekk[m]> I know, made this more than one time with my old pixel. But here it wont work. The convex grid does not appear. He just drops that error.
10:28:59 <alzxjm[m]> The grid doesn't appear on this wizard either, you just have to guess. But I hear you that it doesn't even get to that point.
10:32:09 <crueltekk[m]> > The grid doesn't appear on this wizard either, you just have to guess. But I hear you that it doesn't even get to that point.
10:32:09 <crueltekk[m]> Okay one thing that the grid does not appear. But yeah I do not even get to the point where I would move around my face.
10:39:54 <strcat[m]> crueltekk: if you have a screen protector on that might be blocking it
10:40:01 <strcat[m]> can't think of anything else

10:44:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then start "adb logcat > log" and do face enrollment while the log is running

14:19:26 <pikey[m]> i have strong LTE here
14:20:28 <dazinism> Try that other app I just linked. It'll actually show you if, and what satellites you can see
14:20:35 <dazinism> Well your phone
14:22:11 <pikey[m]> thats what i am using, i installed it. zero data. going outside for a while! thanks
14:23:39 <dazinism> pikey: its a common problem first time people use GPS on Graphene
14:26:47 <pikey[m]> Ah OK well so far no good. Device bought used in excellent condition but its possibly bad hardware
14:29:27 <AdventureCommuni> I dont think Ive ever even used the gps on any of my phones haha
14:30:16 <pikey[m]> haha. same here except for occasional driving/satnav
14:33:22 <pikey[m]> nope. it appears GPS not working. I dont suppose it could be wifi and bluetooth scanning being turned off?
14:33:46 <pikey[m]> it shoudln't, that annoys me how they mix the technology, gps should be able to do it on its own but maybe thats it?
14:37:40 <dazinism> pikey: pretty sure GrapheneOS doesnt use anything but GPS for location, so shouldn't need them on.
14:38:03 <dazinism> Maybe the satellites don't like hanging out where you live?
14:38:21 <pikey[m]> haha. iphone has no trouble, or old sat navs
14:38:41 <pikey[m]> very odd. giving up.
14:38:48 <pikey[m]> thanks for the replies
14:39:37 <dazinism> No problems, bit weird. May just click into action if you leave it all on for a bit and wander about outside.
14:40:42 <pikey[m]> the thing is osmand has been installed for like 2 months. i just got back from 700 mile round trip last weekend too. worrying, maybe bad phone :(
14:41:02 <dazinism> Oh, it was previously working...
14:41:34 <pikey[m]> no
14:41:53 <pikey[m]> not seen GPS working on this device yet. jjust saying the phone came with me for that trip and was turned on the whole time. but didn't try using GPS
14:42:39 <dazinism> Without the location on and, I think an app trying to use it, the phone won't be trying to get a GPS fix
14:42:54 <pikey[m]> right yes. thanks
14:43:09 <pikey[m]> i just turned off location services and turned back on inc ase that helps. but no good. nevermind
14:46:11 <odisaben[m]> Best tech advice....turn it off and back on....works almost every time
14:49:31 <pikey[m]> haha. thanks but I knew that secret trick :D
14:59:13 <anonymouserobot[> <pikey[m] "nope. it appears GPS not working"> I had an issue with my GPS when I first installed Graphene, what resolved it was installing SatStat, after opening that app and letting it scan the satellite's, my location services + GPS worked.
14:59:38 <pikey[m]> nice. well worth a try then. thanks very much
15:02:36 <dazinism> pikey: only other thing I can think is if somehow your requests of the GPS almanacs are being blocked
15:02:39 <dazinism> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
15:03:30 <dazinism> Not sure which system app does that, but if you'd disabled network permisssion for that
15:04:51 <dazinism> Or if a VPN set up or something is blocking network requests to those URLs - I think unlikely unless you'd set it up to do that
15:11:33 <pikey[m]> Thanks daz. Not sure I follow fully but will look into that. Satstat didn't help sadly. Losing my patience now. As daily driver if it wasn't for covid tracking bull shit I would go back to iPhone and keep this for my 'other' phone. Combination of problems and my lack of knowledge isnt good!
15:15:37 <odisaben[m]> Contact tracing is what pushed me here....glad it it did
15:24:21 <pikey[m]> just asked someone else here who has a pixel 3xl running graphene. his GPS works fine. think I must have faulty hardware. depressing. especially the thought of trying to set up a new device with my 39 GB music collection, 20 Gig video collection etc!
15:26:13 <dazinism> I've got a 3xl and it also works fine
15:26:45 <dazinism> pikey: have you ever switched off network permission for random system apps?
15:27:34 <pikey[m]> honestly can't say for certain but i dont thinjk so
15:28:54 <pikey[m]> pretty sure not. the only apps on deny list for network are calendar camera gallery omni notes and vinyl music player
15:29:31 <pikey[m]> i wonder if there is a way to test GPS module (hardware)
15:48:11 <dazinism> pikey: if you click on the three dots top right can get it to show system apps (in case you hadn't)
15:48:36 <dazinism> I've not got any system apps in denied
15:49:31 <dazinism> ...well except Print Service Recommended Service
15:49:56 <cdesai> I use https://github.com/barbeau/gpstest for testing GPS
15:50:17 <cdesai> should work without a network / sim / any additional assitance as well, and it'll happily use that if available
15:54:28 <dazinism> Was thinking might need to download the almanac, via network, before a device could get first lock on satellites, but I've never tested.
16:01:01 <pikey[m]> <dazinism "pikey: if you click on the three"> thanks, yep no system apps denied here.
16:01:57 <pikey[m]> GPS Test installed. Shows no data. GPS hardware is poofed i think
16:02:41 <dazinism> Yeah sounds a reasonable possibility
16:02:42 <pikey[m]> Anyone know how easy it would be to 'clone' my graphene installation, i.e. everything, data, settings etc, to another pixel? or would i have to do it inch by inch?!
16:03:05 <dazinism> Could be something up with the satellites, think it does happen
16:03:40 <dazinism> Maybe Elon is testing his new star train mounted GPS blocking tech?
16:04:06 <pikey[m]> haha
16:04:26 <pikey[m]> nope. I have another Pixel 3 right next to me on desk. Its finding satellites in seconds perfectly fine.
16:04:40 <pikey[m]> boo hoo. need another 128GB pixel now, if i can move stuff across
16:06:21 <dazinism> Think there is a data download, sent down from the satellites, on first GPS use, could be some weird issue temporarily causing that to fail.
16:06:48 <dazinism> I'd try again tomorrow
16:12:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pikey[m] "boo hoo. need another 128GB pixe"> Use adopted storage
16:16:15 <mrxx_0[m]> I just see that Pixel 4 and 4XL are now supported, kudos !!
16:18:51 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Use adopted storage"> sorry what does that mean?
16:19:08 <pikey[m]> i have a mac running android file transfer
16:27:29 <pikey[m]> think I will just set up graphene on new device, then drag and drop as much as i can with android file transfer and match up the settings manually. i had hopes of taking some kind of clone/backup of my device so i could sell it to raise money for the new one, but will borrow some cash to have both together on the bench at same time. safer i think. thanks (ps Daz, I will try tomorrow just in case that's the issue, thanks)
16:39:38 <strcat[m]> pikey: why not use the backup implementation
16:40:48 <woot75[m]> <pikey[m] "think I will just set up graphen"> need to do the same, but I don't have root this phone and I have to do the copy of certain apps for adb
16:43:54 <pikey[m]> <strcat[m] "pikey: why not use the backup im"> not quite got to looking at that yet, i wasn't sure it was even working fully :)
16:44:04 <dazinism> <strcat[m] "pikey: why not use the backup im"> Think its mainly files they want to move, rather than app data
16:44:27 <pikey[m]> yes basically everything
16:44:48 <strcat[m]> use the backup implementation for app data
16:44:49 <dazinism> pikey: it does backups of app data, also possibly some system settings?
16:45:10 <dazinism> Files you want to do the way you describe
16:45:10 <strcat[m]> you need to transfer your home directory files yourself for now
16:45:36 <pikey[m]> pretty sure it will be beyond my abilities but will look into it
16:46:37 <dazinism> Backup is pretty easy to use, just plug in usb stick storage and goto backup in settings>system
16:47:17 <dazinism> Have it plugged in again when you first boot GrapheneOS on a new device
16:48:30 <pikey[m]> wow, really that easy?! cool if so. i heard a few discussions on here about the backup utility a while back and i had a headche just trying to follow some of the conversation :D
16:48:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pikey[m] "sorry what does that mean? "> Pretty neat feature
16:48:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Gives you extra storage
16:48:53 <strcat[m]> pikey: you might be confusing this with adb backup / adb restore
16:48:56 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Gives you extra storage"> ah i see thanks
16:49:03 <strcat[m]> this is the built in GUI backup implementation
16:49:12 <pikey[m]> <strcat[m] "pikey: you might be confusing th"> ah possibly yes
16:49:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well the encryption key is a problem
16:49:18 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: adoptable storage is for sdcards, etc. though
16:49:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's stored on data
16:49:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> You format your phone you lose adopted storage
16:49:56 <strcat[m]> this isn't related
16:50:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: adoptable storage"> External drives are adoptable
16:50:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes it isn't
16:50:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Was a previous discussion on storage size
16:53:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> External USB can be adopted but the user accepts the risks
16:53:16 <pikey[m]> ok i found the backup feature in settings. after entering the 12 words it offers internal storage of USB flash drive. so if I plug in a flash drive, it will backup all apps and app data, what about settings etc? basically i am asking how much it will 'clone' the device i push it to later. I assume it won't be 100% identical, will it?
16:53:28 <pikey[m]>  * ok i found the backup feature in settings. after entering the 12 words it offers internal storage or USB flash drive. so if I plug in a flash drive, it will backup all apps and app data, what about settings etc? basically i am asking how much it will 'clone' the device i push it to later.

16:53:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> If the user doesn't disconnect the device properly data loss will occur
16:54:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pikey[m] "ok i found the backup feature in"> It won't
16:54:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not all apps can be backed up
16:55:17 <pikey[m]> trying to work out if its better than using android file transfer and just dragging and dropping to desktop backup folder and pushing to new phone myself. maybe both will get it as close as possible
16:55:57 <cdesai> pikey[m]: what it gets can't be backed up by copying files anyway
16:56:03 <cdesai> it grabs all apps, and data of most apps
17:01:17 <pikey[m]> thanks. ok, so its backup first, file transfer later if neededd
17:02:21 <cdesai> file transfer is for everything you'd see in the Files app when you enable show internal storage
17:02:34 <cdesai> and basically what you'd see when connected to file trasnfer
17:02:44 <cdesai> that does not get backed up (yet)
17:03:00 <pikey[m]> yes i am lacking kjnowledge. i assumed that showed 100% of everything. :)
17:07:11 <mrxx_0[m]> What is your best alternative to Waze ?
17:07:11 <mrxx_0[m]> Do you use Waze with Graphene ?
17:08:19 <neonfuz2> does graphene do anything about orbot leaks?

17:09:36 <jcpicard32[m]> > Do you use Waze with Graphene ?
17:09:36 <jcpicard32[m]> I've been using Magic Earth for navigation and have been mostly happy with it
17:20:21 <eligiblecoffee[m> I just went through the changelog and saw this
17:20:21 <eligiblecoffee[m> "Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL: update APNs with carriersettings-extractor"
17:20:21 <eligiblecoffee[m> Will it help in enabling volte?
17:22:40 <mrxx_0[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "> <@mrxx_0:matrix.org> What is y"> Seems nice, was using osm ...
17:35:49 <neonfuz2> I'm not gonna use it, but does google fi work okay with graphene?
17:38:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> neonfuz: if you're not going to use it then it doesn't matter to you does it?
17:42:54 <neonfuz2> because I know someone with a 3a xl that uses fi
17:43:16 <neonfuz2> and I wouldn't recommend graphene to them unless it works with fi
17:43:42 <alzxjm[m]> <neonfuz2 "I'm not gonna use it, but does g"> It is not 100% functional on GrapheneOS or CalyxOS.
17:43:44 <alzxjm[m]> I use Google Fi on my Pixel 4 XL.
17:44:22 <neonfuz2> do you use the fi app?
17:44:22 <alzxjm[m]> MMS messages will not load at all, you do not have network switching, Wi-Fi calling does not work, visual voicemail does not work.
17:44:29 <alzxjm[m]> LTE data works, SMS messages will come through OK, and calling works.
17:45:20 <alzxjm[m]> The Fi app will not run on GrapheneOS. On CalyxOS, which comes with microG, the app tries to activate but it is not currently possible (as far as I can tell) to add a Google account to the phone so the Fi app will not activate.
17:45:38 <neonfuz2> okay
17:45:43 <alzxjm[m]> The fault is on microG, not CalyxOS.
17:45:44 <neonfuz2> cool thanks for the info
17:46:15 <alzxjm[m]> Every few days I flash CalyxOS and try to get Fi to work, but I live in an area with terrible service so I need Wifi calling to work. I'll definitely report back here if I can get it to function.
17:58:42 <pikey[m]> well oil be fooked. Daz appears to have been right all along! After pulling out three different phones, doing some research about 3a, 3 and the 4 even, I was just about to get my linux machine open and start ditching this phone when it must have got insecure and decided to turn on GPS! Totally out of the blue. That saves me a lot of work I didn't have time for!! Hooray. Thanks everyone for the input. I am still going to
17:58:42 <pikey[m]> look at the backups thing so at least I learned something!
18:17:31 <bbqcore[m]> how is the project funding going?
18:17:48 <bbqcore[m]> i remember daniel saying Graphene wasnt sustainable without backing
18:20:26 <bbqcore[m]> i see pixel 4 support now so thats a good sign for expansion
18:20:49 <bbqcore[m]>  * I remember Daniel saying Graphene wasnt sustainable without backing
18:20:56 <bbqcore[m]>  * I see pixel 4 support now so thats a good sign for expansion
18:21:28 <bbqcore[m]> Just wondering the sustainablity/future of this free OS
18:21:52 <bbqcore[m]> Also, has all the previous hardening being ported over yet?
18:31:44 <JTL> (re: donations, https://grapheneos.org/donate)
18:31:58 <JTL> Restoring past features (as I understand it) is a work in progress
18:34:08 <cdesai> even better - https://github.com/sponsors/thestinger
18:34:08 <cdesai> github will match your donations upto $5k for the first year
18:34:55 <JTL> Done now
18:35:19 <JTL> (It was mentioned in /donate but since that's concluded it was removed)
18:35:36 <JTL> (crossed the $5k bonus)
18:35:43 <JTL> (strcat mentioned that recently)
18:35:50 <cdesai> I missed that
18:35:54 <JTL> Ah
18:40:23 <bbqcore[m]> Doesn't answer my question.
18:40:42 <bbqcore[m]> Daniel has said multiple time that donations alone won't be enough to support this project.
18:42:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> bbqcore: yes
18:56:17 <dallemon[m]> Upped my monthly donation after the GH goal was reached :)
19:01:00 <nickcalyx[m]> The github donation thing is only at 28%
19:06:08 <bbqcore[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "bbqcore: yes "> Yes what?
19:13:51 <nickcalyx[m]> > Daniel has said multiple time that donations alone won't be enough to support this project.
19:13:51 <nickcalyx[m]> People are stepping up to do parts of the work as well
19:14:56 <bbqcore[m]> So this OS is a viable long-term privacy & security solution?
19:39:31 <pikey[m]> <nitroneurons[m] "as much as anything other than a"> interesting comment. I have family on iphones and I am not working so hard to pull them away now (as i will pick up the technical tab of installing/teaching graphene, and I am hardly a power user :D). But I would love to hear someone compare Graphene with iPhone for security and privacy, or perhaps write something explaining the benefits of moving from iphone to
19:39:32 <pikey[m]> graphene. If someone cared to outline the benefits. My understanding is iphone is very secure compared to stock android, but apps steal data and spy on users, as do Apple. But I don't much more than that, if i am right that far!
19:41:26 <pacobell[m]> The whole clipboard spying thing should have been locked down a long time ago on iOS. Android's outright forbidden that kind of sharing for the past two major versions now.
19:43:04 <alzxjm[m]> <pikey[m] "interesting comment. I have fami"> I recommend this comment by Daniel Micay (lead developer of GrapheneOS) on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/ekxifpa/
19:43:19 <alzxjm[m]> This topic has been discussed a billion times in this room. You can also search the log here: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
19:43:22 <nitroneurons[m]> <pikey[m] "interesting comment. I have fami"> cn3m is a good person to talk to, he knows a lot about the technical differences
19:43:22 <pacobell[m]> Seems kind weird they'd allow global clipboard access when they don't even let apps connect to other apps' local ports directly.
20:05:30 <cn3m[m]> pacobell: Apple isn't stealing your data and they are largely comparable privacy and security wise to GrapheneOS(some pros and cons)
20:06:50 <pacobell[m]> I never said Apple was specifically. But their app partners just might be.
20:07:24 <pacobell[m]> And they've been enabling them to do just that with their hands-off approach thus far.
20:09:42 <pacobell[m]> I'm surprised it took a third party to notice the anomalies when Apple takes such a seemingly strong stance to vett apps prior to publication in the App Store. Maybe they need a better Bouncer-like analysis engine like Google has?
20:11:29 <pacobell[m]> That's not to say that Bouncer is perfect, either. We've seen instances where it can be fooled with clever dropper malware.
20:12:21 <cn3m[m]> <pacobell[m] "I never said Apple was specifica"> as an app developer who worked in ad tech I can tell you iOS is far more restrictive
20:12:25 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is very close to iOS in 3rd party privacy though and if you use profiles effectively it can be superior
20:12:26 <cn3m[m]> https://nm.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/ekxifpa/ pacobell: this sums it up still
20:12:31 <cn3m[m]> you are going to have to expand on that
20:12:40 <cn3m[m]> Bouncer is terrible and not recommended
20:12:42 <cn3m[m]> Apple has far stronger restrictions on apps than Android I am really not sure what you are even talking about
20:12:57 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS increases restrictions apps and removes the Play Services so I am not counting that in the broad comments about Android
20:14:39 <pacobell[m]> <cn3m[m] "the iOS 14 alerts might seem sca"> And prior to that... it just let any app have carte blanche to that data? Doesn't sound very privacy-friendly to me. Even now, it's just a warning and not a hard block from the OS?
20:14:45 <cn3m[m]> iOS has an equivalent to bouncer built in anyway
20:15:09 <cn3m[m]> it really seems like you have no idea what you are talking about
20:15:31 <cn3m[m]> iOS has permissions for all of this and adding alerts to show you when those apps are using those permissions
20:15:44 <cn3m[m]> this is far better than anything Android has
20:16:15 <cn3m[m]> especially since many permissions can be given temporarily or with much stronger restrictions
20:17:20 <pacobell[m]> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes
20:17:31 <pacobell[m]> Limited access to clipboard data
20:17:31 <pacobell[m]> Unless your app is the default input method editor (IME) or is the app that currently has focus, your app cannot access clipboard data on Android 10 or higher.
20:17:53 <pacobell[m]> Sounds like they have pretty decent mitigation
20:18:05 <cn3m[m]> Yes, iOS has been doing that far longer
20:18:09 <cn3m[m]> iOS is vastly ahead on the clipboard game
20:18:13 <cn3m[m]> it is not even close
20:18:49 <cn3m[m]> iOS and GrapheneOS have been crushing Android on clipboard for years
20:19:08 <cn3m[m]> "GrapheneOS previously restricted background clipboard access as a much earlier and slightly less strict implementation of this feature. It provided a toggle for users to whitelist clipboard managers, which is no longer needed now that keyboards are expected to provide it." here is from the FAQ
20:19:15 <cn3m[m]> iOS and GrapheneOS have been much further ahead
20:19:30 <pacobell[m]> So why have the clipboard warning at all in iOS if it's all so well siloed?
20:20:31 <cn3m[m]> pacobell: Since it is good to know
20:20:35 <cn3m[m]> Don't you wish you could see that on Android?
20:20:40 <SubnauticaSplit> Hey, all. I just have a quick question. I've noticed that there's finally support for the Pixel 4 and 4 XL lineup, which is fantastic. However, before I bite the bullet and purchase one (the 4 XL), I just want to know if everything is up and running, or are there still some bugs to be ironed out?
20:21:06 <cn3m[m]> Much like I wish I could see when apps use the camera and microphone or location permissions
20:21:13 <cn3m[m]> or access bluetooth
20:21:13 <pacobell[m]> I'd just like to know that the OS is doing that protection in the background. Logcat is fine.
20:21:44 <pacobell[m]> Apps shouldn't have access to the global clipboard at all unless it's directly from the IME.
20:21:48 <cn3m[m]> or any number of other permission shaming iOS does
20:21:49 <cn3m[m]> it really is just better on app privacy
20:21:52 <cn3m[m]> pacobell: all modern OSes are
20:21:59 <cn3m[m]> a solid 30% of phones have good protections
20:22:30 <cn3m[m]> <pacobell[m] "Apps shouldn't have access to th"> that is how it works on GrapheneOS and Android 10
20:22:41 <cn3m[m]> iOS 14 is much better as it is transparent about it
20:23:11 <fll[m]> > Hey, all. I just have a quick question. I've noticed that there's finally support for the Pixel 4 and 4 XL lineup, which is fantastic.

20:23:11 <fll[m]> anupritaisno1 is the one that knows the most about that
20:23:12 <pacobell[m]> The messaging is mixed, then. It makes it sound like the mitigations aren't already in place.
20:23:19 <cn3m[m]> iOS and GrapheneOS are historically the only ones that took this seriously
20:23:21 <cn3m[m]> iOS more so than GrapheneOS
20:24:10 <cn3m[m]> <pacobell[m] "The messaging is mixed, then. It"> Android is doing exactly what people are seeing on iOS just likely worse
20:24:32 <cn3m[m]> iOS is at least telling you
20:25:28 <cn3m[m]> iOS has the same or better permissions for camera, location, microphone, bluetooth, local network access, clipboard, storage and more that they have been shaming for overuse over the years
20:25:44 <cn3m[m]> if you have ever used an Apple device that is quite apparent
20:26:10 <SubnauticaSplit> Thanks, fll[m]. Paging anupritaisno1[m] about the Pixel 4 XL and my query above!
20:26:22 <cn3m[m]> Again I highly recommend reading this writeup from the lead developer of GrapheneOS on Android vs iOS security and privacy https://nm.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/ekxifpa/
20:29:52 <spaceinfinite[m]> <cn3m[m] "Again I highly recommend reading"> What’s the verdict on microsoft edge on ios ?
20:30:44 <spaceinfinite[m]> I know safari is best but need a second browser for twitter
20:35:12 <cn3m[m]> spaceinfinite: offtopic, but in general you should use the browser that comes with your OS
20:35:14 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium for GrapheneOS, Safari for Apple, Microsoft Edge for Windows
20:35:18 <AdventureCommuni> <cn3m[m] "Vanadium for GrapheneOS, Safari "> The new edge or the old one?
20:35:25 <cn3m[m]> https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#browser-ios
20:35:32 <cn3m[m]> <AdventureCommuni "The new edge or the old one?"> old edge is dead
20:35:36 <cn3m[m]>  * https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#browser-ios spaceinfinite
20:35:39 <AdventureCommuni> thats the one that still comes preinstalled though
20:35:42 <AdventureCommuni> or at least the last few times I installed windows
20:35:45 <cn3m[m]> <AdventureCommuni "thats the one that still comes p"> it will be replaced in the coming weeks
20:35:48 <AdventureCommuni> ah ok
20:41:19 <cn3m[m]> Adventure Communist: generally you only want to use one browser engine
20:41:29 <cn3m[m]> Blink or WebKit
20:42:01 <cn3m[m]> That is why the iPhone and iPad combo is so strong there is very little attack surface as you can only be hacked by an exploit chain for one browser and one OS. The less diversity of your products the better
20:42:41 <cn3m[m]> I use GrapheneOS and Windows 10
20:42:47 <cn3m[m]> it makes most sense to use Vanadium and Edge Chromium
20:43:15 <AdventureCommuni> do more people actually use edge than chrome?
20:46:34 <pacobell[m]> I prefer Brave on Windows. Better fingerprinting avoidance (even if it does break some websites).
20:47:04 <pacobell[m]> Some of the same devs that worked on Tor Browser are there now.
20:47:20 <cn3m[m]> no not close, but it should keep going up
20:47:28 <cn3m[m]> Right now I can get hit with 3 exploit chains. Chromium > Windows, Chromium > GrapheneOS, > Safari to iPadOS. That a lot of attack surface
20:48:12 <cn3m[m]> that is 3 times the number of attacks I would be vulnerable to if I had only an iPhone and iPad. That's the thought exercise to think through when choosing the software between your devices
20:48:27 <cn3m[m]> less variety is good
20:48:34 <cn3m[m]> Brave takes a month to update at times
20:48:40 <cn3m[m]> I consider it in the same league as Firefox(unsafe)
20:49:12 <cdesai> Brave could be faster if they wanted to given chromium is developed in the open
20:49:27 <cn3m[m]> that goes for Android too to a lesser extent
20:49:32 <AdventureCommuni> I use Brave Nightly, faster updates
20:49:36 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium, Bromite, Safari, and Edge Chromium is all I would recommend browser wise on any platform
20:49:57 <cn3m[m]> running a testing version of a sketchy crypto browser is not recommended
20:57:09 <xabi[m]> <cn3m[m] "Vanadium, Bromite, Safari, and E"> I have tried chromium edge on windows, I read somewhere that it has a unique identifier, how true is that?

21:02:24 <cn3m[m]> Your OS is essentially the core point of trust for the whole experience of the devices. You want to minimize that as much as you can
21:03:36 <cn3m[m]> The easiest way to get setup is to use only Apple products. They respect your security and privacy extremely well. The criticisms are largely unbased. Only 2% of the "privacy" community can get what they need done on a degoogled Android. If you fall into that 2% by all means use Windows 10 and GrapheneOS and trust them and you will get more user freedom
21:04:17 <cn3m[m]> it is very simple, If your OS makes something you should largely use it if you need it
21:04:23 <cn3m[m]> browsers, email clients, you name it
21:04:51 <cn3m[m]> This whole topic is largely pointless, it is very simple
21:05:15 <cn3m[m]> less is more in privacy and security. Less trust is better than more trust
21:06:12 <cn3m[m]> Everything has bugs and everyone should use encryption
21:06:17 <EssentialChaos[m> <sirthinkalot[m] "Remember when you could get into"> Bugs be everywhere
21:06:20 <cn3m[m]> Windows passwords are trivial to bypass
21:06:27 <jonah__> <cn3m[m] "browsers, email clients, you nam"> I wonder if this is always true. Because like on iOS, the built in applications will have special functionality / use hidden system APIs that third-party apps don’t have access to. Which is why we saw like that Mail app exploit in iOS recently.
21:06:34 <cn3m[m]> that is not a relevant bug
21:06:37 <cn3m[m]> <jonah__ "I wonder if this is always true."> we haven't seen a mail exploit
21:06:40 <cn3m[m]> that was flat out false
21:06:56 <cn3m[m]> <sirthinkalot[m] "Not if you use BitLocker"> then MacOS is not effected if you use FileVault
21:07:41 <dolores0[m]> nice
21:07:56 <cn3m[m]> The logic is pedantic
21:07:56 <jonah__> <cn3m[m] "that was flat out false "> CVE-2020-9818, CVE-2020-9819? 🤔🤔
21:07:57 <jonah__> Real enough that they had to be patched in iOS 13.5
21:08:05 <cn3m[m]> Jonah [privacytools.io]: It is always true. You trust Apple to make your hardware and OS to respect your privacy. You should trust them to make a mail client at least from a privacy and malware perspective.
21:08:07 <EssentialChaos[m> <jonah__ "CVE-2020-9818, CVE-2020-9819? 🤔"> A vulnerability is not an exploit, though
21:08:20 <cn3m[m]> Jonah [privacytools.io]: It is not an exploit
21:08:31 <cn3m[m]> That was not an accurate source that shared that
21:08:51 <cn3m[m]> It can't be used as an exploit
21:09:19 <jonah__> Haven’t seen any sources on that
21:09:41 <cn3m[m]> <sirthinkalot[m] "And did nothing"> Actually that is false
21:09:47 <cn3m[m]> they did far more than everyone else years ago much like GrapheneOS
21:09:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> cn3m: mind if I start a private chat with you for more discussion of mostly off-topic (Apple-related) matters?
21:09:57 <cn3m[m]> it is Android who was failing on the clipboard
21:10:03 <cn3m[m]> Android 10 is okay
21:10:11 <cn3m[m]> cyborgninjaneer: yeah that is fine. I am also in SPITE
21:10:40 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS and iOS have been leading on clipboard protections for years
21:10:49 <cn3m[m]> iOS is pulling ahead right now
21:10:56 <cn3m[m]> Android is treading water
21:11:30 <nitroneurons[m]> I have far too many points of trust on my systems and it makes me uneasy
21:11:30 <cn3m[m]> yes, many years late and now iOS is pushing ahead
21:11:56 <pacobell[m]> Any articles on current iOS clipboard innovations?
21:12:03 <pacobell[m]> I'd like to be informed.
21:12:06 <cn3m[m]> <nitroneurons[m] "I have far too many points of tr"> Use Chromium everywhere
21:13:32 <cn3m[m]> pacobell: There are a ton right now on the warnings that will likely kill all woes about clipboard completely dead. I can pull up some stuff it is pretty much what GrapheneOS has been doing for years and what Android 10 just added(that only 10% of phones have)
21:14:14 <teddybears[m]> Yeah and 11 about to come out
21:14:17 <cn3m[m]> transparency is very important to privacy
21:14:39 <cn3m[m]> teddybears: 11 won't help much here
21:14:43 <nitroneurons[m]> ungoogled/chrome on desktop and bromite/vanadium on mobile
21:14:47 <cn3m[m]> not at all actually
21:15:02 <teddybears[m]> I just meant when he said 10%
21:15:11 <cn3m[m]> <nitroneurons[m] "ungoogled/chrome on desktop and "> that isn't so babd
21:15:13 <teddybears[m]> That 11 is about to be out
21:15:17 <pacobell[m]> I don't really care about any Android phones other than Pixels at the moment, anyway.
21:15:45 <cn3m[m]> pacobell: Likely your family would be best off staying on iPhones
21:15:55 <cn3m[m]> the iPhones is general recommendation here for phones
21:16:00 <pacobell[m]> They've all got Pixels as well.
21:16:02 <cn3m[m]> just search the chat
21:16:24 <cn3m[m]> oh I thought you said they were all on iPhones
21:16:40 <pacobell[m]> Nope. I never even mentioned them yet.
21:16:49 <cn3m[m]> In either case you can't go wrong with either GrapheneOS or iOS
21:17:21 <pacobell[m]> They'll never stomach GOS. It compromises too much functionality (Play Services).
21:17:22 <teddybears[m]> i wonder if pixel 4 improved anything besides longer chipset support
21:17:29 <pacobell[m]> I made my choice.
21:17:31 <cn3m[m]> I thought you were pikey
21:17:45 <cn3m[m]> <teddybears[m] "i wonder if pixel 4 improved any"> minor improvements
21:17:55 <teddybears[m]> Like pixel 3 versus 4 in terms of hardware security
21:17:59 <teddybears[m]> Oh ok
21:18:29 <cn3m[m]> no Pixel 3 was a very large leap
21:18:30 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4 is not
21:18:32 <nitroneurons[m]> I like to think I'm not terribly vulnerable but there are so many people contributing to code on every platform and even if they're all under the same banner like apple or microsoft you're still implicitly trusting that they haven't slipped in underhanded stuff
21:19:01 <teddybears[m]> <cn3m[m] "Pixel 4 is not "> Thats what i thought.  So maybe not worth the upgrade huh?
21:19:01 <cn3m[m]> nitroneurons: You trust the firmware makers of the devices too
21:19:04 <nitroneurons[m]> it's probably better than trusting linux distros made by hundreds or thousands of largely unknown volunteers, though
21:19:12 <pacobell[m]> Heh, I still remember seeing the "Underhanded C Contest" 😅
21:19:12 <nitroneurons[m]> <cn3m[m] "nitroneurons: You trust the firm"> right
21:19:19 <cn3m[m]> It doesn't make sense to distrust these companies, but trust the root certs and firmware
21:19:35 <cn3m[m]> You have to trust companies
21:20:08 <teddybears[m]> The pixel 4 in general seems underwhelming if you have a 3
21:20:15 <nitroneurons[m]> very true
21:20:41 <pacobell[m]> And now there's not going to be a 4A?
21:20:44 <cn3m[m]> Fair
21:20:51 <pacobell[m]> Just a jump to 5?
21:21:12 <cn3m[m]> the Pixel 4 is the only Pixel you can buy new from the store
21:21:12 <nitroneurons[m]> I guess all you can try to do is trust minimisation
21:21:21 <cn3m[m]> that is the main appeal
21:21:24 <cn3m[m]> they will launch likely close together
21:21:28 <teddybears[m]> Yeah i mean i love swappa
21:21:30 <nitroneurons[m]> Using any computing device you implicitly trust big tech companies and thousands/millions of devs
21:21:45 <teddybears[m]> Swappa is where i have gotten all my pixels
21:22:05 <pacobell[m]> <teddybears[m] "Yeah i mean i love swappa"> That's where I got my 2XL from an Android Authority columnist 😁
21:22:36 <jonah__> <cn3m[m] "they will launch likely close to"> Lmao - for an advertising company, Google is literally the worst people at marketing their products I’ve ever seen
21:22:37 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 2 has 3 months left right?
21:22:52 <cn3m[m]> <jonah__ "Lmao - for an advertising compan"> the irony
21:22:56 <teddybears[m]> Yeah i like swappa i got a like new pixel 2 and 3 mutiple tikes.  I was able to get my whole family on pixels
21:23:03 <pacobell[m]> <cn3m[m] "Pixel 2 has 3 months left right?"> And not a moment too soon. My battery is starting to fade.
21:23:15 <cn3m[m]> I can't believe how badly they screwed up the facial recognition launch
21:24:02 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4 had a really good chance of being the only phone worth comparing for the average person on security
21:24:11 <pacobell[m]> I was really hoping for more from the radar sensor, but they completely kneecapped that tech.
21:24:37 <teddybears[m]> Yeah plus maybe 5G support could have happened
21:24:50 <cn3m[m]> Pixel devices are so hit and miss
21:24:55 <teddybears[m]> I mean for a flagship it didnt even have 5G
21:25:04 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 2 and 3a really did well, but that is largely it
21:25:21 <pacobell[m]> Indeed. My bro got the 4, tho.
21:25:29 <jonah__> <cn3m[m] "I can't believe how badly they s"> I can’t believe how badly they screwed up <every product launch they are involved with>
21:26:00 <teddybears[m]> Yeah i hope the pixel 5 will help
21:26:05 <pacobell[m]> I still don't get the 3AXL.
21:26:15 <teddybears[m]> They are possibly looking at a slightly more budget snapdragon
21:26:42 <teddybears[m]> Hopefully it will have milimeter wave
21:27:04 <pacobell[m]> So day we all...
21:27:18 <pacobell[m]> <pacobell[m] "So day we all..."> Damnit. No edit.
21:27:44 <teddybears[m]> I would hope the pixel 5 would be a 5G fone hehe
21:27:54 <cn3m[m]> <pacobell[m] "I still don't get the 3AXL."> too small yes
21:28:25 <cn3m[m]> the iPhone 12 Pro Max is so appealing to me 6.7" privacy and security friendly phone. Sign me up
21:28:42 <teddybears[m]> I bought a 3a but it died from my sweat in my pocket
21:28:49 <teddybears[m]> i dont even sweat much
21:29:03 <teddybears[m]> But google warranty said there was water in it
21:29:24 <teddybears[m]> So i go with pixel 3 with water resistence now
21:29:28 <jonah__> Idk I’m gonna be pretty mad if they make the 12 Pro any larger than the 11 Pro
21:30:11 <teddybears[m]> So i hope that 4a has water resist
21:30:49 <cn3m[m]> sirthinkalot: again false
21:30:50 <jonah__> Luckily they rumored that last time around with the 11 Pro and it ended up not being true, since it’s a stupid idea.
21:30:52 <cn3m[m]> you just reboot your phone if you are ever worried about that
21:30:53 <EssentialChaos[m> <jonah__ "Idk I’m gonna be pretty mad if t"> I think, the 12 Pro is supposed to be 6.1"
21:30:55 <teddybears[m]> I even let my pixel 2 sit in a water puddle while i was asleep and it still lived
21:31:09 <teddybears[m]> I had been drinking and dropped it and fell asleep
21:32:44 <teddybears[m]> But the 3a died after a lil sweat
21:35:21 <dolores0[m]> rip
21:35:57 <cx2[m]> <sirthinkalot[m] "iPhones are easily broken into b"> False. Also, maybe don't make a habit of doing things that are interesting to law enforcement?
21:36:21 <teddybears[m]> <cx2[m] "False. Also, maybe don't make a "> Nah i disagree
21:36:32 <teddybears[m]> The cops will arrest u over a single puff of weed
21:36:39 <cn3m[m]> Jonah [privacytools.io]: the 6.1" iPhones are pretty medium sized though
21:36:43 <jonah__> <cn3m[m] "Jonah [privacytools.io]: the 6.1"> The 11 and Xr? Those are terrible. Although they’re mostly terrible because of their massive bezels, idk how they’d be without that, but still probably too big.
21:36:46 <jonah__> Honestly I’d just carry around an iPad all day if I wanted to view things big or I had weak eyes or whatever reason people buy the Max models lol
21:36:50 <teddybears[m]> The cops will arrest u over a single puff
21:36:52 <cn3m[m]> The keyboard man
21:36:57 <cn3m[m]> I wish there would be a Pixel 4a XL
21:37:04 <teddybears[m]> You almost cannot do things not interesting to the pigs
21:37:48 <teddybears[m]> Here they will literally put you into felony prison over a single puff
21:38:12 <cn3m[m]> Reboot your phone whenever you think it is likely to be in anyone's hands but your own
21:38:16 <jonah__> <cn3m[m] "The keyboard man"> You have big fingers I guess. I type 60 WPM on my 11 Pro which seems fast enough for a text.
21:38:17 <teddybears[m]> Thats how america is
21:38:19 <jonah__> <teddybears[m] "The cops will arrest u over a si"> True
21:38:22 <jonah__> Any activity is of interest to law enforcement.
21:38:24 <cn3m[m]> iPhones are notably stronger than everything for encryption resistance beside possibly Pixels
21:38:25 <teddybears[m]> Mass government intrusion
21:38:27 <cn3m[m]> That is firmly in the toss up camp

21:43:20 <teddybears[m]> Where are your sources?
21:43:24 <cn3m[m]> teddybears: no one cares
21:43:25 <cn3m[m]> shut up
21:43:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hi FinnwwwBackFromt, yes, you can. If the handset is unlocked, it should be able to work with any provider.
21:43:34 <teddybears[m]> when i say things i back them up with evidence
21:44:24 <FinnwwwBackFromt> <TheJollyRoger "Hi ¡Finnwww Back From the Dead! "> What do you mean "the handset is unlocked"?
21:45:12 <igioo[m]> You don't want the carrier version of the phone. So like of you bought it through Verizon it might not let you unlock the phone to install graphene
21:45:52 <TheJollyRoger> FinnwwwBackFromt: As long as it's not carrier locked, like if you accidentally bought a Verizon branded one. You do need an unlocked phone to run GrapheneOS, so if it'll run GrapheneOS it should work with any carrier except for Sprint, which if I recall correctly requires you install a proprietary (and highly privileged) service driver into the operating system.
21:46:34 <FinnwwwBackFromt> Cool!
21:46:40 <TheJollyRoger> Interestingly enough, I've heard some anecdotal reports that if you have Verizon, GrapheneOS will work on the Verizon network.
21:46:56 <TheJollyRoger> Just insert your SIM card and let the phone connect.
21:47:28 <TheJollyRoger> However, it's the /devices sold by/ Verizon that won't let you unlock the bootloader and install GrapheneOS.
21:52:37 <jonah__> <TheJollyRoger "Interestingly enough, I've heard"> My Graphene Pixel 3 is on Verizon.
21:52:39 <jonah__> And why wouldn’t it I suppose, identical hardware.

23:24:31 <GlmJitter> For those looking for a Pixel 3 that can be used with GrapheneOS: I purchased a new black 64GB version from 'TTP Retail' on Amazon. Looks like the price went up $10 already.. currently in stock for $379.99 with Prime shipping and free returns.I can confirm that the one I received is OEM unlock-able, and the warranty extends to Apr.

23:26:03 <GlmJitter> It's been a pain to find one of these, new or used. Hope this helps.
