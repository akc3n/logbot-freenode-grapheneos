00:00:14 <cn3m[m]> iOS security and privacy has a ton of misinformation. The kernel, some of the operating system bits(beside UI) are open source, the web engine(internal and safari) are open source, and even the development platforms are open source
00:00:15 <cn3m[m]> The information is not hard to find
00:03:12 <icy-sprite[m]> cn3m: Wait what
00:03:22 <icy-sprite[m]> cn3m: I'm looking at you very funny right now
00:03:41 <radixed9[m]> He is right on all of that
00:04:13 <radixed9[m]> I think over half of iOS is open source(macOS too). The most critical components certainly are
00:04:31 <icy-sprite[m]> I don't know, I find Apple and Open-Source a weird combination
00:04:51 <TheJollyRoger> icy-sprite[m]: who do you think gave BSD a second chance at life?
00:05:14 <radixed9[m]> They have been pushing open source for a long time. Even WebDAV, CalDAV, and CardDAV
00:05:14 <icy-sprite[m]> TheJollyRoger: I'm aware of that. macOS is UNIX based obviously
00:05:23 <icy-sprite[m]> The iOS part is wha surprised me
00:05:27 <TheJollyRoger> Prior to Apple contributing clang BSD had to hold out on an ancient version of gcc because of a licensing incompatibility.
00:05:31 <icy-sprite[m]> what surprised me*
00:05:54 <radixed9[m]> iOS and macOS are both Darwin based which is a full open source operating system
00:06:25 <radixed9[m]> WebKit is forked from KHTML
00:06:36 <radixed9[m]> Chromium forked from that
00:06:54 <radixed9[m]> Apple is definitely near the top as far as important open source juggernaughts go
00:07:34 <radixed9[m]> I got to go
00:07:35 <icy-sprite[m]> A surprise, but a welcome one. Tbh I've always found the Apple eco-system very tempting especially that I want to do tons of creative work. Too bad yer boi is broke right now lol.
00:07:53 <icy-sprite[m]> radixed9: See ya, rad dude.
00:07:59 <TheJollyRoger> icy-sprite[m]: it goes deeper than macOS using BSD as an upstream provider: if it hadn't been for Apple open sourcing clang, it's very likely the BSDs would have gone under a long time ago.
00:08:09 <TheJollyRoger> radixed9[m]: cheers mate.
00:08:36 <radixed9[m]> thanks guys just coding I'll possibly be around a bit
00:08:56 <cn3m[m]> I'm invested in both ecosystems
00:09:08 <cn3m[m]> Both GrapheneOS and iOS are awesome and there's a lot of misinformation about both
00:09:46 <TheJollyRoger> It's human nature to want to separate everything into arbitrary, simplistic "good" and "bad" boxes. Nuance tends to be discarded in doing so.
00:12:14 <icy-sprite[m]> cn3m: Elaborate more
00:12:43 <icy-sprite[m]> What are the most common misunderstandings on Apple?
00:12:54 <cn3m[m]> You saw a lot of misinformation about iOS here. We see misinformation on Reddit and YouTube all the time about GrapheneOS
00:13:13 <jiibus[m]> So only been on Graphene like 2 weeks, with the update, will there be a notification about it?
00:14:08 <cn3m[m]> <icy-sprite[m] "What are the most common misunde"> That it's insecure, completely a black box, that it's data mining. It's all false/misleading
00:14:15 <cn3m[m]> <jiibus[m] "So only been on Graphene like 2 "> You will get a notification to reboot
00:15:00 <BeingFrey[m]> <jiibus[m] "So only been on Graphene like 2 "> Hi there.. How do you like GrapheneOS so far?
00:15:09 <TheJollyRoger> jiibus[m]: yes, it'll ask you. If you want, you can set your update client to only allow downloading of updates when you are on an unmetered network like wifi.
00:15:24 <TheJollyRoger> So you don't accidentally end up using more data than you intend to.
00:15:37 <jiibus[m]> <BeingFrey[m] "Hi there.. How do you like Graph"> I am enamored. The peace of mind that comes with knowing there's no google touch on my phone is.....scrumtrulescent
00:16:37 <cn3m[m]> @Icy-Sprite ;^): ultimately everyone should make informed decisions, but it's a linkless evidence free shouting match on the internet. People are obsessed with privacy and security theater and use known bad metrics
00:16:39 <BeingFrey[m]> <jiibus[m] "I am enamored. The peace of mind"> Oh sweet! ðŸ˜†  I just ordered my Pixel 3a last night, due to arrive sometime next week.  I plan to install GOS on that phone; first time user.
00:17:17 <BeingFrey[m]> <BeingFrey[m] "Oh sweet! ðŸ˜†  I just ordered my "> Did you install GOS on your phone yourself?
00:17:17 <jiibus[m]> BeingFrey: The most difficult thing for me to replace was Google Voice...took me a while, but I found jmp.chat. I like it a lot
00:18:04 <sheruleeya[m]> Which is the best privacy and security wise, where I can isolate its activity from other sites and stop it from communicating on other apps: A webapp wrapper (such as Frost/Twidere?) (of social media like fb, twitter) or a PWA in Vanadium/Bromite (of a social media, like fb, twitter)
00:18:24 <jiibus[m]> <BeingFrey[m] "Did you install GOS on your phon"> Yea, it's a very straightforward process. Probably the most difficult thing, which isn't all that hard, is getting the android tools on your computer properly to be able to flash your phone.
00:18:28 <BeingFrey[m]> <jiibus[m] "BeingFrey: The most difficult th"> Oh very good to know.  Thanks!  I check into that too. ðŸ˜‹  I've been discovering new programs and services to replace my Google features/services myself.
00:18:40 <TheJollyRoger> sheruleeya[m]:  a separate profile.
00:18:45 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium is notably ahead on securitysheruleeya
00:18:47 <cn3m[m]> Using it for PWAs is amazing
00:19:07 <BeingFrey[m]> <BeingFrey[m] "Oh very good to know.  Thanks!  "> I've discovered that www.Mailbox.org is the most perfect email provider to replace Gmail.
00:19:26 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "sheruleeya:  a separate profile."> Sperate profiles aren't as secure as Vanadium PWAs and they are less convenient
00:19:32 <BeingFrey[m]> <BeingFrey[m] "I've discovered that www.Mailbox"> And to replace G Pay with Zelle.
00:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> cn3m[m]: ah whoop.
00:19:47 <sheruleeya[m]> <TheJollyRoger "sheruleeya:  a separate profile."> Alright, quite thinking about it. Although I might have to use VPN extra there, which would definitely mess the VPN block though...
00:19:49 <BeingFrey[m]> Loving it so far too!
00:19:52 <jiibus[m]> BeingFrey: Nice! I was thinking about what provider to replace gmail with. Was considering fastmail
00:20:31 <BeingFrey[m]> <jiibus[m] "BeingFrey: Nice! I was thinking "> With Mailbox.org, you get 30 days free trial and let me tell you YOU will fall in LOVE!
00:20:40 <BeingFrey[m]> It has everything Gmail has.
00:20:44 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "Sperate profiles aren't as secur"> Been leaning on PWA, but yeah, I would use Vanadium. Won't they easily fingerprint that I use Pixel though?
00:20:46 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "cn3m: ah whoop."> Profiles aren't going to protect the kernel which is definitely not one of the strongest points of GrapheneOS
00:21:12 <BeingFrey[m]> <BeingFrey[m] "With Mailbox.org, you get 30 day"> Email, contacts, drive, calendar and more.
00:21:12 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium and userland hardening are excellent and PWAs are getting a lot of benefit
00:21:26 <cn3m[m]> <sheruleeya[m] "Been leaning on PWA, but yeah, I"> Vanadium is designed to blend in with the average Chrome and Pixel user
00:21:31 <sheruleeya[m]> * Been leaning on PWA, but yeah, I would use Vanadium. Won't they easily fingerprint that I use Pixel though?
00:21:31 <sheruleeya[m]> Its pros and cons over Bromite PWA should be the same on Bromite vs Vanadium I guess?
00:21:45 <cn3m[m]> Mozilla found only 3.5% of sites even use fingerprinting and it's very basic
00:21:48 <BeingFrey[m]> <cn3m[m] "Vanadium and userland hardening "> The Mailbox drive is share-able too.
00:21:51 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "Vanadium is designed to blend in"> Oh alright. Guess it was by design, and will try that ^^
00:22:01 <sheruleeya[m]> * Oh alright. Guess it was by design, and will try that.
00:22:06 <cn3m[m]> I wouldn't worry about it
00:22:26 <jiibus[m]> For the luddites among us, what's a PWA?
00:22:26 <icy-sprite[m]> Beating fingerprinting would be having the same setup as everyone else. Wouldn't using Safari on iOS be better technically?
00:22:30 <BeingFrey[m]> <BeingFrey[m] "With Mailbox.org, you get 30 day"> The Mailbox drive is share-able too.
00:23:01 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <jiibus[m] "For the luddites among us, what'"> You take a website and you stick it in your app launcher and give it an icon. When you tap the app icon it just takes you to the website basically.
00:23:06 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "Mozilla found only 3.5% of sites"> Already read that a bit, but guess social media site(s) knowing Pixel is the least of my worries for now
00:23:17 <M0xC0ncord[m]> You just cram a website into an app basically.
00:23:24 <jiibus[m]> Oh nice!
00:23:48 <cn3m[m]> <sheruleeya[m] "Oh alright. Guess it was by desi"> The goal is to achieve what Safari and iPhones do so well. pixels have 1/30th the market share, but it's better than nothing
00:23:53 <sheruleeya[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "You take a website and you stick"> It's the "add to home screen" option on sites.
00:24:07 <TheJollyRoger> BeingFrey[m]: check to see if Mailbox.org passes E-mail spoof testing.
00:24:24 <cn3m[m]> <icy-sprite[m] "Beating fingerprinting would be "> Safari on iOS is second to Tor of course
00:24:34 <TheJollyRoger> There should be some E-mail spoof tests you should be able to check for DMARC alignment/DKIM/SPF/Internal E-mail validation.
00:25:03 <sheruleeya[m]> * It's the "add to home screen" option on sites.
00:25:03 <sheruleeya[m]> Edit: Not all of sites have PWA as far s I know.
00:25:06 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "There should be some E-mail spoo"> there are some, but they are that indepth sadly
00:26:30 <sheruleeya[m]> * It's the "add to home screen" option on sites.
00:26:30 <sheruleeya[m]> Edit: Not all of sites have PWA as far as I know.
00:27:20 <TheJollyRoger> cn3m[m]: yeah but most of the "Priavcy focused!" E-mail providers seem to not even go for the low hanging fruit, after s?trcat showed me earlier, I try checking for these first.
00:27:40 <TheJollyRoger> As it turns out my current inbox provider failed like DMARC/DKIM/SPF/Internal mail validation so I'm trying to find a new one.
00:27:58 <icy-sprite[m]> Gmail is very secure but the privacy is bad.
00:28:21 <cn3m[m]> <icy-sprite[m] "Gmail is very secure but the pri"> Source?
00:28:33 <icy-sprite[m]> Gmail scans your e-mails
00:28:41 <icy-sprite[m]> AFAIK
00:28:44 <cn3m[m]> Google changed their privacy policy on email
00:28:48 <cn3m[m]> I believe them
00:29:07 <jiibus[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "You take a website and you stick"> So you basically just use the "add to home screen" option to do this?
00:29:07 <cn3m[m]> In 2017 it's under the G-Suite license
00:29:14 <cn3m[m]> That's what they use for schools where they legally can't
00:29:23 <icy-sprite[m]> I honestly don't. For a company to collect location data when you have it turned off it's very dishonest.
00:29:33 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <jiibus[m] "So you basically just use the "a"> Kind of?
00:29:54 <icy-sprite[m]> That's why when people say "Oh well they stopped, and they changed the policy" I just don't buy it. Sorry mate.
00:30:14 <sheruleeya[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "Kind of?"> Pretty much, as far as I know. Though something like Reddit has no PWA, despite being added on home screen
00:30:50 <cyborgninjaneer[> I believe that much, but what's to stop them from turning it back on? Plus gmail has pissed me off too many times after they tightened security.
00:31:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> Google is very good at locking me out of my own shit.
00:31:32 <sheruleeya[m]> <icy-sprite[m] "That's why when people say "Oh w"> It has to be tested and check their ad personalization. Maybe it can be proved or disproved there.
00:31:41 <cn3m[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Google is very good at locking m"> Yes they are very security first
00:31:49 <cyborgninjaneer[> I've lost a couple of older emails entirely, and nearly lost my previous main email, which I have since chnaged.

00:32:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> I dont use Google for anything anymore. I don't trust them, but more than that I don't like their stuff.
00:32:55 <icy-sprite[m]> I actually like Google's eco-system, I just don't trust the company.
00:33:09 <cyborgninjaneer[> I dislike both.
00:33:19 <icy-sprite[m]> I used to use Keep religiously for my notes, until I started seeing ads about things I wrote there
00:33:29 <icy-sprite[m]> creeped the hell out of me.
00:33:44 <cyborgninjaneer[> Sounds like Google Drice
00:33:47 <sheruleeya[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "I dont use Google for anything a"> Somehow ironically, it took Google phones to remove Google (invasive play services and apps) and replace with secure and private Android OS without their softwares

00:39:43 <icy-sprite[m]> sheruleeya: Maybe next time :^)
00:42:00 <sheruleeya[m]> Alright. Honestly, it's quite hard to find cheap enough Pixels outside US
00:42:36 <cn3m[m]> If you can't get a Pixel just get an iPhone even a few years old model. Don't bother with Android
00:43:33 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "If you can't get a Pixel just ge"> Yeah, that shouldn't be too bad, although I  already had GrapheneOS.
00:44:05 <sheruleeya[m]> Doubt I could offer them this with average peeps
00:44:24 <icy-sprite[m]> The new SE is pretty cheap
00:44:31 <icy-sprite[m]> I mean 400$ ain't bad.
00:44:36 <jcpicard32[m]> Yeah. Best deal in phones rn tbh
00:44:57 <cn3m[m]> $400 for 6 years of support is insanely good
00:45:09 <sheruleeya[m]> <icy-sprite[m] "I mean 400$ ain't bad."> Yeah, I meant iOS is more easily marketable for them for reasonable privacy and security
00:45:09 <icy-sprite[m]> I was really surprised when it came out. They outdid themselves this time ngl.
00:45:14 <jiibus[m]> Personally I just can't deal with iOS, despite the privacy advantages vs android. The whole UX is just bleh to me.
00:45:28 <jcpicard32[m]> The fact that my first gen SE is getting iOS 14 is pretty incredible
00:45:33 <icy-sprite[m]> The UI is butter smooth
00:45:42 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "$400 for 6 years of support is i"> Yeah, you are right. Support time-wise, it beats Pixel out of the water

00:46:46 <jiibus[m]> <cn3m[m] "iOS 14 beta fixed about 95% of t"> I'm referring to how everything is done on the OS. From how apps are managed to how the system settings are. Just so unappealing to me.

00:46:49 <icy-sprite[m]> Like oof, finally.
00:46:59 <icy-sprite[m]> The privacy features are great though.
00:48:07 <cn3m[m]> Thankfully we have two privacy and security heavyweights with GrapheneOS and iOS
00:48:12 <cn3m[m]> Choice is always good
00:48:23 <jcpicard32[m]> Yeah. Very impressed with what I saw during WWDC the other day.
00:48:23 <icy-sprite[m]> <cn3m[m] "Thankfully we have two privacy a"> Agreed!
00:48:26 <jcpicard32[m]> Feel pretty blessed to be able to use GOS and iOS

00:48:39 <sheruleeya[m]> * Yeah, at least I get to keep to be in Android.
00:49:00 <sheruleeya[m]> I still like the freedom it offers
00:49:28 <sheruleeya[m]> * I still like the freedom it (GOS) offers, relatively more compared to iOS.
00:49:30 <icy-sprite[m]> I dual wield because, if it were for me I'd get an iPhone and a Graphene Pixel lol
00:49:31 <jiibus[m]> Yea, that's my chief draw to android. Similar reasons why I went to Linux
00:49:39 <brenneke[m]> <cn3m[m] "iOS 14 beta fixed about 95% of t"> I always thought of iPhone as being more a communist device.
00:49:41 <icy-sprite[m]> Now i'm stuck with an old sony and samsung lol
00:49:49 <jcpicard32[m]> @Icy-Sprite ;^): That's exactly what I do. I have an iPad too :)
00:53:21 <jiibus[m]> What launcher do you guys use? I found Shade Launcher and it's pretty decent.
00:54:07 <TheJollyRoger> Outside of the Carl Gustaf M84 Recoilless Rifle, I have no idea what a launcher is or why anyone would need one, so I'm gonna say I don't know.
00:54:28 <jiibus[m]> Ha! I mean home launcher
00:54:43 <jiibus[m]>  * Ha! I mean home launcher/ app.
00:55:10 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, I just use what comes with the operating system :p.
00:55:31 <jiibus[m]> I always like to see what's available.
00:57:20 <cn3m[m]> <jiibus[m] "What launcher do you guys use? I"> I use the default only for privacy reasons
00:57:32 <cn3m[m]> iOS doesn't let you change launcher for a very good reason
00:58:20 <jiibus[m]> How would one investigate if a 3rd party home app has privacy issues aside from permissions it asks for?
00:59:00 <TheJollyRoger> jiibus[m]: the easiest way is to set up an intercepting proxy and see what it connects to and what it sends
00:59:06 <cn3m[m]> <jiibus[m] "How would one investigate if a 3"> You really can't there's never a way to be fully certain of any software
00:59:10 <TheJollyRoger> Although that's really low-hanging fruit.
00:59:17 <cn3m[m]> If your OS provides you software you should use that
00:59:21 <TheJollyRoger> Or you could perform reverse engineering on the binary.
00:59:32 <cn3m[m]> Almost exclusively
00:59:43 <TheJollyRoger> By using a disassembler to turn it back into assembly code and then reverse-engineering it in assembler.
01:00:34 <TheJollyRoger> If this sounds too difficult, then just use the defaults as cn3m[m] says; remember the golden rule of opsec is the less "custom tuning" you do, the better off you're going to be.
01:01:13 <jiibus[m]> Yea, I know. I'm just such a freedom loving guy lol. I am cognizant of the risks that come with that, though.
01:02:26 <jiibus[m]> TheJollyRoger: Never got into the whole reverse engineering deal, but I'm a technical guy so it's not necessarily off limits to me.
01:02:52 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. It's too technical for me :P.
01:03:16 <jiibus[m]> But talk of assembly gets the juices flowing!
01:08:30 <cn3m[m]> This is such an underrated guide https://techsolidarity.org/resources/basic_security.htm it's a shame
01:11:01 <icy-sprite[m]> How the heck do you even cross border with electronics lmao
01:11:10 <icy-sprite[m]> you guys have that TSA stuff it's creeeepy
01:11:18 <icy-sprite[m]> Here no one cares luckily.
01:11:48 <cn3m[m]> If you are a US citizen you're fine
01:11:56 <icy-sprite[m]> Maybe you should send them as a product delivery to someone you know there?
01:12:05 <icy-sprite[m]> I'm not US citizen.
01:12:18 <renlord> then you're not fine.
01:12:42 <jiibus[m]> The worst part about it is "ports of entry", where all the draconian measures can be enacted in the US, can be considered anywhere within 100 miles of the border. Which is a huge chunk of the population
01:13:01 <renlord> the US: if you're not one of us, get fucked.
01:13:01 <icy-sprite[m]> Man this is so shit
01:13:23 <icy-sprite[m]> Ok how the hell do I get my phone and laptop there then if I were to ever travel
01:13:32 <icy-sprite[m]> Should I just backup everything online?
01:13:33 <jiibus[m]> Mail them to a friend
01:13:41 <jiibus[m]> and go with wiped devices
01:13:44 <icy-sprite[m]> I was thinking of Mailing too
01:13:51 <icy-sprite[m]> but I wasn't sure
01:13:55 <icy-sprite[m]> if it's a good idea
01:14:01 <icy-sprite[m]> Mails get checked but how throughly?
01:14:21 <jiibus[m]> Electronics generally don't rate too much scrutiny from my understanding
01:14:33 <renlord> send some durians in the mail
01:14:57 <icy-sprite[m]> maybe as a product package, that'll be a good camouflage? lol
01:15:06 <icy-sprite[m]> <renlord "send some durians in the mail"> Fuck durrians :(
01:15:50 <jiibus[m]> <cn3m[m] "If you are a US citizen you're f"> Not necessarily. Some absurd shit happens to journalists and people who the US gov't thinks interact with "unfavorables".
01:20:40 <defconanon12[m]> I will add on activists, journalists, whistleblowers, and anyone that the government deems as unfavorable is not welcomed in a lot of countries.
01:20:56 <defconanon12[m]> They also have less protections depending on where you are at.
01:21:04 <jiibus[m]> Yea, very true
01:24:26 <defconanon12[m]> For an example hackers in NSA docs are labeled as extremist group.
01:28:34 <defconanon12[m]> Wow I almost got pwned.
01:28:43 <icy-sprite[m]> Lmao what
01:28:44 <icy-sprite[m]> why
01:29:13 <defconanon12[m]> JS execution. Almost ruined my Host OS on my desktop.
01:29:36 <icy-sprite[m]> Oooookaaaaaaaaay
01:30:20 <jiibus[m]> DO TELL
01:30:30 <jiibus[m]> Should I get some popcorn?
01:31:02 <defconanon12[m]> Yeah one of my applications were compromised. Discord client. Not much to say there. Discord is very faulty on it's own right.
01:34:16 <defconanon12[m]> Computer rebooted after I opened up Discord. Might have to fresh install.
01:35:35 <defconanon12[m]> What is weird is the malicious code failed so I might be fine.
01:36:04 <icy-sprite[m]> Omg delete ur whole existance now
01:36:39 <defconanon12[m]> Lol that is how you become more of a target if you delete everything. That is just my view.
01:37:20 <icy-sprite[m]> dissapears
01:37:57 <concat[m]> <defconanon12[m] "Lol that is how you become more "> How can you target something that doesn't exist?
01:38:10 <concat[m]> That's what deleting your whole existence is supposed to mean no?
01:38:13 <CWO[m]> <defconanon12[m] "Computer rebooted after I opened"> How do you know it was an exploit and not just a bug?
01:38:36 <defconanon12[m]> concat: Talking about mass deleting your personal accounts mainly.
01:41:11 <defconanon12[m]> CWO: There is one line of code in the JS execution that didn't look right. Didn't know where it came from. I don't think it is normal to have an anonymous code line. A script kiddy was trying to get to me I assume.
01:42:41 <icy-sprite[m]> Is it possible for someone to take hold of your machine through javascript?
01:43:48 <defconanon12[m]> Yes. It has almost happened to me before. This is when I was a lot less insecure with my devices.
01:44:34 <icy-sprite[m]> Is it possible for a malware to presist even after formatting your computer?
01:44:55 <defconanon12[m]> Yes, depending how smart the malware is.
01:45:08 <icy-sprite[m]> Oh shit
01:45:30 <icy-sprite[m]> What if you formatted and shredded using DBAN?
01:45:37 <defconanon12[m]> Sometimes doing a fresh install is not enough. That is usually rare but it happens.
01:45:44 <defconanon12[m]> DBAN gets it done.
01:46:02 <icy-sprite[m]> Phew~~
01:48:19 <defconanon12[m]> Gotta love DBAN.
01:48:39 <icy-sprite[m]> Yeah
01:48:45 <icy-sprite[m]> Thanks for the information dude
01:48:55 <icy-sprite[m]> GTG now, see you around folks !
01:49:12 <defconanon12[m]> Huh it corrupted my CBS.log.
01:49:37 <defconanon12[m]> Maybe that was already a problem though.
01:49:46 <defconanon12[m]> I will do a deep dive here in a sec.
02:13:00 <cn3m[m]> This Reddit thread is horrifically bad https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/hfb5w7/qubesos_alternatives/
02:15:28 <jknsec[m]> Hey I'm getting two Signal updates today on GOS. Download one earlier and got another tonight. Am on my home network, not in public.
02:16:38 <jknsec[m]> Since I'm not in public or near any protests or anything like that I don't think its bogus or anything. Was just checking for corroboration.
02:16:45 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: Okay just title scares me. I am ready though. xD
02:18:13 <jknsec[m]> Fucking lol
02:18:42 <jknsec[m]> "this is a joke, I won't take it seriously :)"
02:19:12 <cn3m[m]> Yeah my comment was popular... Not
02:20:29 <defconanon12[m]> And this is why there is some redditors will never learn.
02:22:14 <cn3m[m]> I got downvoted for recommending Windows Defender for security and privacy. If you trust Windows and not Windows Defender you have some real threat modeling issues
02:23:22 <defconanon12[m]> I think Prism really throws people off Windows when they first find out about it. Also, Win 10 enterprise makes sense.
02:23:46 <jknsec[m]> Linux/Firefox/LineageOS/Toxic Power User mindsets are very toxic and very hard to get out of. I don't trust Apple or Microsoft as far as I can throw them but I do trust the quality of the products they make, especially when geared toward businesses/governments.
02:24:00 <defconanon12[m]> * I think Prism really throws people off Windows when they first find out about it. Also, Win 10 Enterprise makes sense.
02:24:21 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I think Prism really throws peop"> Linux hands out vulnerabilities to the US government and people don't care. Live with it you have to trust the US government
02:24:22 <cn3m[m]> Yeah it's just weird haha
02:25:12 <jknsec[m]> I think what people misunderstand about PRISM is that it is a much greater systemic issue and not something that you can really avoid if you live in the US or, well, anywhere.
02:25:48 <defconanon12[m]> You hit the nail on the head. jknsec "Oh just because it is open source that means it is secure and safe!"
02:25:51 <defconanon12[m]> xD
02:26:51 <cn3m[m]> I care about the software maker far more than the license
02:27:57 <jiibus[m]> <cn3m[m] "Linux hands out vulnerabilities "> I understand that RedHat collaborates with the gubmint, but do you have any links to the specific claim that they hand over zero days?
02:29:31 <jknsec[m]> Instead of trying to be ultra-private what you do is just gear your toolset toward whatever your threat model is and just do whatever you're ideologically comfortable with. I like GrapheneOS because of Daniel, the community, and just the general nature of it. I like it better than iOS simply because it appeals to me in some ways that iOS doesn't.
02:31:20 <jknsec[m]> I think most people 1) Don't understand threat modeling 2) Are grossly misinformed 3) Feel that they lack power and agency, and as such are trying to compensate by adopt such toxic mindsets.
02:31:37 <jknsec[m]> Plus, you know, some people are just dicks, lol.
02:33:15 <cn3m[m]> <jiibus[m] "I understand that RedHat collabo"> Linux Foundation has many security partners. I know for sure one is Google for Android and that Android has the US and Chinese governments as partners
02:34:31 <jiibus[m]> cn3m:  I get that, I just honestly don't understand on what basis you're worried about red hat working with the US gov't
02:35:25 <jiibus[m]> And how are they different from Microsoft
02:35:41 <cn3m[m]> <jiibus[m] "cn3m:  I get that, I just honest"> Ultimately I'm not
02:36:16 <cn3m[m]> Root certs and the broken root of trust on the web is so screwed up
02:37:49 <jiibus[m]> What do you mean, specifically?
02:39:31 <cn3m[m]> I could write a short book on web verification
02:40:06 * JTL is sad key pnning is gone from browsers. Far from perfect sure, but it was closer to a step in the right direction
02:40:27 <JTL> pinning*
02:40:40 <jiibus[m]> Perhaps an overview, then? lol
02:41:11 <jiibus[m]> Because I'm totally ignorant of what you're talking about
02:41:32 <JTL> Moxie Marlinspike had a project called TACK many years ago, but it never had a formal implemenation iirc and he was waiting to see how HPKP turned out. Now that it's gone. I feel like he needs to come out of the woodwork :P
02:41:38 <JTL> (but I know he's busy with Signal these days)
02:41:58 <cn3m[m]> JTL: tofu is awesome
02:42:51 <cn3m[m]> jiibus: it's pretty complicated. It will take me a bit I'm half writing a criticism of LastPass right now
02:43:08 <jiibus[m]> No worries!
02:43:16 <JTL> cn3m[m]: Ahahaha fun :D
03:12:46 <cn3m[m]> jiibus: okay so what do you know right now?
03:13:24 <cn3m[m]> Do you know what a certificate authority is? Do you know how domain verification works? Do you know what DANE and other email mean and entail
03:13:25 <defconanon12[m]> Found what happened to me just now.
03:13:28 <defconanon12[m]> https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-client-turned-into-a-password-stealer-by-updated-malware/
03:14:36 <cn3m[m]> defconanon12: don't install game chests
03:14:37 <cn3m[m]> Cheats*
03:15:02 <defconanon12[m]> I didn't.
03:15:11 <defconanon12[m]> Not sure how it happened.
03:15:23 <cn3m[m]> Did you read the article?
03:15:43 <cn3m[m]> It's a Trojan
03:15:43 <defconanon12[m]> I said it is related to my issue.
03:17:03 <defconanon12[m]> It is similar. It didn't prompt me to log back in.
03:17:42 <defconanon12[m]> Though my Discord client got modified without me realizing it.
03:19:31 <defconanon12[m]> I knew that update was fishy. It happened automatically too. I was like wait Discord doesn't have an update.
03:20:57 <jknsec[m]> Speaking of that dubious Signal update just disappeared
03:21:02 <jknsec[m]> Odd
03:21:56 <defconanon12[m]> Huh sounds like a modified Signal but not sure.
03:22:08 <defconanon12[m]> jknsec: Did you check the fingerprint?
03:23:29 <jknsec[m]> Of the update? I check the update for the original, yeah. Maybe I need to reinstall it again.
03:23:55 <jknsec[m]> *checked the fingerprint of the original version
03:25:13 <defconanon12[m]> As far as I know my Host OS on desktop is not compromised.
03:28:53 <jknsec[m]> Huh. Either Signal is maliciously modified, that was a bogus update, or that was a glitch. I am currently on the latest update as of earlier today
03:29:45 <jknsec[m]> I'll delete it and set it again if that's best.
03:30:11 <cn3m[m]> It's doesn't sound odd could be a bug
03:30:14 <cn3m[m]> The rollback protection and their careful signing process will keep you safe
03:30:47 <jknsec[m]> That's what I figured considering I verified the initial fingerprint
03:31:27 <defconanon12[m]> Yeah if it is the same fingerprint you should be good.
03:31:59 <defconanon12[m]> I wish more apps adopted fingerprinting to be honest.
03:33:38 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I wish more apps adopted fingerp"> All apps do, it's TOFU from your hopefully trusted store
03:33:52 <cn3m[m]> You can check publicly for the fingerprint
03:34:10 <cn3m[m]> Exodus Privacy does this for Google Play and F-Droid is easy to check
03:35:37 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: I never heard of Exodus Privacy care to elaborate? I know you can scan these places. Just don't know how.
03:36:47 <cn3m[m]> It's a website(not that helpful actually) that checks for known trackers in apps
03:36:51 <cn3m[m]> They show the fingerprint for every app on the play store
03:37:27 <cn3m[m]> The known trackers bit is obviously privacy theater
03:39:45 <jknsec[m]> but my mownero wallet has n-no known trawckers!!!!
03:40:20 <jknsec[m]> why would exodus do this I'm literally crying and shaking rn
03:43:48 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: Yeah cause in reality how can you know all trackers. You will always be missing some.
03:44:13 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon12[m] "cn3m: Yeah cause in reality how "> Exactly
03:54:39 <defconanon12[m]> Someone gain access to a Discord server and did this. That is just me guessing on what happened. I haven't downloaded any suspicious files lately.
03:54:59 <TheJollyRoger> jknsec[m]: stop! Don't uninstall the original. When you first installed it, if you installed one you were able to verify out of band, that certificate should be pinned.
03:58:48 <defconanon12[m]> This is why I don't use auto connect my Host OS would have been compromised.
04:12:14 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: You know you are right about Windows Defender. I used to use Avast and that tracks the shit of you. Even puts trackers and ads in your emails. Mainly Gmail as far as I know.
04:14:07 <defconanon12[m]> It even installs extensions in your browser after you go through the installation process.
04:17:25 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon12[m] "cn3m: You know you are right abo"> They all do and they all have security and privacy issues
04:19:46 <defconanon12[m]> I am surprised those redditors don't hear you out. Boggles my mind sometimes but I used to be one of them. Accepting Linux as security, privacy, and anonymity.
04:20:22 <defconanon12[m]> Even technical inclined users fall for that bs.
04:20:25 <cn3m[m]> Windows Defender is the only one with decent sandboxing and safe scanning. All the other ones have some massive architectural flaws
04:21:44 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I am surprised those redditors d"> Yeah most people who do research don't have the time or energy to deal with echo chambers
04:23:34 <defconanon12[m]> It is really the people who don't keep up with technology, security, and privacy news. They just expect Reddit to give it to them or some other social media platform. To be handed this "power".
04:25:05 <defconanon12[m]> If they don't know how to use said tool that is poor OPSEC.
04:37:24 <jknsec[m]> TheJollyRoger Rest assured I didn't do anything to my Signal
04:47:02 <TheJollyRoger> jknsec[m]: whew!
04:49:25 <TheJollyRoger> CTS has been running for six hours now. Seems to be running the camera test cases. I'm looking forward to running this a second time...
05:24:39 <dallemon[m]> TheJollyRoger: hey :) do you have any suggestions as to why my device disconnects after X hours of CTS?
05:27:26 <TheJollyRoger> Hey dallemon[m] oh huh. I don't!
05:27:37 <TheJollyRoger> I haven't seen that happen just yet, I will keep my eyes open!
05:34:34 <dallemon[m]> TheJollyRoger: I typically leave it running over night. When I get back to the laptop next morning it's completed CTS but skipped a bunch of tests because it disconnected. Also it's not just running arm-v8 but also arm-v7a tests, is this expected?
05:36:03 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. I actually don't know, myself.
05:54:05 <dallemon[m]> Btw the behaviour is the same regardless of having Android studio installed. So I don't think it's necessary for running CTS as long as you have the tools installed and keep them up to date
06:46:15 <rioot[m]> What's the best way to block some apps from accessing the internet on GraphineOS? Given that I need to run Mullvad VPN always.
06:47:09 <TheJollyRoger> rioot[m]: slide the "Network" permission to off.
06:48:37 <TheJollyRoger> After installing the app, press and hold it, then tap information. Under there you should see the permissions. Network and Sensors permission will always be there and always be granted by default because they are nonstandard and unique to GrapheneOS; apps have no way to request them unless they are specifically coded for GrapheneOS, so to ensure compatibility they are granted by default. You
06:48:38 <TheJollyRoger> can deny them prior to launching the app though.
06:54:01 <rioot[m]> TheJollyRoger: thank you, that was really help. I used to block the apps using Netguard  firewall, but I can't use it if I want to use VPN.
06:54:18 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
06:57:41 <rioot[m]> Is there any way to install add-ons on vanadium?
06:58:31 <TheJollyRoger> Haven't tried. It isn't recommended.
07:38:23 <cn3m[m]> <rioot[m] "Is there any way to install add-"> If you need addons you would have to use the mobile Ungoogled Chromium, but that's not recommended. I haven't audited how they handle extensions personally
08:09:27 <Guest75150> Hi Guys. I'm stuck at one point in the installation. Can someone help me?
08:14:10 <cn3m[m]> <Guest75150 "Hi Guys. I'm stuck at one point "> Are you using the official guide on the website?
08:17:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guest75150: yes, just don't ask to ask next time
08:24:12 <Guest75150> i use the guide from "techlore @ youtube"
08:24:37 <Guest75150> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc
08:26:48 <Guest75150> 8:58 min. When I click (flash.all), the input window opens very briefly and closes again. No installation like on the video ..
08:45:33 <fll[m]> Guest75150: better follow this: https://grapheneos.org/install
08:45:33 <fll[m]> It is up to date
08:48:53 <cn3m[m]> The official website is the only good option
08:56:11 <Guest75150> OK thanks. I'll try it
09:06:55 <Guest75150> wo trage ich den pfad ein?

09:18:20 <fll[m]> > where do I enter the path?
09:18:20 <fll[m]> In PowerShell
10:56:40 <jiibus[m]> Does the update go out in rolling waves? I ask because I have yet to get prompted to restart.
11:09:03 <cn3m[m]> <jiibus[m] "Does the update go out in rollin"> It checks every 4 hours some phones get it first
11:12:38 <jiibus[m]> If I manually check should I see that there's an update? Because it does nothing when I tap on "check for updates".
11:14:09 <cn3m[m]> I am not certain
11:14:18 <cn3m[m]> Check the website
11:20:07 <jiibus[m]> I did. I'll probably just end up adb sideloading it.
11:24:17 <thelearner[m]> jiibus: just wait a day. Notification usually shows then. Depends though.
11:27:15 <renlord> fll[m]: %PATH%?

13:09:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw
13:09:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Does eSIM survive factory resets?
13:09:54 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Which app do you use for checking app signatures?
13:09:55 <dallemon[m]> anupritaisno1: i think it asks if you want to wipe them when using stock os
13:10:22 <dallemon[m]> don't think grapheneos has support for esim, yet
13:40:20 <cdesai> yep it survives just fine if you don't tick that option
13:40:31 <cdesai> can go stock -> aosp just fine too, even lock / unlock in between
13:40:56 <cdesai> on stock setupwizard detects it, and on aosp once esim is enabled you just need to go to Settings -> Mobile network -> Add to have it reboot and get detected
13:41:01 <jiibus[m]> <rioot[m] "Is it OK to install and use wire"> Depends on your VPN provider. Wireguard is generally faster because of less overhead.
13:45:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dallemon[m] "don't think grapheneos has suppo"> Don't worry I'll be trying to add supoort
13:45:47 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: fyi it works here on Calyx even when microg is disabled
13:46:05 <cdesai> so it might also work with that minimal wrapper available for google camera
13:46:15 <cdesai> or something similar.
13:46:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: pixel 4?
13:46:23 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: 3, 3a, 4 all.
13:47:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> You picking anything specific from lineageos?
13:47:47 <cdesai> just the two Euicc apps and permissions, so check our apv and device - should have it all.
13:49:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah
13:49:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> You mean the EUICC app, the 2 .img files and the xml that declares support
13:49:29 <cdesai> yeah
13:58:40 <alzxjm[m]1> <cdesai "so it might also work with that "> What does that minimal wrapper for Gcam do?
15:53:58 <sheruleeya[m]> What should one look for when using beta channels, besides bugs?

17:25:27 <dallemon[m]> defconanon12: sounds like a reinstall would be a good idea
17:29:21 <defconanon12[m]> dallemon: Everything is good. I cleaned everything out. I don't have a rootkit or anything. I checked.
18:03:08 <jfbourdeau1> Calendar /  Agenda : hi all, how most of you are handling your Agenda on GOS ? No syncing anymore with clould provider ?  You simply backup your phone from time to time to not loose your appointments ?   tks in advance for any useful feedback 
18:05:58 <jiibus[m]> Etesync is a good tool for syncing your calendar & contacts
18:06:28 <jfbourdeau1> tks jiibus[m]  I will google , read and may be  try tks !
18:14:02 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. The CTS is still going!
18:15:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: is it stuck?
18:15:56 <TheJollyRoger> Nope! It's just running some tests on texturing.
18:16:00 <TheJollyRoger> I decided to run *everything*
18:16:12 <TheJollyRoger> rendering now.
18:18:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Textures hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
18:19:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's rendering some "texture 2d to cube" or something.
18:20:11 <cdesai> I personally find all those video tests the most annoying - you get tired after seeing Big Buck Bunny so many times
18:20:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I've got an old laptop with the CTS installed on it.
18:21:57 <TheJollyRoger> So this way I can put the CTS testing rig somewhere where I won't disturb it and where it won't disturb me while it runs. I've got a pair of LED desk lamps shining on a pair of bottles positioned roughly a foot and a half away from the cameras.
18:23:01 <defconanon12[m]> Welp had to do a fresh install. Let's see if this fixes it. Just checked my network and did not like what I saw at all.
18:23:37 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: yep, post-compromise it's generally prudent to completely wipe everything out and start over.
18:25:31 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger: I didn't see a rootkit but I saw vulnerable ports listening. Whatever happened deleted my firewall logs to even check.
18:25:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: when you do fastboot -w does it format metadata as ext4?
18:25:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or does it just erase metadata

19:02:39 <joshman[m]> Arm Macs evil?
19:06:44 <CWO[m]> It's good for security bad for freedom
19:19:30 <Cyrinux[m]> hi
19:19:37 <Cyrinux[m]> in the default phone app, there is a feature like "number from thing around me",  where you need so to enable location, is it working? how to test?
19:25:00 <cn3m[m]> josh.man: arm Macs bring strong verified boot, all store apps are well sandboxed, the kernel is one of the best monolithics for security, and it has a good security chip. There's no privacy concerns really and it's extremely secure
19:25:16 <cn3m[m]> Arm Macs are a win for getting something close to the mobile security experience
19:26:44 <cn3m[m]> It's definitely not evil and a huge move in the right direction for balancing security and usability
19:27:13 <cn3m[m]> It's the closest you'll get to a GrapheneOS like experience on PC. I can't think of a better companion system
19:27:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not sure if grapheneos sends all your data to a remote government controlled server unencrypted like iOS
19:28:09 <madaidan[m]> Lmao
19:29:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> The iOS shill downvoted me
19:30:14 <madaidan[m]> Bro why am I seeing connections to some Chinese server from glassrom
19:30:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> I also don't think grapheneos commits any of these https://stallman.org/apple.html
19:31:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> You downloaded the wrong glassrom
19:32:14 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I also don't think grapheneos co"> Stallman/GNU/FSF constantly spreads bullshit

19:33:06 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "madaidan.: yes bullshit with sou"> That's a good lesson about sources
19:33:07 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "madaidan.: yes bullshit with sou"> Have you even looked at those sources?
19:33:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh shi-
19:33:25 <madaidan[m]> I can easily spam a bunch of links while totally misrepresenting them
19:33:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
19:33:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Point is
19:34:08 <cn3m[m]> I could easily do a bullshit get rekt Chromium
19:34:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos doesn't work behind your back or against you
19:34:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> iOS definitely does
19:35:37 <madaidan[m]> Well yes. iOS is pretty hostile to the user and hates freedom but that's not the same as security.
19:35:41 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't have a store
19:35:48 <cn3m[m]> Not a fair comparison
19:35:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pretty daid honestly
19:36:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't think backing up user data unencrypted is because of an app store they added
19:36:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Pretty fair honestly
19:37:13 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I don't think backing up user da"> They use end to end encryption for backups and a dozen services
19:37:30 <cn3m[m]> But again GrapheneOS doesn't offer cloud so it's not a fair comparison
19:38:13 <cn3m[m]> There shouldn't be any division between two wonderful OSes. They are both proven for security and privacy over time
19:38:54 <cn3m[m]> I fully support both and encourage them
19:38:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Privacy and iOS, nah
19:39:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Never
19:40:51 <cn3m[m]> In some ways iOS is dramatically better. It has a store and it has a notably better permissions system. In iOS 14 all questionable features are asked on the install screen or when an app is opened. GrapheneOS of course has a lot of advantages too. You can't go wrong with either
19:41:30 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is a privacy and security beast with insane functionality too
19:44:00 <Cyrinux[m]> <Cyrinux[m] "in the default phone app, there "> also i search a TTS for osmAnd (maps replacement) any idea ?
19:44:27 <cn3m[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=iphone&ch=grapheneos&w=a&n=strcat%5Bm%5D Daniel summed it up. He considers GrapheneOS technically better, but the majority of people should use an iPhone with Safari
19:44:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> They should just use graphene
19:45:22 <xabi[m]> <Cyrinux[m] "also i search a TTS for osmAnd ("> I use magic earth, they promise no tracking and it works offline, they include their own tts
19:45:59 <cn3m[m]> Safari is definitely the best privacy browser, but Vanadium is definitely the best on the security front. They are both good projects and neither deserve any form of heavy criticism they are vastly better than everything else
19:46:18 <cn3m[m]> It's not productive to attack either
19:47:05 <cn3m[m]> iOS attacks undermine the work GrapheneOS does. GrapheneOS attacks undermine the work iOS does
19:47:07 <fll[m]> Cyrinux: I have to admit I use Google's TTS and denied it network access. I couldn't find a decent alternative but also haven't looked for one in a while
19:47:19 <xabi[m]> <cn3m[m] "Safari is definitely the best pr"> Do you think that safari is better than bromite?
19:47:23 <alzxjm[m]1> I'm not on GrapheneOS (yet) but one thing that annoys me about Android Chrome is the lack of integration with a password manager. The only way to use Bitwarden (I think) is copy/paste which is a bad idea. Conversely, Firefox Preview allows autofill from Bitwarden and Keepass2Android.
19:47:53 <cn3m[m]> <xabi[m] "Do you think that safari is bett"> Yes for privacy certainly
19:48:00 <jiibus[m]> alzxjm: I never had a problem with autofill and bitwarden on normal android
19:48:05 <joshman[m]> GrapheneOS is not locked down to itself unlike Arm MacBooks will. You won't be able to install OS of your choice on a device you paid 2k$ for
19:49:28 <cn3m[m]> Safari and iOS have homogeny and great privacy features
19:49:28 <cn3m[m]> It's a model for how Vanadium works and should work
19:49:31 <joshman[m]> <jiibus[m] "alzxjm: I never had a problem wi"> Not a single bitwarden problem here either
19:49:45 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium blends in with Pixels with Chrome which is around 30 times rarer combination, but still pretty solid. There's some timing things that give it away that gives an advantage to Safari
19:50:03 <cn3m[m]> Tor Browser > Safari > Vanadium for blending in
19:50:25 <cn3m[m]> The opposite for security though
19:50:29 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium > Safari > Tor Browser
19:50:30 <Cyrinux[m]> <xabi[m] "I use magic earth, they promise "> I  will retry i forgot it, seems to be good, but OSM is good and do much more than magicearth i think, but maybe, i need simply both. TTS seems well cool.
19:50:38 <Cyrinux[m]> <fll[m] "Cyrinux: I have to admit I use G"> thanks you, will think to this too
19:51:42 <cn3m[m]> Safari is a great browser, just like Vanadium and Tor Browser. It depends on the person, but generally speaking Safari is the strongest middle ground
19:53:01 <cn3m[m]> There's no need to attack any of the projects as they are at the forefront and quite excellent

22:33:29 <worldwidecave[m]> just gives them warning signs
22:33:47 <madaidan[m]> Sounds like windows in general
22:34:06 <worldwidecave[m]> lol
22:34:21 <worldwidecave[m]> any soultion?
22:34:57 <strcat[m]> follow the instructions precisely
22:34:57 <strcat[m]> start over
22:35:01 <strcat[m]> make sure to do exactly what it says
22:35:14 <worldwidecave[m]> close the shell and reopen?
22:35:19 <strcat[m]> sure
22:35:27 <strcat[m]> every error you're encountering is from deviating from what it says to do
22:35:42 <worldwidecave[m]> the phone is already in  fastboot
22:36:06 <worldwidecave[m]> should i put it back to the google home screen
22:36:57 <strcat[m]> don't need to do that
22:37:22 <worldwidecave[m]> i can keep in fastboot?
22:37:52 <strcat[m]> you're at the downloading phase
22:37:56 <strcat[m]> so did you already do this?
22:37:56 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
22:38:27 <worldwidecave[m]> this is what i am following
22:38:35 <strcat[m]> so you already unlocked?
22:38:41 <worldwidecave[m]> i am a newbie to this
22:39:55 <strcat[m]> my only recommendation is that you'll need to start over since I don't know what steps you've skipped and you don't have the same terminal session
22:40:01 <strcat[m]> if you want to reboot the device to do that - fine
22:40:15 <strcat[m]> just start over, and make sure to follow exactly what it says without skipping anything
22:40:39 <strcat[m]> if you have unlocked you skipped a step
22:40:46 <strcat[m]> and you won't have fastboot set up in your PATH anymore
22:41:04 <strcat[m]> I don't think you're going to be successful at installing it if you can't troubleshoot yourself
22:41:25 <strcat[m]> we don't know what you have or haven't done yet and now you're part way through the instructions (but you seem to have skipped portions)
22:41:44 <strcat[m]> so it's not going to go exactly as intended no matter what - you're going to have to understand what you're doing and troubleshoot it now
22:41:57 <strcat[m]> but I recommend starting over at the top now
22:42:28 <strcat[m]> the instructions work if you follow them precisely - nothing extra needs to be added, etc.
22:42:50 <worldwidecave[m]> i followed techlore video yesterday and it never worked now i am trying to follow the instructions
22:42:57 <a0mtrx0[m]> anupritaisno1: i know you are the maintainer of 4 /4xl,are you unofficially working on other devices on diffrent os ?I cant find pixels on my region and i read somewhere of oneplus devices
22:43:22 <strcat[m]> worldwidecave: unofficial installation instructions that are out-of-date aren't expected to work
22:43:30 <strcat[m]> only the official installation instructions should be used
22:44:11 <strcat[m]> problem is now you've done who knows what already
22:44:45 <worldwidecave[m]> tar.exe: Error exit delayed from previous errors. Is this becausr i downloaded it already?
22:46:12 <strcat[m]> just start over
22:46:17 <strcat[m]> the error was because you told it to extract a file that doesn't exist
22:46:19 <strcat[m]> because you skipped a step
22:46:24 <strcat[m]> or you opened new terminals in new locations
22:46:26 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you did - just start over
22:47:28 <worldwidecave[m]> ok thanks i am
22:47:32 <worldwidecave[m]> fastboot version eac51f2bb6a8-android
22:47:54 <worldwidecave[m]> is this the most up to date?
22:48:08 <strcat[m]> no
22:48:11 <strcat[m]> that's some third party stuff
22:48:17 <strcat[m]> not referenced by the installation instructions
22:48:20 <strcat[m]> and will prevent you from flashing
22:48:27 <worldwidecave[m]> oh
22:48:36 <strcat[m]> you installed some third party fastboot software
22:48:36 <worldwidecave[m]> how to remove it
22:48:42 <strcat[m]> don't know
22:48:46 <strcat[m]> don't know how you installed it
22:49:07 <strcat[m]> or what you installed
22:49:17 <worldwidecave[m]> download package
22:49:38 <strcat[m]> it isn't the fastboot software referenced by the official instructions
22:49:59 <strcat[m]> and the official instructions just set it up in a directory and add it to a temporary PATH (the current terminal)
22:50:08 <strcat[m]> so it's not really installed and can just be deleted after
22:50:22 <strcat[m]> so if you've already got fastboot available as a command in a fresh terminal
22:50:32 <strcat[m]> you did something drastically different - especially since it's clear that's third party software
22:50:45 <strcat[m]> I don't really know what you've done, I can't really help you undo it
22:51:13 <worldwidecave[m]> fastboot version 30.0.3-6597393
22:51:17 <strcat[m]> we only recommend following the official installation instructions and I definitely wouldn't suggest downloading third party, weird forks of fastboot
22:51:19 <worldwidecave[m]> that is better right
22:51:28 <worldwidecave[m]> i found the other file
22:51:33 <strcat[m]> worldwidecave: yes - although the other one is probably still in PATH after this
22:51:51 <worldwidecave[m]> i deleted the file
22:52:39 <strcat[m]> what does `echo $env:Path` say
22:54:40 <worldwidecave[m]> C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\;C:\Users\darkc\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;C:\adb;C:\Program Files\platform-tools;C:\Users\darkc\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;
22:56:00 <strcat[m]> so this is really weird:
22:56:04 <strcat[m]> C:\Program Files\platform-tools
22:56:26 <strcat[m]> anyway I don't know what it is you downloaded / installed before
22:56:34 <strcat[m]> I'd be concerned about that
22:57:16 <strcat[m]> did you actually run some kind of installer? I assume so
22:57:28 <strcat[m]> would suggest uninstalling that if possible
22:57:31 <TheJollyRoger> If you installed some kind of "Minimalist Fastboot", you're going to have to uninstall it and make sure that no traces of it remain on your system. Those third party versions of fastboot have a tendency to produce the dreaded "No Operating System Found" error.
22:57:56 <TheJollyRoger> *the dreaded "No Operating System Found" error.
22:58:04 <strcat[m]> it also might have installed drivers or something
22:58:14 <worldwidecave[m]> I uninstalled it
22:58:16 <TheJollyRoger> *the dreaded "No Operating System Found" error on the phone.
22:58:31 <strcat[m]> worldwidecave: try rebooting and see if that entry is gone from path
22:58:35 <strcat[m]> but you also have a weird C:\adb entry
22:58:43 <madaidan[m]> <TheJollyRoger "*the dreaded "No Operating Syste"> I faced that recently
22:58:51 <worldwidecave[m]> how to check about the drivers?
22:58:53 <madaidan[m]> Nearly shat myself
22:58:53 <TheJollyRoger> madaidan[m]: oh argh >_<.
22:59:06 <strcat[m]> worldwidecave: I'm just concerned because I don't know what you've installed
22:59:12 <strcat[m]> and how it's going to interact with the proper procedure
22:59:15 <madaidan[m]> Although not because of some sketchy fastboot
22:59:19 <strcat[m]> try a reboot and check path again
23:00:18 <worldwidecave[m]> C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\;C:\Users\darkc\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;C:\adb;C:\Program Files\platform-tools;C:\Users\darkc\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps;
23:00:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, it's still there.
23:02:16 <worldwidecave[m]> it says can not delete open in adb
23:02:57 <worldwidecave[m]> i have nothing open
23:03:10 <worldwidecave[m]> can i remove it with a command?
23:06:07 <strcat[m]> worldwidecave: try to see if there's an uninstaller
23:06:11 <strcat[m]> I don't know what it is you installed
23:06:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Check Add/Remove programs and look for it.
23:06:28 <strcat[m]> where did you get these things, seems like 2 different things you installed
23:06:34 <strcat[m]> at least
23:06:35 <strcat[m]> maybe at different times
23:07:04 <worldwidecave[m]> from reddit i think
23:08:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ohhhh bad news.
23:09:27 <TheJollyRoger> >_<.
23:09:37 <strcat[m]> worldwidecave: well I'd guess something is running from there (service, driver?) dunno
23:09:48 <strcat[m]> really going to need to get rid of that stuff before starting
23:10:10 <worldwidecave[m]> how to remove it please
23:10:25 <strcat[m]> I don't know - don't really know what it is you've installed
23:10:35 <TheJollyRoger> The problem is we don't know what you've installed, much less what it's done.
23:10:56 <TheJollyRoger> I would probably use the system restore to revert to an earlier point in time.
23:11:13 <TheJollyRoger> If you have that option available and provisioned.
23:12:28 <icy-sprite[m]> cn3m: Why do you recommend 1Password over Bitwarden?
23:12:37 <worldwidecave[m]> a fresh reboot then
23:12:51 <worldwidecave[m]> ok thanks for your help
23:13:00 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck!
23:13:18 <worldwidecave[m]> Cheers
23:13:33 <cn3m[m]> <icy-sprite[m] "cn3m: Why do you recommend 1Pass"> I only recommend KeePass really
23:14:00 <TheJollyRoger> Check to see if you have system restore available and revert to a time prior to installing what you installed. You may need to reboot into recovery to do so. It's been a long time since I used those features on Windows 10 .
23:14:04 <icy-sprite[m]> cn3m: But I want something that syncs and have unified apps on all platforms
23:16:41 <renlord> i use unixpass
23:16:48 <renlord> and it has clients across all platforms
23:16:56 <renlord> on windows its quite difficult to use though
23:18:33 <dazinism> @Icy-Sprite ;^): can use syncthing or nextcloud for syncing. Theres decent keepass clients for most platforms
23:19:00 <renlord> i just use git for syncing for unixpass
23:20:17 <overheadscallop[> Doesn't pass leak metadata through the filenames?
23:21:46 <cdesai> renlord: tbh if something called unixpass didn't work well in windows I definitely wouldn't mind
23:25:22 <icy-sprite[m]> <dazinism "@Icy-Sprite ;^): can use syncthi"> Awesome! thanks for the tip
23:29:54 <renlord> cdesai: no reason why it should not work well in windows, the windows architecture is deliberately designed so it can run unix/linux subsystems
23:30:47 <cdesai> renlord: I'm aware, just trying to make a joke ;)
