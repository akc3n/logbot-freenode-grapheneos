00:51:31 <strcat> feel free to spread this
00:51:53 <strcat> among other things
00:54:11 <strcat> people funding Copperhead by purchasing their scam products are perpetuating their attacks on open source developers, and their grifting
00:54:39 <strcat> they spend their resources marketing and promoting themselves, while stealing our work and fraudulently presenting it as their own
00:54:57 <strcat> taking credit not only for what we've done historically but our newer work from after the split with that company as well
00:55:08 <strcat> such as hardened_malloc
00:55:33 <strcat> you might wonder why they would be so illogical as to spend so much effort trying to destroy the project that they depend on for copying
00:55:37 <strcat> but that is what they do

00:56:10 <telum[m]1> Sore losers. Micay has a working project, and they don't. The unbecoming smearing the Copperhead gang does across the internet makes me even less inclined to trust them.
00:56:21 <strcat[m]> considering that the company doesn't even have the intended legal name
00:56:27 <strcat[m]> nothing is surprising
00:56:33 <strcat[m]> there has never been a shareholder meeting
00:56:47 <strcat[m]> my rights as a 50% shareholder are disregarded
01:07:20 <pchelp321[m]> I run "fastboot --version" and this comes up "fastboot version c7815d675
01:07:20 <pchelp321[m]> Installed as /usr/bin/fastboot"
01:16:59 <strcat[m]> that's not a proper fastboot

05:57:42 <trevqr[m]> Hey all, I'm back at trying to get Graphene on a Pixel 4a on Windows this time. When I do "fastboot flashing unlock" from cmd in the platform-tools folder, I get a <waiting for any device> prompt. I was able to do this on my PopOS comp, but for some reason, Windows is now giving me issues at this step. Any suggestions?
05:58:20 <trevqr[m]> Would it be bad to connect it to PopOS, unlock the bootloader, and then disconnect and try to flash from Windows? Then relock in PopOS?
05:59:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe faulty USB port
05:59:28 <trevqr[m]> Jk, looks like it just took quite awhile
05:59:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Smh
06:08:08 <trevqr[m]> Now having a different problem. When I click on the flash-all file, a cmd window briefly appears (with no text), and then auto-exits with no change on the device. I tried running it as admin as well and did try waiting awhile haha
06:18:05 <louipcm> trevqr:  you need to run it in powershell
06:18:12 <louipcm> trevqr:  check the install guide
06:26:32 <trevqr[m]> Thank you louipcm! Looks like I got it to go. Really, really appreciate the patience and help here üôè

08:25:42 <Looking4Smartwat> Hello, someone with amazfit GTS smartwatch?
09:46:08 <doobry[m]> Do you have a good link what exactly seedvault backups? According to the backup volume, it seems like it only backups the APKs, not the user data?
09:51:43 <CryptRelay[m]> <doobry[m] "Do you have a good link what exa"> https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault
09:52:42 <doobry[m]> CryptRelay: Thanks, but I didn't find much there - didn't take the extra effort to read the code itself yet though üòâ
09:53:09 <makingaliasesisa> Backup application data to a flash drive.
09:53:19 <makingaliasesisa> Is one of the points
09:56:28 <CryptRelay[m]> <doobry[m] "CryptRelay: Thanks, but I didn't"> It does not backup the APKs, but their data. But if you want to make sure what's on the backup, you should use the backup parser.
09:56:54 <CryptRelay[m]> https://github.com/tlambertz/seedvault_backup_parser
09:57:37 <CryptRelay[m]> I haven't tested it myself yet
09:57:44 <doobry[m]> CryptRelay: good idea, thanks üòä I only wondered because I have something like 10G OsmAnd map files on my phone, but the seedvault backup only takes around 800MB.
10:15:30 <projectmoon> seedvault doesn't back up anything on the sdcard, or emulatd sd card
10:15:39 <projectmoon> it's basically adb backup in terms of what it will save
10:18:40 <doobry[m]> mh ok interesting. I don't see an (emulated) sdcard in my file manager on the pixel 4a at all.
10:23:58 <renlord[m]> applications have to implement the backup api to specify what gets backed up
10:24:09 <renlord[m]> otherwise a bunch of useless cache data gets backed up too
10:24:14 <renlord[m]> which is undesirable
10:24:37 <renlord[m]> doobry:
10:34:24 <doobry[m]> renlord: I see, thank you! So I have to trust in the app developers that they chose the correct data to be backupped.
10:35:07 <renlord[m]> doobry: you kinda already do trust the app developer to do the right thing with your input data
10:35:16 <renlord[m]> otherwise you wouldnt be using their app
10:38:52 <doobry[m]> you're right, but that's not my point üòâ If I understand you right, then seedvault doesn't just backup all app data but instead backups the data that the app tells it to backup, correct? So the app developers are in charge here.
10:45:18 <renlord[m]> <doobry[m] "you're right, but that's not my "> yes
11:09:42 <projectmoon> There is work in seedvault to back up the filesystem happening, which will make it a much more compelling solution
11:37:31 <doobry[m]> Yay, that's awesome news, I'm really looking forward to that ü§©
11:50:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> projectmoon source?
11:51:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hi anthraxx been a while
11:52:10 <anthraxx> anupritaisno1[m]: hi
11:53:09 <renlord[m]> there should be no API to make a filesystem backup
11:53:30 <renlord[m]> and does not make much sense in the context of scoped storage
11:55:08 <renlord[m]> if it was possible, someone can just write an erroneous application to cross-app boundaries to steal app data
11:55:37 <projectmoon> https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/57 and https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/36\
11:55:38 <projectmoon>  * https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/57 and https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/36
11:56:58 <projectmoon> the main purpose is for apps that prevent backup of their data, but also expose some kind of local backup, which is a lot of apps
12:01:14 <dazinism> Yeah its not the full filesystem, just /sorage
12:01:26 <dazinism> *storage
12:02:28 <dazinism> And I'm not quite sure how multiple users/profiles will be handled
12:08:19 <projectmoon> i think the work has barely started, maybe not even much more than moving it to "In progress"
12:09:52 <projectmoon> well there is some draft specification thing
12:14:08 <dazinism> Grote, who's been doing a load of work on seedvault, sponsored by Calyx has been working on this. They recently released a test app to try out file backup techniques

12:36:21 <Bebef> Hi everyone o/
12:37:11 <WouterS> Good afternoon everyone, could someone tell me what the expected time frame is for software support on the pixel 3xl? I see the pixel 2xl images are already outdated
12:41:24 <Bebef> I just stumbled upon GrapheneOS. I think I'll need a substitute OS for a Pixel 2 soon, but that's marked as "obsolete". I suppose this referrs to the official updates (like firmware patches), not to GrapheneOS on Pixel 2 itself?
12:56:57 <bed[m]> Anyone use a navigation app + android auto (or equivalent) with graphene? Currently using a second phone to do this but would like to convert solely to graphene.
12:57:26 <jpds> bed[m]: osmand+, it's OK
13:23:00 <nscnt> WouterS: Google's minimum update & support period ends at October 2021 for the Pixel 3 XL. At least until that time you can expect GrapheneOS support for it.
13:23:58 <WouterS> Ah great, thanks nscnt
13:24:33 <nscnt> Bebef: "Official" updates are the crucial updates. If they are no more, it simply is obsolete.
13:27:11 <Bebef> nscnt: I was asking because I wanted to know if I would at least get AOSP-based updates. If I exchange one OS that I don't get updates for with another OS that I don't get updates for, I wouldn't have gained much. So I was wondering if I could at least hope GrapheneOS builds although the device would be "obsolete"?
13:44:24 <nscnt> Bebef: Let's start at the beginning... Why would you want to substitute your OS "soon" on your Pixel 2?
13:45:03 <nscnt> *need. That's what you wrote
13:46:43 <Bebef> nscnt: Well, there are no more updates from Google. I know of the security implications that come with the lack of support from Google. However, I am unwilling to throw away a perfectly fine working piece of hardware just because I don't get official updates any longer.
13:47:35 <Bebef> nscnt: What I therefore am looking for is an alternative that would allow me to at least get OS updates and patches (minus kernel and firmware, of course).
13:48:18 <Bebef> nscnt: However, if I now exchange the no longer supported Google stock with a no longer supported alternative, I haven't gained much in that regard.
13:48:45 <Bebef> nscnt: So my question essentially is: will there be updates for the Pixel 2 or not?
13:49:05 <nscnt> Your OS updates and patches are from Google. If they stop shipping them, they are gone. GrapheneOS won't substitute them.
13:49:14 <Bebef> nscnt: I am fully aware of that.
13:51:21 <nscnt> Why would you need to switch then? You won't gain anything except running GrapheneOS.
13:51:22 <Bebef> nscnt: But what about the AOSP part(s)?
13:51:29 <nscnt> ?
13:52:11 <nscnt> What do you think are the OS updates and patches? It's for AOSP; by Google
13:52:13 <ISSHIN[m]> Well he will gain better privacy than the stock ROM
13:53:33 <nscnt> Bebef: Go read https://grapheneos.org/faq#legacy-devices
13:54:35 <Bebef> nscnt: Counter question: how is it possible that ancient devices which have been out of support are running (more or less) current Android versions?
13:56:03 <Bebef> nscnt: I have a Moto G3, which had official support until Android 6, running Android 10.
13:58:04 <jpds> Bebef: Because someone else has made the effort to port it across
13:58:05 <Bebef> nscnt: I would suppose that, while most likely not touching any kernel or firmware or whatever, I would still benefit from any other software updates (and probably security fixes) that came with Android 10. And if not that, at least I could benefit from new features and not have a worse setup than I had if I stayed at Android 6.
13:59:49 <Bebef> jpds: Yes, of course. But it's not a thing that would be impossible.
13:59:57 <nscnt> What's the point? Is it that hard to understand what obsolete means?
14:00:38 <nscnt> It's very well written in the faq what and why.
14:00:43 <jpds> Bebef: If you want to maintain the device system image after Google has dropped support for it, nothing is stopping you
14:01:11 <Bebef> nscnt: Is it so hard to just say "Pixel 2 is marked obsolete because there will be no further builds for that device?"
14:01:36 <jpds> That's exactly what obsolete means
14:02:15 <Bebef> Good that we've talked about this.
14:04:09 <louipc> you could say deprecated
14:11:05 <nscnt> He totally misunderstood what the objective of GrapheneOS is
16:19:09 <zcs[m]> Are you going to support Pixel 5?
16:22:09 <louipc> someone needs to volunteer for it
16:46:39 <ty1919[m]> anyone know a global socks5 app for GOS that doesnt leak?
17:06:19 <seppat[m]> Hello there. I'm attempting to flash GrapheneOS with `flash-all` (basically the last step) but the command only briefly opens then closes. Anyone able to help troubleshoot?
17:06:53 <seppat[m]>  Installing using windows, followed the guide on the official website and flashing to a pixel 3a xl
17:07:14 <TheJollyRoger> seppat[m]: are you using Powershell?
17:07:32 <seppat[m]> Oh, no I was using CMD
17:08:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, very important step to use PowerShell rather than the command prompt.
17:08:29 <seppat[m]> Well I mean when it double clicks it opens CMD.
17:08:37 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to use PowerShell.
17:08:51 <seppat[m]> Is there an easy way to switch what flash-all opens with?
17:09:17 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not well-versed with Windows, but keep in mind that this is a commandline tool, it won't work via the graphical interface.
17:09:55 <TheJollyRoger> Under "Prerequisites", fifth paragraph, under "Install" on grapheneos.org, it says that you'll need to use command-line tools, and on windows, you'll need to use PowerShell.
17:10:08 <seppat[m]> Yeah okay. I just clicked and dragged it to PowerShell and got a "fastboot too old" error. May have to try a different version.
17:10:13 <TheJollyRoger> Or, rather, it may or may not work, IDK.
17:10:24 <TheJollyRoger> *may or may not work with graphical tools, IDK. You'll be on your own there.
17:10:53 <TheJollyRoger> Are you using the official, Google version of the android platform tools?
17:11:12 <TheJollyRoger> If you've downloaded or installed any other "lightweight adb" versions or something like that, similarly, you're on your own.
17:11:22 <seppat[m]> Yeah it linked me to the exact place I downloaded it from .
17:11:57 <TheJollyRoger> In PowerShell, what's the output of `fastboot --version?`
17:12:05 <TheJollyRoger> ** `fastboot --version`?
17:14:11 <seppat[m]> Which punctuation do I add? ** `fastboot --version` throws an error
17:14:31 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, don't add the backticks - I just use the backticks to show the command.
17:14:52 <seppat[m]> So just...
17:14:58 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version
17:14:59 <seppat[m]> Fastboot --version
17:15:32 <seppat[m]> eac51f2bb6a8
17:15:38 <seppat[m]> -android
17:15:58 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like you've installed a third-party version of fastboot.
17:16:08 <TheJollyRoger> and it's using that over the official one.
17:16:24 <seppat[m]> Oh wtf... How do I get rid of that?
17:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> I would not suggest going further until `fastboot --version` returns something like 30.0.1. something.
17:16:38 <TheJollyRoger> Unless you want to end up with the dreaded "No operating system found" error.
17:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to uninstall any third-party or unofficial versions of fastboot that you've installed.
17:17:25 <seppat[m]> I had a look through and can't find fastboot to uninstall
17:17:58 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure you got the official version from Google - delete it and start over if you have to.
17:18:21 <TheJollyRoger> But it *should* say fastboot 30.0.1-[numbers]
17:18:28 <TheJollyRoger> Or higher.
17:18:49 <seppat[m]> I guess I was doing something weird in the past on this machine lol. I think I found it. Fastboot.py deleted. Let me see now...
17:18:53 <TheJollyRoger> If you're not getting that when you type in `fastboot --version` then STOP and do not go any further.
17:19:24 <TheJollyRoger> Incorrect, too old, or third-party versions of fastboot can softbrick devices.
17:20:49 <TheJollyRoger> They won't be damaged, but if that happens you'll have to start all over again and the device won't be usable until you do.
17:21:16 <seppat[m]> Hmm now I just get an error rather than a version number. I'll just scrap everything and start over fresh with fastboot
17:21:25 <TheJollyRoger> Probably for the best.
17:21:37 <TheJollyRoger> make sure there's no other old versions of fastboot in your command path.
17:22:25 <seppat[m]> Now idk what I'm doing at all here (obviously lol). Do I have to do anything with the phone if it's already unlocked and is showing Fastboot Mode?
17:23:11 <TheJollyRoger> nope, not at all. The PowerShell Script will do it all for you -- but you WILL need to lock the bootloader afterward in order to complete the installation.
17:23:17 <TheJollyRoger> That part you'll have to do manually before you start using your phone.
17:23:28 <seppat[m]> Yeah okay
17:24:20 <TheJollyRoger> locking the bootloader sets the verified boot to enforcing and completes the installation. I sometimes will let the phone boot unlocked just for the first time to make sure it boots first.
17:24:35 <TheJollyRoger> Then I lock it.
17:25:33 <TheJollyRoger> If you see a yellow "Your phone is loading a different operating system" message when you first power on, that's normal and expected behaviour, it means that the verified boot is on and enforcing, but the bootloader keys are to a key that's not Google's.
17:25:37 <seppat[m]> I still just get an error when trying to check fastboot --version.
17:25:37 <seppat[m]> Fastboot: the term 'fastboot' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function.... Etc.
17:25:43 <TheJollyRoger> (Since if it was to a key that was Google's, you're loading Google's operating system)
17:26:23 <seppat[m]> I'm going to just restart this lol. That's about where my IT expertise goes out the window
17:26:27 <TheJollyRoger> If you're removing fastboot, that's a good sign - that means the computer is not detecting any other versions of fastboot in your command path.
17:26:42 <TheJollyRoger> So now's the time to go and re-download fastboot and add it back to your command path.
17:27:20 <TheJollyRoger> Start again, from fresh.
17:28:03 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back in a sec.
17:28:19 <TheJollyRoger> (may be a tad longer, circumstances depending, life away from the computer calls)
17:28:22 <jpds> ty1919[m]: There isn't one, simply set all traffic to go down a VPN implementation
17:29:35 <seppat[m]> I downloaded and unzipped it but I'm still getting an error. What does " add it back to your command path." Mean? Is that something I need to do manually?
17:31:57 <TheJollyRoger> seppat[m]: when you type a command into the command prompt or into PowerShell, the computer looks on a pre-determined list of places to check for executables which it will execute first. That list is called your command path.
17:32:54 <seppat[m]> It's in my downloads folder. Should I be moving it to somewhere it can find it?
17:33:09 <TheJollyRoger> on Windows, you can temporarily set it with the command listed under paragraph 12 of the section "Standalone Platform-tools" of the install guide.
17:33:30 <TheJollyRoger> Note that that command tells you to set it to the working directory.
17:33:48 <TheJollyRoger> So, make sure your working directory is set to where platform-tools has been unzipped to.
17:34:15 <TheJollyRoger> you can do this with the `set-location` command in PowerShell.
17:34:26 <seppat[m]> Aha! I got the version number now üòÅ
17:35:40 <TheJollyRoger> Perfect. Now set your location in powershell to where ./flash-all is located. Plug in your phone, boot it to fastboot and try `fastboot devices` first to see if it sees your phone.
17:36:23 <TheJollyRoger> I might have to scoot in a moment since I've got my coat on, but you're on the home stretch now.
17:37:18 <seppat[m]> K so I do ... cd (file location)
17:37:38 <seppat[m]> Then plug it in... And fastboot devices command
17:37:41 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure that the phone's plugged in to either the rear of the motherboard (if you're using a desktop) by a USB-A to USB-C cable, and a high-quality one at that. We've had issues before in the past with some vendors cheaping out on C to C cables and front panels.
17:37:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yes!
17:38:03 <seppat[m]> It found something so that must be the phone.
17:38:09 <TheJollyRoger> If you need to know if flash-all.bat is in the working directory, in powershell try `get-childitem`
17:38:28 <TheJollyRoger> Which will display on screen your directory listing.
17:38:34 <seppat[m]> Oh okay that's good to know. I was using an OEM usb-c to USB-c cable for mac and also tried to OEM pixel one
17:39:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It varies /depending on vendor/, we've had some bad experiences in the past, so we chose to be conservative about recommending hardware, but if your vendor was good about it, you should be alright.
17:39:34 <seppat[m]> It says mode d-----
17:39:52 <seppat[m]> Lastwritetime 4 mins ago
17:39:55 <TheJollyRoger> Look under "Name"?
17:40:18 <seppat[m]> Platform-tools
17:40:27 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to narrow it down a bit by search query, try `get-childitem flash-all.bat`
17:40:29 <seppat[m]> Length name says that
17:40:35 <TheJollyRoger> Which will search for `flash-all.bat`
17:41:02 <TheJollyRoger> Since you've added fastboot to your command path, it will now work if your working directory is no longer in platform-tools.
17:41:27 <seppat[m]> Error, same error ask was getting when searching for the version earlier
17:41:39 <seppat[m]> As I *
17:41:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, looks like you haven't added fastboot to your command path - it worked because you were in the working directory.
17:41:47 <seppat[m]> * Error, same error as I was getting when searching for the version earlier
17:41:56 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to add it to your command path.
17:42:04 <seppat[m]> Oh okay
17:42:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. On Windows, if you type in a command, it'll check your working directory first, and then if it finds one in there it'll run that.
17:42:57 <TheJollyRoger> So once you've cd'd back to where you see fastboot.exe and where fastboot works,
17:42:59 <seppat[m]> Okay. So that command listed on the guide, do I need to modify that?
17:43:24 <seppat[m]> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
17:43:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. What this is telling you is:
17:44:58 <TheJollyRoger> $env:Path "Set the environment variable: Path"  = "to be" $pwd "this working directory" "in platform tools" ;$env:Path "plus the existing command path"
17:45:54 <TheJollyRoger> So "$pwd\platform-tools" needs to be the location of where fastboot.exe is.
17:47:15 <TheJollyRoger> My guess is that it's going to be under "C:\Users\[YOUR NAME]\Downloads\platform-tools"
17:47:50 <TheJollyRoger> (Since we've changed your working directory, I didn't want to tell you what to type in since I can't see your screen)
17:47:56 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I really have to run, sorry.
17:48:19 <seppat[m]> Np thanks
17:52:50 <seppat[m]> Hmm well I got the phone to spaz out. That's a start. Lots of errors though so I'm assuming I got this command oath thing all wrong.

18:32:01 <strcat[m]> doobry: projectmoon  the profile's shared storage is presented as an emulated sdcard anymore
18:32:02 <strcat[m]> that's a legacy thing
18:32:14 <strcat[m]> just call it the profile's home directory or shared storage
18:32:27 <strcat[m]> the technical term is external (i.e. outside the app's internal storage) storage
18:34:29 <strcat[m]> jpds: there will likely still be a December and perhaps January release for the Pixel 2
18:34:38 <strcat[m]> because it's getting one more official update in December, so we'll ship that
18:35:03 <strcat[m]> and if that raises it to the 2020-12-05 patch level, we can do a final release with AOSP updates for the 2021-01-01 patch level (but not 2021-01-05 or anything after it)
18:35:14 <strcat[m]> it seems pretty pointless to continue providing support after that point
18:35:33 <strcat[m]> it's marked obsolete because it didn't receive the full November security update (can only reach 2020-11-01) so it already doesn't meet the standards
18:36:17 <strcat[m]> if the December release is not 2020-12-05 patch level, that will probably be our last release for it
18:36:20 <strcat[m]> remains to be seen
18:36:24 <strcat[m]> people should move to a Pixel 4a
19:12:49 <habbihabbiya3[m]> is it risky to buy a used phone for example pixel 4 from amazon renewed service ?
19:13:24 <strcat[m]> how will you make sure it's an unlocked device?
19:13:32 <strcat[m]> amazon is generally pretty good about returning things
19:13:37 <strcat[m]> also what exactly do you mean by risky?
19:13:53 <strcat[m]> as in, someone could have replaced the touchscreen, battery, etc. with malicious hardware? totally possible
19:14:10 <habbihabbiya3[m]> damn thank you
19:15:06 <strcat[m]> iphones make more use of hardware pairing (pixels do use it, but not as much)
19:15:19 <strcat[m]> for stuff like the touchscreen
19:15:27 <strcat[m]> but it can be bypassed with enough resources / effort
19:15:34 <strcat[m]> and doesn't really work against a sophisticated attacker
19:15:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> you mean that bit where you can't transplant a screen from one iphone to another?
19:16:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> assuming they are the same model
19:16:06 <strcat[m]> if someone with substantial resources has had possession of a phone and tampered with the hardware there is not much that can avoid them replacing hardware with malicious components
19:16:13 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: iphone screens are paired with the SoC basically
19:16:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: but every apple store has equipment to do it
19:16:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> yeah i've seen what happens
19:16:30 <strcat[m]> so no doubt sophisticated attackers have the pairing keys / equipment
19:17:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> why not just make devices reboot everyday btw
19:17:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> obviously automatically
19:18:13 <strcat[m]> we don't want users to miss notifications etc.\
19:18:17 <strcat[m]>  * we don't want users to miss notifications etc.
19:18:34 <strcat[m]> people can toggle on reboot while idle for Updater to automatically reboot into the updated OS after updating
19:18:43 <strcat[m]> so that the device can stay fully updated indefinitely without user interaction
19:18:45 <strcat[m]> but it's opt-in

19:25:13 <strcat[m]> > A Google project aims to bring the Linux kernel virtualization mechanism, KVM, to Android systems.
19:29:37 <nscnt> I remember reading about a new API (?) introduced with Android 11 that should handle the "restart, but don't miss notifications and start work where you left off". Very vague, though. Android dev docs
20:23:14 <rygku[m]> Is anyone else having problems getting USB file transfer to work?
20:23:24 <rygku[m]> Specifically:
20:23:33 * rygku[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QebIKhgGDaUZJZzyNNmcPWQp/message.txt >
20:30:23 <strcat[m]> rygku: USB peripherals setting has no connection to file transfer
20:30:33 <strcat[m]> that's about connecting USB peripherals to the phone
20:30:41 <strcat[m]> it has nothing to do with using the phone as a USB peripheral itself
20:30:51 <strcat[m]> you should leave that at the standard setting
20:30:52 <rygku[m]> Ok interesting.
20:31:29 <rygku[m]> It should "Deny new USB peripherals" ?
20:31:41 <strcat[m]> the default is allow new USB peripherals when unlocked
20:31:47 <rygku[m]> Copy that
20:31:50 <strcat[m]> that's a feature added by GrapheneOS
20:32:07 <strcat[m]> when you plug in the phone to a computer it is able to act as a USB peripheral itself
20:32:16 <strcat[m]> it shows a notification with controls for that
20:32:25 <strcat[m]> that is the standard Android design
20:32:37 <rygku[m]> I just set it to allow new USB peripherals when unlocked
20:32:40 <strcat[m]> if you plug it into somewhere that only charges then it won't provide those settings
20:33:03 <rygku[m]> I plugged it into the PC USB port (used to transfer files to/from other devices) and nothing happens
20:33:18 <strcat[m]> the device will never show up as a mass storage device
20:33:19 <strcat[m]> it isn't one
20:33:28 <rygku[m]> PC does not show under "Connected Devices" either
20:33:32 <strcat[m]> it doesn't ever allow an attached computer to directly write blocks of data to it like a disk
20:33:38 <rygku[m]> :(
20:33:49 <strcat[m]> rygku: you seem quite confused
20:33:54 <strcat[m]> file transfer is fully supported
20:33:54 <rygku[m]> How do you move lots of big files onto or off of the device?
20:34:00 <strcat[m]> the device never acts as a flash drive
20:34:17 <strcat[m]> in the old days it used to have a fat32 partition that it exposed to an attached computer as a flash drive
20:34:26 <strcat[m]> it hasn't been that way for a long time... it's a terrible way to do things
20:34:43 <strcat[m]> it doesn't let the attached computer directly write blocks to storage
20:34:49 <strcat[m]> there's a file transfer protocol called MTP
20:35:00 <rygku[m]> OK
20:35:06 <strcat[m]> when you plug in a device to a USB port that provides data access, and have a proper USB cable with data lines
20:35:19 <strcat[m]> it shows a notification letting you choose the USB mode for using the phone as a USB peripheral
20:35:23 <strcat[m]> default is charge only
20:35:39 <strcat[m]> if you change that to file transfer you can use MTP to transfer files to and from the profile's home directory
20:35:46 <strcat[m]> that's how it works, it is not something to do with GrapheneOS
20:35:47 <rygku[m]> That MTP notification does not happen.
20:35:50 <strcat[m]> it's how all Android devices work
20:35:54 <strcat[m]> rygku: so use a USB port and cable that work
20:35:59 <rygku[m]> I'm using a good USB cable and port
20:36:02 <strcat[m]> on an OS that supports the device type
20:36:07 <strcat[m]> with which OS
20:36:16 <rygku[m]> Ubuntu 20.04
20:36:22 <rygku[m]> 2 different machines, 2 different ports.
20:36:26 <strcat[m]> probably has to do with your OS being broken
20:36:33 <rygku[m]> It didn't work on 18.04 either.
20:36:38 <strcat[m]> if your OS doesn't support transferring data to / from phones / cameras
20:36:41 <strcat[m]> then sure it probably won't work
20:36:45 <rygku[m]> Ubuntu definitely supports this.
20:36:55 <strcat[m]> apparently not your install on your hardware
20:36:59 <rygku[m]> It works with my Samsung Android tablet.
20:37:10 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean it works properly
20:37:35 <strcat[m]> does your Samsung tablet use USB-C 3.1+ ?
20:37:42 <rygku[m]> USB C yes
20:37:46 <rygku[m]> Not sure about 3.1+
20:38:45 <strcat[m]> you'll need to fix your setup
20:38:52 <strcat[m]> I don't think it's an issue with GrapheneOS or the phone
20:38:53 <rygku[m]> OK
20:39:03 <rygku[m]> Interesting
20:39:07 <strcat[m]> USB problems with desktop Linux distributions are common
20:39:42 <rygku[m]> Just curious, why do you think it's an Ubuntu problem when it works for other Android devices (i.e., Samsung tablet)?
20:39:58 <strcat[m]> because every installation of GrapheneOS is identical
20:40:01 <strcat[m]> and you're the only one with this problem
20:40:30 <strcat[m]> so what is the variable? you're using a desktop Linux distribution that has issues on lots of hardware, especially with USB
20:40:36 <strcat[m]> on some specific hardware
20:41:28 <strcat[m]> Linux kernel only recently fixed support for USB C and USB 3.1, etc. to not cause kernel panics with many USB controllers, it is not something stable
20:41:30 <seppat[m]> > Ok, I really have to run, sorry.
20:41:30 <seppat[m]> Tyvm for all your help. I managed to get it installed üéâ
20:42:01 <rygku[m]> strcat: Interesting - thanks.
20:42:05 <seppat[m]> * TheJollyRoger  tyvm for all your help. I managed to get it installed üéâ
20:42:09 <strcat[m]> big difference between running the Linux kernel on hardware where the vendor puts in substantial effort to get it all working / stable over a year or more
20:42:15 <strcat[m]> vs. random assortment of hardware
20:42:59 <strcat[m]> rygku: plug the phone into a macOS or Windows machine and I'm sure file transfer works fine
20:43:23 <strcat[m]> it should work with desktop Linux distributions too - but people do often have USB issues
20:43:34 <strcat[m]> usually hear about it when people are trying to install the OS
20:43:37 <strcat[m]> same kind of issues though
20:43:53 <strcat[m]> we're very aware of it because of how many people run into Linux kernel USB problems installing GrapheneOS
20:44:05 <rygku[m]> The funny thing is I used this exact machine, USB port, and cable to put GrapheneOS onto this phone. :)
20:44:10 <strcat[m]> and have personal experience with how buggy the USB stack is
20:44:23 <rygku[m]> I get your point - I'll see if MacOS or a WIndows box can do it.
20:44:40 <strcat[m]> it's a different kind of USB device though
20:44:49 <strcat[m]> it could be a udev rule issue or some other kind of configuration issue
20:44:53 <strcat[m]> it's a mess
20:45:02 <rygku[m]> Ok thanks for your help!
20:47:47 <strcat[m]> rygku: you could make sure you haven't messed with developer options on the GrapheneOS device too
20:48:08 <strcat[m]> disable developer options so that it toggles some things to default (I don't think it resets everything)
20:48:44 <strcat[m]> if you've changed the USB developer options that could be the issue - but if you haven't touched it I don't see anything that could be an issue aside from the computer simply not having working a USB stack
22:15:47 <strcat[m]> seppat: F-Droid has a lot of bugs, those aren't caused by GrapheneOS
22:16:13 <strcat[m]> seppat: clearing F-Droid's app data tends to work around those problems unless it's caused by the repository servers being down / overloaded
22:18:52 <strcat[m]> that seems unrelated to whatever issues you're having after a factory reset though
22:19:11 <strcat[m]> you'll need to explain more detail what happened with the factory reset and what's wrong now
22:19:17 <strcat[m]> or, what exactly do you mean by reset your phone if not a factory reset?
22:19:24 <strcat[m]> so you mean you rebooted it?
22:19:48 <strcat[m]> can you explain what exactly is wrong?
22:21:00 * seppat[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20201111_172025.jpg (132KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/yujNsUrHcZeSZvtNTgwuyaSR/IMG_20201111_172025.jpg >
22:21:06 <seppat[m]> It's been stuck on this screen indefinitely. I've rebooted a few times.
22:22:43 <seppat[m]> I can access settings but not apps
22:42:48 <strcat[m]> seppat: I'd recommend enabling ADB and getting the `adb logcat` logs
22:43:20 <strcat[m]> seppat: is that a Pixel 3a?
22:45:33 <seppat[m]> 3a xl. Anyway did a factory reset to see if that would help.
22:47:19 <seppat[m]> Also seems signal won't let you download directly from their website anymore. I can only get it to lead me to google play and requires a sign in.
22:47:50 <seppat[m]> Ah nvm, using the direct URL to the APK works
22:48:28 <strcat[m]> can only guess what went wrong since you did a factory reset
22:48:52 <strcat[m]> try to get `adb logcat` logs if you encounter a problem that you can reproduce
22:49:04 <strcat[m]> you can run `adb logcat -c` to clear
22:49:07 <strcat[m]> then trigger the problem
22:49:10 <strcat[m]> then `adb logcat`
22:49:18 <strcat[m]> although the context before the issue is triggered may be relevant
22:49:42 <strcat[m]> in this case, since it's a problem that happens while booting up and then unlocking the profile, probably can't minimize the logs like that
23:15:24 <M26o66y[m]> What is the dif between the default mac randomization and the wifi-enhanced mac randomization?
23:16:22 <strcat[m]> not clear what you mean
23:16:43 <strcat[m]> the default on GrapheneOS is per-connection MAC randomization, which is a feature we added
23:17:16 <strcat[m]> the default on the stock OS / AOSP is per-network randomization with a persistent random address (reused when connecting to that network again), which is still an option on GrapheneOS, just not the default
23:17:31 <strcat[m]> there's a section in the usage guide covering these topics
23:18:20 * M26o66y[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20201112_101730.jpg (77KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/NeYKgvublkKLgDJZRPEmbkSF/IMG_20201112_101730.jpg >
23:18:42 <M26o66y[m]> So this option is better?
23:18:53 <strcat[m]> developer options are not meant for users
23:18:59 <strcat[m]> those are for OS developers
23:19:05 <strcat[m]> they are not supported or documented
23:19:14 <M26o66y[m]> Ok
23:19:33 <strcat[m]> you should leave everything in developer options at the defaults unless you know what you're doing such as enabling adb and permitting a trusted host
23:19:34 <M26o66y[m]> Thanks
23:20:00 <strcat[m]> our per-connection MAC randomization is part of the regular setting
23:20:02 <M26o66y[m]> I havent chamged anything I was just curious.
23:20:03 <strcat[m]> and is the default
23:20:09 <M26o66y[m]> Ok
23:20:16 <strcat[m]> that's some unsupported / experimental upstream thing
23:20:37 <strcat[m]> may not actually do anything (note it says may)
23:21:40 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "developer options are not meant "> I see people asking about developer options a lot. Wouldn't it be good to add a detailed pop-up warning explaining it better?
23:24:16 <strcat[m]> it's hard to maintain that
23:24:22 <strcat[m]> it requires substantial porting work
23:24:36 <strcat[m]> we have a ton of important things still not reimplemented for the latest OS
23:24:55 <renlord> from android hardening archive?
23:25:02 <strcat[m]> UI changes like that are often quite difficult to port forward each major release
23:25:06 <strcat[m]> renlord: partly
23:25:10 <strcat[m]> some things from before then
23:25:12 <renlord> i find it really challenging (for me at least) to navigate android hardening archive
23:25:23 <strcat[m]> you have to clone it and look at the N* tags
23:25:33 <strcat[m]> clone bionic, art, etc.
23:25:38 <renlord> do you have old changelogs?
23:26:50 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "it's hard to maintain that"> Ah, I assumed a small warning would be simple
23:28:13 <renlord> how does google photos know if photos uploaded to their service is from a pixel or not?
23:28:18 <renlord> is it via play services?
23:28:27 <JTL> That wouldn't surprise me
23:28:37 <renlord> can i just use a web browser and upload to it and it'd still count as from a pixel device?
23:28:40 <renlord> @_@
23:28:53 <strcat[m]> renlord:  yes I have some of the old changelogs but they aren't super useful
23:28:55 <renlord> i just so happen to own lots of puppy photos
23:29:15 <renlord> hundreds of GBs worth
23:29:17 <strcat[m]> I have changelogs starting at 2016.03.27
23:29:20 <jpds> renlord: EXIF metadata?
23:29:27 <strcat[m]> but the initial port is rarely laid out in detail
23:29:43 <strcat[m]>  * but the initial port is not laid out in detail
23:29:43 <renlord> jpds: lol EXIF!? then should i just write a tool to help everyone get free storage?
23:29:54 <strcat[m]> so it's not going to mention most of the features since they are already there at the start
23:33:04 <renlord> strcat[m]: the changelogs will still be useful so interested persons can know which tags to look at for features that interest them
23:33:04 <renlord> right now, (at least) i traverse the commits blindly
23:33:04 <renlord> hoping to stumble upon something i (kinda) understand then port it
23:38:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> r_e didn't have their issue resolved
23:39:17 <r_e[m]> correction: i have Graphene up and running. :D
23:39:28 <r_e[m]> thanks for the help
23:39:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh ok
23:40:06 <strcat[m]> r_e: make sure that you've locked the bootloader
23:40:14 <strcat[m]> verified boot will make sure the install is done properly
23:40:34 <r_e[m]> it is locked, oem unlocking is off, debugging is off and it is auditor-verified
23:40:50 <strcat[m]> glad it worked out
23:41:11 <r_e[m]> i misread, mistyped and forgot stuff. But i got there eventually.
23:42:31 <renlord> electron app to install grapheneos? good idea?
23:42:34 <renlord> lulz
23:42:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord see if you can help in the dev chat
23:42:56 <renlord> would significantly reduce the helpdesk workload
23:43:13 <renlord> anupritaisno1[m] works so hard at the helpdesk
23:43:53 <strcat[m]> we do want a WebUSB installer like https://flash.android.com/
23:44:01 <strcat[m]> so we can have it on the GrapheneOS site
23:44:03 <strcat[m]> as an alternative
23:44:10 <strcat[m]> requires a developer to invest a ton of time in it
23:44:20 <strcat[m]> have to reverse engineer how their one works atm
23:44:47 <renlord[m]> google hired an intern to build this?
23:45:19 <renlord[m]> strcat: you can propose it as a SoC project and hire an intern to do this for GrapheneOS heh
23:47:48 <strcat[m]> I know someone who might be interested in working on it
23:47:50 <strcat[m]> I'll reach out to them
23:48:17 <renlord> the webusb api is still in draft
23:48:38 <renlord> yea, only available in chromium
23:50:58 <strcat[m]> and Chromium-based browsers
23:51:02 <strcat[m]> it works fine in Vanadium
23:51:27 <strcat[m]> it's how the new official Trezor wallet works
23:51:37 <strcat[m]> can use it on GrapheneOS in Vanadium
23:51:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> U2F works?
23:51:55 <strcat[m]> https://suite.trezor.io/
23:51:57 <renlord> fido-u2f has worked a long time
23:52:00 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no
23:52:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sad noises
23:52:20 <strcat[m]> renlord: not on GrapheneOS since the library for Android is part of Play services
23:52:22 <strcat[m]> unfortunately
23:52:27 <strcat[m]> we need to reimplement that
23:52:29 <strcat[m]> among other things
23:52:36 <strcat[m]> or get them to do it differently
23:52:56 <renlord> autofill is a pain point for me
23:52:58 <strcat[m]> for example maybe Microsoft cares about Edge supporting it on Android without Play
23:52:58 <renlord> grrr
23:53:01 <strcat[m]> and they contribute to Chromium
23:53:14 <strcat[m]> there are different ways to approach getting stuff done
23:53:19 <strcat[m]> don't always have to do it ourselves
23:53:24 <strcat[m]> I get a fair bit done politically
23:53:45 <strcat[m]> like how there are platform-tools tags for AOSP now
23:53:57 <strcat[m]> I'm trying to get sources for flash.android.com
