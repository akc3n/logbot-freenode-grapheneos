00:13:09 <aeonsolution[m]> if you are in the bootloader, adb doesnt work because you are in fastboot not the android os
00:14:08 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] if you are in the bootloader, adb doesnt work because you are in bootloader not the android os; fastboot works in the bootloader
00:15:26 <Boxapt> how do i get back out of here so i can retry from the beginning of the instructions?
00:17:01 <aeonsolution[m]> turn off the phone and boot to the bootloader
00:17:12 <aeonsolution[m]> step 1
00:17:38 <aeonsolution[m]> close all your windows on your computer
00:17:53 <aeonsolution[m]> there is no way to backtrack, if you messed up. you have to start from scratch
00:18:16 <aeonsolution[m]> step 2
00:18:21 <aeonsolution[m]> open up powershell
00:18:51 <aeonsolution[m]> if you are not in the home directory, you need to change the directory to Downloads
00:19:07 <aeonsolution[m]> make sure you dont have anything in there so we can avoid confusing you
00:20:17 <aeonsolution[m]> cd ~/Downloads
00:20:49 <aeonsolution[m]> *i do this when helping troubleshoot so that way we are all on the same page and avoid misunderstandings
00:21:00 <aeonsolution[m]> some peoples home directory is full of stuff
00:21:24 <Boxapt> ok 2 seconds
00:21:51 <aeonsolution[m]> step 3
00:22:02 <aeonsolution[m]> install the platform tools again https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
00:22:24 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] download the platform tools again https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
00:23:35 <Boxapt> sorry, i'm completely new to all of this, including powershell etc
00:23:53 <aeonsolution[m]> thats ok
00:24:03 <Boxapt> i open powershell and type 'cd ~/Downloads'?
00:24:06 <aeonsolution[m]> just get in the habbit of if something messes up, just start over
00:24:10 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
00:24:33 <aeonsolution[m]> the PATH part is what gets most people
00:25:01 <aeonsolution[m]> the PATH is temporarily set, so if you do something wrong or open up a new shell thinking itll work because you followed the steps
00:25:18 <aeonsolution[m]> then thats the issue most of the time
00:25:35 <Boxapt> ah, i've already re-downloaded everything. so i should type the path into powershell of where platform tools is?
00:25:40 <Boxapt> like this? ' C:\Users\NAME\Desktop\Phone\platform-tools '
00:26:06 <aeonsolution[m]> why would it be downloaded there
00:26:27 <aeonsolution[m]> i asked you to download it to the Downloads folder
00:26:36 <Boxapt> ah, will do that now
00:26:51 <aeonsolution[m]> please follow the steps
00:27:19 <aeonsolution[m]> im being redundant on purpose to avoid confusion and collisions with your past downloads
00:28:23 <Boxapt> ok so i have the rom and platform tools in my downloads folder
00:28:36 <Boxapt> in two seperate zip files
00:29:31 <aeonsolution[m]> please delete the factory-images
00:29:42 <aeonsolution[m]> it should only be the platform tools in there
00:29:51 <Boxapt> done
00:30:15 <aeonsolution[m]> run `fastboot --version`
00:30:43 <Boxapt> 'astboot : The term 'astboot' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
00:30:44 <Boxapt> CommandNotFoundException
00:31:17 <aeonsolution[m]> you typed: fastboot --version
00:31:30 <aeonsolution[m]> and that happened
00:31:32 <aeonsolution[m]> ??
00:31:38 <Boxapt> yes
00:32:14 <aeonsolution[m]> you ran this command before: $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
00:32:22 <Boxapt> no
00:32:59 <aeonsolution[m]> i cant help you if you cant follow the instructions from the website
00:33:26 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
00:33:42 <Boxapt> sorry, i was following a video from youtube as the instructions on the site were hard for me to understand. as i said, i've never used cmd or powershell etc
00:33:50 <aeonsolution[m]> you need to do everything here, i am only here to guide you if you get stuck or dont understand what to do next
00:34:06 <aeonsolution[m]> stop using the video, its what messed you up to begin with
00:34:13 <Boxapt> i'll have another attempt at the instructions on the website and come back with any questions, thanks
00:35:10 <aeonsolution[m]> please dont use the videos, they all do a poor job of explaining the instructions
00:38:39 <Boxapt> okay, managed to get 'fastboot version 30.0.4-6686687' returned
00:51:44 <kzhid[m]> So is it workin now?
00:52:42 <Boxapt> no, phone still shows no os
00:54:04 <Boxapt> i'm unsure whether i should continue through with the instructions or if there's something else i need to do as my phone isn't running an os currently
00:55:09 <aeonsolution[m]> the OS isnt showing because you havent flashed the factory-image again
00:55:47 <Boxapt> ok will try that now

06:17:58 <Vappy[m]> How does grapheneOS mitigate the attack vector edl presents?
06:18:54 <Vappy[m]> I.e. can grapheneOS stop exploits from edl, or atleast, refuse to boot if it somehow realizes its been exploited
06:20:04 <Vappy[m]> Idk how to word this, since im not really a a phone nerd, but I believe that edl presents a significant security risk, so I was wondering if GOS has measures against i to
06:20:14 <Vappy[m]> * Idk how to word this, since im not really a a phone nerd, but I believe that edl presents a significant security risk, so I was wondering if GOS has measures against it
06:26:31 <JTL> As I understand it (could be wrong here). EDL mode to dump NAND requires you to decrypt the resulting image afterwards, which with recent Pixels isn't possible with past methods.
06:26:36 <JTL> (in the context of data extraction)
06:26:49 <JTL> (Been a while since I've looked into this)
06:28:45 <cn3m[m]> Yeah it is not an attack vector
06:30:32 <cn3m[m]> <Vappy[m] "I.e. can grapheneOS stop exploit"> persistent attacks wouldn't work against a Pixel unless you hacked it badly
06:31:18 <Vappy[m]> Wdym by "hacking it badly"
06:31:42 <cn3m[m]> Titan M enforces the boot integrity. Google offers $1,000,000 in bounty for persistent attacks against it.
06:31:56 <cn3m[m]> the much easier attack would be to swap out your phone
06:32:09 <cn3m[m]> and give you another that steals your password and phones it home
06:32:17 <cn3m[m]> then use that to open your device that they kept
06:32:32 <cn3m[m]> if they were able to exploit the system they would still need to break the encryption
06:32:46 <cn3m[m]> assuming they can't bypass the hardware timer
06:33:01 <cn3m[m]> you are looking at up to 650 years to crack a truly random 4 digit PIN

06:37:00 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> What are the chances you can backdoor or exploit a Pixel vs a Pinephone?
06:37:09 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS will not accept and update without it being signed by strcat

06:43:51 <cn3m[m]> PinePhones have a deeply flawed security model and no developer team

06:45:32 <strcat[m]> I am not sure what's unclear
06:46:22 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices covers the basics but of course it's a complex topic and Pixels have a ton of work put into security to make them how they are
06:46:40 <strcat[m]> you don't get that simply as a baseline especially with an SoC not meant for smartphones or focused on security

06:52:32 <Vappy[m]> you're making the Titan M sound like an indestructible shield and im a bit skeptical, although I dont know too much about it
06:53:22 <cn3m[m]> Vappy: The Secure Enclave has a very strong track record and is over 7 years old and very well documented. It is probably to early to compare the Titan M definitively. Though the Titan M matches it on feature set and has had no issues so far
06:53:57 <cn3m[m]> Consider them comparable

06:55:53 <Vappy[m]> Not saying you should fork it over to malicious parties, just trying to find a way to compare the prices in my head
06:56:21 <Vappy[m]> Apple gives a quarter mill to any security bugs on its phone, but the dark web pays 4 times as much
06:56:50 <Vappy[m]> For any grey hat who knows what they're doing, they'd brush aside the Apple reward for the larger one.

09:07:54 <cn3m[m]> on the other hand it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense for GrapheneOS to support devices as long as Apple
09:08:09 <cn3m[m]> Android has to use backporting to old kernels

09:08:34 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <cn3m[m] "on the other hand it really does"> I blame the upstream support (stock Android support and closed components)
09:08:55 <cn3m[m]> Android is not setup in a way to be supported as long especially 2+ years. The Pixel 2 is on an older kernel it has no CFI, no ShadowCallStack, etc
09:09:22 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <cn3m[m] "Android is not setup in a way to"> So they had to use mainline kernel instead?
09:09:29 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> To actually have longer support?
09:10:02 <dazinism> Stuff is backported
09:10:34 <cn3m[m]> just follow https://nitter.net/spendergrsec to see why backporting is a bad idea. The longer back you go the worse
09:11:29 <dazinism> All android kernels are 'old'. A load of work goes into doing the backporting
09:12:27 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Odd that they prefer old kernel
09:12:57 <dazinism> Dont think theres any other way things could be done on android/Linux as getting support for new hardware into kernal takes too long.
09:16:47 <dazinism> Hopefully I'm not explaining it wrong.... they use kernels with long term support, patch them to get them to work with hardware, strip out unnecessary stuff. It all takes time
09:17:31 <dazinism> As theres no mainline support, new kernels break stuff, so they have to keep the device on the kernel it is launched with
09:18:51 <dazinism> Some projects / devices attempt to get support for android device hardware into mainline
09:18:58 <dazinism> It takes years
09:20:36 <dazinism> Even with mainline support moving to a new kernel can break stuff
09:25:57 <dazinism> Being on an older kernel isnt all bad. New kernels introduce more complexity and potential bugs. Older kernels have had more time to shake some of them out. Theres a reason grsec isnt based on the latest
09:28:18 <cn3m[m]> dazinism: yeah you are right
09:28:26 <cn3m[m]> backporting sucks
09:28:34 <cn3m[m]> and it really doesn't work well
09:28:49 <cn3m[m]> but it would do more harm than good switching as updating would take even more time
09:29:06 <cn3m[m]> probably
09:31:15 <cn3m[m]> this is the talk to watch if anyone is interested
09:31:16 <cn3m[m]> https://youtu.be/O5N_YcHX8zc
09:31:18 <cn3m[m]> https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/contributions/61/attachments/69/80/Android_and_Linux_Kernel__Herding_billions_of_penguins_one_version_at_a_time.pdf
09:31:23 <cn3m[m]> slides if that is your thing
09:33:31 <cn3m[m]> https://nitter.net/spendergrsec/search?f=tweets&q=backport&since=&until=&near= running a backports search on @spendergrsec shows how bad this can be
09:40:11 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Being on an older kernel isnt al"> though grsec does do their own backports and they have bypassed a ton of these issues
09:40:19 <cn3m[m]> and Android and GrapheneOS do remove a bit of the bloat
09:40:33 <cn3m[m]> so newer kernels are pretty much a net positive
09:43:42 <cn3m[m]> For example the oldest phone to get an update this month from Apple is the iPhone 5s. 7 years old like the Nexus 5. The iPhone SE has the JIT hardening support in the CPU, it has the SEP, and it has secure biometrics. It has been well updated for years.
09:43:42 <cn3m[m]> If Google was still supporting the Nexus 5 with Linux 3.4 that wouldn't be pretty. Even with GrapheneOS patch sets.
09:49:00 <dazinism> Yeah, most everything is a bit crap. Just have to accept best efforts. Androids use of Linux is the weak point. Thankfully due to the way everything fits together still we have some pretty damn secure devices
09:49:26 <cn3m[m]> dazinism: And with only 3 years of support that is totally fine I think
09:51:14 <cn3m[m]> Apple is in a very unique position they were many years ahead on the hardware security front. They don't have backporting issues. They have very high marketshare per device. It is just not a fair comparison or even a good idea to compare the support right now
09:52:01 <cn3m[m]> hopefully that changes if Google marketshare grows, mainline kernels get introduced, etc
09:52:10 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3 already has solid security features in hardware
09:52:18 <dazinism> Yeah. Guess if it wasnt for firmware security updates ending then the work on getting support for hardware in mainline could lead to more sensible longer support
09:52:55 <cn3m[m]> yeah the other factor is Apple makes their own chips now
09:53:00 <cn3m[m]> so the devices you see being supported for a long time
09:53:10 <cn3m[m]> all A7s and whatnot
09:54:29 <cn3m[m]> Google having their own chips, mainline kernels, and higher marketshare would be the key pieces
09:54:44 <cn3m[m]> all three are current goals of the Pixel team
09:54:52 <dazinism> I guess with android devices it's economics, theres so many, and I dont imagine any are selling comparable volumes to iPhones.
09:55:43 <dazinism> So not as many resources to put into long term maintenance
09:57:00 <dazinism> But interesting that Samsung is now doing 4 years of security updates on their flagship
09:57:13 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "But interesting that Samsung is "> false and misinfo
09:57:22 <cn3m[m]> please don't repeat that here
09:57:41 <dazinism> Oh, soz
09:57:58 <cn3m[m]> they offer quarterlies only for the 4th year and it is exclusive only the the S line of phones
09:58:21 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Oh, soz"> no problem man
09:58:28 <cn3m[m]> non S line phones
09:58:51 <cn3m[m]> so A series, M series, and the S series tablets only get 3 years of quarterlies
09:59:01 <cn3m[m]> 90 day patch times are horrible of course
09:59:06 <dazinism> Guess its kinda 4 years... just really not very good in the forth
09:59:18 <djee737ejdd[m]> <dazinism "So not as many resources to put "> But they get an OS delivered for free. That gotta save some resources.
09:59:26 <cn3m[m]> on a minority of their devices and yeah it is not secure
09:59:38 <cn3m[m]> it a roundabout way it kinda is 4 years I guess
10:00:31 <dazinism> Still its interesting they decided to offer longer update period (even if crap)
10:00:40 <cn3m[m]> Samsung is the master of making their updates look impressive. Breaking embargo. Quarterly updates. Inconsistent support times
10:00:44 <cn3m[m]> they are incredibly manipulative
10:01:25 <djee737ejdd[m]> <cn3m[m] "on a minority of their devices a"> Nothing is secure. GrapheneOS is not secure either.
10:01:32 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Still its interesting they decid"> probably since they make their own lens, they use Qualcomm and their own chips only, and it looks good in the news(even if it is extremely misleading)

10:03:49 <cn3m[m]> secure is a relative thing, but this is quickly drifting off topic
10:04:08 <cn3m[m]> dazinism: sorry if I came off rude by the way. Just tired of these marketing ploys
10:04:15 <cn3m[m]> I didn't mean tot be
10:04:40 <djee737ejdd[m]> If your threat model is an adversary with more than an million dollars, iOS isnt secure. If they got less, iOS is secure.
10:04:57 <dazinism> No sweat.
10:04:58 <dazinism> All fine
10:05:00 <djee737ejdd[m]> Because then they can just buy an exploit.
10:05:02 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <djee737ejdd[m] "If your threat model is an adver"> Well yeah, try gaining persistence on iOS
10:05:35 <cn3m[m]> <djee737ejdd[m] "If your threat model is an adver"> though free github exploit pwns Samsung. Multi-million dollar exploit pops iOS. Huge difference
10:05:42 <djee737ejdd[m]> <d64qoc8432li8p9o "Well yeah, try gaining persisten"> For one million dollars, you can. Exploits are being sold.
10:05:52 <cn3m[m]> <d64qoc8432li8p9o "Well yeah, try gaining persisten"> if you are willing to throw millions you probably will at least until the next update
10:06:07 <cn3m[m]> <djee737ejdd[m] "For one million dollars, you can"> well more than 1 million but again incredibly offtopic
10:06:12 <cn3m[m]> move it to the other chat
10:06:38 <djee737ejdd[m]> <cn3m[m] "though free github exploit pwns "> I just stated than if something is secure, depends on your threat model.
10:06:59 <cn3m[m]> <djee737ejdd[m] "I just stated than if something "> objectively security has to be relative
10:07:52 <djee737ejdd[m]> <cn3m[m] "objectively security has to be r"> Indeed
10:08:18 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <cn3m[m] "objectively security has to be r"> Yeah
10:09:06 <djee737ejdd[m]> The off-topic chat should be in the description. A lot of people don't know that it exist and therefore this often goes off topic.
10:10:13 <theultron[m]> <djee737ejdd[m] "If your threat model is an adver"> No sir! I will spend 2000 USD to hire some goons to beat the shit out of you. 99.9% chance is that you will reveal your iOS pin or whatever device you got.
10:10:25 <cn3m[m]> just recently there was a 1day for Chrome(which is delayed a few days on Play Store usually) on github. Assuming it works on the Android version you probably could find an android exploit on there that works on a Samsung A50. Then you use the root access to install an accessibility service. You get essentially a free exploit chain to persistent spyware. It is rare that the stars align like that, but possible. That is
10:10:26 <cn3m[m]> night and day to something secure
10:11:22 <dazinism> Yeah could be useful. Although I'm not totally sure offtopic is an 'official' graphene channel. Folks get directed there pretty quick if chats veer off
10:11:27 <theultron[m]> <theultron[m] "No sir! I will spend 2000 USD to"> People like Snowden are under 0.1% where you need to buy expensive exploits to find out the whereabouts.
10:14:10 <djee737ejdd[m]> <theultron[m] "People like Snowden are under 0."> He is not the kind of mastermind people make him to be. He just uses Qubes OS and an dump phone.

10:19:00 <renlord> im not a moderator on the matrix side so i cant fix it
10:19:03 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Is depot-tools dependency needed to be installed first?

10:22:04 <renlord> hmm ok
10:22:16 <renlord> odd that people repeatedly suggest that its not there
10:22:29 <renlord> maybe not on mobile since its so long

10:25:20 <dazinism> <renlord "maybe not on mobile since its so"> Actually, I do see it in Fluffychat, just not in Element. Guess for some reason the description in Element hasnt updated yet.
10:25:45 <dazinism> Imagine it'll be there for new folks that join.
13:32:44 <TheLynx> hello
13:49:30 <save2020[m]> Any idea why would I get a failed signature verification when I try to install over OTA even thou it worked a week ago and now I downloed the file many times over and tried from 2 different laptops and every time I get the same error. I managed to install the version with the script but I haven t checked the signature.

15:14:30 <Paradox991> Hi all, just wondering with the pixel 4 having a neural chip instead of visual does grapheneos still support the built in hardware HDR+ processing?
15:29:36 <mvdan[m]> does anyone have details on what pieces of non-OSS are included in grapheneOS for the pixel devices? the FAQ says that these devices are recommended because of the "best firmware security", but I assume that cellular data and wifi still require non-free drivers, at minimum.
15:34:53 <save2020[m]> mvdan: the baseband is the big 👾
17:37:54 <stewjes> hi, does someone know how long it'll take to update fdroid? I can't download any apps
18:25:32 <save2020[m]> stewjes: a few minutes
19:36:42 <TheLynx> 
20:24:11 <alex-a-soto[m]> Hey all curious if anyone has used jmp.chat with grapheneos? Currently trying it out and running into some problems receiving and making phone calls, curious if other folks ran into problems and fixed it
20:37:05 <dazinism> alex-aN -soto  No but you can get them to route calls via xmpp/conversations, which sounds interesting.  You tried that?
20:38:19 <dazinism> Found that I get notifications pretty quick when using conversations, so suspect it may work well for call initiation
20:39:54 <alex-a-soto[m]> dazinism:
20:40:19 <dazinism> For US folks jmp.chat looks like it could be a real nice service, especially if calls will work reliably
20:41:35 <alex-a-soto[m]> dazinism: I just set-it up to route calls, still no quite working for me, not sure if it's grapheneos, the SIM provider I'm using, my wireless provider at home, or if it's a step where I don't something quite configured correctly. Text messages sending and receiving works great
20:42:36 <alex-a-soto[m]> Kinda in a weird place where I can use the twinkle client on desktop make calls but cannot receive calls, and then when using the pixel3a with graphene I'm able to make and receive phone calls when I hit "answer" the call ends..
20:43:26 <dazinism> Thats using SIP
20:43:38 <dazinism> ?
20:43:59 <dazinism> You using the built in android SIP stuff?
20:45:47 <alex-a-soto[m]> dazinism Yeah, using the built in android 10 SIP
20:49:39 <dazinism> Heard some folks have had more joy using an app for SIP (not on GrapheneOS)
20:50:40 <dazinism> Think maybe it was Linphone
21:03:29 <alex-a-soto[m]> Linphone was a pain in the ass to get working
21:03:38 <alex-a-soto[m]> Going to try again with it
21:33:34 <brenneke[m]> <alex-a-soto[m] "Linphone was a pain in the ass t"> Not sure if you are doing SIP but just to let you know, have started using Sipnetic with my VOIP account recently and am extremely impressed, 100%. (GrapheneOS)
21:46:28 <alex-a-soto[m]> Wow....
21:47:10 <alex-a-soto[m]> brenneke: Thank you so much for suggesting sipnetic, worked right away without any problems, able to make and receive phone calls
21:47:11 <alex-a-soto[m]> Wow...
