00:04:23 <JTL> clannad[m]: But is really shutting it up a good idea?
00:04:53 <clannad[m]> Glassrom actually needs it because it bumps up the optimization level. It must not be used to create regressions

06:08:12 <paynode> clannad[m]: also, possibly github's 1yr donation match policy is still in place, so you may want to donate through there if you are okay with their platform's tos

06:22:24 <galyoninion[m]> yeah a few GrapheneOS features are still from OpenBSD iirc
06:22:52 <paynode> ?
06:25:24 <paynode> i indeed see some mention of this (malloc) on main page...were the list of openbsd tech used made into a succint list/page?
06:25:28 <paynode> this is interesting
08:31:58 <maybemaybe[m]> I create a second user profile for my work on GrapheneOS and try to install few apps. I was not able to install an app. I suppose that the reason for this is that the work user is not admin. Is there a solution for this? Or another way to make the work user to an admin as well?
08:32:32 <cn3m[m]> <maybemaybe[m] "I create a second user profile f"> let me guess it is an F-Droid or an app you installed in F-Droid?
08:32:50 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid really messes up multi profile(but there are workarounds)
08:45:07 <cdesai> how does F-Droid mess things up / whats the expected?
08:46:33 <cn3m[m]> cdesai: F-Droid doesn't have the latest build for F-Droid on their site usually. This means it fails to install the store. Then people get non F-Droid versions of apps. Which will fail as virtually everything on F-Droid is not signed by the dev and uses the centralized F-Droid cert
08:47:07 <maybemaybe[m]> <cn3m[m] "F-Droid really messes up multi p"> cn3m: On my private profile i installed Aurora Droid and few apps over the f-droid repo. The work user was ‚Äûclean‚Äú from any apps.

08:50:12 <cdesai> work profile isn't really meant for installing random apks like that anyway, that's part of the issue.
08:54:37 <ruddo[m]> Just out of curiosity, what's the sandbox intended to do in the work profile thing?
08:54:56 <ruddo[m]> In my mind, please correct me if I'm wrong, it's precisely to install bullshit APKs I don't want on my phone otherwise.
08:55:02 <ruddo[m]> Like Uber or WhatsApp.
08:55:18 <cn3m[m]> <ruddo[m] "Just out of curiosity, what's th"> technically everything is already sandboxed
08:55:36 <ruddo[m]> Yes, agreed, but most of these apps want shared storage access.

08:55:46 <maybemaybe[m]> <cdesai "work profile isn't really meant "> Do have a suggestion for a better way forward? I want a separation for Signal for privat and work
08:56:01 <cn3m[m]> Generally the project recommends a dedicated profile instead of a work profile
08:56:11 <ruddo[m]> That's a good question!  Can I have a signal in my work profile and another one in my regular profile?
08:56:21 <ruddo[m]> Ah I see like a totally diferent user.
08:56:24 <cn3m[m]> Shelter adds attack surface and allows for more access to the clipboard
08:56:30 <ruddo[m]> What's the difference between a work profile and a separate user?
08:56:43 <cn3m[m]> <cn3m[m] "Shelter adds attack surface and "> this
09:00:14 <SchismXL[m]> Whilst not recommended, it fundamentally depends on your threat model. If you just want to have the aforementioned apps "compartmentalised" in a profile using Shelter, then go for it. If you're running from the feds, then you got more problems.
09:01:01 <cn3m[m]> You shouldn't use F-Droid in that case xD
09:01:41 <SchismXL[m]> Just make sure the apps you're installing are from "trusted sources"

13:09:48 <overheadscallop[> both are normal and expected

13:10:47 <international> Is there away to make it not happen
13:11:01 <overheadscallop[> no

13:11:21 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Not really, that's how it works
13:11:26 <international> I really appreciate it
13:12:00 <international> May i ask one more question about app cloning
13:12:31 <international> For example running two telegrams
13:12:36 <international> Or such
13:13:43 <overheadscallop[> ask whatever questions you have and if anybody knows they'll answer
13:14:17 <overheadscallop[> the supported method of having multiple instances of apps is to use separate user profiles
13:15:12 <international> And they can run both at the same time
14:34:06 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Six months since we had a full month update interval
16:21:50 <q22[m]> You only receive notifications of your active profile afaik
16:58:05 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> I'm trying to change my keyboard language but I don't see the language I want. What do I need to do?
16:58:43 <BalooRJ> M3m7pxucpi7[m] Not sure if GrapheneOS Keyboard supports all languages
16:58:50 <BalooRJ> what language are you looking for. There are other keyboards in F-Droid
17:00:03 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> Japanese and Korean
17:00:53 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> I can change the system language to them but not the keyboard
17:02:01 <BalooRJ> so what I'm seeing is
17:02:07 <BalooRJ> did you add a second language
17:02:26 <BalooRJ> I am in Languages & Input, then clicking Languages
17:02:29 <BalooRJ> I add what I think is Japanese
17:02:30 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> No
17:02:59 <BalooRJ> hmmm, it looks like the GrapheneOS keyboard does not have support from those languages in the list I see
17:03:32 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> Then do I need to install an external app for those languages?
17:03:38 <BalooRJ> it looks like you might
17:03:48 <BalooRJ> a quick view of the F-Droid store there is an app that is six years old called OpenWnn
17:05:27 <BalooRJ> there is also nicoWnnG
17:05:31 <BalooRJ> that's 4 years old
17:08:18 <BalooRJ> yeah it looks like I can set the system language as Japanese but if I have the GrapheneOS keyboard to just use system languages it does not support Japanese
17:10:16 <BalooRJ> I got the nicoWnnG keyboard working in GrapheneOS for Japanese characters
17:10:48 <BalooRJ> if you download that app from F-Droid and then hit the keyboard icon in the bottom right in whatever app you have the keyboard open up you can select that keyboard and then use it. And turn off GrapheneOS keyboard as the default if you want
17:11:01 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> It also works for me, thanks
17:11:14 <BalooRJ> no problem, glad you were able to find it
17:11:30 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> But those keyboards are very old, even the OS is warning me
17:11:50 <BalooRJ> the issue, like any other open source project is that maintainers are needed to keep it updated
17:12:12 <BalooRJ> I am using Flite TTS as well and that is 5 years old to avoid Google's Text to Speech service
17:12:52 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> Yeah you're right
17:13:15 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> I guess making keyboards is not as easy as just bringing those that exist on vanilla android
17:14:19 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <M3m7pxucpi7[m] "But those keyboards are very old"> Actually, GrapheneOS warns about an old app everytime when the app's target API is less than the Graphene's API
17:15:20 <BalooRJ> I have gotten some notifications in GOS for newly updated apps
17:15:32 <BalooRJ> but that one is indeed 4 years old
17:15:49 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> So I will be warned everytime I switch keyboards ok
17:16:04 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> Ah I don't see a Korean keyboard though
17:16:17 <BalooRJ> yeah I don't see a Korean one either
17:18:09 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> Are Japanese and Korean keyboards not available on normal android too? Wasn't expecting this
17:18:58 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> Recently switched to Graphene from iOS so I don't know much about Android
17:19:30 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <M3m7pxucpi7[m] "So I will be warned everytime I "> No, just one time, that's it
17:20:00 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> oh great
17:20:28 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> I guess no texting in Korean on Graphene then :(
17:20:44 <M3m7pxucpi7[m]> Maybe someday I'll make one myself
17:22:17 <BalooRJ-phone> You might be able to find a korean keyboard if you dig online enough
17:23:05 <nickcalyx[m]> Try gboard?
17:40:00 <cdesai> google has these other keyboards on the play store for various imes
17:40:59 <cdesai> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.korean&hl=en
17:41:05 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <nickcalyx[m] "Try gboard?"> I doubt GBoard will work on GrapheneOS, because it depends on GSF
17:49:20 <alzxjm[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "I doubt GBoard will work on Grap"> gBoard works on GrapheneOS
17:49:36 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <alzxjm[m] "gBoard works on GrapheneOS"> Can confirm this.
17:52:00 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <alzxjm[m] "gBoard works on GrapheneOS"> Aurora Store does say that it's GSF dependent, so is there something that doesn't work in Gboard?
17:52:42 <alzxjm[m]> Black Winner Yoshi: I'm not sure how that "GSF dependent" label is generated. Lots of apps with that tag work perfectly well without GPS.
17:52:56 <alzxjm[m]> I guess it's the difference between a dependency and a "hard dependency"?
17:53:16 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Black Winner Yoshi: I'm not sure"> I'm pretty sure the tag just means it pulls in GSF for some functionality, but the app may still function without it.
17:53:35 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <alzxjm[m] "I guess it's the difference betw"> Kind of like how Signal depends on GSF, but only to send notifications (I think)
17:53:39 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Google Maps as of late functions fine without GSF (even on Graphene) despite its complaining.
17:53:54 <alzxjm[m]> The Philips Hue app works perfectly fine on GrapheneOS with, afaik, zero loss of functionality.
17:54:39 <alzxjm[m]> Despite saying "GSF depenent"
18:13:41 <BalooRJ-phone> GrapheneOS with Google Maps just seems like a paradox
18:20:35 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <BalooRJ-phone "GrapheneOS with Google Maps just"> That's why I use OsmAnd+
18:26:23 <alzxjm[m]> If you live in an area with worst-in-the-US congestion and often have to commute during peak hours, using Google Maps amazing traffic features is a no brainer.
18:26:58 <alzxjm[m]> Freedom is important too: not just privacy and security. I'm glad I'm free to use Google Maps but I don't have to.
18:27:13 <BalooRJ> Yeah I'm an OSM And+ suer as well
18:29:58 <BalooRJ> M3m7pxucpi7 - Did some more looking yeah I don't even see a korean keyboard that's not from Google
18:31:26 <BalooRJ> the other options I see are in the playstore: ALKeyboard - Korean Hangul, and Swiftkey which is not private
18:32:52 <BalooRJ> AnySoftKeyboard does not have Korean or Japanese support
19:05:27 <broda721[m]> OSMAnd+ is amazing
19:20:22 <applescruff_53[m> Does anyone have experience with Magic Earth?
19:20:43 <SchismXL[m]> <applescruff_53[m "Does anyone have experience with"> Yep
19:20:49 <SchismXL[m]> Love it
19:22:22 <applescruff_53[m> I had OSMAnd then replaced it with Magic Earth.
19:23:12 <SchismXL[m]> Same. Used OSMAnd for a long time, but they really do need to make the user experience a bit better
19:23:41 <restf[m]> do you run Magic Earth in a separate profile?
19:24:04 <SchismXL[m]> No, I don't use separate profiles
19:24:05 <alzxjm[m]> Magic Earth is great.
19:26:41 <SchismXL[m]> If there's only one thing I'd want from Magic Earth, is for it to not be closed source. Other than that, it is perfect

21:53:21 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <Knull[m] "wish polls were a thing, I'd lov"> Well, Framadate exists: https://framadate.org - I could make a poll about what keyboard app do you use on your phone
21:53:34 <SchismXL[m]> <jfbourdeau "Hi all, I am having difficulty t"> Have you tried it without your VPN first?
21:55:08 <BalooRJ> Knull: Why not use the GrapheneOS keyboard? What is the functionality you are looking for
21:55:52 <BalooRJ> I also liked the Hacker's Keyboard when I used it
21:58:49 <Knull[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Well, Framadate exists: https://"> that would be interesting
21:59:02 <Knull[m]> <BalooRJ "Knull: Why not use the GrapheneO"> swiping
21:59:03 <jfbourdeau> SchismXL[m],   Yes I tried without the VPN.... But you make me think, I had that problem with NordVPN and when VPN was OFF it was working...  Weeks ago I installed OpenVPN instead of NOrdVPN to not depend on a commercial product and I think the problem started at the same time !! I will uninstall OpenVPN to see... tks !!!
22:03:18 <Knull[m]> open board no swipe. sad
22:05:57 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <Knull[m] "open board no swipe. sad"> Is there any libre keyboard that has swiping, besides AnySoftKeyboard, anyway?
22:05:57 <BalooRJ> ah, I see
22:07:48 <Knull[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Is there any libre keyboard that"> not that I'm aware of
22:18:25 <M114z[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Is there any libre keyboard that"> OpenBoard

23:11:38 <entry1[m]> Currently here and getting the fastboot too old error. I want to try the process from the start again, any suggestions? I restarted my computer with a different fastboot and it gives the same error
23:12:09 * entry1[m] uploaded an image: 20200729_191144_6682605594097128721.jpg (81KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/cCCRiJfCboseZCNbOrIGsAmZ >
23:12:58 <JTL> entry1[m]: hold on. I can help you in a sec
23:13:30 <JTL> It doesn't look like fastboot is in your PATH?
23:14:51 <entry1[m]> So that needs to be included into the command line? I downloaded the platform tools from Google after I tried using and adb portable from Techlore's tutorial
23:15:08 <JTL> Only use Google's versions of fastboot
23:16:29 <entry1[m]> Yessir that's what I'm on now. I have platform-tools folder extracted and pasted in the GrapheneOS Pixel 3a stable files into it (extracted)

23:17:35 <JTL> I don't have a win10 machine here atm, but there are instructions on the website on how to properly download platform-tools and temporarily alter the PATH for a PowerShell instnace
23:18:12 <JTL> I'd rather do that then attempt to merge the platform-tools binary with the contents of the factory zip
23:18:15 <JTL> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools

23:20:11 <JTL> Yes
23:20:28 <JTL> Need to start from PowerShell and not cmd, just to make that clear
23:21:05 <entry1[m]> I see this, do I paste the script under "On Windows:" into Powershell?
23:21:20 <JTL> what script?

23:21:50 <entry1[m]> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
23:22:12 <JTL> Yes
23:22:22 <JTL> Well
23:22:38 <JTL> Need to download platform-tools using curl as directed
23:23:54 <entry1[m]> Okay great. I ran that and it shows the following now

23:24:20 <entry1[m]> Sorry for spamming, should I move to dms
23:24:33 <JTL> That looks fine
23:24:43 <JTL> I'm going to have to leave for a bit, but I wish you well

23:30:39 <entry1[m]> Unsure what value to supply for the parameters
23:32:27 <overheadscallop[> I think you're supposed to use `curl.exe` on Windows
23:32:35 <overheadscallop[> not just curl
23:32:38 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <entry1[m] "Unsure what value to supply for "> I guess it's the URI, it even says so
23:33:10 <JTL> overheadscallop[: I know curl.exe in powershell isn't the same as the Unix curl, just a symlink to some Microsoft thing iirc
23:34:46 <overheadscallop[> JTL: plain `curl` is the alias for the Powershell Invoke-WebRequest commandlet
23:34:56 <JTL> Yes
23:35:14 <overheadscallop[> you need to specifically use `curl.exe` in powershell for actual curl
23:35:40 <entry1[m]> I'll try .exe in about an hour and post, I appreciate the help!
23:46:35 <Knull[m]> <entry1[m] "20200729_191144_6682605594097128"> I had to edit the flash all .bat to replace all instances of fastboot with .\fastboot when I did it
23:46:56 <JTL> Knull[m]: Because it wasn't properly added to PATH I think
23:47:06 <Knull[m]> probably
23:58:43 <Knull[m]> can vanadium search engine settings be changed? it offers Google, Yahoo, Bing (ddg by default), but no startpage, qwant, or searx
