01:47:32 <ss132ikl> how do i do a "lightweight sync" as described in the build guide?
01:49:04 <AndroUser> Any device manager solutions proven to work with graphene. Most require google services of some sort to sync.
01:53:08 <memelord669[m]> > how do i do a "lightweight sync" as described in the build guide?
01:53:08 <memelord669[m]> "-c"
01:55:08 <ss132ikl> thanks
03:59:19 <AndroUser> Hey
04:00:28 <AndroUser> Any device managers that are recommended for graphene users
04:00:45 <AndroUser> Trying to prevent my employees from using certain apps
04:03:45 <bantamanjyo[m]> Pixel 3 Graphene user here. Thank you for the great work. Can anybody tell me what the Pixel 4 battery life experience on GrapheneOS is like? I'm imagining pretty similar to the Pixel 3 but hoped that somebody could comment on their experience generally. (I ask this knowing fully well that battery experience is subjective!). Thank you.
04:08:18 <louipc> if you have a similar usage profile then that helps
04:08:44 <louipc> screen usage seems to be one of the biggest determining factors of battery
04:09:17 <louipc> you can check the percentage time spent with screen on in battery app
04:15:45 <louipc> AndroUser: i don't believe so. I'd be interested to hear what you are using now if you care to join #grapheneos-offtopic
04:18:45 <jimsanches1124[m> back with another question lol. i have been following the install instructions on the site but when i try to unlock the bootloader by entering the command:  "fastboot flashing unlocked" i get this error message" fastboot: usage: unknown 'flashing' command unlocked      | does anyone know what could be causing this? I updated the 4a and also enabled the oem unlocking and the usb debugging aswell
04:18:46 <jimsanches1124[m> I also have downloaded the latest versions of the tool. ive asked this in a few places just in case so some of you might be seeing this twice if u are in both spots
04:20:30 <jimsanches1124[m> im on windows 10
04:20:33 <jimsanches1124[m> forgot to add that
04:20:48 <louipc> ok type `fastboot --version`
04:22:11 <louipc> oh right.. its 'unlock' not 'unlocked'
04:22:44 <jimsanches1124[m> oh thanks lol
04:22:46 <jimsanches1124[m> that fixed it
04:22:51 <louipc> gud
04:30:32 <jimsanches1124[m> welp. ran into another problem hopefully im just being dumb with this and it can be another easy fix. after i did that and continued on with the instructions and got to the part where i run  flash-all i get this error
04:30:46 * jimsanches1124[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/yUmysgCYuzkuCDieQquECIiU/message.txt >
04:31:20 <louipc> errrr
04:31:51 <louipc> are you in powershell
04:32:07 <jimsanches1124[m> no just command prompt
04:32:13 <jimsanches1124[m> should i be in powershell?
04:32:16 <louipc> yea
04:32:22 <jimsanches1124[m> oh that makes sense
04:32:26 <louipc> it says in the instructions
04:32:51 <jimsanches1124[m> the ones im following must not be the right ones then lol
04:32:56 <jimsanches1124[m> im gonna see
04:33:00 <louipc> dang we really need to make that web flashing tool
04:33:16 <louipc> then u can just go to a website and install graphene
04:33:34 <louipc> no instructions needed
04:33:35 <somenerd[m]> sounds cool tbh
04:33:51 <louipc> stock android already has it
04:34:51 <louipc> jimsanches1124[m: https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites
04:35:56 <jimsanches1124[m> i get the same error in powershell
04:36:31 <louipc> did you set the path
04:36:41 <louipc> please read the instructions tho
04:37:35 <jimsanches1124[m> i understand that.. i am reading the instructions, I am definitely not  one of those people who dosent read them. I promise. I just read the ones you sent me along with the ones i was already reading and yes i set the path
04:38:39 <louipc> somthings wonky
04:39:02 <louipc> maybe you in the wrong directory
04:39:07 <louipc> or 'folder'
04:39:35 <jimsanches1124[m> i have it set to the correct directory
04:40:24 <louipc> jimsanches1124[m: which instructions were you reading btw?
04:40:57 <jimsanches1124[m> was following the instructions in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIXAzA555xk
04:41:26 <louipc> oh... i cant vouch for that
04:41:27 <jimsanches1124[m> they start at about 6 mins
04:41:40 <louipc> i'd ignore them and just start over from the official instructions
04:42:14 <jimsanches1124[m> ok ill try that, thanks : )
04:42:41 <louipc> gooluck
04:44:58 <memelord669[m]> Powershell is like Unix SH and you need to do ./ before a exe file if its not in path
04:45:23 <louipc> or is it .\
04:46:37 <louipc> powershell bugs me so much. why didn't they just go to a unix-like shell
04:46:43 <jimsanches1124[m> oh I know that part. I started my IT career in unix. I just completely suck at phones LOL
04:46:56 <jimsanches1124[m> at least i can admit it haha
04:47:14 <jimsanches1124[m> i know other guys my age who cant admit they are falling behind
04:47:45 <memelord669[m]> \ is usually used for spaces
04:48:06 <louipc> c:\this\is\my\folder in windows
04:48:22 <louipc> This.exe /Infuriates /Me /bigly
04:48:25 <jimsanches1124[m> I wanted to do this install on my linux machine but Ive been tinkering around with it a lot lately so i had to use my windows for this
04:48:40 <jimsanches1124[m> i really prefer linux more for this stuff
04:48:46 <jimsanches1124[m> considering android is already linux
04:48:52 <jimsanches1124[m> i imagine it would have been easier
04:48:57 <louipc> well the shell is way better
04:51:01 <jimsanches1124[m> I knew something would happen too lol. I was saying to myself, the one day I dont have linux Im gonna really need it
04:51:21 <jimsanches1124[m> i just like how its more straight forward
04:51:28 <jimsanches1124[m> once you know it
04:59:42 <jimsanches1124[m> just checked and went through the installation instructions once more and I did do everything identical to the instructions, I am really interested now
05:02:46 <jimsanches1124[m> hm apparently somehow the device completely reset
05:02:52 <jimsanches1124[m> this could have been the problem
05:03:19 <jimsanches1124[m> it just turned on and acted like a brand new phone right out of the box asking me to set up and connect to wifi and all that with the stock os
05:03:38 <jimsanches1124[m> not sure what triggered that but ill try again
05:03:54 <louipc> i think you had script and path errors before
05:04:37 <louipc> sounds like you had a bad flash, so it reverted to the last working rom
05:06:31 <memelord669[m]> Are you on windows 10 release or ltsc?
05:06:59 <louipc> :O
05:07:22 <jimsanches1124[m> I have windows 10 pro and just updated last night to most recent so i think that should be ok?
05:07:44 <louipc> yes
05:07:45 <jimsanches1124[m> most recent updatr*
05:07:59 <memelord669[m]> Yes, I was just thinking the powershell script may be for a different version of it
05:09:15 <louipc> oh like powershell update completely broke their scripting language?
05:12:37 <jimsanches1124[m> well its getting weirder and weirder. Since nothing happened i was going to just delete the folders and then just re download the files and do it over completely but it wouldnt even let me delete the folder saying that It was still running. I unplugged the phone and i didnt even have the folder open and cant find it in task manager so looks like ill reboot and try again
05:13:52 <louipc> sounds fun
05:32:14 <memelord669[m]> > oh like powershell update completely broke their scripting language?
05:32:14 <memelord669[m]> They changed it to make it cross platform to try and compete with bash and zsh
05:35:15 <jimsanches1124[m> it gets even worse now.... my pc wont even recognize It being plugged in now. I plugged it into one of my old linux laptops thats too old to do the install on and what do you know? even that recognized it in a flash
05:40:54 <memelord669[m]> What is device manager saying? And why not just update it
05:43:09 <jimsanches1124[m> device manager dosent even show the phone anymore even when i scan for hardware changes
05:43:50 <memelord669[m]> Use a different USB port
05:43:58 <jimsanches1124[m> ive used every port on the pc
05:44:57 <louipc> dang
05:45:04 <jimsanches1124[m> im about to just get a live installation of manjaro because its an easy arch related distro and just do it from there
05:45:36 <jimsanches1124[m> i read that it works best on arch related distros (this install process)
05:46:42 <louipc> manjaro is not supported tho
05:46:48 <louipc> so just use arch :p
05:47:02 <jimsanches1124[m> now i gotta set it up lol
05:47:16 <jimsanches1124[m> thats what i was trying to avoid
05:47:21 <jimsanches1124[m> setting up arch just for a live usb
05:47:55 <louipc> yea not sure if graphene install would work from the arch install image
05:48:02 <memelord669[m]> Use a macos live USB
05:48:04 <louipc> would be cool too try
05:48:24 <louipc> theres also netboot
05:49:00 <louipc> If you have a wired connection, you can boot the latest release directly over the network.
05:49:50 <louipc> well, anyways.. not an arch install channel :p
05:50:05 <jimsanches1124[m> thats another story... LOL
05:50:33 <jimsanches1124[m> dont even get me started on the friendly gentoo channels ; ) Lol
05:50:58 <memelord669[m]> Linux from scratch by hand  or can you even Linux
05:51:18 <jimsanches1124[m> gentoo has to be by far the worst channels ive ever been in
05:51:24 <jimsanches1124[m> very rude people
05:51:56 <jimsanches1124[m> not all of them of course
05:52:09 <jimsanches1124[m> but a lot
05:54:03 <louipc> ok guys but please join #grapheneos-offtopic for general chat and stuff
05:54:35 <jimsanches1124[m> oh i didnt even know that existed lol
05:54:38 <somenerd[m]> yeah
05:55:18 <jimsanches1124[m> well to get back on topic what would be the best distro to try installing this from on a live USB?
05:55:30 <jimsanches1124[m> i see it says ubuntu is not working good
05:56:00 <louipc> one that you can upgrade the fastboot to current version
05:56:01 <memelord669[m]> Any of the ones listed with signify
05:56:27 <jimsanches1124[m> ok
05:58:29 <jimsanches1124[m> oh ok it says ubuntu 20.04 is working that would be really simple to use quick from a USB
05:58:33 <jimsanches1124[m> flash drive
05:59:05 <jimsanches1124[m> ill try that and let u all know how that went
05:59:39 <jimsanches1124[m> once the OS switches im sure ill be able to transfer data to my pc anyways
06:00:47 <jimsanches1124[m> not to back up i should clarify i already know all the data gets deleted after flashing
07:06:59 <jimsanches1124[m> live flash drive didnt work out too well, i forgot its a very stripped down version of the real OS missing a lot
07:07:35 <jimsanches1124[m> best bet is to just get my regular computer i usually use with arch on it fixed up quick then re attempt
07:29:47 <jimsanches1124[m> i figured something out im onto something now
07:30:13 <jimsanches1124[m> i found there was a setting that was saying the pixel was an untrusted device so i disabled that
07:30:46 <jimsanches1124[m> but now it is telling me my fast boot is out of date and to download the new one even though the one i am using is the newest on i can find from the link directly on the site
07:40:24 <jimsanches1124[m> i finally fixed it, It was a problem with the file itself, i had to edit a line inside of it
07:40:35 <jimsanches1124[m> thank you all for listening to me lol
07:42:34 <Tennessee> no problem jim! lol
07:44:00 <jimsanches1124[m> and it was a problem that could have easily been avoided with linux LOL
07:44:04 <jimsanches1124[m> as i suspected
07:54:09 <Tennessee> well, at least you got it fixed.
07:59:36 <jimsanches1124[m> is there anywhere i could submit the problem i had and what i did to fix it so that in case others wind up with the same problem they can see ?
08:04:18 <clox[m]> Hi guys, i did install my graphenOS without 'obtaining signify' because I did not know precisely which commands I need to use on a linuxmint. Can someone help me understand which command I need to use to get SIGNIFY?
08:10:34 <dazinism> clox: sudo apt-get install signify-openbsd
08:11:27 <dazinism> As mint is based on Debian think you'll need to use that
08:12:59 <clox[m]> Thank you, dazinism
08:14:35 <jcb[m]> F(x)tec with physical keyboard: Has it been discussed to port GrapheneOS to it?
08:14:36 <jcb[m]> https://nitter.fdn.fr/thefxtec?cursor=HBaOwLnF1OHj6CQAAA%3D%3D
08:20:38 <Tennessee> @jim: can't say for sure, but from what I've seen, I'd say no there isn't.AFAIK there is no forum and the subreddit is on maintenance.MAYBE one of the issue trackers?! but tbh that doesn't feel like a place for a guide on solving an issue either.
08:22:49 <Tennessee> @jcb: never gonna happen. the SOC is close to EOL. Graphene wont be ported to devices w/o ongoing firmware support. (at least not officially)
08:37:21 <clox[m]> <jcb[m] "F(x)tec with physical keyboard: "> Can you install GrapheneOS on the F(x)tec phone? Will it be working like on a pixel phone?
08:37:49 <somenerd[m]> You can probably build it for the phone
08:38:06 <somenerd[m]> but it won't be as secure as the official Pixel builds
08:38:42 <somenerd[m]>  * You can probably build it for the phone (or, for that matter, any Android phone)
08:39:09 <clox[m]> The, somenerd. That I want to know! I will stay on the best then :-)
08:39:27 <somenerd[m]> Welcome!
08:40:24 <somenerd[m]> I may be wrong here, but Pixels are (afaik) the best phone for Android security
08:40:33 <pallaf[m]> How do you change accent colors on grapheneos?
08:42:10 <dazinism> jcb: it is an 2016 chipset and as suggested its unusual for Qualcomm to keep chipsets updated for this long
08:43:28 <dazinism> A year younger chipset got a shout out as note worthy, as it got support for Android 11 https://nitter.net/MishaalRahman/status/1303743527063560192#m
08:44:26 <dazinism> Can't really see a small company like fxtech keeping support going for long
08:45:08 <pallaf[m]> * How do I change accent colors on grapheneos?
08:45:46 <dazinism> Also I've not seen any suggestion that any fxtech phone has verified boot that will work with an alternative operating system
08:46:20 <dazinism> https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
08:47:03 <somenerd[m]> Pixels have rather good support for other OSs.
08:48:45 <clox[m]> dazinism: Thanks for clarify this. Good to know!
08:49:03 <pallaf[m]> I've already looked under settings but there seems to be no option to change
08:49:38 <dazinism> pallaf: there is no way to change
08:53:49 <dazinism> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/76
09:02:56 <pallaf[m]> dazinism: ok thx
11:32:18 <jcb[m]> That's a shame. I would love to see something like the fxtec running GOS...
11:34:10 <louipc> what is that
11:46:24 <dazinism> Keyboard slides out sideways & use it in landscape.
11:47:26 <dazinism> XDA developers are partnering for the launch of a new version with more RAM and storage
11:48:33 <dakotah[m]> Sounds pretty dope
13:25:22 <ss132ikl> hey, the build guide says that a lightweight sync should only take 61gb and full sync should take 89gb but when i try to do a lightweight sync with 95gb available my HDD fills up

15:48:54 <applescruff_53[m> How do the photos in Gallery get moved to desktop?
15:49:44 <applescruff_53[m> Linux Mint desktop
16:15:19 <nscnt> applescruff_53[m: Use your USB cable to transfer files by dragging files from your device to your computer or set up a synchronization app like Syncthing.
16:31:33 <applescruff_53[m> I have the pixel connected with a USB to the computer. The pixel3axl mounts.

16:39:41 <NorbertTretkowsk> applescruff_53: Have you enabled file transfer? There should be a notification where you can enable it, otherwise it only charges per default when connected via USB.
17:28:11 <tobsn[m]> Probably this had been asked several times already, but how do I get app notifications which relay on Google Play Services like Arlo or Twitter?
17:28:51 <Knull[m]> <tobsn[m] "Probably this had been asked sev"> afaik, you can't. ProtonMail is like that for me.
17:29:24 <tobsn[m]> Hmm ok, is there any work around you know of?
17:30:25 <tobsn[m]> Because several apps are just working without any issues notification wise
17:31:15 <tobsn[m]> FairEmail for example is giving me notifactions without any trouble
17:46:25 <nfpdex[m]> Hello guys. I did read somewhere that there are plans to ultimately build free hardware to use instead of pixel phones. Where can I find any more info on that? And is there anyway to help if you are not a programmer (other than money)?
17:51:35 <golli[m]2> <nfpdex[m] "Hello guys. I did read somewhere"> Spread the word and someone who hears it from you might be a programmer or willing to donate.
18:08:02 <r0tt0r[m]> <nfpdex[m] "Hello guys. I did read somewhere"> librem tried this and only one part is yet not free
18:08:41 <tobsn[m]> Someone knows a way to circumvent the Google Play Service and still get app notifications?
18:26:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw I'm aware many people messaged me for testing
18:26:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is taking a while to get test builds ready
18:26:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please be patient

19:24:04 <cenapatop689[m]> How can I look my bootloader without losing my data
19:28:36 <malicoye[m]> I'd guess you can't
19:30:35 <malicoye[m]> Split screen mode has been unusable to me last months. It lags abnormally. Anyone else? P3XL. It began since Android 11 release
19:42:44 <alzxjm[m]> cenapatop689: you cannot, as far as I know
19:45:30 <cenapatop689[m]> alzxjm: Adb backup maybe?
19:46:07 <cenapatop689[m]> Never used, just heard of it
19:46:44 <cenapatop689[m]> +I have+
19:56:03 <alzxjm[m]> cenapatop689: you can back your phone up and restore it, sure. But no data will survive a re-lock
20:23:48 <PeterEaston> cenapatop689[m]: changing bootloader lock state will cause the phone to be reset, this is by design. You wouldn't want someone to come along, unlock your bootloader, change the operating system to one of their liking, rekey the bootloader, then relock it again with your data still on it.
20:28:57 <faxing[m]> I have recently been trying to compartmentalize my apps in different user profiles on GrapheneOS but haven't been able to figure out how to have notifications go to the whole device and not just be isolated to that one profile.
20:29:05 <faxing[m]> Is that even possible or am I just sort of wasting my time?
20:49:10 <tobsn[m]> <faxing[m] "I have recently been trying to c"> I also would like to know how to get app notifications of apps depending on Goople Play Service using GrapheneOS.
20:52:17 <TheJollyRoger> tobsn[m]: The easiest way to do this is to go and kindly request, petition, or coerce the developers of those apps that depend on Google play to have a fallback to function without it.
20:52:58 <alzxjm[m]> I reached out to an app developer to remove a tracker from their ap
20:52:59 <alzxjm[m]> app
20:53:04 <alzxjm[m]> They were happy for the feedback, and the newest version does not have the tracker.
20:53:15 <alzxjm[m]> This was a proprietary app for photos management.
20:53:16 <TheJollyRoger> alzxjm[m]: Yarr, splice the mainbrace! \o/
20:53:19 <alzxjm[m]> So it can be done!
20:54:08 <TheJollyRoger> tobsn[m]: in order to function, Play Services need to be integrated deeply into the operating system and must be granted some special privileges. GrapheneOS considers both play services invasive and this to countermand several of the project's goals for "security first, minimize as many attack vectors as possible."
20:54:54 <Joeri[m]> do I need to be worried about the possible proprietary modem and other drivers on the pixel 3XL?
20:54:55 <TheJollyRoger> So, your best bet stands with the developers of those apps. Signal is one such app that's been written to be optimized for running in the foreground, without Play Services to tell it to "wake up" to retrieve messages queued at the server.
20:55:07 <TheJollyRoger> Joeri[m]: no. The drivers on the Pixels are open source.
20:55:30 <Joeri[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Joeri: no. The drivers on the Pi"> oh wow that's great. are there exceptions?
20:55:36 <TheJollyRoger> Not that I know of.
20:55:49 <TheJollyRoger> The devices on the Pixels are further isolated from the host via In/Out Memory Management.
20:55:54 <alzxjm[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Joeri: no. The drivers on the Pi"> Are you sure about this?
20:56:22 <TheJollyRoger> alzxjm[m]: fairly certain. I'll ask for confirmation and get back to you.
20:56:56 <Joeri[m]> <TheJollyRoger "alzxjm: fairly certain. I'll ask"> could you ping me if you get an answer?
20:57:05 <TheJollyRoger> I will. Assume no news is good news.
20:58:24 <TheJollyRoger> The drivers are compiled right into the kernel, so it wouldn't really make sense if they weren't.
20:58:55 <alzxjm[m]> TheJollyRoger: Aye aye
21:00:00 <faxing[m]> <faxing[m] "I have recently been trying to c"> Is it possible to even achieve this?
21:00:02 <TheJollyRoger> Joeri[m]: alzxjm[m]: Yup, they're open source. https://github.com/GrapheneOS/kernel_google_crosshatch/tree/11/drivers
21:01:14 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m]: Not sure, to be honest, I'll do a little digging when I have spare time.
21:02:52 <alzxjm[m]> TheJollyRoger: Thank!
21:02:54 <alzxjm[m]>  * TheJollyRoger: Thanks!
21:03:11 <faxing[m]> <TheJollyRoger "faxing: Not sure, to be honest, "> Oh thanks! I really appreciate it!
21:03:27 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, hope I can help ye, shipmates!
21:05:59 <Joeri[m]> how would I be able to see whether a language pack that is usually installed with foss android roms properly installs on grapheneos ?
21:06:19 <Joeri[m]> I've been having some issues using the stock aosp keyboard on my phone in my native language of Dutch
21:06:58 <Joeri[m]> i since switched to gboard on which i disable the network permission and since I don't use any other android apps i believe it should be fine. but I'd rather use the stock keyboard if at all possible
21:07:15 <Joeri[m]> <Joeri[m] "how would I be able to see wheth"> i would like to be able to test it so I can make a bug report if it doesn't work at all
21:07:23 <Joeri[m]> is it possible to use grapheneos in something like a VM?
21:07:38 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, crap. This part unfortunately, I'm not actually sure I can help with. I know there are other keyboard apps available, but I know that we've had some troubles with getting languages that aren't English installed because this would require a lot of translation work and we'd need people that the project can trust on that so support for other languages might not be available yet.
21:08:12 <TheJollyRoger> Joeri[m]: I have good news for you on the idea of GrapheneOS in a virtual machine! Yes! GrapheneOS will run in the Android Studio emulator, several people here have actually reported getting it working before.
21:08:32 <TheJollyRoger> I haven't tried it myself though so unfortunately I cannot walk you through the process, but yes, GrapheneOS will run in an emulator quite happily.
21:09:53 <Joeri[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ah, crap. This part unfortunatel"> i might be available to check some strings i. Dutch and german
21:10:04 <Joeri[m]> * i might be available to check some strings in Dutch and German
21:10:20 <Joeri[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Joeri: I have good news for you "> that's awesome. I'll check if I can reproduce the bug
21:10:31 <Joeri[m]> * that's awesome. I'll check if I can reproduce the bug  later
21:10:35 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome!
21:11:00 <tobsn[m]> alzxjm: TheJollyRoger OK thx, do we have a list of apps with notifications working without Google play integration?
21:11:01 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know if the project's ready to start branching out in terms of language support but knowing people are around that do speak other langauges is the first step.
21:12:26 <alzxjm[m]> tobsn.: https://github.com/techlore-official/plexus/blob/master/src/data/Plexus.csv
21:12:27 <TheJollyRoger> tobsn[m]: so far I know that Signal will, as will Wire Swiss. They will need to run in the foreground (so don't hide the notification!).
21:12:29 <alzxjm[m]> There is some info there.
21:12:41 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo, awesome find alzxjm[m]!
21:13:14 <tobsn[m]> <alzxjm[m] "tobsn.: https://github.com/techl"> Top notch
21:13:36 <tobsn[m]> <TheJollyRoger "tobsn.: so far I know that Signa"> Okay
21:14:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I don't use that many apps, I haven't used Wire in a long time, so my experience with different apps tends to be fairly minimal.
21:14:26 <Joeri[m]> <TheJollyRoger "tobsn.: so far I know that Signa"> wait does hiding a notification make it not run in the foreground? i have not experienced this issue with apps like signal
21:15:42 <TheJollyRoger> I'm actually unsure. I just noticed that when I hid the dot it also stopped sending me notifications and I would miss them.
21:16:01 <TheJollyRoger> But my memory's a tad bit foggy so you'll need to confirm.
21:17:35 <nfpdex[m]> I also could help with doing some translation into german if needed.
21:18:18 <nfpdex[m]> Is there a way to see who here actually is a developer of the project?
21:19:39 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think so. We haven't got custom IRC cloaks or Matrix Flair, maybe we'll do that later in the future.
21:20:07 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not one of them though, I'm just the channel greeter.
21:22:03 <nfpdex[m]> ok thank you.
21:25:09 <tobsn[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I'm not one of them though, I'm "> By the way, who is in charge of the channels permissions? Saw the channel is running unencrypted ...
21:26:00 <TheJollyRoger> tobsn[m]: "unencrypted" does not mean what you think it means - this is a public channel. Would you like me to give you the breakdown?
21:27:16 <alzxjm[m]> nfpdex: You can look at the project's Github page.
21:28:00 <alzxjm[m]> nfpdex: https://github.com/orgs/GrapheneOS/people
21:28:12 <TheJollyRoger> tobsn[m]: if we turned on the encryption on a public channel it would be like building a 100-foot high wall around my house, then not even bothering to lock the gate.
21:28:17 <TheJollyRoger> Because anyone could join.
21:30:13 <TheJollyRoger> On Matrix, all connections between servers and from servers to client are protected by TLSv1.2. On Freenode, you can request certauth, and connect on an SSL port.
21:31:14 <TheJollyRoger> If we were to turn on the end to end encryption, there are over a hundred people in this channel. If we assume that each person has only one device each, then that means we'd need to all visit each other and get each others' keying information to have any security benefit. That's a good lot of travelling.
21:32:02 <TheJollyRoger> There are 817 people in this channel. Are you willing to travel around the world to meet 816 other people?
21:32:04 <tobsn[m]> Haha, ok that makes sense
21:32:06 <TheJollyRoger> Because I sure am not!
21:32:31 <tobsn[m]> Got it 😃
21:33:08 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Yeah, we want this channel to be publicly accessible and available to everyone.
21:33:12 <alzxjm[m]> tobsn.: It's a public channel. It does not need to be encrypted.
21:33:18 <alzxjm[m]> Anyone can join
21:34:21 <tobsn[m]> Even if I love to travel that would be hell of a trip 🗺️
21:34:28 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha, yes!
21:35:07 <TheJollyRoger> Man, you could make a documentary out of that, even. Imagine a documentary about taking a random chat room full of people, and travelling around the world to get to know each one of them and their stories about what brought them to the channel...
21:35:55 <tobsn[m]> Damn
21:36:05 <tobsn[m]> That would be ultr@
21:36:06 <alzxjm[m]> TheJollyRoger: That is a better answer.
23:40:10 <problems_10> I'm having some trouble installing grapheneos on a pixel 4a.  It's updated to the latest operating system and security update.  It's unlocked since it was bought from google.  I've tried linux POPOS and windows 10.  Right now I'm trying windows 10 again.
23:40:32 <problems_10> I can get it to appear with ./adb devices using a thunderbolt cable that is C to C
23:41:04 <problems_10> The issue is that once I use adb reboot bootloader and try to do fastboot flashing unlock, I get stuck at waiting for device
23:42:14 <problems_10> Any idea what can cause this problem?  I see some other people have asked about it recently but they were using linux.
23:43:41 <problems_10> The fastboot screen says boot slot B and the unlock status is locked
23:46:03 <problems_10> I've tried 2 usb c to c cables including the one the pixel 4a came with.  I also tried a couple anker usb c to usb cables.  None of those work though.  They all fail to get the device to appear in device manager or have the pixel display the notificaiton shade drop down that asks if you want to only charge or do file transfers. The thunderbolt c to
23:46:04 <problems_10> c cable is the only thing that works.
