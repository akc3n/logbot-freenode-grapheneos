00:01:27 <TheJollyRoger> If you're concerned about the app, then don't give it permissions. Android already sandboxes the apps. It will run without most of the permissions, although if you want camera and a microphone you'll obviously need to grant those.
00:04:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> > Shouldn't hack your phone as long as it's in a separate profile though
00:04:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> Strictly speaking it (probably) won't *actually* hack your phone anyway, but it may do mean things.
00:05:08 <cyborgninjaneer[> Zoom should be considered malware or an unwanted program, like McAffee.
00:05:15 <TheJollyRoger> This is what Application sandboxing on Android is for.
00:05:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> Exactly.
00:06:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> And separate profiles hide what software you have installed
00:10:51 <glct[m]> jacob: qyo3462572445 May I PM you you both in a group chat?
00:13:53 <sheruleeya[m]> * But again, I refrain from doing it, as much as possible. You could use the website anyways if possible (yes it is, when you tick the desktop mode). Vanadium can handle it pretty much
00:18:00 <sheruleeya[m]> <animalchin[m] "Its on my 3a with GOS. Do you kn"> Can't disable it. What does it do?
00:18:10 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you're on a Pixel 3 maybe. I doubt any of the other phones (barring the 4 which is experimental) will have the power
00:18:14 <dazinism> cyborgninjaneer: jalb user profiles keep running and can still make connections when you switch to another. You can restart the phone to kill non-main users
00:18:44 <dazinism> Also can force stop apps to stop them running in background
00:19:34 <dazinism> Although I think in shelter, island etc. you have to freeze, rather than force stop
00:20:22 <dazinism> I used to use Jitsi in the browser on my Nexus 6p
00:21:07 <dazinism> Jitsi in chromium (via desktop site selected)
00:24:26 <dazinism> Also with user profiles each user has possibility of their own VPN, without that set connections from that user will be clearnet
00:25:21 <dazinism> Because of the leak but, can not be sure what will happen if more than one user has a VPN set
00:26:51 <dazinism> *leak bug (my spell checker sometimes goes weird and keeps changing words)

01:43:17 <aeonsolution[m]> it will unless you delete it
01:44:14 <faxing[m]> So I will be able to get it back if I were to change to a different wallpaper
01:45:02 <aeonsolution[m]> yes, Settings->Display->Wallpaper->Wallpapers
01:45:35 <aeonsolution[m]> if you delete the default wallpaper, you won't be able to recover it unless you do a factory reset
01:46:02 <aeonsolution[m]> changing the wallpaper won't delete it

05:14:17 <chmod000[m]> Hello :) is shelter considered the best solution for sandboxing apps? Is there a good guide for best practices when you have to do this sort of thing? Thank You
05:15:04 <cn3m[m]> chmod000: use seperate user profiles is the standard sandboxing is not enough for privacy
05:15:18 <cn3m[m]> Shelter is not as robust of a solution
05:19:16 <chmod000[m]> what do you recommend?
05:31:47 <sheruleeya[m]> <chmod000[m] "what do you recommend? "> Read again the comment above your last comment, but slowly
05:32:30 <sheruleeya[m]> Apps which ask for device admin/manager permissions are not recommended.
05:34:20 <jalb> dazinism: thanks!
05:34:38 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "chmod000: use seperate user prof"> What he probably meant was user profiles are best option for sandboxing, but it isn't sufficient in itself to keep your privacy, considering its other aspects
05:35:32 <sheruleeya[m]> * What he probably meant was user profiles are best option for sandboxing, but it isn't sufficient in itself to keep your privacy, considering its (privacy) other aspects
05:37:37 <sheruleeya[m]> (Unless what I said is wrong)
05:43:04 <strcat[m]> apps are always sandboxed
05:43:13 <strcat[m]> same app sandbox regular of whether you use work or user profiles
05:43:59 <strcat[m]> user profiles are different workspaces: each has their own data (contacts, home directory, etc.), and apps can only communicate within a profile, not across them
05:44:51 <strcat[m]> the standard sandbox doesn't get any better with profiles, it's just the semantics of what can be accessed that's based on the profile
05:45:12 <strcat[m]> apps like shelter creating / managing a work profile do not sandbox apps any more than usual
05:45:16 <strcat[m]> they are not 'sandboxing' apps
05:46:34 <sheruleeya[m]> Sorry about that, but what he said is more accurate
05:48:26 <sheruleeya[m]> Or actually, that's really how separate profiles works (sorry if I disturbed you there)
05:51:01 <sheruleeya[m]> * Sorry about that, but what he said is more accurate (than mine), and anybody would fare better in finding info if you read the logs of his messages
05:52:26 <jalb> strcat[m]: do you know if using only a VPN app in another user will connect other users in the background (without this VPN app) with this VPN connection?
05:52:54 <strcat[m]> yes, networking is not per-profile
05:52:55 <jalb> Or only the normal or clear connection?
05:53:03 <jalb> strcat[m]: ok, thanks
05:53:06 <strcat[m]> if the profiles are logged out then of course they can't run stuff
05:53:17 <strcat[m]> switching users is not logging out
05:53:34 <strcat[m]> the easiest way to log out of all profiles ATM is to reboot although it's possible to log out without rebooting
05:53:44 <strcat[m]> it's just not part of the usual Settings or quick settings UI
05:53:55 <jalb> Interesting
05:55:05 <jalb> In this case it's not private to use a VPN app only in a different profile, maybe using Tor browser only in that different profile
05:56:26 <chmod000[m]> thank you for the information. i am going to have to do some more reading :)
06:00:59 <sheruleeya[m]> I assume main profile always run on background, is that true even for GrapheneOS?
06:01:22 <sheruleeya[m]> (source is the android (aosp) documentation)
06:01:59 <teddybears[m]> Yeah
06:02:04 <jalb> sheruleeya[m]: yes
06:02:43 <jalb> Or you must reboot lo log out as strcat[m] said
06:02:50 <jalb> *to log out
06:03:43 <teddybears[m]> You might want to look into shelter
06:04:06 <teddybears[m]> It will create a work profile that can be easily turned on and off and can run their own VPN
06:04:52 <teddybears[m]> You can have a seperate lock for the work profile
06:06:21 <teddybears[m]> Im excited for android 11
06:06:39 <teddybears[m]> Scoped storage
06:08:58 <chmod000[m]> teddybears: that is kinda what I am looking for... is there a good guide on setting it up, like best practices?
06:10:21 <sheruleeya[m]> Don't use it on main profile?
06:10:51 <sheruleeya[m]> Then main profile should have all network permission revoked? That's what I suggest, if you really need to use it.
06:11:39 <chmod000[m]> I do not understand, do not run shelter on main profile\user?
06:12:48 <teddybears[m]> You can do it but it sounds like that person was responding to something you wrote earlier
06:14:41 <teddybears[m]> Hmm i know there were some apps i could not get working without installing them on the main profile anyway but i dont know if i remember if shelter was one of them
06:15:01 <teddybears[m]> I seem to vaguely remember having it give me an error but could be wrong
06:20:40 <teddybears[m]> I guess it is going to come down to how quickly you want to be able to switch between apps.  Work profiles will be more seamless
06:29:56 <sheruleeya[m]> <teddybears[m] "Hmm i know there were some apps "> Yeah, some apps have those issue. Not sure what's the cause
06:40:07 <teddybears[m]> <sheruleeya[m] "Yeah, some apps have those issue"> It seems that those secondary profiles are more limited for security purposes
06:40:22 <teddybears[m]> Only one account seems to have full control

18:01:27 <pikey[m]> it seems popular although I dont know why,
18:01:34 <pikey[m]> more secure i assume

18:05:29 <pikey[m]> thanks
18:05:31 <sixBit[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "pikey: openvpn is a security the"> What do you mean by that?
18:06:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> sixBit: you just have to trust your provider
18:06:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> You have to trust that they are using sane and actually safe ciphers
18:06:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> And that they are updating openssl or whatever library frequently
18:07:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> I wouldn't be surprised if some were vulnerable to heartbleed even today
18:08:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wireguard only has one cipher and the cipher is proven to be secure
18:09:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Misconfiguration of wireguard is much harder
18:09:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> On the other hand wireguard is harder to configure
18:09:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can't have one config for all users
18:10:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> You need to write a back end that can issue new profiles and garbage collect old ones
18:10:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> You have to put a lot of trust in VPN providers anyway, but I see your point.
18:10:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> While UDP is theoretically faster
18:10:47 <crabbles> i cant look up src rn but maybe thru google ; i think openvpns been comprimised/ ez to crack
18:11:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Linux has a bad implementation of UDP
18:11:31 <dazinism> chmod000: have a look at https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
18:11:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> So UDP causes more load than TCP
18:12:45 <pikey[m]> interesting stuff thanks anu
18:13:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unlike openvpn wireguard allows better roaming. Wireguard supports both client and server changing their IPs at any time. So wireguard will not kill your connection if you switch from WiFi to mobile data or if your WiFi drops for a second. Openvpn will require a full handshake and kill all your connections
18:13:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wireguard is much more forgiving
18:13:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> However most VPN providers pin IPs and break this feature so it mostly works only when you self host
18:20:53 <dazinism> chmod000: I was going to add something about Shelter currently being unmaintained and using Island (or  its new fork Insular)is probably better. But note that the dev is working on it again
18:25:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Island it is
18:33:06 <dazinism> Insular fork strips out the Google analytics etc. for Fdroid, looks like it may be added soon.
18:33:25 <dazinism> https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues/1393
18:34:50 <dazinism> Also on the Fdroid repo using v1 certs
18:34:50 <dazinism> Android 11 won't support installs or updates signed with v1
18:36:36 <dazinism> Thats pretty soon, and I'm thinking will push the repo to (finally) use v2 (and quite likely v3) signatures
18:37:40 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Unlike openvpn wireguard allows "> useful to know thanks. I don't use wifi at all so I am only on LTE, i wondered if that may be why I am getting so many connection issues, failures to submit remote attestation etc
18:37:53 <dazinism> Although I'm thinking getting the reproducable build server to move from v1 is likely to be more complex, and less of a priority
18:38:27 <dazinism> As theres not many apps with reproducable builds
18:39:13 <dazinism> ....actually the Fdroid app does, which is kind of important for them

20:01:13 <crabbles> anyone have any experience with android malware ? i am compromised badly
20:01:14 <sixBit[m]> My screen is mildly flashing when brightness is low. Does anybody experience the same?
20:06:11 <pikey[m]> <sixBit[m] "My screen is mildly flashing whe"> ha, I had this exact thing last night myself on a long journey. it kept going to full brightness and if i tried to dim it down (in a dark vehicle) it flickered and flashed then went to full brightness again
20:06:22 <pikey[m]> I was starting to wonder if my device HW is dodgy
20:09:02 <pikey[m]> OpenVPN for Android - found that in Fdroid. Is that recommended?

20:20:52 <dolores0[m]> I have some basic questions for anybody that can help advise how to contribute to the project directly
20:21:28 <dolores0[m]> but my level is that of a layperson that cannot code, though I want to get to that point to be able to help with the project
20:31:22 <dazinism> dolores0: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os
20:31:44 <dazinism> Its not been updated for a while, but I think most of it is still relevant
20:32:13 <dazinism> Guess the other thing if you want to learn to code.
20:32:26 <dazinism> Learn to build AOSP or even the GrapheneOS apps
20:32:44 <dazinism> PDF viewer, Auditor etc.
20:33:24 <dazinism> Then watch contributions and try and figure out changes
20:33:58 <dazinism> that happen to it
20:34:00 <dazinism> them
20:35:42 <dolores0[m]> wow I did not see that wiki when I was searching for it
20:35:49 <dolores0[m]> thanks daz
20:36:30 <dolores0[m]> actually think I went to the matrix channel instead of the libra wiki
20:38:14 <dolores0[m]> the wiki is helpful but not quite what I'm thinking of, I assume I should just learn to build AOSP?
20:38:46 <dolores0[m]> don't want to pick a goal too difficult and give up
20:38:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hi dolores0[m], I have a few resources for you on learning to build and run CTS.
20:39:02 <TheJollyRoger> One sec.
20:39:20 <dolores0[m]> okay!
20:39:39 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/For%20Testers/The-Compatibility-Test-Suite.md This'll help you set up the Compatibility Test Suite.
20:39:55 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/For%20Maintainers/Setting-Up-Your-Host.md And this will help you with setting up a build environment.
21:38:00 <dolores0[m]> thanks, that's pretty comprehensive
21:38:03 <dolores0[m]> what a iu
21:38:28 <dolores0[m]> about the skills required once I actually have a build environment set up?
21:38:53 <dolores0[m]> <dolores0[m] "about the skills required once I"> what about*
21:40:53 <crueltekk[m]> No one here with FaceUnlock problems here on Pixel 4XL?
21:46:59 <cdesai> crueltekk[m]: what's the problem?
21:47:58 <hitchhooker[m]> soo if google will be forced to provide firmware level backdoor after Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act(https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/S.4051%20Lawful%20Access%20to%20Encrypted%20Data%20Act.pdf)  goes through, does grapheneos help me at all against this?
21:48:24 <crueltekk[m]> Since I flashed graphene the FaceUnlock wont work.
21:48:35 <hitchhooker[m]> or is firmware level backdoor securitywise game over?
21:49:24 <cdesai> crueltekk[m]: a logcat would help if you know how to take one.
21:49:37 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: ^ it's working here / on aosp without any changes
21:49:48 <strcat[m]> cdesai: it works on GrapheneOS
21:49:58 <strcat[m]> maybe it's slower but it works
21:50:18 <crueltekk[m]> Okay should say that im on Pixel 4xl
21:50:18 <crueltekk[m]> Logcat from what exactly?
21:51:04 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: not what that act proposes to do
21:51:20 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: and Google is hardly the only company / individual / organization in the US
21:51:40 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm is a US company too, and nearly all major companies have a US presence so they are subject to US law
21:52:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai "anupritaisno1: ^ it's working he"> what is?
21:52:59 <JTL> I'm confused lol
21:53:17 <cdesai> face unlock
21:53:30 <JTL> ah okay
21:53:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai "face unlock"> it sure does
21:54:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> have grapheneos running rn
21:54:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> official build
21:54:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat
21:54:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> pr need more changes?
21:56:34 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: rebase if you haven't
21:56:38 <strcat[m]> working on the July release atm
21:56:50 <strcat[m]> it will need more changes tho
21:57:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: wil do in a few hours
21:58:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> need to do that on my roms too
21:58:41 <hitchhooker[m]> strcat, still reading it, but seems like any company that has sold 1 million hardware or software after 2016 is forced to co-operate under law to provide pass on encryption of their customers?
21:59:06 <strcat[m]> nothing like what you said
21:59:25 * crueltekk[m] posted a file: 2020-07-06_23.59.zip (3KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/riOXHlynigUYjsUEOjuonKqS >
21:59:30 <strcat[m]> and again, how is that specific to Google?
21:59:51 <crueltekk[m]> Made a sys log hope that helps
21:59:56 <strcat[m]> it's also not a law, it's a proposal in committee
22:00:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "nothing like what you said"> who?
22:00:21 <strcat[m]> I don't think we need to discuss everything proposed in US congress committees here
22:00:31 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: hitchhooker
22:00:35 <strcat[m]> it's not a US politics channel
22:01:07 <strcat[m]> if you don't want to use hardware involving companies in the US, guess you'll be using a huawei device
22:01:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "if you don't want to use hardwar"> eww
22:01:39 <strcat[m]> don't see anything to talk about beyond you trying to create a fuss out of a proposal that's unlikely to become a law
22:01:55 <strcat[m]> you're free to use a huawei device and port GrapheneOS to it
22:02:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> but chinese spyware :D
22:02:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> oh great
22:02:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> riot desktop is lagging now
22:02:46 <hitchhooker[m]> im running google phones and that kind of proposal scares the shit out of me
22:03:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> hitchhooker: oneplus time
22:03:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> port grapheneos to oneplus
22:03:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> please i have tried it many times and failed
22:03:57 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: what phone do you plan on using that's not based in the US
22:04:00 <strcat[m]> why are you making it about Google
22:04:44 <strcat[m]> it's a proposal for a law still in committee
22:04:58 <strcat[m]> hasn't even made it to the point that there's anything to be voted on by congress
22:05:10 <strcat[m]> are you going to make a fuss out of every stupid bill that's proposed?
22:05:16 <strcat[m]> this is not a US politics channel
22:05:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> btw strcat  what is this
22:05:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> fatal allocator error: sized deallocation mismatch (large)
22:05:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> using hardened malloc
22:05:52 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: means code did a sized operator delete (C++) with a different size class than what they allocated with
22:05:54 <strcat[m]> which is undefined behavior
22:06:03 <strcat[m]> a common example would be they delete as the wrong type
22:06:08 <strcat[m]> due to a type confusion bug
22:06:20 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you can optionally disable the specialized C++ support
22:06:29 <strcat[m]> a lot of C++ code has those type confusion bugs including Qt
22:06:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> well happened in telegram-desktop
22:06:55 <strcat[m]> you can build with CONFIG_CXX_ALLOCATOR := false
22:06:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> i just disabled systemwide ldpreload to launch telegram
22:06:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> then enabled it back
22:07:03 <strcat[m]> to use the regular C++ allocator implementation
22:07:09 <strcat[m]> which will still use hardened_malloc
22:07:21 <strcat[m]> just without the sized deallocation sanity check
22:07:24 <strcat[m]> that's the only feature that adds
22:07:41 <strcat[m]> in README
22:07:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> not really expecting any attacks throgh telegram tbh
22:07:42 <strcat[m]> > CONFIG_CXX_ALLOCATOR: true (default) or false to control whether the C++ allocator is replaced for slightly improved performance and detection of mismatched sizes for sized deallocation (often type confusion bugs). This will result in linking against the C++ standard library.
22:08:10 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: apple is a US company
22:08:13 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: qualcomm is a US company
22:08:20 <strcat[m]> intel is  US company
22:08:22 <strcat[m]> AMD is a US company
22:08:28 <hitchhooker[m]> yes, we are fucked
22:08:43 <strcat[m]> from a law being proposed in committee?
22:08:44 <strcat[m]> I don't get it
22:10:05 <strcat[m]> they've been posturing about this stuff for years
22:11:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "they've been posturing about thi"> See: "Clipper Chip" for one of the more serious-traction'd attempts
22:12:26 <strcat[m]> it's just posturing
22:12:34 <strcat[m]> tech companies have a ton of money and do a lot of lobbying
22:13:04 <strcat[m]> they are just trying to make themselves look good by portraying themselves as fighting the evil tech companies
22:13:14 <strcat[m]> they aren't going to do shit
22:13:22 <strcat[m]> ot'
22:13:27 <strcat[m]> it's a bill in committee
22:13:48 <strcat[m]> if you're going to have panic attacks about every bill that a couple congresspeople write
22:14:11 <strcat[m]> you aren't going to have a very good time
22:14:27 <JTL> Lot's of stupid bills get proposed in the US (and elsewhere for that matter)
22:15:48 <hitchhooker[m]> thanks for the calming words, i guess im overreacting then
22:16:00 <strcat[m]> it's just usual US BS political / media cycle
22:17:37 <strcat[m]> if they were really going to do it I'm sure they'd require it for small companies / orgs too especially with companies like encrochat in the news
22:18:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> Americans be like "Don't touch my Bibles, my guns, or my encryption!" Don't worry about the lawful access bill for now.
22:18:05 <strcat[m]> pretty big if
22:18:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Americans be like "Don't touch m"> Except those two groups rarely join hands and realize their battles are the same. We're all idiots =[
22:18:46 <strcat[m]> they aren't going to choose what the police want over what capital wants, simple
22:19:23 <strcat[m]> when your interests are aligned with a bunch of the biggest US corporations paying a ton of money for lobbying and political contributions
22:19:32 <strcat[m]> I think you should worry about other things
22:19:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> > > <@cyborgninjaneer:matrix.org> Americans be like "Don't touch my Bibles, my guns, or my encryption!" Don't worry about the lawful access bill for now.
22:19:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> > Except those two groups rarely join hands and realize their battles are the same. We're all idiots =[
22:19:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> Guns and encryption really are the same fight. Everyone needs to start calling backdoors "digital gun control"
22:20:12 <strcat[m]> and what phones are there other than Pixels that wouldn't be impacted
22:20:12 <cyborgninjaneer[> That rhetoric will help garner support for encryption in the US
22:20:16 <strcat[m]> other than say Kirin Huawei ones
22:20:17 <hitchhooker[m]> you right that law would be capital suicide if passing through
22:20:40 <strcat[m]> and do you really think a huawei phone is without issues
22:20:46 <strcat[m]> china already effectively has laws like that
22:21:18 <strcat[m]> they might not actually make huawei put backdoors in their phones but they CAN legally do it already
22:21:21 <hitchhooker[m]> is there even semiconductor manufacturer that hasnt sold 1 000 000 devices/software since 2016 in US
22:21:21 <strcat[m]> no need to change anything
22:21:47 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: that 1m number is not really relevant
22:21:57 <strcat[m]> as I said I'm sure if they really passed the law that wouldn't be a thing
22:22:14 <strcat[m]> if they really passed the law it would be edited a lot including taking technical info into account
22:22:27 <strcat[m]> and considering things like encrochat esp. with that being a big news story
22:23:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cyborgninjaneer[ "That rhetoric will help garner s"> Except from all the people that LOVE gun control! Maybe "digital gun-grabbing" would work, though, ha
22:24:04 <strcat[m]> you don't want it to become a political issue in the US
22:24:12 <cyborgninjaneer[> Or "the digital equivalent of repealing the Second Amendment"
22:24:14 <strcat[m]> because political issues in the US become partisan issues
22:24:28 <strcat[m]> if you tie it to guns the democrats will be against encryption
22:24:31 <strcat[m]> that's how US politics works
22:24:35 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "you don't want it to become a po"> No doubt. Then it's just a jumprope for the two entrenched parties to fight over, instead of something anyone truly considers.
22:24:50 <strcat[m]> and then people will adjust their views based on their other political views
22:24:52 <strcat[m]> like other things
22:24:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> I think Democrats are already against encryption. Could be wrong though
22:27:30 <strcat[m]> I don't think many politicians from either party know what it is
22:27:32 <strcat[m]> let alone the public
22:27:54 <JTL> Know what exactly?
22:28:27 <strcat[m]> what encryption is
22:28:45 <JTL> Oh yeah of course
22:28:48 <JTL> That doesn't surprise me
22:29:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> Some of the younger ones probably do. I don't think that judiciary committee has a damn clue
22:32:41 <strcat[m]> https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tesler-VIRUS-ECONOMY-0630-2-UPDATED.png?w=1150
22:32:47 <strcat[m]> if encryption became a political issue
22:32:53 <strcat[m]> it'd quickly turn into something like that
22:33:16 <strcat[m]> i.e. one the public is aware of
22:34:08 <strcat[m]> they're not aware so I don't see why you'd expect that they are really going to pass laws that a bunch of the biggest companies pouring tons of money into their campaigns and lobbying are against
22:34:41 <strcat[m]> stuff like net neutrality has big companies on both sides, this doesn't
22:35:24 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "they aren't going to choose what"> I think even from the perspective of them wanting to be able see and know everything it still doesn't make sense, aren't they already pretty good at this via metadata collections and users willingness to have account in social media and showing who they are and what they like
22:49:30 <igioo[m]> I think the bill is going to a floor vote now
23:17:01 <woot75[m]> Hello everybody!
23:19:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <woot75[m] "Hello everybody!"> Oh, cool, you made it
23:20:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> GrapheneOS.org - check out every page carefully
23:20:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Come back with any questions, mate
23:40:39 <woot75[m]> There is new addition to this project or only Pixel are possible still?
23:43:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Only Pixels have the hardware to retain the security model
23:52:16 <strcat[m]> there might be other devices that can do the basics
23:52:24 <strcat[m]> but people haven't invested time in finding and supporting those
23:52:32 <strcat[m]> requires expensive and time consuming research
23:52:38 <strcat[m]> without much to gain
23:53:07 <strcat[m]> since it's known they'll be worse but some might have the absolute bare minimum requirements
23:54:21 <renlord> strcat[m]: just hardware with any hardware-backed keystore?
23:54:43 <renlord> for bare min. requirement?
23:54:58 <strcat[m]> need more than that
23:55:08 <strcat[m]> verified boot with support for alternate OSes
23:55:14 <strcat[m]> full ongoing security updates
23:55:41 <strcat[m]> having full security support already rules out most devices
23:55:50 <renlord> i dont even know if besidse qualcomm there are other SoC vendors that push security updates regularly
23:55:52 <strcat[m]> also properly configured IOMMUs is a bare minimum requirement
23:55:53 <renlord> lulz
23:56:19 <strcat[m]> there isn't really much attention given to other SoCs so the security research to find the vulns barely exists
23:56:29 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm has a lot of internal and external research
23:56:55 <strcat[m]> probably next after that is Apple despite the platform being very locked down and having a very high barrier to entry for research
23:57:04 <strcat[m]> no one cares about other SoCs to the same extent
23:57:13 <renlord> and broadcom wanted to takeover and kill all of that "inefficient expenditure" of capital
