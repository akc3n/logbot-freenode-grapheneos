00:01:07 <valldrac> I’d revert it so we can work in the proper fix without hurry. But up to you
00:02:22 <valldrac> Anyway I’ll be focus on this during the weekend
00:03:40 <strcat[m]> valldrac: could you maybe figure out which processes this is used in
00:03:47 <strcat[m]> and we can just disable SLOT_RANDOMIZE for those as a quick workaround
00:03:52 <strcat[m]> SLOT_RANDOMIZE is not important
00:04:19 <renlord> woohoo, coral support soon?
00:05:46 <strcat[m]> renlord: don't think so just added some empty repos
00:06:00 <strcat[m]> someone did some work on it but there are major issues
00:06:09 <strcat[m]> and I don't own the devices to do releases
00:07:40 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you think it'll be appropriate to include the mocked gapi for cam provider?
00:08:18 <strcat[m]> don't want to do stuff like that atm
00:08:31 <strcat[m]> got a lot of issues that need to be addressed and the Android 11 migration not that far away
00:09:03 <strcat[m]> I think emulating Google Play needs to have a per-app toggle and should be a separate project we can rely on that's focused on minimalism / security
00:09:03 <strcat[m]> not microG
00:09:09 <strcat[m]> off by default and not the way they do it
00:09:20 <strcat[m]> just stub things out, pretend services aren't available, all of it
00:09:22 <strcat[m]> stub out all the APIs
00:09:29 <strcat[m]> and must be opted into per app
00:09:37 <renlord> the mocked gapi is not microg
00:09:41 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't trigger apps like Signal to try using GCM instead of their own push
00:09:42 <renlord> its actually stubbing out the API
00:10:09 <renlord> https://github.com/LumenReaper/Gcam-Services-Provider/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/google/android/gms/GServicesProvider.kt
00:10:11 <renlord> lulz
00:10:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: well that makes more sense just not ready to do this atm and needs to be optional / opt-in
00:10:29 <JTL> > 17:09 <strcat[m]> I think emulating Google Play needs to have a per-app toggle and should be a separate project we can rely on that's focused on minimalism / security
00:10:31 <JTL> Agreed
00:11:02 <strcat[m]> valldrac: try to figure out which process this happens in tho so we can just disable SLOT_RANDOMIZE there
00:11:07 <strcat[m]> so I can just put this into the next release
00:11:14 <strcat[m]> revert your attempted fix + work around it like that
00:12:09 <valldrac> okay, I’ll tell you
00:15:46 <strcat[m]> I just want it to work for now like stock
00:16:01 <strcat[m]> if they removed it in master we don't even need to ever fix it
00:16:05 <strcat[m]> hopefully gone in ANdroid 11
00:16:28 <strcat[m]> I'll work on the hardened_malloc change
00:19:46 <strcat[m]> valldrac: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/commit/c525803921e622cd50e7556911f339e76c00bff9
00:19:51 <strcat[m]> just need exe path to plug into to that
00:20:01 <nickcalyx[m]> > I think emulating Google Play needs to have a per-app toggle and should be a separate project we can rely on that's focused on minimalism / security
00:20:01 <nickcalyx[m]> Microg does have a per-app toggle for gcm registration allow
00:20:23 <JTL> nickcalyx[m]: I think he's talking for more then just that
00:20:23 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: want more than just for that tho
00:20:34 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: and also an app can decide to use GCM just because it sees Playu
00:20:37 <strcat[m]>  * nickcalyx: and also an app can decide to use GCM just because it sees Play
00:20:43 <JTL> I've noticed that oo
00:20:44 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: usually what will happen
00:20:53 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: so for example if Signal sees Play
00:20:57 <strcat[m]> I think it will try to use GCM
00:20:58 <renlord> as a permission toggle?
00:21:04 <strcat[m]> I don't think it will fall back if GCM doesn't work
00:21:10 <renlord> like Network?
00:21:14 <strcat[m]> they have Play and non-Play paths, they don't handle GCM being unavailable
00:21:31 <nickcalyx[m]> Makes sense, why would they
00:21:36 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: and we never want to actually have GCM in GrapheneOS just fake always down GCM
00:21:53 <strcat[m]> we just want a toggle to enable stubbed out Play Services where it pretends everything is down / unavailable
00:22:05 <strcat[m]> so instead of app not running it's just like it can't connect to Google services
00:22:13 <strcat[m]> so some won't work still
00:22:15 <strcat[m]> but many will work
00:22:20 <strcat[m]> with partial functionality
00:22:26 <strcat[m]> mostly just push notifications missing, etc.
00:22:30 <strcat[m]> unless they use Google for login or w/e
00:22:34 <strcat[m]> then it just won't work but w/e
00:37:49 <valldrac> strcat[m]: libaudiopolicyservice.so, and is loaded by audioserver, let me search the full path
00:38:08 <strcat[m]> valldrac: need the executable not the library
00:38:10 <strcat[m]> so audioserver
00:38:14 <strcat[m]> path to audioserver
00:38:32 <strcat[m]> SLOT_RANDOMIZE is really unimportant so it's not a big deal to temporarily disable it for a process
00:38:45 <strcat[m]> probably easiest way to deal with this if it works around the problem enough to wait for their upstream fix
00:43:12 <valldrac> strcat[m]: /system/bin/audioserver
00:44:54 <strcat[m]> valldrac: try pulling the frameworks/av and external/hardened_malloc changes
00:44:58 <strcat[m]> and just trying with that workaround
00:45:28 <strcat[m]> not pretty but...
00:45:29 <strcat[m]> it is what it is
00:46:36 <strcat[m]> maybe I'll do a release tomorrow with this
00:46:58 <valldrac> valldrac: okay, but let me check the fix first
00:47:10 <strcat[m]> yeah
00:47:28 <strcat[m]> valldrac: also could try working around camera bugs with more nonsense like this
00:47:34 <strcat[m]> there's already an attempt
00:51:16 <strcat[m]> C++ is such a shit language
00:51:30 <strcat[m]> layer on all this complexity and nonsense abstraction while it still being totally unsafe everywhere
00:51:31 <strcat[m]> not good
00:51:49 <renlord> legacy codebase, what do?
00:52:07 <renlord> cant just ask everyone to upgrade to c++14 today.
00:52:39 <strcat[m]> C++14 isn't any safer tho
00:52:41 <strcat[m]> they just add more
00:52:46 <strcat[m]> and people just abstract more and more
00:52:49 <strcat[m]> but it can't do safety
00:53:10 <strcat[m]> so you have this mix of layers and layers of weird abstractions, using a fucked up type system that's not based on actual type theory stuff
00:53:18 <strcat[m]> with unsafety everywhere
00:53:24 <strcat[m]> also class inheritance is a horrifying thing
00:53:32 <strcat[m]> it's hard to unravel what code is being called and what's happening
00:53:51 <strcat[m]> hard to debug this crap
00:54:06 <renlord> you have gripes with runtime vtable resolutions
00:54:24 <strcat[m]> renlord: mostly just class inheritance
00:54:31 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense
00:54:54 <renlord> if it can be resolved statically in compile-time, class inheritance is OK imo
00:55:10 <strcat[m]> I think it's a weird, illogical thing
00:55:20 <strcat[m]> and hard to follow or do correctly
00:55:25 <valldrac> strcat[m]: the problem with the camera is that there are some proprietary libraries in place, with no source code
00:55:38 <strcat[m]> valldrac: yeah but they have symbols at least
00:55:39 <valldrac> strcat[m]: so it's even harder
00:55:45 <strcat[m]> and we can just work around bugs and report upstream
00:56:21 <strcat[m]> don't really feel like trying to fix device-specific bugs all the time rather than just reporting them
00:56:51 <strcat[m]> valldrac: going to start building a release
00:56:55 <strcat[m]> needs to be tested first ofc
00:57:19 <strcat[m]> but this workaround + revert of the attempted fix is progress
00:57:31 <strcat[m]> as long as it's for the right process and works
00:57:52 <strcat[m]> building now
00:58:00 <strcat[m]> can use beta to test
00:58:04 <aeonsolution[m]> <strcat[m] "don't really feel like trying to"> its hard for you to do it all, it might be the best option right now with how the little contribution is coming in
00:59:06 <valldrac> strcat[m]: my build is sooo slow
00:59:07 <renlord> dont know if relevant, but encountering camera error on gcam is significantly less of an occurance compared to opencam
01:00:04 <renlord> valldrac: what sort of HW spec?
01:01:29 <aeonsolution[m]> question for the group:
01:01:29 <aeonsolution[m]> should we be testing with the beta when strcat makes a new release?
01:01:47 <valldrac> renlord: one thinkpad with external hdd
01:02:34 <renlord> valldrac: compiling using external hdd?
01:02:48 <renlord> thats a very huge io penalty hit
01:03:04 <valldrac> renlord: I know, but the internal ssd is not big enough
01:03:40 <valldrac> renlord: I plan to upgrade soon
01:03:50 <aeonsolution[m]> are you using a vm valldrac?
01:04:05 <renlord> and pay hypervisor penalty on top of io?
01:04:07 <renlord> lol
01:04:12 <valldrac> aeonsolution[m]: no way! xD
01:04:41 <aeonsolution[m]> how much memory you got on your main? maybe try 7zips some files
01:04:48 <cn3m[m]> > <@aeonsolution:matrix.org> question for the group:
01:04:48 <cn3m[m]> > should we be testing with the beta when strcat makes a new release?
01:04:48 <cn3m[m]> I am always on beta
01:05:46 <renlord> i still havent received my refund for spectre mitigation on intel machines
01:06:01 <renlord> they should at least refund me 30% of the price of the CPU I paid for.
01:06:32 <travankor_> you can turn the mitigations off?
01:06:33 <renlord> amd too
01:06:47 <renlord> travankor_: then what? leave my front door open?
01:06:56 <renlord> that's not a very reasonable thing to do
01:07:02 <cn3m[m]> I have Intel something or another
01:07:20 <travankor_> how many real world spectre exploits are there?
01:07:25 <aeonsolution[m]> <cn3m[m] "> <@aeonsolution:matrix.org> que"> thanks
01:07:28 <valldrac> renlord: no worries, we won't tell anyone, try https://make-linux-fast-again.com
01:07:38 <renlord> its analagous to a builder giving you a broken toilet installation with untinted bathroom windows.
01:07:40 <cn3m[m]> travankor: hey I have some beachfront property in Arizona to sell you. I will throw a librem 13 in with it
01:07:54 <renlord> and builder just asks you to shower naked exposed to everyone, refusing to replace the window.
01:08:01 <JTL> cn3m[m]: lol
01:10:11 <renlord> maybe an airgapped computer can run with those mitigations off
01:10:57 <renlord> its not a realistic option for me right now, since i have multi-use purposes for my pC.
01:12:07 <cn3m[m]> I run Windows 10 Enterprise now. I love all the VMs
01:12:24 <cn3m[m]> It is like Qubes with anti exploitation
01:13:32 <travankor_> you should also disable hyperthreading if you want to pedantic with the mitigations but w/e
01:13:50 <travankor_> to be*
01:27:26 <renlord> good point, but at that point, i really need a 50% refund or more.
01:27:54 <renlord> should just use an ARM SBC as my main computer at that point
01:29:53 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "should just use an ARM SBC as my"> 2021 macbook
01:41:17 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "not microG"> how would that work? isn't that a huge project
01:41:27 <strcat[m]> no
01:41:31 <strcat[m]> just stubbing out all the APIs
01:41:33 <strcat[m]> not implementing them
01:57:34 <strcat[m]> valldrac: initial build seems fine but I can't test much
01:57:37 <strcat[m]> don't have BT audio devices
01:57:41 <strcat[m]> just other BT devices
02:18:17 <RageLtMan> strcat: is the build in beta chan by chance?
02:19:53 <strcat[m]> not yet
02:19:55 <strcat[m]> takes a while to get it rdy
02:20:36 <strcat[m]> only 3a build is done
08:27:03 <highupper[m]> Are there any plans to support Pixel 4 or future 5 devices? I'm aware that Daniel Micay doesn't want to add more devices, but maybe when Pixel 2 support is dropped it could be replaced with newer Pixels? Personally I was thinking about buying a Pixel 3 (3a is only like 20€ cheaper), but only one year of support (October 2021, considering it's release date) is not enough for such an expensive phone (compared to e.g.
08:27:04 <highupper[m]> Xiaomi devices). Speaking of Xiaomi: I think I read that Xiaomi Mi A2 support was considered at some point. What about supporting a newer Mi A model (Mi A4?). It would probably expand Graphene's userbase, as Mi A devices are much more affordable than Pixels.

08:28:13 <RageLtMan> from what i understood of the post about new devices: developers need to sign on as maintainers for each device tree
08:28:27 <fujita_[m]> No, there is a lack of community support at he moment
08:28:42 <fujita_[m]> the*
08:29:41 <dazinism> highupper: the Mi A2 was a viable device, but they dropped verified boot support for alternative OS
08:29:51 <fujita_[m]> daniel is doing most of the work by himself so any chance of other devices getting supported would require the help of the community
08:29:53 <dazinism> When they moved from Oreo
08:30:27 <highupper[m]> <RageLtMan "from what i understood of the po"> Yeah, I think the reason behind this is that Daniel can't maintain lots of devices alone. But when Pixel 2 support is dropped isn't there room for a new device?
08:30:31 <nickcalyx[m]> The pixel 3a is currently on sale at least in the US for 279
08:30:32 <RageLtMan> Is there any appetite in the community to do something like kickstarters or bounties of some sort to compensate would-be developers for the work required?
08:31:15 <highupper[m]> <dazinism "highupper: the Mi A2 was a viabl"> Oh ok. Maybe we can reconsider it when the Mi A4 is released.
08:31:17 <RageLtMan> when you say "room for a new device," you realize that the statement expands to "an entirely new set of software and hardware problems to address" compared to maintenance functions for a legacy device
08:32:10 <fujita_[m]> please read up on daniel's past reddit comment
08:32:54 <RageLtMan> Which one?
08:33:07 <dazinism> Also Daniel wants to stop, maintaining devices. The project needs other people to do this.
08:33:46 <highupper[m]> <RageLtMan "when you say "room for a new dev"> Well yes, but I don't think the Pixel 2 will be supported forever (it'll run out of vendor updates). And supporting a new (series) of device(s) always requires work (so did the Pixel 3 series).
08:34:16 <dazinism> When the Pixel2 devices are dropped, I dont imagine he will take on new devices.  Needs other people doing that work
08:34:29 <RageLtMan> Yes, requires work, and there being only one guy doing ALL of the work, means burdening him more
08:34:47 <fujita_[m]> use reddit comment search type in his name and Pixel 4
08:35:03 <fujita_[m]> that should answer most of your questions
08:35:28 <fujita_[m]> he mainly needs development help at the moment
08:35:53 <highupper[m]> Is there some sort of documentation which hardware features are required for GrapheneOS to use it's full potential? Also is there a documentation on which device specific changes need to be done to Graphene's source code?
08:36:20 <RageLtMan> Right, but if nobody is stepping up to do that gratis, are there financial incentives that the community could provide to hire them? I'm in no position time-wise to get spun up and consistently maintain a tree
08:36:29 <fujita_[m]> its on grapeheneOS's github/ website
08:37:14 <fujita_[m]> <RageLtMan "Right, but if nobody is stepping"> you will have to talk to the mods for that
08:38:30 <highupper[m]> <fujita_[m] "its on grapeheneOS's github/ web"> Well he mainly talks about IOMMU in the FAQ page, but I'm looking for more specific stuff like Titan M requirements etc.
08:40:24 <dazinism> RageLtMan: Daniel accepts donations, but doesnt want all to take on the task of finding and employing devs
08:40:28 <RageLtMan> is there anyone on the moderation team who functions as a community coordinator? Who would be the person to talk to about trying to set up a non-corporate funding model (bypass any pitfalls of prior endeavors) to help offload Daniel and ensure some longevity to the project by reducing rate of roast for the most valuable developer?
08:40:37 <dazinism> The community could take that all on though
08:40:46 <renlord> RageLtMan: just donate directly using paypal/bitcoin
08:40:52 <renlord> or github sponsors
08:41:13 <RageLtMan> i do the paypal bit, but i cant fund a TEAM of developers without having to underwrite it somehow, and this isnt tax deductible
08:41:32 <renlord> you fund daniel, daniel can decide how to spend the project monies
08:41:45 <renlord> he knows what's best for the project.
08:42:10 <dazinism> Daniels has said he doesnt want to take on the task of hiring devs
08:42:12 <RageLtMan> renlord, as stated above, this is a staffing issue, and i get the sense that daniel has had more than his share of dealing with humans
08:42:28 <valldrac> strcat[m]: the patch looks good, I cannot reproduce the BT audio issues, so go ahead with the release
08:42:43 <renlord> ok. Alternatively, you can sponsor a talented contributor on the side.
08:43:07 <RageLtMan> thats why i was asking if there's anyone officially responsible for community coordination
08:43:09 <renlord> it does not necessarily have to concern Daniel personally
08:43:24 <RageLtMan> talented contributor. have you ever hired developers?
08:43:28 <renlord> RageLtMan: nope
08:43:32 <valldrac> yeah, I also accept donations to break the releases lol
08:43:34 <dazinism> Sounds good valldrac (pun intended)
08:43:37 <RageLtMan> try it for a C/C++ project nowadays
08:44:09 <RageLtMan> valldrac: thanks for contributing in the first place. breakage is just another form of incremental progress :)
08:44:23 <renlord> RageLtMan: does it sound like you want to volunteer to be in that position ;)
08:44:26 <RageLtMan> (i'm sempervictus on gh by the way, so one of the affected)
08:44:33 <valldrac> the project is missing many things, but nothing proper funding cannot fix
08:45:16 <RageLtMan> renlord: many moons ago i fell into a similar role in the metasploit world. i now run two companies and currently operate as head of security for a healthcare co in a psuedo-consulting role. literally 16h days, 6-7 days a week.
08:45:57 <RageLtMan> hence almost no time on IRC, my github looks like a warmed over corpse, and i'm behind on bassically all open source projects i touch
08:46:05 <renlord> RageLtMan: keeping busy, i like it
08:46:46 <RageLtMan> infosec people are in high demand right now. unfortunately a lot of that demand is utterly frivlous crap where they just want a consult to tell them that all their problems are actually N/A and its totally fine to vent all your healthcare data to the wind
08:48:36 <renlord> likes like management consulting.
08:48:46 <renlord> basically just finding a 3rd party to blame when shit hits the fan
08:49:33 <RageLtMan> so if there isnt really someone running the show as a community coordinator, then is there appetite to delegate such function to someone who's done it for lineage or whatever other popular roms out there? (sorry, i've been on copperhead/graphene for ages, not up to date on what the cool kids use these days to get data-slurped)
08:51:23 <RageLtMan> renlord: in the current situation with covid, its the wirld west for liability, indemnification, surcharges, rate hikes, and other bad behavior in a time of need. You'd expect force majeure clauses to come into effect right now, but there are so many having nothing to do with this where people just want to reneg a contract on favorable terms and see that they can squeeze people suffering from liquidity or supply issues
08:51:45 <renlord> we kinda experimented that with reddit didnt we? and the conclusion was that there was too much misinformation occuring and moderation deprived a lot of time from actual technical work.,
08:52:22 <JTL> > 01:45 <RageLtMan> renlord: many moons ago i fell into a similar role in the metasploit world. i now run two companies and currently operate as head of security for a healthcare co in a psuedo-consulting role. literally 16h days, 6-7 days a week.
08:52:27 <JTL> Interesting background :)
08:52:59 <RageLtMan> for instance: a lot of HC firms did an "emergency term change" on contracts from net30->net90 for consultants who had already invoiced. For places which sub out at high rates, thats deadly. One of our co's had to take a PPP loan to pay subs to cover "the spread" on their randomly modified terms. The co is an f500, in the media daily right now
08:53:45 <RageLtMan> JTL: got lucky - started in the digital world in the 90s, security happened to be what i found interest in, and the rest is sorta history. been very lucky to find people who know more and are willing to teach (Daniel being one of them)
08:53:57 <JTL> Of course
08:55:07 <dazinism> RageLtMan: as I guess you know GrapheneOS is mainly Daniels work. Hes suggested that due to past problems he wouldnt be quick to delegate significant 'official' power
08:55:59 <RageLtMan> So on the topic of getting some sort of delegation and non-voting-rights-hierarchy going (my personal take is that Daniel always remain tyranical overlord of all project direction, we saw what happens when other people have their own ideas about how to subvert his efforts)
08:56:49 <dazinism> RageLtMan: also suggested that theres nothing to stop another (sister?) project funding dev work on GrapheneOS
08:56:55 <renlord> so as long as community does not get in the way of technical work or misrepresent/misinform about the technical work. They can be separate responsibilities
08:57:14 <cg_droid> And... will Daniel trust in what other developers will do, or he'll need to check all the code made too?
08:57:33 <renlord> the problem arises when people misinform about technical details without a good understanding of the technical work.
08:57:48 <RageLtMan> That would probably require someone working full time for a bit to set up the organization which would deal with device support, non-security features which Daniel doesnt want to touch, etc
08:57:56 <renlord> and there are not many people qualified to moderate these items.
08:58:15 <RageLtMan> which is why i'm suggesting we leverage the standard method for acquiring talent: money
08:58:21 <renlord> for example, I'm not entirely across the full android ecosystem, I can probably comment on very specific things I personally have touched on.
08:58:29 <RageLtMan> that would require pledges or lump sum donations
08:59:12 <RageLtMan> so the role would require community management + project management tier2 with all the tier1 priorities still being defined by Daniel?
09:00:45 <RageLtMan> everyone i know with those qualifications is paid a decent salary with benefits, and even though it may not be an FT role once the org is "configured" and set to run smoothly, it still requires a talented person just to coordinate it all for some amount of time every day
09:01:57 <RageLtMan> i need deeper pockets, or we need to identify users who depend on this technology for their privacy with reasonably deep pockets and pool our efforts. this project dies and anyone using this for any finserv/pii access could stand to lose far more by theft from their next insecure device than donating to this project
09:02:46 <renlord> i guess that was kinda what copperheados was setup to do
09:02:50 <renlord> but it just imploded.
09:02:53 <RageLtMan> heh
09:03:05 <RageLtMan> that was human element, greed, stupidity
09:06:02 <dazinism> I've been wondering if could maybe facilitate the fundraising and contracting (rather than direct hire) through a third party org. To avoid a load of admin/bureaucracy
09:07:17 <dazinism> As it doesnt need to be a for-profit corp different channels are open
09:07:30 <RageLtMan> Semper Victus (my co) works on the contractor-per-project semantic already, we could technically be the vehicle for it, but the problem we'd all have it taxable overhead. in the US anyway, it would ideally be done through a proper non-profit. not sure how canada works in this regard
09:07:34 <renlord> people can always just start a foundation
09:07:42 <renlord> that's dedicated to grapheneos
09:07:51 <RageLtMan> starting a non-prof in the US is not easy
09:08:02 <renlord> foundation member can write up a constitution that defines how funds get solicited and spent.
09:08:20 <renlord> it does not have to concern/trouble daniel
09:08:41 <RageLtMan> it needs to involve him to delegate all "final say" rights to him and him alone
09:09:12 <renlord> kinda like how bitcoin foundation and actual bitcoin technical work has nothing to do with each other. Though, arguably you can also say taht model does not work since the foundation is more or less useless now
09:09:47 <RageLtMan> this effort can't fragment, just like grsec couldnt, because it is pinned to the talent pool contained in one man's head. Since the actual effort is technical, the architect needs to be at the head of decision making.
09:09:53 <dazinism> Can find an org with somewhat aligned aims to act as fiscal sponsor for the project. To avoid having to set up a not for profit corporate.
09:10:04 <renlord> otherwise, other infosec people can license grapheneos from Daniel and then rebrand it as a commercial product to sell (maybe a more "supportive" version of the OS on top of the base graphene os)
09:10:15 <renlord> then follow the red hat model to contribute back upstream -- graphene os
09:10:41 <RageLtMan> dont go there, will put us all in the x-hairs of law enforcement who have to deal with such things being sold to serious asshats
09:11:07 <dazinism> A side note - is tax an issue if you are spending all your income?
09:11:23 <RageLtMan> yes, income tax, property tax, etc
09:11:31 <renlord> RageLtMan: why is it us all though, the Graphene OS license makes clear you cannot hold any contributor/daniel responsible
09:11:49 <renlord> a commerical entity might want to go a bit further than the project's license
09:12:04 <renlord> but the liability is on them wholely
09:12:34 <RageLtMan> the FBI has some really misinformed notions about criminal responsibility when it comes to who wrote code
09:12:42 <renlord> if red hat explodes, you sue red hat, you dont complain to the fedora project
09:12:49 <renlord> or you dont complain to Linus
09:12:49 <RageLtMan> umm
09:13:34 <RageLtMan> A: i complain to linus as required, B: fedora is derived from RHEL, C: this isn't about civil liability, this is about handcuffs and a human booster shot from a guy named molly
09:13:55 <RageLtMan> :)
09:13:59 <renlord> but we're not even doing anythign criminal?
09:14:01 <renlord> @_@
09:14:24 <RageLtMan> hutchins (SP?) got arrested for code he wrote and put on a forum which bad people incorporated into their malware
09:15:00 <renlord> is there somewhere i can read more to get context?
09:16:21 <RageLtMan> this is a more salient issue for people on the red-side of the field, but given that i've seen accusations of CH being sold to the mob and such, and i dont have a real social media presence or read anything but whats pertinent to my tasking most of the time, i imagine LEOs have too.
09:16:22 <RageLtMan> https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/04/marcus-hutchins-wannacry-arrested-for-banking-virus.html
09:17:32 <RageLtMan> the point is tangential: there are added considerations when having for-profit functions which might upset the powers that be.
09:18:44 <RageLtMan> regardless of modality, if an effort to offload Daniel does materialize, we can provide some amount of funding, some resources in our private clouds for builds and such, and hopefully as we cycle talent and tasking, some actual development work down the line
09:19:19 <RageLtMan> if it can be built in a manner where donations are tax deductible, we can donate more, and can probably get a bunch of our clients to donate as well
09:19:31 <JTL> One point. I think strcat wants to use local hardware under his physical control for production builds.
09:19:40 <dazinism> RageLtMan: thats nice to hear
09:20:09 <JTL> Also he (and a bunch of other people) are in Canada, so in the case of a Canadian non profit/foundation, how that would affect things.
09:20:19 <RageLtMan> by all means, zero trust is a concept i fully support. Theres a lot of builds which never hit release though, and should be built with their own signing keys specifically to avoid accidental release
09:20:26 <JTL> Of course
09:20:34 <renlord> the foundation needs to be incorporated in literally every jurisdiction for it to be tax-deductible
09:20:43 <RageLtMan> yike
09:20:48 <renlord> for example, i cant get a tax-deduction when donating to a canadian non-profit
09:21:13 <renlord> it needs to be specifically an Australian Registered Non Profit
09:21:37 <renlord> that's just not an optimisation that's viable at this point
09:21:39 <RageLtMan> Anyone connected to the EFF or other global orgs with a potential interest in having some semblance of privacy and security on their mobile device?
09:22:02 <JTL> EFF is mainly US focused
09:22:08 <RageLtMan> balls
09:22:40 <JTL> As I know off the top of my head, the canadian equivalents are either very small (think underfunded academic type orgs) or "abandoned"
09:22:55 <renlord> JTL: there's the vancouver privacy thingy
09:23:01 <renlord> open privacy initiative?
09:23:03 <JTL> That's a more recent development
09:23:13 <JTL> and I think their funding is a bit shakey atm
09:24:01 <renlord> sarah's work on the swiss voting stuff was a good read
09:24:11 <JTL> I'm aware she did some work in that area, but haven't read it
09:24:26 <renlord> in collaboration with an academic from my instiution
09:24:37 <JTL> neat
09:24:47 <JTL> swiss? about the voting stuff?
09:25:27 <renlord> https://www.itnews.com.au/news/second-flaw-found-in-swiss-e-voting-system-522869
09:25:37 <renlord> many problems
09:25:38 <JTL> right
09:25:54 <renlord> at the end, they gave up on evoting
09:25:56 <renlord> llol
09:26:18 <renlord> and the company went bankrupt
09:26:23 <renlord> just recently

09:32:21 <valldrac> dazinism: you inspired me https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/217#issuecomment-635874702
09:37:16 <dazinism> valldrac: always available for bad puns
09:38:12 <renlord> valldrac: is it still a problem?
09:38:19 <renlord> i can build and test on the 3a
09:38:24 <renlord> with 2 BT audio devices
09:40:42 <valldrac> the more tests, the better, try pulling frameworks/av and external/hardened_malloc changes
09:44:15 <valldrac> or apply commit ac26b532 to frameworks/av and ce6a2122 to hardened_malloc
09:45:02 <RageLtMan> well lets see if the hardened_malloc changes break anything on Linux, our CI should pick that up in ~16m
09:47:37 <RageLtMan> so "if (strcmp(audio_service, path) == 0)" can be expanded to handle an array of these things to provide built-in exclusions, possibly even passed as an env var at compile time
09:47:46 <renlord> break anything in userland?
09:47:53 <renlord> what applications do you run against?
09:48:28 <RageLtMan> its a bit scattershot: CI will build it, then push it to a current Arch linux instance in the cloud, set it up for ld preload system wide, and reboot
09:49:00 <RageLtMan> it'll then start nginx, php, ruby with passenger, and i think a couple other things
09:49:43 <RageLtMan> right now its only wired to a grsec test image, CI actually builds our linux-hardened kernels for places where we cant use grsec, so i should wire that in too
09:51:18 <neothechosenone[> F droid just popped up with a warning about it being made for an older version of android etc, normally an update follows straight away after refreshing the app but it is not happening now for some reason.
09:51:18 <neothechosenone[> Is anyone else having the same issue?
09:55:10 <dazinism> neothechosenone: that warning was added for apps with a target apk earlier than 28
09:55:57 <dazinism> neothechosenone: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Target_SDK
09:57:21 <dazinism> Think you'll see this warning first time you run any app (after latest GrapheneOS update) with an older target SDK
09:58:51 <dazinism> If Fdroid isnt updating their list of apps, thats something else.
09:59:34 * neothechosenone[ sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/zNWQMSuYKNAKcDOgBbHkJnRi >
10:00:29 <dazinism> Worth noting that Aurora Droid (an alternative app client for accessing Fdroid apps) targets APK29
10:01:06 <dazinism> Made by the same dev as Aurora Store
10:01:34 <neothechosenone[> Must be an f droid issue I just read on calyx room someone having issues with f droid today ..
10:01:34 <neothechosenone[> Aurora droid is a safer app store than F droid then?
10:02:38 <dazinism> Noticed that it still makes loads of non-tor connections if you use the proxy settings in Aurora Droid. May be worth considering for some people.
10:04:06 <dazinism> neothechosenone: maybe there just hasnt been any apps updated on Fdroid since last you checked? Or you dont see any apps?
10:07:12 <neothechosenone[> I see loads of apps just no update for f droid initially after downloading the apk..
10:07:12 <neothechosenone[> Thanks for the info though aurora droid sounds good.
10:07:24 <dazinism> Sometimes Newpipe breaks because if changes Google makes. The Newpipe devs have to work around the changes.
10:08:41 <neothechosenone[> Thanks a lot I'm sure they will sort it.
10:08:57 <dazinism> If you dont see an update for Fdroid, it just means that they have updated their website so that you've downloaded the latest version
10:09:08 <dazinism> Thats a good thing
10:10:01 <neothechosenone[> But the warning saying f droid was built for an older version of android etc must mean their latest version is still behind ?
10:10:01 <neothechosenone[> I understand
10:11:39 <dazinism> > Aurora droid is a safer app store than F droid then?
10:11:39 <dazinism> Hard to say for sure. There is a lot to consider. Its probably a fair choice though. Possibly even more so if you already use Aurora Store
10:12:41 <dazinism> neothechosenone: yeah the Fdroid app targets SDK25
10:13:04 <pravez[m]> <dazinism "pravez: I think most things here"> thank you :)
10:13:37 <dazinism> It doesnt use all the security / privacy features added in the latest versions of android
10:14:06 <neothechosenone[> Thanks for the info..
10:14:18 <dazinism> pravez: pleasure

10:37:01 <renor> Regarding the Bluetooth problems, I enabled the "Disable bluetooth A2DP hardware offload" from the Developer options and is all working nice and fine on all of my devices (even in my car)
10:38:46 <cg_droid> renor, interesting...
10:39:28 <cg_droid> It's disabled in my smartphone
10:39:40 <cg_droid> Maybe that's why it doesn't work
10:39:49 <renor> Comes disabled by default
10:39:54 <cg_droid> Oh yeah
10:40:03 <renor> Try it out enabling the option
10:40:57 <renor> I mean, enabling the option. Which results in disabling Bluetooth A2DP hardware offload
10:40:58 <cg_droid> But someone said that sometimes some people has problem with it and rebooting more than 1 time it worked
10:40:59 <cg_droid> IDN
10:41:08 <cg_droid> renor: ok, thanks
10:41:34 <cg_droid> If it's the only problem with Bluetooth driver then it works ok...
10:41:47 <cg_droid> Maybe all devices could try it
10:42:23 <cg_droid> I'll try when I can
10:43:30 <jalb> renor, yes, it worked for me in my car when I tested it enabling this option. It wasn't working before and the sound was only received from the smartphone and not the speakers
10:43:38 <jalb> Now it works ok, thanks! :)
10:45:27 <cg_droid> strcat[m], did you read this?, could this be the problem?
10:45:49 <cg_droid> By default GOS comes with this option disabled
10:47:43 <dazinism> cg_droid: thats been known about as a long time, and does fix things for some.
10:47:53 <dazinism> *for a long
10:47:56 <cg_droid> dazinism, ok
10:48:46 <cg_droid> THanks
10:49:02 <cg_droid> So, some other people, with this option enabled, continue with the problem
10:49:29 <dazinism> Theres been work recently to try and fix the problem properly. Its proven to be a complex problem (actually possibly a number of issues)
10:51:34 <cg_droid> dazinism, I thought that maybe the people with the problem has the option disabled like me
10:51:46 <cg_droid> I"ll try anyway
10:53:26 <dazinism> cg_droid: yeah possibly, enabling it has been known to sort out problems for quite some time. Its been spoken about here and on the GrapheneOS reddit for months. It doesnt fix the underlying issue that causes the problems though.
11:00:41 <cg_droid> dazinism, thanks
11:01:00 <cg_droid> Anyway I´ll post here when I test it with my Pixel 3a
11:33:47 <dazinism> If I'm following along properly the problem is due to GrapheneOS hardening hitting problems due to poorly written code in AOSP
11:34:30 <cg_droid> it works ok 🙂
11:34:39 <dazinism> The hardening is going to be disabled. And the problematic code will be replaced in Android R
11:34:41 <cg_droid> Enabling that option renor posted in my Pixel 3a
11:35:09 <cg_droid> dazinism, good move
11:35:33 <cg_droid> Maybe it's only in Pixels 3a, IDN
11:35:44 <dazinism> So questionable if its worth spending loads of time trying to fix it properly when theres so much else to do.
11:36:00 <cg_droid> Yes..
11:36:57 <dazinism> No it effects other phoned also.
11:53:13 <kernelpaniker[m]> I enabled a2dp on pixel 3 and restarted. Bluetooth headset still isnt working during calls
11:58:02 <cg_droid> kernelpaniker[m], ok... so, the problem persists

12:10:32 <cg_droid> spaceinfinite[m], and using ORbot in vpn mode?, it must work
12:10:47 <cg_droid> Choose this app and that's it
12:10:55 <spaceinfinite[m]> Not on vpn mode
12:11:03 <spaceinfinite[m]> It has a socks option
12:11:09 <cg_droid> Ah ok
12:11:11 <spaceinfinite[m]> And it doesnt work
12:11:16 <cg_droid> You could use it in vpn mode
12:11:37 <cg_droid> If it doesn't work with socks

12:12:16 <cg_droid> Why Tor?
12:12:45 <spaceinfinite[m]> Cos vpn for specific apps and orbot for very few selection
12:12:59 <spaceinfinite[m]> And the rest normal traffic
12:13:09 <cg_droid> ok
12:13:16 <cg_droid> And AuroraDroid?
12:13:21 <cg_droid> Have you tried it?
12:13:24 <cg_droid> Ah sorry
12:13:28 <cg_droid> It's like F-droid
12:13:33 <cg_droid> Not to install from Google apps

12:13:40 <spaceinfinite[m]> Aurora store works via orbot
12:13:49 <spaceinfinite[m]> Auroradroid doesnt
12:13:57 <spaceinfinite[m]> Fdroid works
12:14:03 <cg_droid> I get it

17:38:22 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], thanks
17:38:28 <cn3m[m]> Bromite vs Vandium webview has a lot of security trade-offs
17:38:39 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium has better hardening for the whole Trichrome
17:38:55 <cn3m[m]> WebView has one sandbox and no site isolation
17:39:55 <cg_droid> So, Vanadium browser has isolation and another browser using Vanadium webview doesn't
17:40:29 <cg_droid> Vanadium browser has some more security included
17:40:54 <cn3m[m]> yes Bromite has better isolation and WebView anti exploit
17:41:30 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium mixes both and is recommended

18:00:30 <fujita_[m]> Same here but its not by choice, I PUKed my sim and I can't unlock it atm. I was looking to port the number over another carrier but I don't have enough documents to sign up for one at the moment
18:02:06 <fujita_[m]> I have fully adjusted to not having a sim but I think I will still need it since where I live WhatsApp is the main form of communication for everything even for work
18:02:11 <furofuro_01[m]> <JanPenfrat[m] "Not sure where you need them to "> Somewhere around Philippines btw
18:03:00 <fujita_[m]> josh.man: how do you get around not having mobile data and a phone number for daily use
18:03:07 <joshman[m]> fujita_ why do you need sim for WhatsApp. You communicate on wifi just fine
18:03:22 <fujita_[m]> Sign in process
18:03:28 <fujita_[m]> Same with signal
18:04:56 <joshman[m]> fujita_ traditional calls are long gone for me. I don't need not want to call anyone using GSM from early 1980s. Texts is even worse. I hate traditional texts. Super insecure and old
18:05:12 <joshman[m]> * fujita_ traditional calls are long gone for me. I don't need nor want to call anyone using GSM from early 1980s. Texts is even worse. I hate traditional texts. Super insecure and old
18:05:57 <fomijafi[m]> Does anyone have a preferred VOIP provider? I've been looking into going the no SIM route just unsure how it will play with GOS
18:06:12 <fujita_[m]> Same here
18:06:31 <cg_droid> Jitsi?
18:06:37 <joshman[m]> I received signup text on another device the. Threw that Sim in the waste. I would never use same number for Signal and GSM
18:07:08 <joshman[m]> * I received signup text on another device then threw that Sim in the waste. I would never use same number for Signal and GSM
18:07:15 <fomijafi[m]> Oh, you no SIM folks don't have a phone number you consistently use?
18:08:02 <fomijafi[m]> I was looking at trying to get a twilio number and using Linphone but don't know if it'll work
18:08:10 <joshman[m]> By phone number you mean 2G calls from 1980s? No. Trully hate that technology
18:09:18 <fomijafi[m]> I guess I was thinking of something a la google voice
18:10:27 <joshman[m]> Ok. That is a tiny bit better. There's hundreds of services providing you phone number. Skype, Viber, Linphone. I personally don't use either
18:15:36 <furofuro_01[m]> <fluoridatedsheep "im finding cheaper than that on "> Unfortunately it is somehow unavailable on my country
18:15:57 <furofuro_01[m]> But thanks for the suggestion still
18:26:51 <strcat[m]> need people to step up as device maintainers for existing devices and to develop and maintain Pixel 4 and 4 XL support
18:27:16 <strcat[m]> it's important to support the 4 and 4 XL so that the 4a can be added later (which would share a lot of the work) and to move things forward to current generation device support code
18:27:21 <strcat[m]> very problematic to not have support for it
18:27:31 <strcat[m]> the project needs help in a lot of different areas, device support is one crucial area
18:27:46 <strcat[m]> need to get these basic reference devices supported to enable other things
18:27:55 <strcat[m]> Pixels are the AOSP reference devices
18:28:20 <strcat[m]> if we don't support the current reference devices, GrapheneOS is not in a good position to be ported to other devices
18:47:29 <TheJollyRoger> Argh. Trying >_<.
18:50:57 <aeonsolution[m]> I am working on helping out with Pixel 3a. I am going to volunteer to be a device maintainer for that so if there are others in the channel that need help getting started please reach out. I also ordered a Pixel 4 to help with porting. I can't help those with Pixel 4 already because porting is very new to me and I am going to be learning it as a I go.
18:53:10 <fomijafi[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "I am working on helping out with"> I know this is not helpful now but I'm very interested in gettkng set up to help. Zero development experience but would love to learn anything I can to at least contribute to the issue trackers
18:53:10 <aeonsolution[m]> If you are building the development branch, learning the steps is very important-and I will help you out with that. Everything is clearly spelled out by strcat on the website <https://grapheneos.org/build> and it is very counter-productive to ask for advice when you did not follow the steps.
18:55:09 <aeonsolution[m]> That being said, learning from your mistakes is a big part of the process.
18:55:36 <aeonsolution[m]> fomijafi: reach out to me in a message and I'll try to give you advice on where to start
18:59:25 <cn3m[m]>  @fujita_:matrix.org WhatsApp and Signal don't care what number you use. you can even use one of those free services.
18:59:30 <cn3m[m]> porting your number over is an option too
19:04:45 <dazinism> aeonsolution: nice one on stepping up maintaining the 3a :-)
19:05:15 <dazinism> *for maintaining
19:06:07 <strcat[m]> Signal says they'll be supporting non-phone-number identifiers soon
19:06:30 <strcat[m]> I hope they fix the new PIN feature to let you set a registration lock without enabling recovery of your profile/contacts though
19:06:35 <strcat[m]> old way was better
19:08:31 <TheJollyRoger> I'm hoping to follow in aeonsolution[m]'s steps as the maintainer for Blueline. I'll order a new phone for it soon.
19:08:59 <nuttso[m]> <strcat[m] "I hope they fix the new PIN feat"> I use Molly with GrapheneOS.
19:09:09 <TheJollyRoger> Hey nuttso[m]!

19:09:16 <nuttso[m]> Hi
19:09:18 <nuttso[m]> Roger
19:09:24 <joshman[m]> I contribute to Signal as a translator. As far as I know Registration PIN will restore user profile 😕
19:09:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hey nuttso[m]! Sorry about the debugging cables >_<. Turns out I've been lower on stock than I normally am. I'm still waiting for the serial TTL cables to arrive but they haven't yet.
19:10:27 <TheJollyRoger> The border is closed, which may explain the delays.
19:10:40 <dazinism> > I'm hoping to follow in aeonsolution[m]'s steps as the maintainer for Blueline.
19:10:52 <dazinism> Nice TheJollyRoger
19:10:59 <nuttso[m]> It's all good man
19:11:21 <cg_droid> nuttso[m], what is Molly?
19:11:33 <nuttso[m]> Hey strcat can we have a private irc room only for beta testers
19:11:49 <nuttso[m]> https://molly.im/
19:12:01 <nuttso[m]> Valldrac has an fork with true password encryption
19:12:05 <cg_droid> Thanks
19:13:00 <nuttso[m]> He also started contributing here but needs more resources
19:13:15 <TheJollyRoger> I've uh... got another IRC channel parked.
19:13:32 <TheJollyRoger> I'll maintain the other IRC room.
19:14:46 <valldrac> strcat[m]: Signal's PIN feature will also support multi-device sync. I don't think they will make it optional
19:15:16 <valldrac> basically it'll become a core feature
19:17:00 <nuttso[m]> <valldrac "strcat: Signal's PIN feature wil"> I'm think he told me he will make it optional
19:17:08 <nuttso[m]> Will ask him.again
19:17:32 <valldrac> nuttso[m]: who?
19:18:42 <nuttso[m]> Hey valldrac
19:19:02 <nuttso[m]> Not sure though you once said in our group it would become optionally
19:19:34 <valldrac> Ah! I was talking about the PIN reminder. And actually, now it's optional
19:19:51 <nuttso[m]> Ah ok
19:19:56 <joshman[m]> PIN is mandatory. Reminder is optional
19:35:30 <soliquid> PAIN is mandatory. Suffering is optional

19:36:31 <strcat[m]> endless attempts to spread misinformation about all kinds of topics by that moose guy and his sockpuppets
19:36:33 <strcat[m]> look at all the BS he keeps posting
19:36:49 <strcat[m]> he clearly lacks an understanding of most of what he tries to talk about too and he suddenly changes the topic
19:37:05 <strcat[m]> and can't follow a consistent thread of conversation
19:37:10 <TheJollyRoger> Rrrgh.
19:37:30 <strcat[m]> I talk about the monolithic design of the Linux kernel and he interprets that as a criticism of the desktop Linux stack and replies with some nonsense wrongly comparing sudo / su transitions from a user account to ADB
19:37:57 <strcat[m]> these people just know how to write a whole bunch of nonsense / bullshitting that makes it seem like there is some kind of debate or that something is rebuted
19:38:08 <strcat[m]> they are just dishonest charlatans writing nonsense and tricking non-technical people
19:38:10 <strcat[m]> really, look at his posts
19:38:13 <strcat[m]> what is that BS
19:38:32 <strcat[m]> reddit is infested with this and they just make echo chambers of bullshitting
19:38:39 <strcat[m]> such a terrible platform
19:38:41 <TheJollyRoger> Fuck.
19:38:52 <strcat[m]> I think reddit is even worse than facebook
19:40:31 <strcat[m]> some 60 year old qanon supporter saying 5g is giving people coronavirus and bill gates wants to microchip them with a fake vaccine is basically on the same level as discourse on subreddits like this
19:40:49 * TheJollyRoger buries his head in his hands.
19:40:55 <strcat[m]> people are so easily fooled by people bullshitting like this
19:40:58 <strcat[m]> just depressing
19:41:01 <strcat[m]> never ends
19:41:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
19:41:03 <dallemon[m]> <strcat[m] "some 60 year old qanon supporter"> Lol Nice comparison
19:41:11 <strcat[m]> got some people incredibly obsessed with me and just going on and on with their bullshitting
19:43:25 <dallemon[m]> Saw a weird article on Forbes yesterday that, kind of, claimed "Chrome bad cuz c++, Firefox good cuz rust"
19:43:51 <strcat[m]> yet Firefox is like 8% Rust
19:44:04 <strcat[m]> and that brings in the whole rust compiler / stdlib as added unsafe / trusted TCB
19:44:40 <strcat[m]> and their C++ is objectively much less audited / fuzzed / hardened and in a code style more prone to vulnerabilities
19:45:17 <strcat[m]> safe rust code relies on the compiler and unsafe rust code - of which they have written a ton
19:45:25 <strcat[m]> and unsafe rust code relies on safe rust code for correctness
19:46:14 <TheJollyRoger> Wow. What a dirty secret.
19:46:26 <dallemon[m]> Yeah, it was a total BS article posted in a local security group on Facebook.
19:46:34 <strcat[m]> not clear that they reduced the amount of code that needs to be trusted to assure memory safety even for those components yet
19:46:48 <cn3m[m]> exactly I was just writing about the libraries yesterday
19:46:49 <cn3m[m]> rust doesn't help much if it is calling untrusted non hardened libraries
19:47:06 <dallemon[m]> Even claimed that Firefox has a "3 year headstart"
19:47:07 <strcat[m]> cn3m: when you expose C APIs from a rust library
19:47:10 <strcat[m]> that is an unsafe API
19:47:17 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "exactly I was just writing about"> Can you give a link please?
19:47:24 <strcat[m]> and you're building backwards from an unsafe API
19:47:39 <strcat[m]> and on the other end is more unsafe code (compiler, stdlib, etc.)
19:47:48 <strcat[m]> there is still plenty of unsafe code trusted to assure memory safety
19:47:51 <cn3m[m]> Firefox has done good work with rust and the PDF Viewer. I'm not going to dismiss that, but 92% of the browser is unhardened and Chrome is 100% hardened
19:48:05 <cn3m[m]> relatively speaking
19:48:16 <strcat[m]> the PDF viewer works just as well elsewhere and honestly it is pretty fucked up how it has like 600 dependencies
19:48:20 <cn3m[m]>  @essentialchaos:tchncs.de I'll check it was a huge comment
19:48:22 <strcat[m]> and is incompatible with sane Content Security Policy
19:48:49 <dallemon[m]> The main take away from the article imo is that Google is looking to use more memory safe languages going forward
19:49:05 <cn3m[m]> I do trust the Firefox PDF viewer more than the Chrome one personally. I don't like either.
19:49:10 <strcat[m]> look at how much of the Android Chromium is already written in Java
19:49:20 <cn3m[m]> however the Chrome one is much safer through other measures
19:49:30 <strcat[m]> cn3m: pdf.js works fine in Chrome
19:49:51 <strcat[m]> you have the choice
19:50:08 <strcat[m]> on mobile they don't include pdfium
19:50:09 <strcat[m]> anyway
19:50:25 <cn3m[m]> true, but I'm grasping at straws for nice things to say about Firefox
19:50:44 <strcat[m]> pdf.js is a distinct project that Firefox bundles
19:51:01 <cn3m[m]> there's not much good there
19:51:11 <strcat[m]> it is by Mozilla sure but I don't think it makes sense to consider it part of Firefox just like Rust is not part of Firefox just used by it
19:51:22 <strcat[m]> others are just as capable of using both
19:51:25 <cn3m[m]>  @strcat:matrix.org right
19:51:33 <strcat[m]> you know what would be nice is if someone forked pdf.js and made it sane
19:51:47 <strcat[m]> and threw substantial development resources into it
19:51:55 <strcat[m]> I don't really think it has a long term value though
19:52:14 <strcat[m]> there are other approaches now
19:52:22 <strcat[m]> like compiling a native renderer to wasm
19:52:36 <strcat[m]> and then you don't need to use JS or the npm ecosystem
19:53:53 <strcat[m]> cn3m: so for example pdfium can be compiled to wasm
19:54:27 <strcat[m]> there are some projects doing that
19:54:41 <cn3m[m]> That is the way forward for sure
19:54:58 <cn3m[m]> thanks for the explanation
19:55:14 <strcat[m]> pdf.js is not just about running it in the web env but is based around the concept that writing that kind of code in JS actually makes sense
19:55:17 <strcat[m]> and I don't think it makes much sense
19:55:23 <strcat[m]> it is useful not a fundamentally good approach
19:56:26 <strcat[m]> you would ideally be writing that in a saner, typed language with solid type system, not relying on CSP to disable dynamic code eval (especially when the pdf.js devs actually like it and basically oppose using CSP that way), etc.
19:56:53 <strcat[m]> cn3m: pdf.js is useful since it's around right now and  mostly works
19:57:01 <strcat[m]> cn3m: easy to deploy it in a web context
19:57:14 <strcat[m]> easier than using something via wasm atm unless someone makes a good project for that
19:58:23 <cn3m[m]> Thanks that is helpful
19:59:55 <cn3m[m]> just got an update will be back

20:24:43 <cn3m[m]> Message me if you want to help I'll teach everything I know
20:25:00 <cn3m[m]> if I have to spend 10 hours teaching you and then you do a few hours a week that pays off

20:26:16 <strcat[m]> is that due to the current environment with James Donaldson attacking the project

20:26:21 <strcat[m]> along with people like these
20:26:28 <cn3m[m]> I was downvoted a lot in the beginning
20:26:29 <cn3m[m]> it's a fact of life
20:26:32 <strcat[m]> and tons of other bad things that have happened / are happening
20:26:39 <strcat[m]> it is just not possible to accomplish all that much right now
20:26:44 <cn3m[m]> I learned and didn't give up
20:26:48 <strcat[m]> I am not too worried about it anymore

20:28:27 <cn3m[m]>  @boniek:matrix.org I'm not going to make some blog

20:28:36 <cn3m[m]> that doesn't help

20:29:11 <strcat[m]> and putting in the work to actually do that
20:29:24 <cn3m[m]> my dms are always open, but I've spent too much time here and no one really seems interested I need to go back to reddit

20:33:37 <strcat[m]> valldrac found what was wrong with bluetooth, etc. tho
20:33:40 <strcat[m]> and that led to this new workaround
20:33:40 <chani1> nuttso[m]: speaking as a non-technical "sheep" myself, education is possible. it's also true that the sea of contradicting information on reddit isn't helpful, particularly when it's over the head of the average user
20:33:42 <strcat[m]> just a bumpy road to it
20:33:48 <strcat[m]> and it's not really fixed

20:38:59 <cn3m[m]> if we push good ideas that helps GrapheneOS

20:41:12 <ducky2> Hey all. I'm trying to install GOS on a new Pixel 3a XL and have some issues unlocking the bootloader. I've enabled OEM unlocking in the system settings and I can boot into fastboot mode, but when I type "fastboot flashing unlock" nothing happens. Any ideas?

20:42:02 <madaidan[m]> I love how strcat makes massive walls of text ripping any argument the other guy had to shreds

20:42:07 <madaidan[m]> It's refreshing
20:42:44 <nuttso[m]> Sadly they don't have time to dedicate here. He is aware of the project.

20:43:59 <strcat[m]> ducky2: perhaps a permission issue - which OS are you flashing from
20:44:11 <strcat[m]> ducky2: make sure to try the troubleshooting advice about USB ports, cables, etc.
20:44:32 <spaceinfinite[m]> <nuttso[m] "Both these companies are in Berl"> So you are german ?
20:44:38 <strcat[m]> ducky2: and note what it says about udev rules - i.e. that Linux distributions specifically don't allow access to local USB devices that don't fit into some narrow classes of devices
20:44:41 <nuttso[m]> I'm trying very hard to find someone to sponsor gos. I'm close to accomplish this
20:44:48 <strcat[m]> ducky2: without root access, or udev rules set up for each additional class of device
20:44:54 <nuttso[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "So you are german ?"> No. But I live there
20:45:04 <strcat[m]> nuttso: the ideal would be a company that wanted to make hardware

20:45:28 <nuttso[m]> Only company I would go with
20:45:56 <strcat[m]> nuttso: was contacted by them before but they wanted too much from me without giving anything

20:46:24 <strcat[m]> nuttso: potentially still on the table
20:46:26 <spaceinfinite[m]> Wow

20:47:05 <cn3m[m]> if you need an Enterprise phone buy a Pixel or iPhone and use their support

20:47:08 <EssentialChaos[m> <nuttso[m] "Htc"> Aren't they half-dead?
20:47:08 <strcat[m]> partnerships with companies, etc. require having people to work on that
20:47:10 <nuttso[m]> <strcat[m] "I just want to work on the proje"> I know. I listen to what I write
20:47:14 <cn3m[m]> they take old features from Google, Apple, and GrapheneOS and sell them as the big new thing for much more

20:47:15 <aeonsolution[m]> ducky2: try unplugging the cable and connecting it back again
20:47:23 <nuttso[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Aren't they half-dead?"> No
20:47:44 <strcat[m]> nuttso: I know just saying that the problem ends up being these companies just message me
20:47:49 <strcat[m]> and they misunderstand GrapheneOs
20:47:53 <strcat[m]>  * and they misunderstand GrapheneOS
20:47:59 <strcat[m]> it's an open source project / community
20:48:01 <strcat[m]> not a company
20:48:42 <cn3m[m]> exactly
20:48:52 <strcat[m]> I want to collaborate, they want to pay for something / license something
20:48:59 <strcat[m]> so requires people who understand and support the project
20:49:04 <strcat[m]> to deal with this aspect of it
20:49:07 <ducky2> already tried reconnecting the cable several times.
20:49:20 <spaceinfinite[m]> Nutsso can be the middleman
20:49:33 <strcat[m]> ducky2: if you're on a linux distribution it probably just doesn't allow you to use USB devices as non-root

20:50:34 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: btw I have personal experience of trying to get them to fix things, etc. and all they wanted was to get me to give my name to be used to claim I was a partner
20:50:36 <strcat[m]> to push their stuff
20:51:04 <ducky2> hm... it should. I just sideloaded the latest update of android 10 without any issues.
20:51:06 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they reach out to ppl to get them to say they are partners and make it seem like there's all this collaboration, etc. that there isn't
20:51:07 <aeonsolution[m]> ducky2: try the `fastboot devices` once you sort out what strcat is asking you to do. if at that point it doesn't work, your cable is unfortunately the issue.
20:51:19 <strcat[m]> ducky2: fastboot is different than adb
20:51:23 <strcat[m]> different class of USB device
20:51:32 <strcat[m]> so you may have udev rules that work for adb but not fastboot
20:51:41 <EssentialChaos[m> Hmmm, HTC could market this as a secure OS for government organizations...
20:51:41 <strcat[m]> the udev rules are just to make it work as non-root
20:51:43 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: they reach out to ppl"> I didn't know that. That's even more shitty.
20:52:10 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I spend substantial time trying to talk with them, raising concerns, suggesting things, telling them what would be needed to support the device
20:52:26 <strcat[m]> all they wanted to do is sweet talk + convince me to let them use the name of the project / my name to promote their product
20:52:26 <madaidan[m]> Btw that anonymousejoker guy is on his last chance in r/privacy. That recent discussion might get him banned.
20:52:44 <madaidan[m]> He probably fucked himself over by pinging the mods

20:53:20 <EssentialChaos[m> cn3m: Don't worry, he'll make a new account
20:53:28 <ducky2> ok, "fastboot devices" says I've got no permissions. Any way to change that?
20:53:34 <strcat[m]> people seem to support him even though he's clearly a bullshitter
20:53:45 <cn3m[m]> on PTIO at least he's known as a clown especially debating me
20:53:46 <strcat[m]> ducky2: use root or set up udev rules for it
20:53:50 <strcat[m]> either way requires using root
20:54:06 <cn3m[m]> I will have to start all over on arguing with his alt
20:54:15 <strcat[m]> ducky2: just an issue on Linux distributions - they don't allow access to local USB devices from a local session without root unless they are within certain narrow classes
20:54:26 <strcat[m]> they need udev rules for each kind to make it work
20:54:45 <cn3m[m]> I wish I could get on /r/privacy, but the site is too fast and has too much misinfo and misdirected paranoia
20:54:48 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "I will have to start all over on"> Not really, because you already established a name for yourself
20:54:50 <cn3m[m]> I need help
20:54:55 <cn3m[m]> if I want to move to /r/privacy
20:55:12 <ducky2> ok, I'll look into the udev rules. New concept for me... thanks.
20:55:26 <cn3m[m]> either help me maintain the grounds gained on ptio or help with /r/privacy
20:55:26 <strcat[m]> btw pls let me know if there are any issues with the beta releases
20:55:36 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "people seem to support him even "> He does have some supporters who are just as irritating. People like CDr0m, ubertr0_n etc. are all big supporters that I have past experience with.

21:23:40 <inquiree> nikoleos: you may want to consult https://grapheneos.org/faq too
21:24:06 <nuttso[m]> I really want this project to succeed and raise the bar for mobile security. And I think the only important people are the ones that can recognize it on their own.

21:25:04 <spaceinfinite[m]> The future is bright the future is orange*
21:25:05 <inquiree> Graphene is definitely filling a void

21:27:48 <paintedman[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org) recently I've sent email to contact⊙go with links to repos which I used to run GrapheneOS on Pixel 4 XL. Hope it helps.
21:28:41 <strcat[m]> paintedman: try to keep working towards resolving the issues + rebasing the changes to fit the same pattern of commits as the existing repos
21:29:03 <strcat[m]> noticed some were merged into a single one - try to match the existing split / order for the most part, meant to be a series of independent patches
21:29:12 <strcat[m]> we'll need to resolve issues like whatever the wifi problem is, etc.
21:29:20 <nuttso[m]> I remember strcat writing at least 5 times that he would end it. Always got a heart attack when reading this. In some way I can understand his frustration. Especially with James. But also lots of what James is capable to do know is strcats own fault. He should have be CEO of the company also. He trusted james with it. James fucked up and strcat lost his faith in humanity
21:30:50 <strcat[m]> there was an amazing opportunity

21:31:45 <strcat[m]> atm most of the past kernel hardening, etc. is missing anyway
21:32:22 <strcat[m]> nuttso: I think there was an amazing opportunity then and we could have had our own custom hardware by now where we control far more of it and wouldn't be so screwed by stuff like a migration to a new major release
21:32:35 <inquiree> Who's behind the GrapheneOS account on reddit? Is it solely Daniel?
21:32:42 <strcat[m]> nuttso: the space was much less crowded by charlatans then
21:32:57 <strcat[m]> inquiree: it represents the project, not just me
21:33:05 <strcat[m]> inquiree: and it will probably be used more often now
21:33:15 <strcat[m]> because I am tired of being personally targeted / harassed
21:33:24 <strcat[m]> so especially when dealing with people like that guy
21:33:54 <strcat[m]> it makes sense to use a project account, he keeps wanting to go back to trying to target me as an individual over collaboratively written / edited content anyways though
21:33:56 <strcat[m]> like the docs on the site
21:34:23 <strcat[m]> which other people like TheJollyRoger have contributed to a lot
21:34:29 <inquiree> strcat: sorry for the confusion
21:34:36 <inquiree> I meant to ask if you're the only one with access to that account
21:34:45 <strcat[m]> nuttso: I feel the opportunity is fading away - the space is increasingly crowded with misinformation, scams, etc.
21:35:21 <strcat[m]> nuttso: and people can see that substance doesn't count for anything
21:35:33 <nuttso[m]> <strcat[m] "nuttso: the space was much less "> Doubt so. It's not that James is only a charlatan. He has some kind of mental illness. Maybe narcissism. Such people exist since the first human. You were the leader for us as a community no matter if James was the CEO.
21:35:46 <strcat[m]> nuttso: we also largely lost the connections we had with AOSP, Pixels, etc.

21:37:12 <strcat[m]> he got fed up of not being able to pursue totally unethical things totally outside what had been agreed upon
21:37:22 <strcat[m]> and just decided to pull a completely illegal and unethical takeover

I am testing on a spare test system with signature spoofing enabled for development purposes right now. Is there any resources on how the project is looking to do this beside https://github.com/AndroidHardeningArchive/legacy_bugtracker/issues/649 and
21:45:13 <radixed9[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#development-guidelines? I can use applications it should be tested with. Is there an applicable list or design goals? The project is a very early Kotlin mockup designed on a standard signature spoofing system. It needs a lot of work
21:45:50 <nuttso[m]> Jollyroger asked me if I would go to court with my real name for u as a witness. I would.
21:45:51 <nuttso[m]> He is a good guy

21:48:00 <BalooRJ> Just noticed with the newest version of Newpipe that the "Import history and settings" button that it defaults to folder "/storage/emulated/0" that shows up blank, possibly because the last / is missing at the end

21:49:04 <BalooRJ> doesn't seem to read the content in folders anymore in GrapheneOS, probably an app issue but just curious if anyone else has run into it

I see Daniel as someone that has integrity. Having integrity means you are real. And not writing someone that offers u help with a problem woth somebody, but still writing that nobody helps is not integrity.
21:58:09 <strcat[m]> I need all the nonsense with James / Coppperhead resolved and out of the picture
21:58:49 <cn3m[m]> Daniel is found a great job doing a lot of jobs let him speak his mind and work in the background. don't go around telling him why you should be in charge of stuff since you don't like how he's doing it

22:52:51 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Even if the modem gets compromised, it can't access host memory. Since the host loads the firmware when it boots, rebooting your phone should reset it to a known good state. It doesn't save state.

23:28:58 <cn3m[m]> Ask here
23:29:16 <cn3m[m]> unless it's offtopic then wait until you see madaidan or I active on Spite?
23:30:14 <spaceinfinite[m]> So are you the mod on r/graphene?
23:30:36 <cn3m[m]> that's correct
23:31:10 <spaceinfinite[m]> Nice
23:31:39 <spaceinfinite[m]> You are very active on reddit and here
23:32:00 <cn3m[m]> That's the best tool I have to help the community
23:32:52 <cn3m[m]> If our community steps up I can start developing on open source projects with my free time. For now I do what I have to do
23:32:55 <spaceinfinite[m]> From what i read before you were are in advertising so you have the knowledge
23:34:00 <spaceinfinite[m]> <cn3m[m] "If our community steps up I can "> I feel there is nit enough people with knowledge here to step up as required
23:34:11 <cn3m[m]>  @spaceinfinite:matrix.org Yes, my strength is in privacy research. I am not a security expert, but there's an overlap
23:34:19 <cn3m[m]> threat modeling and spotting theater
23:34:37 <cn3m[m]>  @spaceinfinite:matrix.org I offered time and time again to help anyone who needs it to get up to speed
23:34:49 <cn3m[m]> I'm an open door
23:35:21 <cn3m[m]> if I have to spend 10-20 hours training 6 people that are able to all able to do half the work I do and spread it to 3 subs that's worth it for me
23:35:23 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. I wonder if I should distill down my GrapheneOS Knowledge base? I could try adding some more of that as well, I've kinda left it unmaintained...
23:36:02 <spaceinfinite[m]> <cn3m[m] "if I have to spend 10-20 hours t"> 20 hours training at what?
23:36:04 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org no one seems willing to read blogs and such. I just have to sit down and explain it all to everyone over and over again with this tl;dr society
23:36:21 <spaceinfinite[m]> How to maintain privacy?
23:36:36 <cn3m[m]>  @spaceinfinite:matrix.org sharing my knowledge and mock debates so they can help on Reddit
23:36:37 <cn3m[m]> a few hours per person
23:36:43 <cn3m[m]> if they stay on topic
23:37:27 <spaceinfinite[m]> But i doubt it will work or depends on subject or person
23:37:59 <cn3m[m]> if you look back to my first posts my comments were buried since I couldn't explain myself well and no one heard these ideas. After a week it starting being more popular. 100 hours later there's a marked change in the sub. There's still much more work to be done
23:38:57 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. :(
23:38:57 <cn3m[m]> If someone really had the drive they could research my comments. This stuff keeps coming up in the same way and I keep arguing with the same people with little verbal support
23:39:16 <spaceinfinite[m]> Lol
23:39:16 <chani1> cn3m[m]: if you have blogs to recommend, what are they?
23:39:33 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org It doesn't really hurt, but if people aren't going to read it besides people like you and me?
23:40:30 <spaceinfinite[m]> Careful of burnout though
23:41:06 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_chani1:matrix.org will link some in a minute
23:41:23 <spaceinfinite[m]> I see you madaidan strcat giving answers long like poems and again an again
23:41:41 <cn3m[m]>  @spaceinfinite:matrix.org I'm trying to minimize Daniel's burnout. If people start helping me help him we can get a chain going
23:42:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
23:43:34 <spaceinfinite[m]> <cn3m[m] " @spaceinfinite:matrix.org I'm t"> As i said few hours ago, in the emd good will triumph
23:43:47 <chani1> cn3m[m]: i get what you're saying about not wanting to cater to tl:dr culture, but honestly, I think it might be worthwhile to increase the ratio of good information in these reddits by writing posts that are more explanatory
23:44:11 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QeJDwKNDJhlQGONwYMnouuRv >
23:44:49 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QlZqjwkMXgwpyJJTuiELXykc >
23:45:15 <spaceinfinite[m]> And it is step by step
23:45:30 <cn3m[m]> https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/ is worthwhile too
23:46:32 <cn3m[m]> <chani1 "cn3m: i get what you're saying a"> you're going to have to explain that
23:47:51 <cn3m[m]> I wrote this whole thing for one person https://reddit.com/comments/gro3rc/comment/fs2o8bf
23:48:00 <cn3m[m]> I can't get more explanatory imo
23:48:11 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Huh. I wonder if I should distil"> As in the FAQ section of the GrapheneOS site? I think you explain subjects very well and i have always enjoyed reading your explanations so I'd be happy if there was more
23:49:33 <TheJollyRoger> Hi mxnorvak[m]! Thanks, I actually have a small backwater repository of stuff I've collected on GrapheneOS and notes I've taken at https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge although it's a tad bit dated.
23:49:42 <chani1> one of the things I keep seeing over and over again on reddit threads is people having slapfights contstantly, and you've got to have the time and patients to dig into the arguments to understand what's going on
23:50:23 <chani1> TheJollyRoger: haha, didn't realize that was yours. DannyWorkOrderPr recommended I link that on the new wiki and work on getting that info ported over
23:50:31 <TheJollyRoger> Ah!
23:50:52 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. I can help jump in and try to help a bit there once I've got some stuff on this end figured out.
23:50:56 <cn3m[m]> it's slapfighting a lot of it is
23:51:06 <cn3m[m]> That has consistently changed people's mind
23:51:17 <chani1> cn3m[m]: part of the problem is a lot of these arguments get really into the weeds really quickly, and the average user doesn't really have the technical knowledge to evaluate the claims made themselves
23:51:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. So this is why quantity tends to win out in the end.
23:51:45 <cn3m[m]> one guy was very misinformed and aggressive. When we got to it he changed his mind and is working on some cool security projects build on meaningful measures
23:52:06 <cn3m[m]> I'm trying to change one person at a time. The general disposition of the sub
23:52:14 <cn3m[m]> I'm the only person on every thread related
23:52:20 <chani1> cn3m[m]: that's awesome! I want to see more of that happening.
23:52:30 <cn3m[m]> if there were more people that would happen faster
23:52:31 <cn3m[m]> It's not that hard
23:53:08 <cn3m[m]> It's frustrating, but they aren't attacking my life's work. I can't imagine that for Daniel.
23:53:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
23:53:34 <cn3m[m]> if you aren't coding you should be beta testing and fighting misinformation
23:54:02 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi mxnorvak[m]! Thanks, I actual"> I'll check them out ,thanks
23:54:09 <cn3m[m]> even just a little bit
23:54:21 <chani1> I'm just saying I think it's more effective to fight misinformation by providing good information in a a clear format for a wide audience than arguing with internet trolls.
23:54:57 <chani1> sadly, there's a lot of trolls floating around those subreddits, and there's a huge lack of solid information available in a non-technical format
23:55:26 <cn3m[m]> I'm making a difference in those subs
23:55:47 <chani1> cn3m[m]: I'm not suggesting you aren't.]
23:55:54 <cn3m[m]> the trolls are usually walking back statements
23:55:57 <cn3m[m]> the culture is slowly changing
23:56:04 <cn3m[m]> that's the most effective method available
23:56:34 <mxnorvak[m]> <chani1 "I'm just saying I think it's mor"> I like this idea
23:57:00 <cn3m[m]> upvotes on Reddit matter it's stupid but it does
23:57:20 <cn3m[m]> if we work together on Reddit it will work. Even me going mostly alone works
23:57:24 <cn3m[m]> you guys are missing the point
23:57:30 <cn3m[m]> blogs and things won't help
23:57:38 <cn3m[m]> you need to go to root of misinfo and paranoia
23:57:39 <cn3m[m]> that's Reddit
23:57:49 <chani1> cn3m[m]: I'm not suggesting blogs, I'm suggesting informative posts on reddit
23:58:28 <chani1> cn3m[m]: ones written in a way the average user can understand
23:58:30 <cn3m[m]> That's going to be called shilling
23:58:31 <cn3m[m]> that's not going to help
23:58:47 <cn3m[m]> The people who don't like me are very active at trying to say I'm biased
23:58:55 <cn3m[m]> if I start making posts I make myself a target
23:59:07 <cn3m[m]> winning in the questions is how I have to do it
23:59:16 <cn3m[m]> the climate there is not what you think it is
23:59:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> Got the patch. Thank you, @strcat:matrix.org
