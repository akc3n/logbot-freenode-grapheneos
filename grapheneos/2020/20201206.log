00:59:18 <ruddo[m]> Think it's time to start an actual step by step guide on how to help.
01:06:22 <urnbeast[m]> <strcat[m] "what matters is that people capa"> So what does this entail, exactly? I've never done anything more than flashing custom roms to my phones so I'm not sure what developing and maintain actually means?
01:08:37 <urnbeast[m]> I'll do some digging but I am curious if just an everyday user without much technical knowledge in Android would be able to positively help in some degree
01:37:14 <joehandcockandja> They can't
01:47:50 <xztrop2[m]> Hi, I am currently in the process of installing and am waiting for factory images to finish downloading. I scrolled ahead and saw in the troubleshooting section that substandard USB cables are a large cause of failed flashes. I have not flashed yet. Is it too late for me to switch out the cable for another? If not, any steps I should take? Sorry for the noob question. Should have looked ahead
01:58:17 <urnbeast[m]> If you haven't started flashing anything then you're fine
01:58:47 <urnbeast[m]> You'll just need to make sure your phone connects to your PC in fastboot
02:00:04 <xztrop2[m]> I am in fastboot now. I have not begun flashing anything. Is it safe to disconnect the cable or do I need to leave the fastboot interface or potentially relock the phone first?
02:00:17 <urnbeast[m]> You can just disconnect and reconnect
02:00:33 <urnbeast[m]> Or rather, it should reconnect itself
02:00:41 <xztrop2[m]> Okay. Thanks. Will update in a moment
02:02:03 <xztrop2[m]> That seemed to work
02:02:37 <xztrop2[m]> switched out cable to better one and will try flashing now
02:08:13 <TheJollyRoger> Fantastic, xztrop2[m]!
02:08:40 <xztrop2[m]> It worked!
02:09:00 <xztrop2[m]> Going to lock bootloader
02:10:02 <urnbeast[m]> Nice!
02:11:14 <whatisthematrix[> Welcome to the party new people!
02:27:44 <TheJollyRoger> xztrop2[m]: excellent! Welcome aboard the good ship!
02:27:47 <xztrop2[m]> Thanks! Such a relief already to be here
02:30:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr
02:31:49 <whatisthematrix[> Let's go sailing the high seas!
02:32:34 <xztrop2[m]> Right there with you!
02:36:33 <TheJollyRoger> P.-)
03:08:54 <xztrop2[m]> pretty basic question, but I should use Vanadium to install F-droid, right? Just getting started setting it all up now. Any other tips or directions you could point me would be very much appreciated
03:11:33 <TheJollyRoger> Hey xztrop2[m], yep, you can download F-Droid through Vanadium and install it.
03:12:46 <TheJollyRoger> Unless you have a direct connection to F-Droid's developers, you will not gain any security benefit from GPG verification, since packages on Android are signed, verified, trusted on first contact, and pinned unless rolled over with subsequent updates validating the next.
03:13:37 <xztrop2[m]> Okay, great. So to be sure, since its not allowed by default, I should allow installation of unknown apps from this source?
03:14:47 <dwkr[m]> <xztrop2[m] "pretty basic question, but I sho"> If you haven't already, check out Foxy Droid (in the f-droid store) as an alternative app to access the F-Droid store. Much smoother experience.
03:15:02 <dwkr[m]> <xztrop2[m] "Okay, great. So to be sure, sinc"> Yes.
03:15:23 <xztrop2[m]> Alright, will do! Thanks!
03:17:33 <xztrop2[m]> Installed. There's a notification about the app being built for an older version of android and may not work properly... This all expected?
03:20:40 <dwkr[m]> This was after F-Droid install?
03:20:51 <xztrop2[m]> Yes
03:25:22 <dwkr[m]> I re-installed and got the same alert.
03:26:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. F-Droid targets an older version of the API, there is nothing we can do about this, the ball is in F-Droid's court on this one.
03:26:14 <TheJollyRoger> They have to essentially compile the app for a newer version of the API.
03:26:35 <TheJollyRoger> Of course, this would likely break the app for all the people running 4-year old builds of LineageOS on their old phones.
03:26:45 <arpysco[m]> I switched from the F-Droid client to Foxy Droid, I'm much happier with it!
03:27:20 <TheJollyRoger> Nice!
03:27:20 <dwkr[m]> Yeah. After years of using F-Droid, Foxy runs like a dream.
03:29:25 <xztrop2[m]> Great, thanks for checking that for me. Going to switch to Foxy Droid now, although I almost feel like I should use the standard interface for a little just so that I'll be able to appreciate it that much more
03:29:45 <xztrop2[m]> on second thought, I'm going straight to it
03:30:28 <dwkr[m]> Haha
03:46:05 <xztrop2[m]> Loving the experience so far. Going to tune out for the evening here soon, but are there any other suggestions for good places to start or nice ways to setup? Welcoming any and all ideas
03:48:13 <xztrop2[m]> Even if just app suggestions. It's my first time using F-droid, embarrassingly enough. Was long overdue
03:52:20 <whatisthematrix[> Better late than never! Welcome to the crew
03:57:29 <xztrop2[m]> Very true. Glad to be here!
04:09:39 <whatisthematrix[> <xztrop2[m] "Very true. Glad to be here!"> Check out the grapheneOS off topic channel as well!
04:24:38 <naribia> eh
05:00:45 <TheJH> TheJollyRoger: well in theory, since f-droid is not on the play store anyway, I think they could just ship two different versions of it if they wanted to?
05:05:29 <JTL> TheJH: Hold on. Who is "they" and two different versions of what?
05:05:37 <JTL> (Just taking some mental notes of this conversation)
05:34:45 <TheJH> JTL: the f-droid folks
05:34:52 <TheJH> JTL: two different versions of f-droid
05:34:55 <JTL> Ah okay
05:34:57 <JTL> Got it
05:41:13 <TheJollyRoger> I guess they could!
07:12:33 <asdafsda> hi. i just installed grapheneos on my pixel 4a. everything works except whatsapp, which is a must for me. says it needs google play services to work and gets stuck loading. anyone else having this issue?
07:14:48 <TheJollyRoger> hello asdafsda, it's likely that Whatsapp has a hardcoded dependency on Google Play Services.
07:15:14 <TheJollyRoger> Your best bet in getting this fixed is to contact the developers of WhatsApp and ask them to implement a way for Whatsapp to run without being dependent on Play Services or Google Cloud messages.
07:15:56 <TheJollyRoger> I don't use WhatsApp, so unfortunately I can't be of much further help. Funny though, I thought WhatsApp ran sans GCM.
07:16:02 <TheJollyRoger> Strange.
07:18:23 <TheJollyRoger> Wonder if they changed it?
07:18:35 <asdafsda> hi jollyroger. oh ok. thanks for the info. i've read that it works for other people so thought that maybe i installed incorrectly. i tried the download from whatsapp directly and from the aurora store but couldn't get past verification.
07:19:50 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy! Yeah, I heard that it had as well. I'm honestly really surprised!
07:20:06 <TheJollyRoger> But unfortunately in this case I've never used WhatsApp, so I don't think I'll be able to chime in here much. :(
07:20:07 <somenerd[m]> Me too.
07:20:11 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about that.
07:20:59 <asdafsda> i installed the latest sunfish version fyi and microg but not too sure if that matters. i'll keep trying, maybe i'll come across a solution online.
07:21:16 <somenerd[m]> micro?
07:21:19 <somenerd[m]>  * microg?
07:21:42 <somenerd[m]> I don't think that microg is supported by GrapheneOS
07:21:51 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
07:22:22 <asdafsda> that makes sense. i added the repo to fdroid but couldn't tell if it did anything lol
07:22:32 <asdafsda> will uninstall then
07:23:48 <arpysco[m]> Not right now anyway, I read that some kind of support is coming that will allow microg to run safely in its own profile for those who want it
07:24:32 <somenerd[m]> Yeah it's also at the link
07:24:43 <somenerd[m]>  * Yeah
07:25:35 <baldgeek123[m]> Has anyone tested VoLTE on the Jio network in India? Wished to buy a pixel 4a and wanted to ask first.
07:29:26 <baldgeek123[m]> <somenerd[m] "Yeah it's also at the link"> Any issues with the cell reception on GrapheneOS?
07:29:36 <asdafsda> the instructions also has me a little confused. it says to lock the bootloader since it has to perform a factory reset but immediately after it says to unlock the bootloader to perform factory reset. i just locked the bootloader and ignored the line about unlocking
07:29:37 <somenerd[m]> I'm not sure
07:30:35 <somenerd[m]> I think they meant that unlocking again would perform a factory reset.
07:30:45 <somenerd[m]> Not to unlock the bootloader
07:33:11 <somenerd[m]>  * Not to unlock the bootloader again.
07:33:53 <asdafsda> i actually tried to unlock immediately after cause i thought that's what it said but it didn't work anyways.
07:34:47 <asdafsda> my first time installing a mobile os so it's all quite new to me. normally used ios but wanted privacy
07:35:56 <asdafsda> if i wanted to revert back to android, i would just have to follow the instructions but flash the android image instead graphene, right?
07:36:10 <somenerd[m]> Yeah I believe that it was a statement, not a part of the instructions (the boot loader part)
07:36:30 <somenerd[m]> > if i wanted to revert back to android, i would just have to follow the instructions but flash the android image instead graphene, right?

07:40:06 <asdafsda> @arpyso yeah i'm aware of that, just wanted to verify w some who has actually done it
09:00:58 <dazinism> asdafsda: never tried WhatsApp, but not heard of people having problems getting it working.
09:02:03 <dazinism> Your issue could be due to having microG installed. Apps can see that and behave differently
09:03:17 <dazinism> I expect either reinstalling or clearing all data in WhatsApp after uninstalling microG may get things working for you.
09:25:20 <anima[m]> whatsapp works without gsf
09:32:29 <seanmarks[m]> Hi guys! Does anyone have pixel 3a from O2 UK? Can the bootloader be unlocked on this one? I read that not all models are unlockable
09:36:08 <Golli[m]2> IIRC only the EE and unlocked ones can?

10:10:59 <seanmarks[m]> It turns out that if the OEM unlock option is not greyed out in the developer options I should be good to go :) at least that is what I got told
10:29:08 <ultrabo0k[m]> Hello guys. Since the last update I have an issue with one of my grapheneos devices which is Pixel 4 XL. For some reason after the update I've lost connection and it shows me no service all the time... I've tried everything like to change the same sim to another grapheneos and it works properly as usual. I've restarted the device I reset all like network or any other option + also I did factory reset and nothing
10:29:09 <ultrabo0k[m]> changed... Just the device can not detect the sim and I have nobidea why after the reboot everything stopped without a rrson for me... So basically I can't use my Pixel 4 XL since then... Any suggestions?
10:33:43 <r0tt0r[m]> <ultrabo0k[m] "Hello guys. Since the last updat"> can you verify imei and phone no is shown in settings about? also have you recreated apn?
10:36:51 <strcat[m]> ruddo: there's the step by step build guide already
10:36:58 <strcat[m]> ruddo: if people want to help with development that's what they need
10:37:51 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: uninstall microG and WhatsApp should work fine
10:39:01 <strcat[m]> ah the person I wanted to send that to left already
10:39:07 <ultrabo0k[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "can you verify imei and phone no"> I've been using this device for more than 2 months without any problem. This problem appears after the last automatic update on 27/11/2020 and then I have to reboot the system as usual andsince then "No Service".
10:39:21 <strcat[m]> probably not related to that update
10:39:27 <strcat[m]> just happens to be when you rebooted most recently
10:40:20 <strcat[m]> have you confirmed that there's actually no service?
10:40:40 <strcat[m]> look at the list of recent changes, there's nothing relevant
10:40:52 <ultrabo0k[m]> Yes I can confirm that the IMEI it shown in settings about but not the number. Also when I go to Mobile data settings it shown the name of the mobile operator but that's it... And when I try to make a call or any it shows me to stop the airplane mode which is off anyway... And that's why I though that if I make factory reset will be fine but no....
10:41:16 <strcat[m]> are you sure airplane mode is off?
10:42:36 <ultrabo0k[m]> <strcat[m] "are you sure airplane mode is of"> Are you joking...100 % come on..
10:42:54 <arpysco[m]> He's trying to help you, man
10:43:01 <arpysco[m]> No need for that tone
10:43:11 <arpysco[m]> We all can make mistakes like that sometimes
10:44:01 <strcat[m]> ultrabo0k: I would also try taking out the SIM, making sure contacts are fine
10:44:04 <ultrabo0k[m]> True. My apologis.. Just follow what I said.. I have 4 grapheneos devices and the problem appear only to one of them after the update with no reason
10:44:15 <strcat[m]> I think the problem just appeared because you rebooted
10:44:18 <strcat[m]> nothing to do with the update
10:44:36 <strcat[m]> just because you rebooted to boot the updated OS doesn't mean an update to do the OS was involved in a problem that appeared
10:44:39 <strcat[m]> no relevant changes
10:44:44 <strcat[m]> you probably hadn't rebooted for a month
10:44:47 <strcat[m]> since last update
10:44:56 <ultrabo0k[m]> <strcat[m] "I think the problem just appeare"> Its ask me to do it bro... Because I didn't set them for automatic reboot after the update and it comes like notification
10:45:01 <strcat[m]> so it's the first time it had to reconnect to the network in ages
10:45:11 <strcat[m]> all I'm saying is that it's unlikely to be caused by the update
10:45:20 <strcat[m]> there are no relevant changes and as you say your other devices work fine
10:46:06 <ultrabo0k[m]> I'm not saying is because of the update I just described the whole situation
10:47:38 <ultrabo0k[m]> Its true I was in roaming that time but for the last 2 no this my phone was updated two times alreadybwhen I was abroad and there was nobissue and like every time after the update I have received notification to restart my phone and that's what I did and then.. No service
10:48:34 <ultrabo0k[m]> <strcat[m] "so it's the first time it had to"> Yes the first time...
10:49:51 <strcat[m]> you should try swapping the SIM cards between it and another phone
10:50:03 <strcat[m]> to see if it can connect with a different SIM
10:50:11 <ultrabo0k[m]> <strcat[m] "you probably hadn't rebooted for"> After every update I restart my phone and it wasn't just one time to restarted.. I was traveling very often so my phone was on and off every few days but never had problem like this...
10:50:11 <strcat[m]> and if another phone can connect with this SIM that's not working
10:50:33 <strcat[m]> try swapping the SIMs
10:51:35 <ultrabo0k[m]> <strcat[m] "try swapping the SIMs"> Actually that is the only thing which I didn't try.. Let me put another sim .. Give me few mi s
10:55:50 <ultrabo0k[m]> Still the same issue... In Network and Internet in Settings it shows me the right mobile operator. Also in Sim Tool app also everything looks fine but No Service...
11:01:16 <ultrabo0k[m]> In that case I have only two options left.. To reinstall grapheneos and to try with another sim but different operator..

12:40:16 <sel[m]1> <dazinism "Foxy Droid has been flawless for"> Same, it's actually the best f-droid client for me

13:29:48 <qpx> Thanks, will give it a try
13:30:07 <hahek[m]> Hello, I am thinking in use grapheneos but I have some questions: 1) is the encryption implementation strong enough to not be bypassed by law enforcement? 2) in case of lost of your phone the os improve how to locate it and prevents bypassing of the lockdown to prevent it to be sell as a new phone? 3) camera can still use night mode and capture northern lights?
13:31:25 <baldgeek123[m]> <sel[m]1 "Idk how far Aurora Droid have pr"> It is really, really good now. F-Droid's original app seems really dated in comparison to it. I tried foxy and it's good but Aurora is something else.
13:32:40 <strcat[m]> hahek: there's a very strong encryption implementation, see past conversations here including yesterday for details
13:33:44 <strcat[m]> hahek: someone that steals your phone can just turn it off so there's not much point in installing something to track it at all times, just adds attack surface (and reduces privacy, assuming it's not end-to-end encrypted)
13:34:25 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "hahek: someone that steals your "> imei blacklist possible
13:34:45 <strcat[m]> doesn't change that there's not much point in trying to track it
13:35:17 <r0tt0r[m]> indeed but noone will be able to use the phone with its imei
13:35:49 <strcat[m]> with carriers respecting that blacklist
13:35:52 <strcat[m]> and what does it achieve?
13:35:54 <strcat[m]> it's stolen already
13:36:21 <r0tt0r[m]> ye thats a bitter pill to swallow, at least the thief might get caught
13:36:31 <strcat[m]> you don't gain anything by making it less useful to them after it's already stolen
13:36:37 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: law enforcement doesn't care about stolen phones
13:36:51 <hahek[m]> I was thinking on remote erasing the device too, not sure if is possible as the only option I know for android is the one provided by google
13:36:52 <nscnt> but muh property
13:37:07 <strcat[m]> hahek: plenty of other implementations, and as I said above
13:37:22 <strcat[m]> thief can just turn off the phone
13:37:45 <strcat[m]> why would they just leave it on with the SIM card inside it, connected to the network?
13:38:09 <strcat[m]> and what do you hope to gain by installing software tracking it at all times
13:38:26 <strcat[m]> you're just adding attack surface and reducing your privacy (since I doubt there are end-to-end encrypted implementations available)
13:38:30 <strcat[m]> and for what?
13:38:41 <strcat[m]> are you going to go break into some crack house, fight a bunch of people off and get back your phone?
13:38:49 <strcat[m]> the police aren't going to care
13:39:22 <hahek[m]> You are right there
13:39:25 <strcat[m]> use decent lock methods - at a minimum use one that's secure based on the secure element, and ideally use a strong passphrase
13:40:43 <strcat[m]> it's a good thing if they turn off the phone
13:40:45 <strcat[m]> you should want that
13:40:58 <strcat[m]> because if it was currently logged in + locked, them turning it off puts it fully at rest again
13:41:20 <strcat[m]> in fact it would make sense to develop optional features for automatically turning the phone off in certain cases
13:41:41 <strcat[m]> such as automatically turning it off if it hasn't been unlocked for a certain amount of time
13:42:20 <hahek[m]> Thanks, I appreciate this info
13:42:46 <alex-resist> A factory reset is still possible, right? Even with bootloader re-locked and a screen lock?
13:43:06 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: yes, they can boot up recovery and factory reset - seems like a good thing if they do that for you
13:43:21 <strcat[m]> now your data is guaranteed to be inaccessible
13:43:36 <alex-resist> I was just wondering if a stolen GrapheneOS phone would be of any use at all, but if factory resets are possible, it would
13:44:02 <strcat[m]> we permit factory reset via recovery, again seems like a good thing if a thief does that for you
13:44:33 <alex-resist> If the threat model includes thieves accessing your data, it is. It would however be a mild theft deterrence feature if factory resets are disabled
13:44:36 <strcat[m]> purges the tokens required to ever obtain the encryption keys again
13:45:04 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: theft deterrence is only relevant if they know that the phone runs GrapheneOS - what are the chances of that?
13:45:09 <alex-resist> Yes, very slim
13:45:16 <alex-resist> That's why I said "mild" :)
13:45:28 <nscnt> alex-resist: You want: If you forget your passphrase you could never use your phone again?
13:45:32 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: stock OS has factory reset protection, the phone ends up tied to a Google account and factory reset via recovery doesn't change that
13:45:48 <strcat[m]> unless you removed the account before the factory reset via settings
13:46:21 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I don't see how it would deter theft for us to have factory reset protection except in an extreme edge case where a thief knows the device is running GrapheneOS
13:46:54 <strcat[m]> also, I'm definitely not dealing with people being unable to use their device ever again because they forget the owner account lock method - which happens all the time
13:47:29 <strcat[m]> so it can't be done by simply removing the wipe option from recovery, and we're not going to tie devices to accounts as part of a regular setup
13:48:07 <strcat[m]> and if it's opt-in, which it has to be for those reasons, I don't see how it would deter theft
13:48:09 <strcat[m]> what is the actual use case?
13:48:31 <strcat[m]> so, 1) it's not a privacy or security feature (in fact, it's best if they wipe the phone)
13:48:51 <strcat[m]> 2) it's just theater that doesn't deter theft unless the thieves know about it and it's the default
13:49:02 <strcat[m]>  * \2. it's just theater that doesn't deter theft unless the thieves know about it and it's the default
13:49:05 <strcat[m]>  * 2. it's just theater that doesn't deter theft unless the thieves know about it and it's the default
13:49:26 <strcat[m]> and 2) it's just theater that doesn't deter theft unless the thieves know about it and it's the default
13:49:31 <alex-resist> Plus thieves will probably destroy phones they cannot use instead of returning them
13:50:08 <strcat[m]> they wouldn't destroy them, they still have value
13:50:14 <strcat[m]> they have valuable parts, etc.
13:50:28 <strcat[m]> they are doing you a favor if they factory reset it
13:51:52 <nscnt> *thief melting out rare-earth elements out of stolen phone*
13:51:56 <strcat[m]> if the device is powered on with at least one profile logged in, then there is data that can be obtained by exploiting the OS, if they turn it off then the profiles are fully at rest again
13:52:05 <strcat[m]> so, it's good if they turn it off to prevent being tracked
13:52:13 <strcat[m]> puts all your data at rest
13:52:21 <strcat[m]> and if they factory reset via recovery, great
13:52:55 <strcat[m]> the factory reset protection in the stock OS allows that - it will just force logging into the account that the owner account was tied to after booting it up again
13:53:17 <strcat[m]> we're fully capable of implementing the same thing but we don't see a reason to do it
13:53:43 <alex-resist> What attack surface is left if there's at least one profile logged in, but secured with a proper screen lock? USB should be deactivated - what else can be done except brute forcing (which would take forever)?
13:53:45 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: also this relies upon them having recovery methods for Google accounts including via support
13:54:00 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: you have to turn on Advanced Protection to disable those backdoors into your account
13:54:36 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: there the attack surface of the radios (cellular, Wi-Fi) and you can make an emergency call to turn on cellular if it was actually disabled
13:54:47 <alex-resist> I see, good point
13:54:52 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: if you have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth disabled they can't enable them, but most people probably have Wi-Fi on
13:55:10 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: there's some minor attack surface on the lockscreen but nothing substantial
13:55:50 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: and yeah we disable USB peripherals when locked by default (you can connect one and *reboot* to make it detected atm, we deliberately allow that right now to cover cases like dead touchscreen where you need to unlock with a keyboard)
13:56:17 <strcat[m]>  * alex-resist: and yeah we disable USB peripherals when locked by default (you can connect one and _reboot_ to make it get detected atm, we deliberately allow that right now to cover cases like dead touchscreen where you need to unlock with a keyboard)
13:56:47 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: and if it's a sophisticated attacker the device can be disassembled and stuff extracted from memory, etc.
13:57:34 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: disk encryption depends on the data being at rest, if the profile is logged in, it's not at rest, the encryption keys are available to the OS, so if the OS is exploited they get them
13:57:57 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: apps can use the keystore to keep data at rest when a profile is logged in but the screen is locked
13:58:23 <strcat[m]> but the default, normal state is that it's accessible by the OS once you unlock the profile until you logout of the profile
13:58:48 <alex-resist> Perhaps the phone could do a soft reboot after 6, 12 or 24 hours and log out from all profiles
14:00:04 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: that's what I suggested above: we could add an optional feature to auto-reboot after N hours of inactivity
14:00:15 <strcat[m]>  * alex-resist: that's what I suggested above: we could add an optional feature to auto-reboot after N hours of not unlocking
14:00:34 <alex-resist> Ok then I misunderstood the suggestion above, I thought you wanted to shut it down after n hours
14:00:44 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: the owner profile can't be logged out without rebooting because it owns core OS services
14:00:46 <alex-resist> But maybe that could be an option too
14:01:09 <strcat[m]> only secondary profiles can be logged out without a reboot
14:01:33 <strcat[m]> a lot of core OS services / data aren't active until you unlock the owner profile after boot
14:01:46 <strcat[m]> because only non-sensitive data can be outside of a profile's encrypted data
14:02:16 <alex-resist> I would probably use that feature
14:02:42 <strcat[m]> it would be easy for us to implement
14:02:56 <strcat[m]> relatively easy, at least
14:03:17 <alex-resist> The question is UX: what options would be available (what options are sane?) and how could that feature be explained to the user
14:04:44 <alex-resist> I wouldn't mind a complete shut down after 6, or even 3 hours, although that would be a bit extreme for most users
14:04:50 <strcat> there are 2 kinds of options that make sense: 1) for owner profile only: reboot device when inactive for N hours, 2) for secondary profiles, logout of profile automatically after N hours
14:05:19 <strcat> well, not inactive, but rather, 'not unlocked' (any profile being unlocked has to restart the timer)
14:05:54 <strcat> the best way to use the device is probably to use the owner profile only for user management type stuff
14:06:02 <strcat> and have secondary profiles for different purposes
14:06:07 <strcat> and if it's sensitive, log it out after using it
14:06:24 <alex-resist> I haven't started doing that yet, but it makes a lot of sense
14:06:53 <strcat> because secondary profiles go back to being at rest when logged out
14:07:00 <strcat> and each has a different encryption key
14:08:00 <strcat> also you can reliably wipe a profile, the encryption key can't be derived again if it's deleted
14:08:03 <hahek[m]> I have read that perform of camera and other featured are not great, so for the purpose of using this OS for long as possible you recommend me to buy a phone with the longest support? Regarding the hardware specs
14:08:32 <strcat> I don't understand the connection to the camera
14:08:35 <arpysco[m]> Camera is fine for me with open camera
14:08:37 <strcat> don't really understand the question
14:08:45 <alex-resist> strcat so you would install nothing on the primary profile and just use it to set up a number of secondary profiles? And only install additional apps in those secondary profiles, depending on context/use case?
14:08:52 <strcat> camera functionality and quality match the stock OS for the same app being compared on both
14:09:19 <strcat> alex-resist: yes
14:09:29 <strcat> alex-resist: only use owner profile to set up other profiles
14:09:38 <alex-resist> strcat ok will try that, that's a good sunday task
14:09:40 <strcat> alex-resist: because that way you can delete the other profiles at any time, and have them not logged in
14:09:56 <strcat> alex-resist: you can't delete the owner profile without factory reset as a whole
14:10:48 <strcat> alex-resist: so you can have a main profile that you use, but it is ideally a secondary profile, not the owner profile, if you want to take maximum advantage of the features
14:11:10 <strcat> alex-resist: since then you can decide to wipe that whole profile, or have it logged out
14:11:27 <strcat> alex-resist: so for example, lets say you are somewhere that you don't want to enter the passphrase for accessing your data
14:12:09 <strcat> alex-resist: if it's in a secondary profile, you can still reboot the device (perhaps it ran out of power and had to be charged) and log into the owner profile, then create some temporary profile to use or swap to an existing one
14:12:18 <strcat> without ever entering the passphrase for your main everyday use profile
14:12:35 <strcat> alex-resist: it's just the best way to do things that's available, if you really want to follow best practices
14:12:44 <strcat> alex-resist: for multiple reasons
14:13:14 <strcat> alex-resist: the owner profile can't really do anything scary without exploiting the OS, but it can manage other profiles including deleting them
14:13:24 <strcat> alex-resist: quite useful: you can delete a profile without logging into it
14:16:12 <nscnt> Ah, so you mean the owner profile is not locked in any way?
14:16:18 <strcat[m]> no
14:17:15 <strcat[m]> I'm saying that the best way to use the device is to have the owner profile as a system administration profile (creation/deletion of profiles and changing global settings)
14:17:25 <strcat[m]> and your everyday usage profile should be a secondary profile
14:17:36 <strcat[m]> because then you can boot up and use the device without unlocking the profile with most of your data
14:17:46 <strcat[m]> and you can wipe it without a full factory reset
14:18:03 <strcat[m]> I'm not saying this is strongly recommended or anything
14:18:13 <strcat[m]> alex-resist asked for the ideal way to do things
14:18:26 <eenno[m]> There should be some exceptions for that automatic reboot after being inactive? Like preventing from rebooting while a system update is downloaded/installed as an example.
14:18:37 <strcat> eenno[m]: rebooting during a system update is harmless
14:19:02 <eenno[m]> Ah ok.
14:19:03 <strcat> it will just start doing it again after rebooting next time it checks for an update
14:19:13 <strcat> there is no point during update installation that rebooting is dangerous
14:19:27 <strcat> the whole point of the approach is that updates are done in an atomic way that does not alter the currently installed OS
14:19:37 <strcat> A/B updates
14:19:37 <alex-resist> strcat: can SeedVault handle multiple user profiles? What does it backup/restore in such cases?
14:19:44 <strcat> alex-resist: no, I don't think it does yet
14:19:51 <nscnt> Yea, but your example with "you're somewhere that you don't want to enter the passphrase for accessing your data". Then "they" would see my owner profile passphrase anyway after a reboot
14:19:51 <strcat> it has experimental / broken support for it
14:20:18 <strcat> nscnt: yes but you have no sensitive data in that profile, you have a different passphrase for the everyday usage profile
14:20:24 <nscnt> right
14:21:01 <strcat> if you use the same passphrase there's not nearly as much point in doing it (but it still has advantages, the key encryption keys aren't the same)
14:21:12 <strcat> same passphrase != same key encryption key
14:21:49 <strcat> the key encryption key has multiple randomized inputs (hash of randomly generated 16k file, random token in the secure element retrieved by providing correct auth token)
14:22:01 <strcat> not just your lock method
14:22:23 <strcat> nscnt: so lets say owner profile is logged in, secondary profile you use for everyday use is not
14:22:39 <strcat> sophisticated attacker gets the device, disassembles it, extracts memory (bypasses memory encryption if present)
14:22:54 <strcat> nscnt: they do not get the key for your secondary profile that has the same passphrase
14:23:14 <nscnt> sure
14:23:49 <strcat> can't reverse key encryption key to passphrase, and also the key encryption key is gone after it's generated and used to decrypt the randomized disk encryption key
14:24:12 <strcat> all they can extract are the currently active disk encryption keys
14:24:19 <strcat> which are just fully random keys
14:24:30 <strcat> and are purged when a profile is logged out
14:24:59 <nscnt> It's crazy how much thought there was put in in everything
14:25:01 <strcat> when you change the lock method, what actually happens is that you help derive the old key encryption key (entering old lock method), then you make a new one
14:25:51 <strcat> it decrypts the disk encryption key for the profile with the old key encryption key, and then encrypts it with the new one, and writes it to storage again (the fully derived key encryption key is never actually available to the OS, this happens in the TEE)
14:26:18 <strcat> disk encryption key is a fully random key always stored encrypted with the key encryption key
14:26:42 <strcat> and there is still a key encryption key when you have no lock method, it still has the other inputs like the randomly generated 16k file, Weaver token on secure element, etc.
14:27:32 <strcat> there are other inputs beyond that (hardware-bound key used for key derivation in TEE, verified boot key, etc.)
14:28:23 <strcat> user profiles are a really strong feature, people don't realize how much it offers (fully isolated workspaces with their own encryption keys, able to be put fully at rest again via logout)
14:29:53 <alex-resist> Would you say that from a user's point of view, profiles are similar to VMs in Qubes, although technically they're quite different?
14:30:08 <arpysco[m]> I don't know how secure it would be but when I was setting up a few user profiles I sure wished I could clone my main profile's apps and settings...
14:30:18 <alex-resist> I.e. suggesting to make profiles similar to Qubes VMs?
14:30:47 <nscnt> UX is different, I guess
14:31:15 <strcat> alex-resist: yes it's a very similar concept, implemented via Linux kernel isolation features rather than VMs though
14:31:24 <strcat> alex-resist: but in theory they could be transparently implemented in another way
14:33:13 <nscnt> You can see different applications from different VMs in one "layer", can't you? With profiles you need to change users and notifications won't be seen from the other profiles I think
14:33:21 <alex-resist> strcat it would make teaching Qubes and Graphene easier if concepts of compartmentation could be applied to both
14:33:36 <BugHunter1000> Are there any open-source tablets that can run graphene?  Some thing like a libre ARM or a RISCV?
14:33:59 <strcat> there's no such thing as open ARM
14:34:19 <strcat> a RISC-V SoC *may* be open source (but likely isn't)
14:34:24 <strcat> an ARM SoC cannot be open source
14:34:55 <strcat> there is no such thing as an open source ARM SoC, despite dishonest marketing claiming that without a basis
14:35:21 <BugHunter1000> strcat, hmm that's disappointing, what do you recommend for tablets?
14:35:29 <strcat> there isn't really any available open source mobile SoC
14:35:41 <strcat> BugHunter1000: we don't have official support for any tablets, of course you can build it for whatever you want
14:35:51 <strcat> I don't have a recommendation for a tablet
14:38:31 <BugHunter1000> thanks anyway
14:46:45 <unknoown> yra
14:49:16 <dazinism> Off-topic and obviously missing loads of hardware security fratures-
14:49:19 <dazinism> Was interesting to see that android 11 has been ported to the Raspberry Pi 4 - create your own cyberpunk tablet...
14:52:10 <alex-resist> strcat one more question: so if I understood you correctly, multiple user profiles can be logged in at the same time. Do notifications then also work for apps in different user profiles? E.g. Signal in Profile A, Conversations in Profile B?
15:11:09 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: notifications work but you won't see them until you switch
15:11:23 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: in theory the censored version of the notifications for the lockscreen could be displayed to other users
15:11:37 <strcat[m]> but it would be confusing without some kind of good UI for it
15:16:57 <nscnt> You won't be bored at GrapheneOS as a developer :P
15:17:35 <nscnt> Tons of interesting issues to solve
15:29:02 <assman> Can anyone on at&t please confirm the volte is working again? It was working perfectly fine on pixel 4xl until android 11 update. Thank you in advance!
15:50:08 <jed> is pixel 5 support coming? I'd like to buy the newest phone possible. can wait up to 6 months.
15:50:48 <Golli[m]> Currently, there is no one working on a Pixel 5 support.
15:51:01 <Golli[m]>  * Currently, there is no one working on Pixel 5 or Pixel 4a 5G support.
15:52:20 <jed> thx
15:54:07 <jed> how long does it take start to finish for a new model generally?
16:00:17 <Golli[m]> It can vary widely.
16:00:17 <Golli[m]> There's no time frame, but the Pixel 4 and 4XL got support back on the 22nd of June this year and they were released on October 15th of last year.
16:01:06 <Golli[m]>  * It can vary widely.
16:01:06 <Golli[m]> There's no time frame, but the Pixel 4 and 4XL got experimental support back on the 22nd of June this year and they were released on October 15th of last year.
16:02:11 <strcat[m]> it hasn't been started
16:02:19 <strcat[m]> the amount of time won't be shorter if it's started later
16:02:36 <strcat[m]> it didn't take that long to add Pixel 4 support once anupritaisno1 became the maintainer and started working on it
16:10:45 <naribia> the main thing I like about grapheneos is that you can lock the bootloader
16:11:09 <naribia> is it difficult to build vanilla android from AOSP and sign it yourself?
16:16:47 <strcat[m]> naribia: it's not trivial to do it properly
16:16:54 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS makes it simpler
16:17:33 <strcat[m]> the main benefit of locking is that it enables verified boot and that's also more meaningful for GrapheneOS due to various improvements
16:17:38 <strcat[m]> naribia: https://grapheneos.org/features
16:36:13 <naribia> strcat[m]: ok thanks. I have a pixel 5 I would love to get graphene OS working on, are there some resources I could use to maybe help get a pixel 5 image started?
16:37:21 <strcat[m]> naribia: https://grapheneos.org/build first learn how to build and sign releases
16:37:28 <strcat[m]> and then look into adding support for the Pixel 5 to android-prepare-vendor
16:40:34 <naribia> what is "android-prepare-vendor" ?
16:41:20 <strcat[m]> it extracts the vendor components from the factory images that are not provided by AOSP (well, ideally, in some cases we could be building things from AOSP that we aren't)
16:41:41 <strcat[m]> such as firmware, etc.
16:41:57 <strcat[m]> it's part of implementing device support for a given device
16:43:33 <naribia> ok so first build graphene os, then include vendor components from the factory images for the specific device?
16:43:52 <strcat[m]> first learn how to build GrapheneOS
16:43:59 <strcat[m]> you could do a build for the emulator and try running it
16:44:08 <strcat[m]> and then do a build for a real device that's already supported and sign it
16:44:32 <strcat[m]> and then you can start working on support for a new device
16:44:41 <strcat[m]> once you're familiar with the building and signing process
16:48:23 <arpysco[m]> ```Note that if you do not change the URL to your own domain, you must disable the Updater app before connecting the device to the internet, or you will be performing a denial of service attack on our official update server.```
16:48:54 <arpysco[m]> How many times have people accidentally dos'd you guys?
16:49:14 <strcat[m]> we dealt with it by not including the Updater app by default
16:49:21 <strcat[m]> that's explaining how to reproduce the official builds though
16:49:21 <arpysco[m]> Ah
16:49:33 <strcat[m]> in which case you have to include Updater to reproduce the build
16:49:51 <strcat[m]> and then... if you leave it as is and actually install that, it's going to try using our update server with an incompatible build of the OS signed with different keys
16:50:31 <arpysco[m]> Fun times
16:54:24 <shatteredsapphir> Heyo, anyone know if the 4a 5g will get support? Mainly avoiding the standard 4a because I figure it would run poorly with graphene like the 3a
16:54:57 <somenerd[m]> The 4a 5G is from the Pixel 5 line afaik
16:55:04 <arpysco[m]> My 4a is great with graphene
16:55:09 <louipc> shatteredsapphir: when people volunteer and commit to supporting it
16:55:29 <strcat[m]> shatteredsapphire: we'd like to have support for the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G but no one has started work on it, every device needs a device maintainer team to step up to the plate and develop/maintain support for it
16:55:40 <strcat[m]> 4a works well and is a much better device than the 3a
16:55:46 <shatteredsapphir> <arpysco[m] "My 4a is great with graphene"> Really? No noticeable lag like the 3a?
16:55:58 <strcat[m]> there isn't any noticeable lag on the 3a
16:56:12 <strcat[m]> I suggest reading our documentation explaining what GrapheneOS provides
16:56:15 <shatteredsapphir> <strcat[m] "4a works well and is a much bett"> Ah okay, I may just scoop up one of those since 5g is a gimmick atm
16:56:16 <arpysco[m]> Haven't tried the 3a
16:56:29 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#exec-spawning
16:56:41 <strcat[m]> shatteredsapphire: secure application spawning taking longer is not runtime lag
16:57:11 <strcat[m]> 3a has eMMC instead of UFS (i.e. it doesn't have a proper SSD) so storage access is a lot slower than the other devices (even the original Pixel 1 had UFS)
16:57:40 <strcat[m]> 4a has UFS so it doesn't have that problem of slow storage access like the 3a
16:57:46 <strcat[m]> but it doesn't cause lag on the 3a
16:57:50 <louipc> cost cutting?
16:58:07 <strcat[m]> it just makes storage access take longer, so launching an app takes longer sure, but there's no lag, the UI is still perfectly fluid etc
16:58:41 <strcat[m]> louipc: well the point of the `a` series is low cost
16:58:46 <strcat[m]> so the whole point is that they cut costs
16:58:51 <strcat[m]> 4a has UFS though
16:58:51 <anima[m]> that explains also a drastically faster flashing regarding sunfish
16:58:52 <shatteredsapphir> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/usage#exe"> Ah yes, the exec spawning issue is what I believe I was remembering. Not a lag so much as a slower app opening experience.
16:58:53 <louipc> ya
16:59:57 <strcat[m]> anima: yes the 3a went back to eMMC like the Nexus 5X / 6P
17:00:00 <strcat[m]> anima: Pixel 1 / Pixel 1 XL brought UFS
17:00:00 <shatteredsapphir> Looking forward to getting away from the one+6t
17:00:13 <strcat[m]> anima: I assume that UFS SSDs are substantially cheaper now which is why the 4a didn't do that
17:00:41 <anima[m]> 4a makes 3a look like a scam tbh
17:00:57 <anima[m]> 50 € / $ cheaper
17:00:58 <anima[m]> and better in every way
17:01:30 <strcat[m]> also their strange naming of the "4a 5G" is because it's a cheaper Pixel 5 rather than fully matching the specs and just having a smaller screen/battery
17:01:31 <strcat[m]> it's really bad naming
17:01:32 <strcat[m]> it's a lot different from the 4a
17:01:46 <strcat[m]> also they probably have a 5a planned as part of the regular `a` series release cycle
17:01:58 <shatteredsapphir> I hate that my current device has USB 2.0 transfer speeds. The 4a should be a good improvement there too
17:01:59 <strcat[m]> which is 6+ months later
17:02:01 <somenerd[m]> that's quite confusing
17:02:11 <strcat[m]> 4a 5G has the same SoC has the Pixel 5
17:02:11 <somenerd[m]> so the 4a 5G is an intermediary?
17:02:35 <strcat[m]> somenerd: it's an oddball I guess because they wanted to get 5G out in a lower end device
17:02:36 <strcat[m]> before the actual 5a
17:02:40 <somenerd[m]> odd naming though
17:02:44 <strcat[m]> they could have come up with better naming
17:02:54 <strcat[m]> or just called it the 5a
17:03:05 <strcat[m]> and called what they are going to call the 5a, the 5a+ or something
17:03:05 <somenerd[m]> 4.5a
17:03:13 <strcat[m]> 5a would be the best name
17:03:18 <somenerd[m]> yeah
17:03:23 <strcat[m]> but then they'd need a new name for what they are going to release as the 5a in 5 months
17:03:37 <strcat[m]> not too concerned about it
17:03:46 <strcat[m]> we make it clear in FAQ it's not supported yet
17:04:11 <strcat[m]> oh, also, due to pressure from US carriers, they included extra optional 5G functionality that's not useful in practice and probably adds $20 to the price of both
17:04:20 <strcat[m]> maybe it will become useful if it's deployed
17:04:43 <strcat[m]> but it's kinda weird to ship a hardware feature with probably no real use for years
17:04:48 <strcat[m]> that costs substantially more
17:05:45 <strcat[m]> also since the 4a was delayed for so long, the minimum guaranteed support time is comparable
17:06:54 <louipc> bell already launched 5G apparently?
17:18:17 <strcat[m]> btw what I mean is that they didn't just add 5G support
17:19:17 <strcat[m]> it's possible they split it for the 4a 5G
17:19:26 <strcat[m]> need to look at specs
17:20:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: I wonder if we can copy just BSP for 4 on 4a 5g kernel
17:20:22 <strcat[m]> mmWave is the optional feature they added to make US carriers happy
17:20:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might break though
17:20:37 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: not going to be doing that
17:20:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> But afaik 4.19 does have sm8150 support
17:23:58 <strcat[m]> not going to be doing that though
17:24:13 <strcat[m]> we have enough problems on our plate to resolve as is
17:28:57 <r0tt0r[m]> is there any way to force lock phone no matter if apps active?
17:29:43 <dwkr[m]> <eenno[m] "What are people's opinion on Aur"> I haven't tried it yet. I'll check it out.
17:29:51 <r0tt0r[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "is there any way to force lock p"> except press power button
17:36:12 <strcat[m]> pressing the power button is how you do it though
17:40:57 <arpysco[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "except press power button"> There's an app called Private Lock that locks after a violent movement by the phone, haven't tried it but I guess it's another way of locking
17:41:10 <naribia> strcat[m]: the FAQ says Pixel 5 is specifically not supported? https://grapheneos.org/faq
17:41:25 <strcat> naribia: it's not supported atm
17:41:28 <strcat> so that's accurate
17:41:34 <strcat> does not mean that we don't want to support it
17:41:56 <strcat[m]> and btw you can link to specific sections by clicking the header
17:41:58 <naribia> ok so its still possible to make a grapheneOS build that can be flashed to the pixel 5
17:42:12 <strcat[m]> like https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
17:42:18 <strcat[m]> naribia: yes but it takes work
17:42:23 <naribia> ah right sorry
17:43:06 <naribia> strcat[m] right, but doesn't seem too difficult? you just have to link up the pixel 5 vendor code to grapheneos build tree?
17:43:12 <strcat[m]> I'm working on making the site more easily machine readable atm to help search engines get better at guiding people to the right sections
17:43:21 <naribia> oh nice
17:43:21 <strcat[m]> naribia: have to add support for Pixel 5 to android-prepare-vendor as step 1
17:43:41 <strcat[m]> naribia: then port over the changes to device / kernel repos to Pixel 5 - but that's not *mandatory* just to get it running
17:44:29 <naribia> I see
17:46:15 <r0tt0r[m]> <arpysco[m] "There's an app called Private Lo"> ye i thought to use some auto tasker pressing power after some mins

17:59:48 <arpysco[m]> Never tried the stock OS 😎
17:59:55 <arpysco[m]> Other than to unlock bootloader ofx
18:07:13 <dwkr[m]> Cool
18:10:34 <dazinism> r0tt0r:if you want to lock after x minutes- can change the time for screen timeout in display settings and the time for lock after screen timeout in  screen lock settings
18:10:56 <strcat> I think what they want is to ignore screen wake locks such as by a movie player
18:11:03 <strcat> or a navigation app telling you where to go
18:11:10 <strcat> but I don't understand the use case
18:11:13 <strcat> just press power
18:11:32 <dazinism> Ah yeah...
18:14:19 <dazinism> Guess can find a media player that ignores that. If you couldnt find an android media player maybe something via termux?
18:15:02 <dazinism> By ignore I mean a player that doesnt keep the device from locking while its playing
18:15:26 <strcat> that's going to be super unusable though
18:17:58 <dazinism> Yeah
18:34:35 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat "just press power"> yep indeed. falling asleep wont be able to press :)

18:42:07 <strcat[m]> we'll see
18:43:03 <strcat[m]> each FAQ entry is marked as an article (which in HTML means a standalone section) to encourage search engines, etc. to extract them
18:43:17 <strcat[m]> among other overhauling of the site
18:50:00 <strcat[m]> in anticipation of expanding the FAQ a fair bit
18:50:16 <r0tt0r[m]> i feel the main page entry has somehow too much text. it should be a short quick first entry and an in depth , but its imho

19:34:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy strcat[m], I hear you are overhauling the FAQ, would you like me to start rebasing all my pull requests? I abandoned them because I wasn't sure if they were going to be used, but I can fix them back up again. I've learned a little bit more about git since.
19:34:27 <TheJollyRoger> (Also, message)
19:35:45 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: I'd just close all the current ones
19:35:51 <strcat[m]> and then open new ones when still relevant
19:35:52 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Close all current ones, OK!
19:35:55 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
19:35:55 <strcat[m]> not all are still needed
19:36:06 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a sec, I can do that for you from my end.
19:36:22 <TheJollyRoger> Also, uh, message for you.
19:46:04 <TheJollyRoger> There we go. Small twinge of sadness removing all those open PRs, but no biggie, information has a finite shelf life and an expiry date too and I've learned a lot since then. I removed all of them except the last one about browser fingerprinting.
19:46:44 <TheJollyRoger> pamachs[m]: Yarr harr! Welcome aboard the ship!
19:51:10 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: er, just let me know which ones you want again, okay? I'm keeping those branches for historical/archival purposes.

19:52:05 <TheJollyRoger> r0tt0r[m]: oh, hehehe, I haven't looked at it. I don't have commit access to GrapheneOS, I just send occasional PRs in for the FAQ. I can go check it out later though. Don't worry though, like...
19:52:10 <pamachs[m]> <TheJollyRoger "pamachs: Yarr harr! Welcome aboa"> Thank you sir!
19:52:54 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: you can reopen them
19:52:55 <TheJollyRoger> I had some PRs outstanding for a long time, sometimes it could be a while before someone gets around to merging or closing your changes, unfortunately.
19:53:00 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: just need to be overhauled for new FAQ
19:53:05 <strcat[m]> the ones that are relevant
19:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. I can do that. Er, which ones do you want the most?
19:53:20 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah. Uh let me get that last one then.

19:54:13 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: Sure, ok! We'll take that one step at a time. I'll go start looking at which ones I still need and get back to you on it.
19:54:44 <TheJollyRoger> r0tt0r[m]: rock on! Maybe I'll be able to send in another wallpaper sometime, I wasn't able to get my entry in because it was the wrong size >_<.

20:06:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I tried using imagemagick too. I think I got something crapped out but it wasn't very well optimized.
20:08:19 <r0tt0r[m]> ye aligning and merging can get tricky
20:11:04 <r0tt0r[m]> also for bootanimation i found out all images have to have upcounting numbers. before i thought each folder can have 0001.png -> 0100.png but following folders for 2nd or n-stage of boot needs counting up further
20:11:13 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow.
20:26:33 <r0tt0r[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah, I tried using imagemagick "> i made the logo not centre due time/date of lockscreen

21:36:08 <eenno[m]> Aha. Probably why my pr got closed/rejected. Haha.
21:37:13 <eenno[m]> So programmatically, you wouldn't manually save the frames as pngs but define each frame programmatically?

21:45:00 <eenno[m]> Nice! Thanks for the explanation. So when you say 'you cannot hide something inside that zip' does that mean that it's executed on the fly when the device is booting?
21:45:00 <eenno[m]> Or is the script actually just run by you once to generate the .zip that is then part of the gos image?

23:00:03 <eenno[m]> Yeah. I see. Just curious if maybe the plans for the logo changed or something.
23:14:37 <dannymckay> Hey
23:16:38 <r0tt0r[m]> <eenno[m] "Yeah. I see. Just curious if may"> ye the left side (maze) stay.the big logo and font didnt some fit but i wanted first get the wallpaper done the write the script to generate the maze and put the font with right font in better place
23:17:22 <r0tt0r[m]> * ye the left side (maze) stay.the big logo and font didnt some fit but i wanted first get the wallpaper done then write the script to generate the maze and put the font with right font in better place
23:18:50 <r0tt0r[m]> <eenno[m] "Yeah. I see. Just curious if may"> oh or did you mean gos logo in general?
23:27:29 <abumubarak[m]> New here. I have a question. I have graphene on Verizon. But after reading some of the comments. I am afraid to leave. Maybe a new carrier won't accept my 3aXL. Are my fears unfounded?
23:29:09 <TheJollyRoger> abumubarak[m]: GrapheneOS will support any carrier that your handset supports that does not require privileged management drivers. Sprint is the biggest offender here. It's safe to assume that so long as your carrier allows for bringing your own device, you should be perfectly fine.
23:30:10 <abumubarak[m]> I was thinking Visible, but earlier someone said they had major problems
23:30:29 <abumubarak[m]> Thanks for the response Jolly
23:30:33 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. Well, stick around and hopefully someone with experience should be able to chime in!
23:31:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, what really determines what the phone talks to is actually the modem. Although GrapheneOS will load and initialize the software in the phone's radios, the chip in the radio runs the same software which is signed by Qualcomm, regardless of what operating system your phone is running.
23:33:07 <naribia> hello I'm trying to compile graphene os kernel for blueline (pixel 3) and it ends up crashing with ../scripts/link-vmlinux.sh: line 93: 107588 Killed
23:33:12 <naribia> and then make error 137
23:33:18 <TheJollyRoger> So if you're in doubt, you should ask your carrier "Can I bring my own phone? It's a Pixel..."
23:33:26 <TheJollyRoger> naribia: how much memory does the machine have?
23:33:29 <naribia> my computer grinds almost to a halt,
23:33:35 <naribia> 16gb
23:34:21 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I think you're going to need a bit more memory than that unfortunately. I was building in a VM and started hitting that error a lot until I added more.
23:34:26 <dwkr[m]> User "dannymckay". Is that a potential troll? I noticed a lot of blocked accts that were pretending to be Daniel or their handle was a play on his name.
23:35:24 <treesa24[m]> has anyone had problems installing graphene os on a google pixel 4a? I tried to and my computer recognizes the pixel 4a when I plug it in, but then once I type the command 'adb reboot bootloader' it stops being able to recognize my device. I tried doing the automatic stuff through device manager to update drivers but it didn't work. I also tried downloading drivers from the internet that said they were for the google
23:35:24 <treesa24[m]> pixel 4a and it didn't work.
23:35:24 <TheJollyRoger> Might be.
23:35:49 <TheJollyRoger> @ dwkr[m]
23:36:30 <TheJollyRoger> treesa24[m]: I don't have a 4a at the moment, maybe someone else will be able to chime in?
23:36:38 <dwkr[m]> 🤔🤷‍♂️
23:37:08 <TheJollyRoger> abumubarak[m]: If they support stock pixels via bring-your-own-device, then GrapheneOS should work...
23:39:32 <dwkr[m]> <treesa24[m] "has anyone had problems installi"> Device manager stops recognizing?
23:41:21 <dwkr[m]> I did need to install Google USB drivers for everything to work, but you are like a step-ish away from the install.
23:41:21 <treesa24[m]> sorrowgalaxies: it puts it under the category of 'other devices' and says it doesn't have the proper drivers for it
23:42:04 <dwkr[m]> Are you able to continue with the install instructions though, after "adb reboot bootloader"?
23:42:50 <treesa24[m]> no because it just infinitely says 'waiting for device'
23:43:05 <treesa24[m]> i am trying to follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc so i downloaded the stuff he said to download
23:43:52 <ziq> Are you by any chance trying to use  adb after rebooting into bootloader? That won't work.
23:44:31 <dwkr[m]> Try to follow the instructions here: https://grapheneos.org/install
23:44:31 <dwkr[m]> Both of the popular ur videos for GOS install are known to cause issues
23:44:42 <treesa24[m]> oh fr
23:45:32 <dwkr[m]> That youtuber, Techlore, did post a follow up video mentioning some of the issues users found following the one you linked. It might be helpful.
23:45:58 <treesa24[m]> oh really, ok thats good, i had trouble understanding the install guide on its own b/c im not that experienced with this stuff
23:47:39 <dwkr[m]> You're not alone.
23:49:39 <dwkr[m]> IIRC that guide is for Windows, I would opt to figure out how to use Powershell instead of command line as the official GOS guide suggests. I did need to install Google USB drivers to get everything to work for my install, which I think was the only thing not suggested in the official guide that I found necessary.
23:53:12 <treesa24[m]> i will try powershell, im thinking that's the issue as it recognizes my device before i run commands so
23:53:51 <treesa24[m]> thanks guys ! 🐥
