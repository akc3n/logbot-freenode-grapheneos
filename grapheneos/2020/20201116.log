04:33:19 <louipc> oops
05:38:59 <letrain> As pixel 2xl is the oldest device you support... What does "Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL support will now be provided via separate extended support releases for obsolete devices. " Mean? I know google official ends support in December.
05:40:51 <louipc> It means they won't be on the same patch-level as other devices
05:42:11 <letrain> So there will no updates of grapheneos after December? Or will there be limited patches? Or will support also end from graphene?
05:43:36 <letrain> I'm familiar with lineageos which continues support into eternity it seems. But seeing is how google is an end of life and my phone is still full operational I'd like to keep it as long as possible. Sorry just new to grapheneos.
05:44:04 <louipc> i believe if security fixes stop being available then grapheneos will end support
05:45:04 <letrain> Yeah it's confusing with the  "via seperate extended support releases"
05:45:10 <louipc> because the maintenance burden will be too high, and the device will start to accumulate known vulnerabilities
05:46:22 <letrain> So it sounds like there will be support of some kind. Lineageosight be enough for me. Just looking to de-google and checking options.
05:46:26 <louipc> i think because google ends support, but then security fixes may still be available
05:46:33 <letrain> Ok
05:47:46 <louipc> while other devices will continue to move ahead in features as well as security, the pixel 2 will be stuck on a certain android revision
05:47:52 <letrain> Well worse case is I move graphene. Then have to move to something else. I know with lineage os and other custom roms it's pretty much only security patches and maybe custom rom features that get updates. The only one with hardware updates ever after official support ended was my galaxy nexus because of omap project.
05:49:05 <letrain> I can see that.
05:49:38 <letrain> I'd hope I don't need a new phone until this one ha no battery life left or destroyed
05:50:21 <letrain> Thanks for the help. I haven't been on irc since 2004.
05:50:30 <louipc> nice
06:51:01 <gibsms[m]> Hi.  I'm trying to install GrapheneOS (using the installation guide), however keep getting the following error when flashing the factory images - "fastboot too old; please download the latest version at... ". However when I check the fastboot version It says 'fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874' which I believe is the latest.   Could someone please direct me where I should look for help?  Reddit, xda developers, here?  I'm
06:51:01 <gibsms[m]> not a developer, just trying to de-google my life, so any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.  Sorry if this is the wrong forum to ask this question..
06:53:38 <TheJollyRoger> Hi gibsms[m], you've come to the right place.
06:54:00 <TheJollyRoger> Just a sec and let me check a little something first.
06:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, so, first up, do you have any other versions of fastboot installed on your computer?
06:56:27 <TheJollyRoger> (Also, what operating system are you running?)
06:57:16 <gibsms[m]> Great!  Thanks for your help.
06:58:10 <gibsms[m]> I've tried on two Windows 10 machines, both with the same error.  One machine is new, so I doubt it would have another version of fastboot installed.
06:58:10 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, well, I can't guarntee that I'll be the right person to help you, but you've come to the right place!
06:59:29 <TheJollyRoger> Windows 10, okay, and you're running Powershell, right? (I'm just running through a quick checklists of sanity checks)
07:00:16 <TheJollyRoger> *a quick checklist
07:01:35 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just downloading one of the releases now so I can test this on a Windows 10 machine.
07:01:51 <gibsms[m]> CMD
07:02:51 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, could you try it in Powershell? The legacy CMD shell shouldn't be used, the installer warns against this.
07:02:59 <TheJollyRoger> I strongly suspect this may be your problem.
07:05:23 <gibsms[m]> I might need some help.  In powershell, when I type 'cd (my directory here)' I get an error that says - "A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument 'platform'.
07:06:10 <gibsms[m]> I can't get to the correct folder in powershell, as I would type it in cmd
07:06:23 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. PowerShell behaves a tiny bit differently than cmd does in that it behaves like a UNIX shell - it will parse the spaces as separate strings.
07:06:44 <TheJollyRoger> If you're moving to a directory that's titled "My Directory" you're going to want to type:
07:06:55 <TheJollyRoger> cd "My Directory"
07:06:58 <TheJollyRoger> and not:
07:07:00 <TheJollyRoger> cd My Directory
07:07:03 <TheJollyRoger> Or you will get an error.
07:07:17 <TheJollyRoger> Give that a try?
07:08:09 <gibsms[m]> thanks, that worked.  Now shoud I type the word 'flash-all.bat'?
07:08:47 <TheJollyRoger> Assuming you've got everything ready and fastboot can see the device, you've checked everything else, yes, run flash-all.bat from PowerShell.
07:10:49 <gibsms[m]> I get the error - The term 'flash-all.bat' is not recognised as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.  Check the spelling of the name.......
07:11:50 <mrxx_0[m]> gibsms: Did you enter just "flash-all.bat" or "./flash-all.bat" ?
07:11:54 <TheJollyRoger> Look near the bottom of the error message, does it offer a suggestion?
07:12:15 <TheJollyRoger> It may need you to run ".\flash-all.bat" to indicate that flash-all.bat is in the directory you're currently in.
07:12:21 <TheJollyRoger> Your working directory is indicated by the .
07:13:19 <gibsms[m]> just "flash-all.bat".  "./flash-all.bat" didn't work either unfortunately.
07:13:58 <TheJollyRoger> Did it say something like Suggestion [3, General]: the command [command] was not found, but it does exist in the current location" ?
07:14:04 <TheJollyRoger> If not, then you're not in the right directory.
07:14:13 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to change your working directory to where flash-all.bat is .
07:15:10 <TheJollyRoger> You can hit tab for autocompletion if so, and type in "Get-Childitem flash-all.bat" to see if it's there. If "Get-Childitem flash-all.bat" returns an error, you're in the wrong place.
07:15:15 <gibsms[m]> Actually. ".flash-all.bat" gives a slightly different error message.  It add's the line - $version=fastboot --version; try { $verNum = $version[0].substring(17 ...
07:16:20 <TheJollyRoger> gibsms[m]: can you set your working directory to where flash-all.bat is located? (Remember, I'm flying blind here, so unless I know what you're doing and where you are, I'm just guessing)
07:16:51 <TheJollyRoger> (Also, you haven't moved any of the files you unzipped from the .zip file, have you? Just to confirm)
07:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> If you get ahead of me, I can't help you.
07:17:03 <dar_gomml[m]> what reference location does the night light function use to get the sunrise/sunset times? because it is already 0816 here and it is still on(sunrise was about an hour ago).
07:17:45 <gibsms[m]> I typed in "Get-Childitem flash-all.bat".  It came back with a message that includes the words '1902 flash-all.bat'
07:20:18 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, give me a moment here.
07:21:51 <TheJollyRoger> The command ".flash-all.bat" without a \ between the . and the f should return a "command not found" error.
07:23:59 <strcat[m]> dar_gomml: it's location-based and doesn't work well due to us not having a coarse location service to quickly get an approximate location
07:25:54 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, what on earth seems to be going on here, it's working for me. gibsms[m], could you paste the whole error message?
07:26:10 <gibsms[m]> If I type ".flash-all.bat" the error message says 'The term'.flash-all.bat' is not recognised as the name....
07:27:03 <gibsms[m]> if I type ".\flash-all.bat" the error message says 'The term 'fastboot' is not recognised as the name...
07:27:43 <TheJollyRoger> Ok NOW we're talking, the second command you've typed is correct, but you haven't added fastboot to your command path.
07:27:52 <gibsms[m]> I'm using two computers unfortunately.  I can test on the machine I'm typing on to cut and paste.  Just need to set it up first
07:28:24 <gibsms[m]> There is a fastboot application file in the same folder.  Is that what you are referring to?
07:28:39 <TheJollyRoger> gibsms[m]: you need to add fastboot to your command path. ".\flash-all.bat" is correct.
07:29:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, you will need to add fastboot to your command path, that's why it's giving you "fastboot is not recognized"
07:30:07 <TheJollyRoger> If you've unzipped fastboot to your working directory, then you need to add that directory to your command path.
07:30:17 <TheJollyRoger> Note - NOT platform tools within your working directory.
07:31:47 <TheJollyRoger> If you're positive that fastboot.exe is in your working directory (you can verify with "Get-Childitem fastboot.exe"), then try "$env:Path = "$pwd;$env:Path"
07:35:16 <TheJollyRoger> This will set the environment variable "Path" to your working directory, *plus* what "Path" was before.
07:35:21 <TheJollyRoger> For that Powershell session.
07:35:28 <gibsms[m]> The first command came back with a message that includes '1397248 fastboot.exe'.  Unfortunately, the second command didn't do anything.
07:35:35 <TheJollyRoger> It won't.
07:35:37 <TheJollyRoger> At least,
07:35:40 <TheJollyRoger> it won't give you any feedback.
07:35:53 <gibsms[m]> ok, cool.
07:36:08 <TheJollyRoger> try "fastboot" now in that same powershell window.
07:36:20 <TheJollyRoger> See if it returns "fastboot: no usage"
07:36:25 <TheJollyRoger> or "fastboot --version"
07:36:51 <TheJollyRoger> And let's see if "fastboot --version" returns the answer you want.
07:37:02 <gibsms[m]> I got 'fastboot: usage: no command'
07:37:08 <TheJollyRoger> Excellent.
07:37:31 <gibsms[m]> 'fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874'
07:37:57 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. If you're phone's plugged in and waiting at fastboot with the bootloader unlocked and ready, try "fastboot devices" and see if it sees it.
07:38:54 <TheJollyRoger> If it does, then try the flash all script.
07:39:11 <gibsms[m]> It came back with '0A0.....  fastboot'
07:39:19 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Run it.
07:40:18 <gibsms[m]> you mean ".\flash-all.bat" again?
07:40:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
07:40:47 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure that phone's plugged in nice and tight and the cable isn't going to fall out.
07:41:21 <gibsms[m]> Fantastic!!  It is installing (I think)
07:41:28 <TheJollyRoger> Here we go!
07:42:00 <gibsms[m]> Thank you so much for your help!
07:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime! I like to test boot the phone in unlocked mode first, to make sure it's working, then reboot it to fastboot and lock the bootloader again.
07:42:43 <gibsms[m]> Was typing "$env:Path = "$pwd;$env:Path" the crucial part to get it working?
07:42:58 <TheJollyRoger> You'll see an orange "SOFTWARE INTEGRITY NOT GUARANTEED!" error to show you that your bootloader is open.
07:43:20 <gibsms[m]> Ok, I will test it first and then lock the bootloader again.
07:43:34 <TheJollyRoger> After locking, you'll see that yellow "Your phone is loading a different operating system" warning, to let you know that the phone is loading GrapheneOS, rather than the regular Google Android, but that yellow screen is a *good sign*
07:43:48 <TheJollyRoger> It means that the Verified Boot is on and enforcing and the bootloader is locked.
07:44:05 <TheJollyRoger> It just means that the phone is loading a system that's signed and verified, but it isn't Googles'.
07:45:06 <TheJollyRoger> After the phone has been rebooted and you're past the launcher, you can use attestation.app and the auditor app to audit your device via remote attestation and the attestation server.
07:46:35 <TheJollyRoger> Auditor uses the Android Remote Attestation to verify the entire operating system image, all at once, back to the keys that signed the releases and verifies the system image at boot time.
07:47:21 <TheJollyRoger> So if even one bit is changed from the system image, it will produce an incorrect result and the attestation server can catch it red handed.
07:47:27 <TheJollyRoger> (Note that this doesn't work if the bootloader is unlocked!)
07:49:53 <TheJollyRoger> The "$env:Path" command was a part of it. We needed the computer to be in Powershell first, then we needed the computer to recognize where fastboot was. the command that began with $env:Path simply pointed Powershell to search in the working directory, where, coincidentially, fastboot had been stored.
07:50:28 <TheJollyRoger> It looked like you'd done the same for cmd, just, when we switched to Powershell, Powershell is different than cmd.
07:50:37 <gibsms[m]> Thank you for all that extra information and advice.  It looks like it has installed successfully.  Will check that its working correctly, lock the bootloader again and use the auditor app.  Thank you again for all your help!!  Goodbye google 🙂
07:51:23 <TheJollyRoger> Hey, anytime man. If you find GrapheneOS useful, (or want to help the project) send the devs a donation, donations fund this project and keep it going!
07:51:26 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
07:51:33 <gibsms[m]> Ok, I will write down the steps incase I have to do it again.
07:51:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, don't forget to lock the bootloader, that's one of the most important parts of the installation.
07:51:56 <TheJollyRoger> gibsms[m]: Great!
07:52:24 <briaruser[m]> Hello friends! Anyone knowa if there is a way to get notifications working for the messenger app Wickr Me?
07:52:53 <TheJollyRoger> Each installation of GrapheneOS is bitwise identical across every single respective device, and signed and verified such, locking the bootloader allows it to be verified to known good condition upon every time you reboot your phone.
07:53:41 <gibsms[m]> Will send a donation.  The work you all do is for a great cause.
07:54:16 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy briaruser[m], if WickrMe is dependent upon push notifications and does not have a fallback to run without Google Software Frameworks, it's likely that the easiest way to get notifications would be to go to the developers of Wickr Me and either beg them, petition them, berate them, or coerce them into writing their app to fall back to a foreground service with proper battery life
07:54:18 <TheJollyRoger> optimizations to behave without it.
07:54:34 <TheJollyRoger> gibsms[m]: Yarr, welcome aboard the good ship GrapheneOS!
07:54:46 <TheJollyRoger> With a yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!
07:54:55 <gibsms[m]> Ok, I'll go and finish setting up the phone.  Sounds straight forward from here.   Glad I found this chat room.  All the best TheJollyRoger.
07:55:09 <TheJollyRoger> Aye! Fare thee well!
08:07:29 <briaruser[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ahoy briaruser, if WickrMe is de"> Tnx for your reply!
08:17:49 <dar_gomml[m]> <strcat[m] "dar_gomml: it's location-based a"> thx, i'll use custom schedule instead 👍
10:05:46 <auspiciouslink[m> 👋Greetings! Relative n00b here, using GrapheneOS since ~March. Tech level is "took me four tries, but I DID install it--and then realized I was deeper in the FOSS waters than I expected, and have really enjoyed learning like crazy to figure things out" 😄
10:05:46 <auspiciouslink[m> Looking forward to learning from other people's experiences, but am likelier to ask more questions than provide answers!

12:30:42 <tom_co[m]> TheJollyRoger: louipc dazinism  Thanks guys, I tried everything you said one more time and it helped. Not sure what was the problem but the GPS works now 👍
14:55:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys we still need more people to help combat misinformation that is being spread about grapheneos. Please pm me if you can help
14:56:48 <bed[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Guys we still need more people t"> What misinformation?
14:59:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> <bed[m] "What misinformation?"> Mostly comes from James and copperhead, they spread misinformation about grapheneos and slander the lead dev
14:59:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> But there are other people who fall prey for them
14:59:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> And there are still many who don't know that grapheneos is the continuation of the original
15:09:16 <renex> About Osmand and voice prompts, is there something special that needs to be done to get it working on GOS? I've got rhvoice installed
15:34:33 <nscnt> renex: Please move your question to #grapheneos-offtopic
18:53:01 <r0tt0r[m]> i just read through freenode logs from graphene channel, this shit against graphene/daniel is going since long time, stay strong and keep faith.
19:51:46 <Forbo[m]> I tried searching on the site as well as the chat history here, but couldn't find any information, wondering if anyone here knows: Does GrapheneOS use Google's SUPL servers for A-GPS? I think upstream AOSP does, but haven't seen anything indicating that GrapheneOS differs in that regard.
19:53:28 <strcat[m]> it's a carrier configuration thing
19:53:43 <strcat[m]> and it's not something that the OS does
