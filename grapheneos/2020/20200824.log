00:54:16 <headgas[m]> Anyone interested in a perfect Pixel 4xl?
00:54:47 <cn3m[m]> headgas: please take this to the off topic channel
00:55:03 <cn3m[m]> https://matrix.to/#/!NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=privacytools.io&via=tchncs.de
00:55:03 <headgas[m]> I don't know how to go to different channels
01:58:31 <brenneke[m]> How do I find and get to the off topic channel on Riot?
01:58:58 <nikitalita[m]1> click that link? does it not work?
01:59:32 <brenneke[m]> Nein.
01:59:56 <nikitalita[m]1> which version of the riot client are you using? web? the electron app? mobile?
02:00:09 <brenneke[m]> Mobile
02:02:30 <brenneke[m]> Curious why it doesn't come up in global search.....?
02:03:28 <nikitalita[m]1> Hmm, works for me on mobile
02:04:19 <nikitalita[m]1> what is the version number that you see when you go to settings->help&about
02:09:55 <brenneke[m]> 0.9.12
02:10:43 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, that's way out of date, please update to the new version; riot is called "element" now, so you might have to search for that on whatever app store you're using
02:29:05 <brenneke[m]> Thanks. Am signed into Element now, link still does not work.
02:29:47 <brenneke[m]> "Not implemented yet in Element"
02:31:35 <nikitalita[m]1> this is so strange; a number of people have been complaining about these links not working
02:31:56 <nikitalita[m]1> https://matrix.to/#/!NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org
02:32:05 <nikitalita[m]1> brenneke: try that link
02:33:10 <brenneke[m]> Same not implemented message
02:34:03 <nikitalita[m]1> oh, wait, I see
02:34:06 <brenneke[m]> Why does it not come up in search like GrapheneOS does?
02:34:13 <nikitalita[m]1> those links don't work on mobile if you're not already in the room
02:34:21 <nikitalita[m]1> brenneke: it's not listed publicly
02:35:46 <brenneke[m]> OK....so now what?
02:36:04 <nikitalita[m]1> trying to figure this out, one moment
02:36:08 <nikitalita[m]1> I mostly use the desktop client
02:41:54 <nikitalita[m]1> ok, I cannot figure this out; there doesn't seem to be another way to create a sharable room link
02:42:26 <nikitalita[m]1> anyone else know how to do this on mobile?
02:43:43 <nikitalita[m]1> I think part of the problem is that #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org is an irc bridged room
02:43:45 <nikitalita[m]1> wait
02:44:10 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Type this:
02:44:14 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> `/join`
02:44:27 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Then copy paste:
02:44:31 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
02:45:09 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Enter it, would probably work for older clients
02:46:12 <nikitalita[m]1> yes, finally
02:46:17 <brenneke[m]> All on same line?
02:46:28 <nikitalita[m]1> `#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org`
02:46:32 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Yes
02:46:36 <nikitalita[m]1> something a bit easier to copy and paste
02:48:16 <nikitalita[m]1> `/join #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org`
02:49:08 <nikitalita[m]1> we should just tell people to copy and paste that to join it now when they ask
02:57:05 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Doesn't work always
02:57:15 <nikitalita[m]1> oh yeah? doesn't work on some third-party clients?
02:57:19 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> '/join' has to be typed
02:57:34 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> For those client that support '/join' command
02:57:59 <nikitalita[m]1> mmmm
02:58:14 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Sometimes, it does not recognize the command
02:58:19 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Just to be on the safe side
02:58:29 <nikitalita[m]1> maybe we'd have to provide both the link and the command
02:59:17 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Yeah
02:59:46 <bson989[m]> What is the best way to reinstall grapheneos? Do I need to go back to stock OS or can I just wipe everything and reflash?
03:00:12 <bson989[m]> Using Ubuntu
03:02:26 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <bson989[m] "What is the best way to reinstal"> No need
03:02:33 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Just backup, reflash
03:02:38 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Reflashing should wipe it?
03:04:18 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Just backup, reflash (GrapheneOS)
03:04:30 <nikitalita[m]1> bson989: also, when you're going through the instructions again, if you get confused at some place, just ask here
03:04:49 <nikitalita[m]1> I'm curious to see where people are getting tripped up
03:06:00 <bson989[m]> Okay thank you good to know
03:12:29 <bson989[m]> Okay well I'm not going to attempt it tonight but Is signify what you use to verify the factory images
03:12:44 <nikitalita[m]1> yes
03:12:56 <bson989[m]> I think that part is confusing to me because at the beginning it says obtain signify and then towards the end it wants you to verify the factory images
03:13:00 <nikitalita[m]1> and now I'm realizing we totally forgot to help the guy who was asking about it last night
03:13:33 <nikitalita[m]1> bson989: what OS are you using?
03:13:49 <bson989[m]> And I don't really understand what that is for is that basically so you know you have a legit copy
03:14:12 <bson989[m]> Ubuntu 20.04
03:14:20 <nikitalita[m]1> it checks to see if the image's signature matches the developer
03:14:22 <bson989[m]> The lite version
03:14:50 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, you can get it by typing `sudo apt install signify-openbsd`
03:15:12 <bson989[m]> Yes I just figured that out today but it's too late now
03:15:21 <bson989[m]> I thought it could be done after the fact
03:18:04 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, you don't wanna skip that step
03:18:36 <bson989[m]> Also I'm pretty sure the first time it didn't work because of this error that they listed in troubleshooting-A common issue on Linux distributions is that they mount the default temporary file directory /tmp as tmpfs which results in it being backed by memory and swap rather than persistent storage. By default, the size is 50% of the available virtual memory. This is often not enough for the flashing process,
03:18:36 <bson989[m]> especially since /tmp is shared between applications and users. To use a different temporary directory if your /tmp doesn't have enough space available:
03:19:48 <bson989[m]> So ran this command TMPDIR="$PWD/tmp" ./flash-all.sh
03:20:11 <nikitalita[m]1> bson989: that's not the case on stock ubuntu 20.04
03:21:20 <bson989[m]> mkdir tmp.  Should I have ran this command first?
03:21:28 <bson989[m]> Because I left that out
03:21:47 <nikitalita[m]1> yes
03:22:01 <nikitalita[m]1> what happened when you ran that command?
03:22:43 <bson989[m]> Well it worked after that
03:22:58 <bson989[m]> Even though I left that first line out
03:23:12 <bson989[m]> Is there a way to save the progress in terminal
03:23:23 <bson989[m]> I thought I saved it so I could go back and see the errors but I must not have
03:23:24 <nikitalita[m]1> save the progress?
03:23:59 <marlow11[m]> Can save a log if you use something like tmux
03:25:01 <bson989[m]> I think the biggest problem is I haven't used Linux in a very long time and I'm rusty. I don't have access to anything past Windows 7 right now. So I just need to familiarize myself more with Linux and the terminal
03:26:42 <bson989[m]> This is why I asked before if just the fact that graphene is running is that proof everything installed correctly?
03:26:55 <bson989[m]> Because I did have a lot of unstability at first
03:27:25 <nikitalita[m]1> I dunno, that might be indicative of any number of things; i personally haven't had any problems on a pixel 2 or a pixel 4
03:28:32 <bson989[m]> Instability*
03:28:33 <nikitalita[m]1> reflashing might help, it couldn't hurt at least as long has you have everything backed up
03:29:04 <bson989[m]> I'm not worried about backing anything up I haven't got that far into it
03:29:40 <bson989[m]> It is a pixel 3
03:31:03 <bson989[m]> If the verifying process with signify is so easy and important then why do all the videos online skip that part
03:31:12 <nikitalita[m]1> actually, can you do this in the terminal: `cat mtab | grep tmp`
03:31:21 <nikitalita[m]1> ech
03:31:23 <nikitalita[m]1> not that
03:31:36 <nikitalita[m]1> do this in the terminal: `cat /etc/mtab | grep tmp`
03:31:46 <bson989[m]> Okay
03:31:52 <nikitalita[m]1> and see if anything is mounted at /tmp
03:32:23 <bson989[m]> Well I went back to the tmp folder on my computer and nothing is in there
03:33:22 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, but I just wanna see if you actually have a memory/swap partition for "/tmp"
03:33:51 <bson989[m]> Okay I guess I can go fired it up real quick and check
03:34:07 <nikitalita[m]1> oh, you're not on it right now?
03:34:49 <nikitalita[m]1> eh, don't worry about it then; when you pick it up again later, just check that
03:35:07 <bson989[m]> I am now
03:35:15 <nikitalita[m]1> ok
03:35:50 <bson989[m]> What is that character you have before grep
03:36:07 <bson989[m]> Does that just mean next line
03:36:19 <bson989[m]> Like I said I don't really know how to use terminal
03:36:19 <nikitalita[m]1> |, the pipe sigil, it's on the backslash key
03:36:39 <bson989[m]> Got it
03:37:18 <bson989[m]> Command not found
03:37:28 <bson989[m]> Is there a space after grep
03:38:24 <nikitalita[m]1> `cat /etc/mtab | grep /tmp`
03:38:29 <nikitalita[m]1> copy and paste that
03:39:54 <nikitalita[m]1> `cat` is used to output a file to stdout, `|` tells the previous command to pipe stdout to the following command, `grep` searches for patterns and outputs the lines that match a given pattern
03:40:28 <nikitalita[m]1> `/etc/mtab` is the list of mounted file systems on the system
03:40:39 <bson989[m]> Okay what do you want to know
03:40:51 <nikitalita[m]1> did it output anything?
03:41:09 <bson989[m]> I typed it both ways you told me and got two different outcomes
03:41:31 <nikitalita[m]1> ok, just copy and paste the output here
03:42:30 <bson989[m]> Well I'm on two different devices so I have to type it
03:42:39 <bson989[m]> That second command came up with this
03:43:24 <bson989[m]> Tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,noatime 0 0
03:43:37 <nikitalita[m]1> yep
03:43:56 <bson989[m]> That first command is a whole list of stuff
03:44:15 <nikitalita[m]1> ok, you do have a memory/swap partition mounted as /tmp, so that is why you were having problems in the first place
03:44:15 <bson989[m]> 0 looks like it's giving partition size
03:44:25 <nikitalita[m]1>  * ok, you do have a memory/swap partition mounted as /tmp, so that is why you were having problems in the first place (probably)
03:44:27 <bson989[m]> Or folder size
03:44:58 <bson989[m]> Okay is there a way to correct this for future
03:45:09 <nikitalita[m]1> just curious, when you installed ubuntu 20.04, did you enable full disk encryption?
03:45:31 <bson989[m]> Yeah I was thinking about that too I thought that might have something to do with it but I can't remember
03:45:54 <bson989[m]> I believe so
03:46:06 <bson989[m]> What are the options that might help me remember
03:46:19 <nikitalita[m]1> eh, its not that important
03:46:28 <nikitalita[m]1> well
03:46:29 <nikitalita[m]1> for this case
03:46:39 <nikitalita[m]1> for security in general, it's important
03:47:37 <bson989[m]> Is there a way to verify that
03:47:56 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, I'm looking that up now
03:51:51 <nikitalita[m]1> bson989: type `cryptsetup status`, don't press enter, press tab a couple of times, see what devices it lists
03:53:17 <bson989[m]> Nothing
03:53:24 <nikitalita[m]1> y
03:53:24 <bson989[m]> Pressed tab twice
03:53:28 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, then you don't have it enabled
03:53:44 <bson989[m]> It just stopped after that
03:55:31 <bson989[m]> You're saying that means I did not run disc encryption
03:55:37 <nikitalita[m]1> I think that may be why a memory/swap partition is mounted as /tmp; ubuntu may also just automatically do that for certain systems, I dunno
03:56:07 <nikitalita[m]1> Yes, it doesn't look like you enabled disc encryption when you installed
03:56:37 <bson989[m]> Well I am on a very recent install so I could just reinstall Ubuntu if you think that would be wise
03:56:49 <bson989[m]> I'm not worried about losing any data
03:58:00 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, if you're intending to use this regularly, i'd do that
03:58:09 <bson989[m]> Do you think being lubuntu has anything to do with jt
03:58:14 <bson989[m]> It*
03:58:41 <nikitalita[m]1> eh, probably not
03:58:58 <nikitalita[m]1> the variant ubuntu versions generally don't mess with the installer
03:59:00 <renlord> pls take this offline
03:59:17 <nikitalita[m]1> okey doke
03:59:19 <nikitalita[m]1> #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
03:59:20 <renlord> how big to set your tmpfs is not a #grapheneos issue
04:04:58 <bson989[m]> Is there a better place to discuss this
04:05:10 <bson989[m]> ?
04:05:20 <nikitalita[m]1> the offtopic channel that i just linked
04:05:31 <bson989[m]> IC
04:05:44 <renlord> bson989[m]: are you having trouble installing graphene os?
04:07:16 <bson989[m]> Yes
04:07:42 <bson989[m]> Okay how do I get that link to work
04:10:02 <nikitalita[m]1> <bson989[m] "Okay is there a way to correct t"> so now that we've confirmed that you have a tmpfs /tmp, and that you were having issues the first time when running `./flash-all.sh`, you should use the commands that are written in the guide in troubleshooting instead of just `./flash-all.sh` https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting
04:10:40 * nikitalita[m]1 sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/AcmuJoNMDSiwhLyepMEWSPXd/message.txt >
04:11:00 <bson989[m]> So they are two separate commands

Is there a supported way to install signify on windows?
04:49:44 <nikitalita[m]1> there's this, but it seems to be pretty out of date:
04:49:45 <nikitalita[m]1> https://github.com/stoeckmann/signify-windows
05:04:58 <nikitalita[m]1> yes, but it's dependent on getting a maintainer for them

05:09:15 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> When i click your link (:
05:09:39 <nikitalita[m]1> and the join command didn't work? I dunno then, not familiar with RiotX
05:10:37 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> <nikitalita[m]1 "and the join command didn't work"> No, what App are you using?
05:11:49 <nikitalita[m]1> I'm just using the official Element clients on desktop and mobile
05:13:16 <nikitalita[m]1> <futurenewsplz[m] "Cool what does a maintainer have"> a lot of technical things; i'm not a maintainer or a dev on this so i can't say exactly what, you'd have to ask them when they're around
05:16:00 <nikitalita[m]1>  * /join #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
05:20:23 <nikitalita[m]1> I've used it on both the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 4, performance is good across both
05:21:47 <nikitalita[m]1> i only used the pixel 2 for normal stuff like browsing and messages, i can't speak to stuff like gaming, but I didn't notice anything like UI lag
05:22:06 <nikitalita[m]1> i used retroarch on pixel 4, performance was good on that for 3d games
05:22:59 <nikitalita[m]1> the main thing is that you can't use play store apps that require google play services
05:24:01 <renlord> bson989[m]: can you send your logs
05:24:45 <renlord> paste them in 0bin.net or something
05:24:55 <nikitalita[m]1> It's difficult to say exactly what apps actually require them to be used though, and it's not always obvious; some may just complain and not show notifications, some may just break entirely.
05:26:57 <nikitalita[m]1> Not off the top of my head
05:27:49 <nikitalita[m]1> you can search the logs in here for apps that you're interested in though, look in the topic
05:28:50 <nikitalita[m]1> for me personally, I'm just not using any proprietary apps. I'm only using open source apps, most of which I get from F-droid
05:30:17 <nikitalita[m]1> the pixel 2 i was using had a busted mic
05:31:55 <nikitalita[m]1> i'd recommend reading the faq and the recommended device section in particular: https://grapheneos.org/faq
05:34:21 <nikitalita[m]1> oh, the rules link seems to be down
05:49:50 <nikitalita[m]1> if you're using the desktop or web client, click this link: https://matrix.to/#/!NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org

05:50:18 <nikitalita[m]1> /join #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
05:59:37 <nikitalita[m]1> I just tested it and it worked for me on mobile after leaving the room; try it again and make sure its correct, also try closing and reopening the app after doing it
05:59:51 <nikitalita[m]1> is this ios or android?
06:01:20 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, if those things don't work, I don't know, you might wanna just temporarily use the web client on a desktop to open that link
06:40:40 <smashingclerk[m]> <futurenewsplz[m] "Thanks, is Always on Display sti"> yes, always on display is available on GrapheneOS
08:25:01 <Autopsy[m]> <smashingclerk[m] "yes, always on display is availa"> No, it is device dependent.
08:25:23 <Autopsy[m]> The 4 and 4XL don't have AoD.
08:27:24 <nikitalita[m]1> anyone else have client recommendations on Android?
08:27:57 <nikitalita[m]1> I've tried fluffychat, but I've had problems verifying it from my desktop client
08:37:19 <dazinism> nikitalita: I've got fluffychat, it works pretty well. They've got their own Fdroid repo, which is linked, with the repo fingerprint, from the Known Repositories thread on the fdroid forum.
08:38:38 <dazinism> Has one annoying bug, where sometimes pressing delete with typing deletes all/half the message and using undo on a keyboard doesnt bring it back.
08:38:42 <nikitalita[m]1> i guess ill give that another shot
08:52:34 <dazinism>  @nikitalita:privacytools.io think sometimes connecting to their repo can be a bit patchy, may have to wait a bit and try again
10:36:58 <derpy> Any recommendation to replace SMS & Voice of Google Voice - and has support to port your number?
10:37:43 <derpy> not gonna be able to use grapheneOS unless I can receive many dual factor SMSs, which are through my google voice number
10:44:29 <derpy> Also whats the most liked email client by GrapheneOS community... Unfortunately the recommendation not to use email is not going to work for most of us.
10:45:52 <xmwv[m]> k9, fairemail, etc
10:48:26 <derpy> Gonna try Simple Email based on this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/cyy1h3/fairemail_vs_k9/
10:50:12 <derpy> ah ok will try FairEmail then
10:51:35 <derpy> What to do for SMS & Voice is the mystery
10:54:26 <derpy> Is there a migration guide from stock android? Recommended way to migrate contacts and stuff like that?
10:58:22 <derpy> seems like a main recommendation is voip.ms
11:02:38 <derpy> How do we keep contacts backed up? I wanted to be able to add a contact, throw my phone in the ocean, then restore the next day and still have it...
11:09:54 <Autopsy[m]> <derpy "How do we keep contacts backed u"> Carddav service
11:11:23 <derpy> Caldav Sync?
11:13:26 <Autopsy[m]> I use FastMail. I added my contacts to that service. I then use Dav5x to sync them using CardDAV / WebDAV.
12:00:03 <hultan[m]> Is there a way to quickly go pack to previous app? On my old android I believe it was double tapping on the back button...
12:17:22 <kickstart> is Dav5 is free
12:42:52 <Autopsy[m]> Or right to left if you want to go back to the app you just came from.
12:43:43 <marlow11[m]> Holy crap that's convenient. You just made my day
13:01:10 <derpy> you trust Dav5x?

13:02:31 <kickstart> i don't know what to trust
13:02:40 <kickstart> thats why i'm asking
13:05:05 <derpy> Same here... I don't know what the options are
13:07:21 <kickstart> i asked before and also was recommended EteSync

13:10:13 <Autopsy[m]> <derpy "you trust Dav5x?"> Yes.
13:10:42 <bson989[m]> Is there a gesture or more convenient way to activate the flashlight. I'm assuming active edge doesn't work.
13:11:05 <bson989[m]> I mean other than just the drop-down
13:12:49 <Autopsy[m]> No.

13:15:35 <Autopsy[m]> Yes.
13:15:36 <Autopsy[m]> Maybe.
13:17:24 <kickstart> so you neither confirm or deny

13:53:09 <derpy> but no, not yet
13:53:59 <Autopsy[m]> Right, so can you explain your set up and what it is you want to achieve
13:55:42 <derpy> Same as that reddit thread... Move all wifi APNs and password to my new GrapheneOS install (from stock Pixel)
13:57:22 <Autopsy[m]> <derpy "Same as that reddit thread... Mo"> On your stock Pixel, do you have the option to share WiFi with another device? It generates a QR code.

14:05:36 <derpy> Fennec the best firefox for greapheneOS? I just need it for one location-based app that won't work in the default browser :)
14:09:17 <kickstart> sorry i don't understnad is Fennec is an app name or person in the channel
14:12:40 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Probably (Fennec F Droid is somewhat Un-Mozilla'd Firefox partly)?
14:12:41 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Why not Bromite, just asking?
14:13:34 <kickstart> i couldn't find bromite in f dorid is it just me lacking skills
14:14:19 <theultron[m]> <kickstart "i couldn't find bromite in f dor"> You need to add the Bromite Repo in F-Droid before you can download it from there.
14:14:22 <theultron[m]> https://www.bromite.org/fdroid
14:14:32 <derpy> za_vilfp8kn0pcyh because when I typed firefox in f droid, fennec came up first...
14:15:05 <derpy> theultron[m] za_vilfp8kn0pcyh so is bromite the recommended Firefox fork for grapheneos?
14:15:16 <derpy> theultron[m] ^
14:15:25 <theultron[m]> Bromite is not Firefox. It's Chromium Fork.
14:15:33 <derpy> oh apologies... won't work then I think
14:15:53 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Nah, it isn't even a Firefox fork
14:16:05 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> And by grapheneos.org/faq, Firefox and its fork aren't recommended
14:16:11 <derpy> Ya neither is "email" :P
14:16:12 <theultron[m]> Do you need Firefox for a particular reason?
14:16:16 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> But if it is absolutely necessary
14:16:22 <derpy> I just need it for one location-based app that won't work in the default browser :)
14:16:32 <theultron[m]> You can use Firefox in a second user profile for isolation.
14:16:55 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Fennec may work, or Firefox Nightly?
14:17:13 <derpy> ah do you guys create a 2nd user and then install a bunch of apps using the Aurora Store? Is that safe?
14:17:25 <theultron[m]> <derpy "ah do you guys create a 2nd user"> Yes.
14:17:30 <derpy> za_vilfp8kn0pcyh idk where else to get firefox than F Droid... So I only see fennec so far
14:17:53 <theultron[m]> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "Fennec may work, or Firefox Nigh"> I think Fennec removes the proprietary blobs. Nightly might have issues with certain websites.
14:18:07 <theultron[m]> <derpy "za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a idk"> Use Fennec.
14:18:35 <derpy> F Droid says "this app has features you may not life" as it often does...
14:18:46 <derpy> I'm guessing that means proprietary software

14:21:25 <sinenomine[m]> Hi, what FLOSS tool can I install on GrapheneOS to wipe/erase files ?
14:21:46 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <sinenomine[m] "Hi, what FLOSS tool can I instal"> Just wipe them
14:21:50 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> in settings
14:22:11 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> SSD on phones don't have the retention issues as HDD
14:22:28 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Besides, the encryption keys on Titan M would be wiped anyways if you do so
14:23:17 <Autopsy[m]> <derpy "Per network? There are hundreds."> Once you've run through the script shown on that Reddit post, you'll get a text file with all the SSIDs and Passwords.

14:23:59 <sinenomine[m]> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "in settings"> In what settings ? system settings ?
14:24:49 <sinenomine[m]> or on the gallery app settings ?
14:25:35 <Autopsy[m]> <derpy "F Droid says "this app has featu"> No, it doesn't necessarily mean it is proprietary. The app itself will be open source and free of anything F Droid believe is untoward (e.g. Frost for Facebook); however, the app may use services (e.g. Facebook) which is proprietary.
14:26:28 <derpy> Fennec worked :)

14:28:15 <derpy> Way more work than I expected to migrate to GrapheneOS... But might as well... Would just be rough to setup everything again if I got a new phone... Perhaps the way is some full imaging of phone in case anything happens to it
14:28:41 <theultron[m]> You can backup using Seedvault.

14:33:39 <cdesai> yes, it has to be a system app, and signed with the platform key at the moment.
14:34:24 <theultron[m]> What about ADB backup? Can that backup and restore wifi networks?
14:34:30 <cdesai> there's no way to 'install it' just like any other app.
14:34:30 <cdesai> In the future there might be a way to root and install it on stock
14:35:00 <cdesai> yeah, it should be, we basically use the same underlying mechanism in seedvault.

14:36:21 <theultron[m]> Okay. derpy can try adb backup on stock and restoring on grapheneos. https://www.swiftforensics.com/2019/10/part-3-adb-keyvalue-backups-wifi-and.html
14:36:33 <Autopsy[m]> Soz, didn't see "on stock" lol
14:37:06 <cdesai> Autopsy[m]: well, since it's already included, that's not needed.
14:37:15 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Yes
14:37:35 <Autopsy[m]> <cdesai "Autopsy: well, since it's alread"> Yeah, had a bit of a brain fart 😂

14:40:41 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <sinenomine[m] "> <@za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a"> Just delete them?
14:41:19 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Or if you had nothing important on apps that can't be backup-ed on Seedvault, grab the files you need and wipe
14:41:20 <Autopsy[m]> <derpy "Is using gmail in Vanadium not r"> Why wouldn't it be recommended?
14:41:21 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
14:41:54 <derpy> incomplete functionality I guess
14:42:16 <theultron[m]> Does GOS use continuous trim?
14:43:38 <sinenomine[m]> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "Just delete them?"> Okay but does the delete option on the default gallery app of GrapheneOS overwrite the file's inode or does it just delete the location of the file in the file system ? I don't want it to be recoverable if some has full access to my phone.
14:44:24 <sinenomine[m]> someone*
14:45:06 <Autopsy[m]> <sinenomine[m] "Okay but does the delete option "> Set up a strong password and biometrics. If someone has access to your phone, they won't be able to recover anything without that. The Titan M chip will do its job to ensure no unauthorised access is done.
14:45:12 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Not sure, thus the question mark. You can wait for Android R to be ported in GOS then delete the pics then delete it im the 30-day "Recycle bin"
14:45:22 <derpy> Do you guys allow Vanadium to save your passwords?
14:45:31 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "Not sure, thus the question mark"> On picture deletion
14:45:37 <derpy> Do you know if 1Password X (chromium extension) can work in Vanadium?
14:45:37 <theultron[m]> "Glassrom uses hardware based data destruction, memory poisoning and key wrapping which are much better ways than free space wiping and can even resist cold boot and forensic based attacks" - Is the same in GOS ?
14:45:40 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <derpy "Do you guys allow Vanadium to sa"> Yes
14:45:52 <Autopsy[m]> However... If you have the US Government chasing you and they get your phone, they can just clone the chips on your phone and continue to brute force the password until they gain access.
14:46:04 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <Autopsy[m] "Set up a strong password and bio"> Also, always restart your phone when leaving it unattended
14:46:32 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <Autopsy[m] "However... If you have the US Go"> If it relies on AFU or USB peripherals not really
14:46:46 <sinenomine[m]> <Autopsy[m] "Set up a strong password and bio"> Already did, but I could be forced to give it in certain situation, like if I'm arrested or if someone has a gun pointed to my head ??
14:46:48 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> we don't have evidence yet
14:46:57 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> that cloning the chips
14:47:19 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Would actually decrypt the file, along with brute forcing actually working for long passwords
14:47:26 <Autopsy[m]> <sinenomine[m] "Already did, but I could be forc"> If it's something you don't want someone to see, whatever that may be, death is an option, too.

14:48:29 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> HDD file recovering, however, is another problem on its own
14:48:46 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Not sure if it applies on flash drives
14:49:00 <derpy> Think the Titan M is backdoored?
14:49:34 <Autopsy[m]> <sinenomine[m] "Already did, but I could be forc"> Besides, just a heads up to read the rules as this would be classed as bikeshedding.
14:49:58 <Autopsy[m]> GrapheneOS is rock solid and unless you give someone your credentials, they aren't getting the data. End of.
14:50:54 <sinenomine[m]> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "Always backup, always wipe when ">  Yes I do backup often using strong cryptography and stenography, but in the case of my phone it would be easier if in addition to backup I could just wipe some files (just like I do on QubeOS), not my entire system every time I do something sensible on it.
14:50:54 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <Autopsy[m] "Besides, just a heads up to read"> Yes.
14:50:56 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * If you want that

15:32:15 <dudewheresmycar> New to grapheneOS. Using it to test my curiosity. Was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction when it comes to installing apps on graphene os. Must I compile each one individually? I prefer not to use anything google.
15:32:46 <jpds> dudewheresmycar: You can use an app store like f-droid.org or Aurora Store
15:32:48 <axel72[m]> f-droid
15:32:51 <axel72[m]> aurora
15:34:03 <dudewheresmycar> yeah, I saw these both in blog posts. Went to the website for f-droid, but couldn't find any info on the proper secure way of installing f-droid. Didnt want to download it directly from the website to my phone.
15:34:58 <jpds> dudewheresmycar: You can do that, or sideload it from a desktop onto your phone
15:35:07 <jpds> The end result is the same
15:35:19 <dudewheresmycar> gotcha. One way isnt more secure than the other?
15:35:25 <jpds> No
15:36:00 <dudewheresmycar> what is the diff between aurora and f-droid?
15:36:15 <dudewheresmycar> is one more polished than the other?
15:36:25 <dudewheresmycar> I always prefer blob free if possible.
15:36:34 <jpds> f-droid is purely for open source software, aurora is a proxy to the play store
15:36:37 <derpy> za_vilfp8kn0pcyh was that to me? Sorry, lost most history because of everyone joining/leaving
15:36:53 <dudewheresmycar> but since im just testing graphine out of curiosity, its non-essential. Just a hobbyist.
15:37:42 <dudewheresmycar> oh gotcha. Sounds like f-droid is more up my alley then.
15:37:48 <derpy> F-Droid is how you avoid Google Services in like with the rest of the GrapheneOS. Aurora is how you try to download Google Play Store apps regardless.

15:40:55 <derpy> wish*
15:41:12 <dudewheresmycar> yeah, it would definitely be nice to know how hard developers work on builds for each app in graphene. And end user reviews kind of thing.
15:41:31 <dudewheresmycar> Damn, looks like everyone here is using the matrix except for me. hahahahaha
15:41:48 <dudewheresmycar> Thanks for the tips and help guys.
15:41:54 <jpds> f-droid isn't directly tied to Graphene
15:41:55 <derpy> nah I'm using webchat because I'm a loser who hasn't had time to setup his environment properly yet
15:42:21 <jpds> They're open-source apps - you can see how hard developers work on them by looking at their github pages
15:43:07 <dudewheresmycar> do the graphene developers have any official statements about using f-droid? Does it reduce security/privacy etc. at all? Open up attack vectors or anything?
15:43:50 <dudewheresmycar> what kind of buldenv do you typically use derpy?
15:43:53 <derpy> I'll have to ask on #F-Droid why they don't have reviews
15:43:57 <jpds> dudewheresmycar: https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps
15:44:12 <derpy> dudewheresmycar just got setup with Linux again after being stuck on OSX for years
15:44:30 <dudewheresmycar> ahh nice. Didnt realize all the apps were published on github.
15:44:52 <derpy> dudewheresmycar - good question, I would say F-Droid is the first place to look for apps. And if the app seems suspicious you can install it into another GOS profile
15:44:54 <dudewheresmycar> nice. what linux os ya using?
15:44:56 <derpy> void
15:45:11 <dudewheresmycar> im a debian guy. But tinker with everything sorta.
15:45:19 <derpy> Sorry to hear that hahaha
15:46:32 <dudewheresmycar> @derpy ok cool. Thats helpful.
15:47:01 <dudewheresmycar> Yah, debian pisses me off a lot.
15:47:46 <dudewheresmycar> i definitely want to tinker with a solid cubes rig though.
15:48:06 <dudewheresmycar> seems like it be a fun os to get balls deep into.
15:48:40 <Autopsy[m]> Guys
15:48:50 <dazinism> dudewheresmycar: for apps have a look at https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
15:49:07 <dudewheresmycar> ahh, thanks dazinism
15:50:21 <dudewheresmycar> while im here, anyone got a suggestion for a good osx irc client? foss preferably?
15:50:58 <dudewheresmycar> cant to seem to find one that isnt an app store download
15:51:05 <dudewheresmycar> suppose i could build limechat from source.
15:51:13 <dudewheresmycar> or hexchat
15:52:11 <dudewheresmycar> and lastly, if I wanted to make any development contributions to graphene, woould this be a good hangout to get involved?
15:52:23 <derpy> ya this seems like the place for GOS dev
15:52:34 <dudewheresmycar> cool cool. appreciate it.
15:53:02 <dudewheresmycar> always looking for new hobbies when my old projects get complete.
15:53:22 <dudewheresmycar> alright, well maybe i will be back. Thanks for all the help derpy and co.
15:53:29 <dudewheresmycar> much appreciated everyone.
15:53:47 <dazinism> sinenomine: if you want to be really safe you need the data to always be encrypted on the device, and throw away the keys/pw after deletion
15:54:09 <Autopsy[m]> <dudewheresmycar "cool cool. appreciate it."> Yes, this is the place for GrapheneOS. For more informal chat, head over to #grapheneos-offtopic on freenode.
15:54:36 <dudewheresmycar> appreciate it Autopsy
15:55:05 <dazinism> you could create another user profile where you aquire and keep the data, if you delete that user profile the data isnt really recoverable
15:57:17 <dazinism> or use an app which aquires and keep the data encrypted, and then delete the data and delete the pw/keys
15:58:02 <dazinism> This is about user profiles
15:58:07 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
15:58:47 <dazinism> You could use EDS Lite for storing data
15:58:50 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/storage
16:01:55 <dazinism> eg. you could set up a EDS lite container, then set Open Camera to save photos directly into the container.
16:03:08 <dazinism> Due to changes in Android 11, more and more apps are supporting the Android Storage Access Framework, which can allows you to set where they will store their data.
16:03:57 <cankerwort[m]> Anyone here who has used this to get GCAM running without google services on graphene?
16:03:57 <cankerwort[m]> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
16:04:36 * theultron[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/wpywGDzwsQXPEBzHGUaMCTwx/message.txt >
16:05:07 <theultron[m]> Nice stuff. Does not require any permission. It just stimulate gms.
16:06:41 <cankerwort[m]> Seems there is already a GOS issue open on this
16:06:41 <cankerwort[m]>  https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/204
16:12:31 <theultron[m]> BTW also read this. https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/255
16:17:24 <cankerwort[m]> Very interesting. I'm aware that by using GOS the camera is often worse. But if I install this spoofing app, I can't seem to find "google camera" on the Aurora store to try it out to see the difference
16:17:36 <cankerwort[m]> Or is "google camera" not actually an app?
16:18:34 <cankerwort[m]> (I didn't try google camera on my pixel at all before jumping to graphene, so known nothing about it)
16:18:42 <theultron[m]> Google Camera is an app. If you don't see on Aurora store then download from apkmirror
16:19:04 <theultron[m]> https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/camera/
16:19:49 <cankerwort[m]> Many thanks I will try this out and make some comparisons
16:20:35 <cankerwort[m]> I'm not really into photography at all but the main gripe I had heard with graphene was a reduction in camera quality, so I may as well see what the actual difference is
16:40:03 <futurenv[m]> Are there any preferred smartwatches that work decently well with GOS? I've been running a Pixel 3 since March and have everything switched over that I need, however my only remaining concern is with smartwatch compatibility mainly just for activity/fitness tracking
16:43:01 <Autopsy[m]> cankerwort: search for it on DuckDuckGo, find it on the play store
16:43:03 <Autopsy[m]> Click the link
16:43:11 <Autopsy[m]> Open it in Aurora
16:43:12 <Autopsy[m]> Profit
16:43:30 <Autopsy[m]> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera&hl=en_US here's a link bc I'm nice.
16:44:34 <nikitalita[m]1> just curious, what does this offer over something like open camera
16:44:43 <nikitalita[m]1> i've never used it
16:44:52 <Autopsy[m]> Google's image processing algorithms, night mode, etc etc.
16:45:04 <Autopsy[m]> Far superior in almost every way.
16:45:04 <nikitalita[m]1> mmm
16:45:35 <nikitalita[m]1> they bought up all these open source ML and image processing companies and then made proprietary products out of them
16:49:34 * t32tt23tt32tt23t uploaded an image: image.png (161KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/fUhYTxmHMlZcxrMYdXeJSXuD/image.png >

16:55:17 <nikitalita[m]1> so you'll be forced to use their services for anything resembling usefulness or performance
16:55:19 <nikitalita[m]1> futurenv: someone was asking about that earlier and someone made recommendations, look in the logs in the topic
17:02:26 <Autopsy[m]> futurenv: nikitalita I've mentioned it a few times now, tbh.
17:04:14 * cankerwort[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20200824_180031.jpg (33KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/siFGECMijPzWySEjPbmpXXTE/IMG_20200824_180031.jpg >
17:04:38 <cankerwort[m]> FYI this happens when I try and click the link from DDG into Aurora store
17:04:47 <cankerwort[m]> The apk mirror seemed to work though
17:10:13 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <nikitalita[m]1 "so you'll be forced to use their"> ^^
17:10:14 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> This. It is really annoying
17:10:14 <nikitalita[m]1> part of this was just annoyance at the vendors for not updating their phones
17:10:15 <nikitalita[m]1> but most of it was to increase their reliance on google so that they didn't have wiggle room to make a break
17:10:42 <derpy> I installed twilight from Aurora... hopefully not dangerous :P
17:10:46 <derpy> for night mode
17:19:54 <jpds> derpy: Graphene has a built-in night mode
17:20:24 <derpy> doubt it goes dark enough for my taste... will look for it tho
17:21:49 <derpy> ah ok found it tnx
17:29:29 <kickstart> hello guys i get the camera app crashing
17:29:58 <kickstart> i pressed send report but i didn't get a confirmation that it was sent is that ok
18:02:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> kickstart: yeah don't worry we didn't implement the report button functionality
18:03:00 <kickstart> ok i'm trying help whiten my limited capabilities
18:03:05 <kickstart> ;(
18:08:36 <djee737ejdd[m]> <futurenv[m] "Are there any preferred smartwat"> Samsungs watches work fine.
18:41:15 <trismous[m]> <futurenv[m] "Are there any preferred smartwat"> This is an offtopic, but you cam check Techlore on that topic (privacy friendly fitness tracking). The smartwatch can be considered as weak chain link. If you can get away with mechanical watch and some privacy friendly tracking app on your phone I'd consider that route.

18:44:26 <applescruff_53[m> I just encountered an issue someone may be familiar with. First time I've received voice mail on the phone. I'm asked for my password. Is that the password I entered for Grapheme OS during setup?
18:48:54 <kickstart> what this is strange the least i can say
18:53:54 <applescruff_53[m> If it is I may have to reinstall Graphene OS because I used an apostrophe in my password and the phone keypad does no include one.
20:19:15 <futurenewsplz[m4> <Autopsy[m] "The 4 and 4XL don't have AoD. "> Do you know why the change from the previous Pixel generations?
20:30:38 <futurenewsplz[m4> <derpy "dudewheresmycar - good question,"> How do you make a separate GOS profile?
20:31:12 <derpy> futurenewsplz[m4 not sure yet - I intend to try soon for the first time
20:32:09 <jpds> futurenewsplz[m4: Just create a new user
20:34:00 <futurenewsplz[m4> Thanks derpy jpds
20:35:36 <Autopsy[m]> <applescruff_53[m "I just encountered an issue some"> Before your after you've called your voicemail?
20:37:13 <Autopsy[m]> Just tested it and left myself a rude message. No password here.
20:52:45 <futurenewsplz[m4> Is there a way to enable AOD if GOS doesn't come on the Pixel 4/4xl by default?
21:20:03 <Autopsy[m]> <futurenewsplz[m4 "Do you know why the change from "> If I remember correctly, it is something to do with it being disabled on the stock, because the Pixel 4 devices use Soli / Oslo (radar thing) detection to enable and disable the AoD as and when required. As it is proprietary, Google hasn't implemented it into the AOSP, which means we don't get it. The device maintainer (anupritaisno1) has also stated that he isn't
21:20:04 <Autopsy[m]> going to support it for the Pixel 4 and 4XL devices.
21:20:24 <Autopsy[m]> Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
21:20:25 <nickcalyx[m]> Whats AOD
21:22:03 <Autopsy[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/241 here's the GitHub issue for it, too
21:25:31 <futurenewsplz[m4> Thanks Autopsy. For the Pixel 4a and maybe 5 that doesn't have Soli is it likely Always on Display (AOD) will be available?
21:30:17 <futurenewsplz[m4> anupritaisno1: Why was AOD on the Pixel 4 hard to maintain?
21:32:07 <futurenewsplz[m4> Has anyone tried editing Oslo's feature flag as @Flex1911 suggested? https://github.com/GrapheneOS/device_google_coral/commit/b73112b74bbac667e61f2aaf84e90a7f41863f52
21:33:05 <futurenewsplz[m4> <nickcalyx[m] "Whats AOD"> One of the best non-security related features of the Pixels 🤓
22:22:11 <Autopsy[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Whats AOD"> Always on display
22:22:33 <nickcalyx[m]> why is that a great feature
22:23:36 <Autopsy[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "why is that a great feature"> Not a clue. Isn't my cup of tea at all, tbh.
22:24:45 <Autopsy[m]> <futurenewsplz[m4 "Has anyone tried editing Oslo's "> Don't know. If you can, give it a try?
22:25:05 <aragorndr[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "why is that a great feature"> It's useful when I have dirty hands
22:26:37 <futurenewsplz[m4> <nickcalyx[m] "why is that a great feature"> Able to read notifications (or lack of) without having to interact with phone. Cost is some battery life but it's well worth it imo
22:30:14 <drkw1z4rd> Anyone on Google Fi?
22:33:22 <futurenewsplz[m4> <drkw1z4rd "Anyone on Google Fi?"> Does Google Fi work on GrapheneOS? Am curious about this myself
22:34:04 <drkw1z4rd> I have no idea, haven't really been able to get a straight answer about it. I know it's not officially supported but i was hoping to find someone currently using Google Fi on GrapheneOS.
22:34:26 <drkw1z4rd> GrapheneOS doesn't support esims so im having a physical sim shipped to me
22:34:58 <drkw1z4rd> but if it doesn't work/is extremely buggy, i may have to switch providers
22:35:23 <drkw1z4rd> which would suck because im only paying $30 a month with fi right now lol
22:36:21 <drkw1z4rd> probably will ask around different tech ircs
22:37:31 <futurenewsplz[m4> <drkw1z4rd "GrapheneOS doesn't support esims"> I didn't know esim not supported thanks
22:38:13 <drkw1z4rd> yep i didnt know either until after i had already gotten GrapheneOS installed on my phone LOL, completely forgot that fi uses esim. You'll have to go onto the website and get a physical SIM shipped to you. It is free to have one shipped to you.
22:39:54 <futurenewsplz[m4> <drkw1z4rd "yep i didnt know either until af"> But you the Google Fi app to enable the network service right? I wonder if that's available on GrapheneOS

23:13:55 <faxing[m]> I've been trying all day to get Visual Voicemail working with no luck. I'm on Graphene and Mint Mobile.
23:14:22 <faxing[m]> Does Visual Voicemail work on Graphene and I'm just wasting my time or am I missing something?
23:15:12 <BalooRJ> I haven't had Visual Voicemail on Verizon for years now
23:15:37 <BalooRJ> wasn't sure if it was a Google Play Services or carrier issue or what. faxing how exactly do you go about enabling it? I'd be interested to hear more.
23:17:10 <faxing[m]> I mean my options are sort of limited but I've been just digging around in the phone app and dialing different codes and going around in settings
23:17:33 <faxing[m]> But it's still forcing me to dial a voicemail box to get voicemail
23:38:10 <faxing[m]> Any ideas?
