00:15:15 <larncat[m]> I can only speak for Verizon, but curious why enabling Signal's 'Wifi calling compatibility mode' enabled SMS/MMS over Wifi. It will fail in Messaging placeholder app and QKSMS+.
00:17:18 <larncat[m]> Once WiFi texting is *provisioned? in Signal, I can switch to QKSMS+ and send/receive messages on WiFi only.
00:20:22 <alicebobandeve[m> anupritaisno1 https://github.com/PixelExperience-Devices/device_xiaomi_sdm845-common/commit/ce8cf16c5a3ac15eef16177e164652e77475b92f
00:21:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> alicebobandeve: no
00:21:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> We can't keep any changes that need manual maintenance
00:21:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> That just makes everything harder
00:24:58 <alicebobandeve[m> AFAIK these don't change often
00:25:32 <alicebobandeve[m> Or do they?
00:26:01 <larncat[m]> Then switching to built-in Messaging app, SMS is stuck in forever-sending.
00:26:01 <larncat[m]> At that point, WiFi texting is borked for all apps, and to recover I need to:
00:26:01 <larncat[m]> Turn off airplane mode, send/receive an SMS with Signal, toggle airplane mode again and activate WiFi & then send/receive another SMS in Signal over Wifi, then toggle VPN back on and it works from then on.
00:30:40 <larncat[m]> Signal has the special sauce. Was similar on Nexus 5x with Verizon, as I indicated earlier today. VPN definitely blocks initial WiFi texting provisioning (Signal). OpenVPN back then, now Wireguard.
00:44:30 <alicebobandeve[m> larncat: interesting
01:14:36 <billy> Hello
01:14:55 <cn3m[m]> hello
01:15:24 <billy> Just installed Graphene for first time. Excited to use.
01:15:42 <billy> Starting with f droid for apk manager/downloader
01:16:51 <alicebobandeve[m> Nice! Welcome.
01:17:21 <billy> Thanks
01:17:57 <alicebobandeve[m> I'll try and fix WiFi calling for Pixel 3 if I can anupritaisno1 I'll get in touch if I need help
01:19:27 <alicebobandeve[m> That was a rather quick exit
01:26:03 <larncat[m]> <alicebobandeve[m "I'll try and fix WiFi calling fo"> That's appreciated. Thanks
01:27:21 <larncat[m]> I love the pixel 3.
01:28:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> alicebobandeve: https://github.com/GlassROM-devices/device_google_coral/commit/f0e2c3dd49b5519b1f9d9565ef642a4cf121b1ae
01:29:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> alicebobandeve: also 3 commits from https://github.com/GlassROM-devices/android-prepare-vendor
01:29:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oops
01:29:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well everything I committed on July 11 except for the preopt commit
01:30:49 <larncat[m]> Tweaking the 'smallest width' parameter in dev options to '443' seems to makes text sharp and reasonable for my eyes with the default font size.
01:32:56 <alicebobandeve[m> anupritaisno1: thanks a ton
01:33:10 <alicebobandeve[m> larncat: I'll try, I love the P3 too
01:33:17 <larncat[m]> ^ maybe I misunderstand that dev setting, but none of the default scalings looked right, nor had a smallest width that matched the native DPI. This seems to sharpen text, which looked a bit blurry on the P3.
01:33:21 <nickcalyx[m]> The new picture editor in Signal is fun
01:33:52 <alicebobandeve[m> nickcalyx: very distracting lol
01:34:05 <larncat[m]> <alicebobandeve[m "larncat: I'll try, I love the P3"> Totally
01:36:34 <larncat[m]> nickcalyx putting stickers over photos is remarkably amusing
01:43:40 <nickcalyx[m]> between that and the sticker packs
01:43:51 <nickcalyx[m]> Moxie is finally getting with the program
01:44:25 <nickcalyx[m]> also the auto face pixelation is good
02:06:17 * hypokeimenon[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/BSLhgCBhBrsaKrQTHUYGKuxm >
02:46:13 <nickcalyx[m]> strcat would know the specifics but I think there were improvements in the titan M in between 3 and 4 ?
02:46:29 <nickcalyx[m]> but then they also took away the fingerprint reader
02:56:53 <alex-resist> Hello everyone, GrapheneOS on Pixel 3a here. I would like to use my phone in WiFi-only mode with Orbot in VPN-mode. Unfortunately, with Orbot in VPN-mode, captive portals don't load. Any idea which system components I would have to allow to bypass Orbot for that to work?
03:05:13 <interceptingfist> Anyone know how to bypass this on a pixel3a
03:05:18 * interceptingfist uploaded an image: IMG_20200711_230127.jpg (3302KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/sJrjOXGVTREnLimHVCGHqoXC >
03:06:36 <defconanon010102> alex-resist: To achieve this Alex you can go into Airplane Mode and turn on WiFi.
03:07:18 <defconanon010102> interceptingfist: Why is Google asking you to verify anything aren't you on GOS or no?
03:08:49 <interceptingfist> I have a phone with graphene already, but i bought this for a good deal
03:11:08 <defconanon010102> interceptingfist: Oh so if you press X it just closes everything? You bought a password locked device. Depending how good the password is you can crack it.
03:11:54 <defconanon010102> Or just ask the prior owner for the password.
03:12:50 <interceptingfist> Yea it closes out, phone is useless
03:13:00 <interceptingfist> They don't have it, that's why it was cheap
03:13:24 <defconanon010102> So for now you bought a brick.
03:14:13 <jknsec[m]> "It's yours if you can crack it"
03:14:27 <defconanon010102> ^
03:14:42 <defconanon010102> A good password cracker should do the trick.
03:15:46 <nickcalyx[m]> There is something about,the Titan m chip increasing the delay in between attempts, the more you try
03:15:55 <interceptingfist> jknsec: love the motivation/wisdom
03:16:15 <jknsec[m]> :P
03:16:20 <interceptingfist> <defconanon010102 "^"> Any recommendations
03:16:28 <interceptingfist> jknsec: lmao
03:17:05 <nickcalyx[m]> I'm not aware of there being anything you can do.. just look up the most common password lists and try those
03:17:07 <defconanon010102> interceptingfist: Really that is for you to find out. I don't have any at the moment.
03:17:51 <jknsec[m]> The irony is that this is why the Titan M exists and why Graphene likes Pixels
03:18:02 <alex-resist> defconanon010102 airplane mode + wifi is a no brainer, the issue is that Orbot even blocks desired connections which are needed to use captive portals. I would like to use Orbot in a "not 100%"-VPN-mode so I can use public WiFis but the rest will be routed through Orbot
03:18:07 <interceptingfist> <defconanon010102 "interceptingfist: Really that is"> ok I'm not a hacker so its always best to ask, so I don't waste time
03:18:11 <TheJollyRoger> nickcalyx[m] is right. Even if they only used a 4-digit pin code, it's going to take you roughly 650 years to completely exhaust the available keying space.
03:18:31 <TheJollyRoger> So I would suggest you contact the previous owner.
03:18:40 <defconanon010102> I could give you a tool but I am not going to tell you how to use said tool. Honestly, it is better to look at the array of tools and research.interceptingfist
03:19:16 <nickcalyx[m]> did you try stuff like 1111 9999 1234 0000
03:19:26 <nickcalyx[m]> probably :)
03:20:06 <jknsec[m]> It's probably some long alphanumeric code that no one can possibly remember
03:20:07 <cn3m[m]> interceptingfist: probably a stolen phone I would contact the seller and give them a hard time
03:20:24 <jknsec[m]> Ooh true
03:20:31 <TheJollyRoger> Factory reset protection.
03:21:13 <jknsec[m]> Yeah it could legit be stolen
03:21:22 <cn3m[m]> that is dishonest to have a device stolen like that
03:21:48 <cn3m[m]> you probably could make a very convincing threat of the authorities to the seller
03:21:51 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:28:25 <alex-resist> Not sure if I missed something, but it would be good to have an FAQ regarding Orbot use in public environments. MAC randomization is fine, and having a reliable Orbot on top would make Graphene equivalent (or better) to Tails
03:29:23 <larncat[m]> interceptingfist where did u buy it from?
03:30:13 <cn3m[m]> <alex-resist "Not sure if I missed something, "> FAQs take a long to write and verify
03:30:22 <nickcalyx[m]> what tails also has though is a whole toolset of security focused apps
03:30:28 <interceptingfist> A person who got it but never got junlocked
03:30:42 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "what tails also has though is a "> haha it has generally terrible security
03:30:47 <cn3m[m]> I am not sure what you mean
03:31:47 <alex-resist> The idea is to have MAC randomization and Orbot in public settings. So far Orbot is keeping me from using captive portals. I'm somewhat proficient with Tor and Tails, so I could actually help on that part. But I don't know which part of Android is handling the captive portal connect
03:31:49 <interceptingfist> <defconanon010102 "I could give you a tool but I am"> Its cool no need I'm searchin
03:32:41 <defconanon010102> Wonderful. ^^
06:12:11 <alicebobandeve[m> alex-resist: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/CaptivePortall
06:12:30 <alicebobandeve[m> Connectivity Manager
06:14:20 <alicebobandeve[m> Won't a obfs4 bridge help for captive portals?
07:22:38 <john_doe2[m]> On grapheneOS, where do you get your apps from? F-droid? Aurora? Both?
07:58:01 <g65434-2[m]> fdroid
08:16:20 <cn3m[m]> APKMirror confirming signatures with Exodus Privacy
08:16:25 <cn3m[m]> I avoid all the v1 signing
08:16:45 <cn3m[m]> between that and remote attestation I feel quite confident
08:20:42 <larncat[m]> cn3m what is v1 signing?
08:21:50 <cn3m[m]> <larncat[m] "cn3m what is v1 signing?"> old deprecated signing method F-Droid won't switch off
08:22:05 <cn3m[m]> the full apk is not verified
08:22:14 <cn3m[m]> it is very possible more exploits could be found in it
08:22:31 <cn3m[m]> I don't think anyone is even auditing it anymore as so few people use the method
08:26:51 <cn3m[m]> larncat: from my understanding an exploit in v1 could mean malware could hop across profiles and persist. Imagine you try to install an apk on another profile and it replaces your F-Droid which in turn replaces all your F-Droid apps..
08:27:48 <cn3m[m]> normally I would feel safe installing an app in another profile, but if you could replace an app with such an exploit.. That would be bad
08:28:36 <john_doe2[m]> cn3m: has that happened in the past?
08:28:47 <cn3m[m]> john_doe2: yes Janus
08:29:18 <cn3m[m]> it is patched and has been for a while, but there is no reason there couldn't be another and no one would be looking for it beside maybe a government is my guess
08:34:00 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid says it is not an issue, but that is a little misleading due to them only considering installation happening from builds on the F-Droid server. I don't consider that an accurate take at all
08:34:58 <JTL> Agreed
08:36:26 <cn3m[m]> the most important security feature one could add to GrapheneOS imo is it's own store
08:38:33 <cn3m[m]> seamless background app updates would be nice too
08:39:05 <cn3m[m]> would kill a lot of awkwardness with apps security on AOSP right now imo
08:42:57 <john_doe2[m]> What about aurora store?
08:43:49 <cn3m[m]> john_doe2: it has a v1 fallback and he v2/3 fails
08:44:41 <cn3m[m]> so the store app(which is trusted with unknown sources and the user trusts for updates installs) is weak which is a concern definitely
08:44:53 <cn3m[m]> assuming there was a v1 flaw
08:46:05 <john_doe2[m]> What does one do then?
08:48:03 <cn3m[m]> <john_doe2[m] "What does one do then?"> if you are worried about it you can do what I do and verify the signatures and download the apks
08:48:23 <cn3m[m]> I use APKMirror and check the signature against the developers on Exodus privacy
08:51:38 <john_doe2[m]> Ty
08:56:00 <cn3m[m]> :)
09:25:48 <alicebobandeve[m> Signal or Conversations progressive

09:29:22 <alicebobandeve[m> Let me tell you something about tech, there are always going to be problems and security issues with everything so you must choose what's appropriate for you sometimes
09:29:42 <alicebobandeve[m> You have to choose the lesser evil

09:36:46 <dazinism> v1 signatures will no longer be supported in Android 11
09:37:11 <dazinism> https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes-11
09:37:34 <dazinism> No new v1 app installs or updates
09:37:47 <f8sai[m]> <dazinism "v1 signatures will no longer be "> rip fdroid
09:37:53 <cn3m[m]> haha
09:38:02 <dazinism> The folks that work on the Fdroid repo are working on moving from v1 sigs
09:38:54 <dazinism> The izzyondroid Fdroid repo has a fair few apps
09:39:18 <dazinism> They provide the developers builds
09:39:53 <dazinism> Which will almost certainly use v2 or v3 signing
09:40:28 <g65434-2[m]> well fdroid is the only good option right now anyway
09:40:51 <dazinism> https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=3BF0D6ABFEAE2F401707B6D966BE743BF0EEE49C2561B9BA39073711F628937A
09:41:44 <dazinism> g65434-2: Fdroid repo is good in many ways.
09:42:10 <dazinism> But the v1 signing issue isnt great
09:42:26 <dazinism> Also the app tends to be a bit buggy
09:43:18 <dazinism> See https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps for some info about getting apps safely
09:44:03 <dazinism> That page doesnt mention the v1 issue
09:44:08 <dazinism> Probably should
09:44:14 <cn3m[m]> <g65434-2[m] "well fdroid is the only good opt"> I dunno I prefer my setup
09:44:44 <dazinism> Its going to be painful for the Fdroid repo to support android 11
09:44:54 <dazinism> They will have to resign all apps
09:45:50 <dazinism> Moving new builds of apps to v2 apparently isnt so difficult. Just resigning old builds will be some trouble
09:46:05 <dazinism> *v2 or v3
09:47:09 <cn3m[m]> well good
09:47:17 <cn3m[m]> I am glad they are being forced too
09:47:30 <dazinism> Given the increased speed of uptake of new versions of Android in recent years I expect they'll have to work pretty quick
09:48:04 <dazinism> Or they'll have ever increasing numbers of folks complaining/getting confused
09:48:05 <cn3m[m]> I mean 10% in a year right?
09:48:19 <cn3m[m]> not fast still
09:48:44 <cn3m[m]> generally it is the last OS doing well
09:48:52 <cn3m[m]> like Pie is very popular
09:49:01 <cn3m[m]> by Android standards
09:49:31 <dazinism> 10% of all android users, is a lot of users
09:49:49 <dazinism> Obv not so many using fdroid
09:50:21 <dazinism> And I would imagine probably a higher proportion on older android versions
09:50:28 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "10% of all android users, is a l"> sure, I guess my developer instincts are kicking in. The 88% on iOS was so nice...
09:51:27 <dazinism> *Higher proportion of Fdroid users on older versions
09:52:31 <g65434-2[m]> i feel like they are rushing every major android version
09:52:46 <dazinism> They come yearly
09:53:03 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 will have the longest beta cycle ever
09:53:09 <cn3m[m]> that is anything but rushed
09:53:10 <g65434-2[m]> there are not subversions anymore or something , it's odd
09:53:33 <cn3m[m]> less huge chances have to be made since the updates are higher quality
09:53:48 <g65434-2[m]> i didn't imply it like so, but in oreo/nougat there was like 9.x.x
09:53:55 <g65434-2[m]>  * i didn't imply it like so, but in oreo/nougat there was like 8.x.x
09:56:08 <dazinism> I've updated the wiki about user profiles linked above
09:56:17 <crueltekk[m]> Okay finally I managed to get a look around the Vanadium source and feeling confident to fix my first issue. The problem is that I cant run it from Android Studio on my Pixel 4 XL, USB Debuging is turned on fingerprint is correct.
09:56:36 <dazinism> Wondering if anyone has tested network on multi users
09:57:04 <dazinism> strcat mentioned that only one user profile has network
09:57:10 <dazinism> I think
09:57:51 <dazinism> And that any user  would use foreground user network in background
09:58:12 <cn3m[m]> crueltekk: little more information on what you did?
09:58:37 <dazinism> *And that any user in background would use the foreground users network

10:01:49 <dazinism> Main / work profile i guess are different and can both have their own network (or VPN)active at same time?

10:13:39 <crueltekk[m]> Seems like there is none.
10:13:48 <crueltekk[m]> Will redo the last stes

12:26:17 <crabman[m]> My experience in using fasboot with linux is that it needs to be run with sudo.  I see the install.sh script just has fastboot commands.  Does the script need to be run under sudo or some other condition?
12:27:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Install udev rules
12:29:03 <crabman[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Install udev rules"> Not sure I understand ""udev rules"
12:32:34 <pikey[m]> <crabman[m] "Not sure I understand ""udev rul"> I had same problem/confusion, total linux beginner. JR wrote a great guide for beginners like me. Have you read that? I think it's under "Peter Euston"
12:32:38 <dazinism> crabman: if you are on arch or a derivative udev ruels may be  available as a package or already set up
12:35:41 <dazinism> pikey: yeah the app can see and control network connections (its exactly what you can see NetGuard doing )
12:37:50 <pikey[m]> <dazinism "pikey: yeah the app can see and "> which app?
12:37:56 <crabman[m]> I am sorry I don't understand.  I had no issue flashing my MOTOG3 with Ubuntu.  I had no issue with the P3a until I came across the flash-all.sh script.  However, I have always run commands one at a time, never a script.
12:38:56 <dazinism> pikey: any app that uses Androids VPN functionality. When you enable that you give it full visibility and control of network
12:39:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> crabman: try looking it up then
12:39:33 <dazinism> It wont be able to read encrypted data, but can see it travelling and block it
12:39:38 <crabman[m]> Is there a forum where you can get Graphene support?  I see Reddit directs people here.
12:40:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> crabman: just look up udev rules for android
12:40:31 <pikey[m]> <dazinism "pikey: any app that uses Android"> so in this conversation, are you referring to PIA, as that's the only app that "uses Android's VPN functionality"? Surely you don't mean any app which runs *through* the VPN, as that's all apps!! :D
12:41:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> pikey: he means the app that initiated the VPN
12:42:09 <pikey[m]> thanks, but way over my head by all accounts.
12:42:39 <pikey[m]> crabman - JR made a few very useful comments for me when I was learning to flash Graphene. I kept notes. These may help? :
12:42:43 <pikey[m]> "The third last tip I have for it is, if you are running Linux and end up being stuck at "<waiting for device>" or nothing happens at fastboot, you may be be missing udev rules, or your user account may not be added to the adbusers group (you will need to log off, then log back in in order for the group edit to take effect). There should be a guide somewhere on the Arch wiki about udev rules for both Fastboot and ADB.
12:42:43 <pikey[m]> The second last tip I have for it is, follow Daniel Micay's instructions exactly. He's taken a lot of time to document the whole installation process start to finish and this is the correct way to do it."
12:43:30 <pikey[m]> if not, sorry but I can't do more as it would be the blind leading the blind :p
12:47:18 <crabman[m]> <pikey[m] "crabman - JR made a few very use"> pikey - Thanks my issue is “fastboot too old;”, but I am using latest fastboot.
12:47:45 <crabman[m]> IRT Daniel Micay's instructions, are you referring to https://grapheneos.org/install
12:51:00 <dazinism> crabman: search for udev on https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
12:59:50 <progressive[m]> Is there any possibility that grapheneos can be hacked same way as it happen with EncroChat?
13:01:09 <dazinism> progressive: anything is possible
13:02:48 <f8sai[m]> <dazinism "progressive: anything is possibl"> What would be the consequence of a hacked GrapheneOS' server?
13:03:17 <f8sai[m]> as in, what can a compromised update can do, assuming it bypassed the key checking
13:06:07 <pikey[m]> <f8sai[m] "as in, what can a compromised up"> think I am right in saying Graphene can't identify a specific phone to a user, so a malicious update couldn't be pushed to a specific person/device. I suppose in theory if GOS servers were compromised then a malicious update could be pushed to all GOS devices at once, and I would think that would be spotted in about a nano second, but I am no expert :D
13:06:48 <progressive[m]> <f8sai[m] "as in, what can a compromised up"> Install keylogger
13:07:21 <f8sai[m]> <progressive[m] "Install keylogger"> Malicious system app could be?
13:07:46 <f8sai[m]> <progressive[m] "Install keylogger"> But if it used any of those "red-flags" known on Auditor
13:07:55 <f8sai[m]> (I meant the permissions)
13:08:03 <f8sai[m]> We can simply reflash a previous version
13:08:26 <progressive[m]> I’m not IT guy, sorry I was just asking
13:08:47 <f8sai[m]> Not me either, just telling a solution
13:09:09 <progressive[m]> So we would know the fact it was hacked and keylogger installed?
13:09:21 <f8sai[m]> Possibly
13:09:35 <f8sai[m]> You can compare system apps
13:09:40 <f8sai[m]> Do auditor checking
13:09:44 <f8sai[m]> Or it may not even boot at all
13:09:55 <progressive[m]> Because that was happened with Encro i believe encrochat knew it months ago and they worked with police
13:10:17 <f8sai[m]> they would be better off hacking Signal tbh
13:10:52 <f8sai[m]> <progressive[m] "Because that was happened with E"> Encro has its own chat app or something for communication
13:12:08 <progressive[m]> Are you asking?
13:13:22 <f8sai[m]> I might not be the best person to answer your question, and yes, I'm asking for a written answer by more security-inclined people here
13:13:36 <progressive[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/hk40m7/police_arrest_746_and_seize_more_than_54000000/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
13:13:58 <progressive[m]> They sold encrypted phones with own OS
13:18:10 <cyborgninjaneer[> To compromise GrapheneOS, someone would need to get hold of Daniel's signing keys and push the update without him noticing. That would be very hard.
13:18:48 <progressive[m]> Look
13:19:07 <progressive[m]> International investigators were also going after the team who ran Encrochat, who they said led ‘luxury lifestyles’, although the technology itself is not legal
13:19:17 <f8sai[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "To compromise GrapheneOS, someon"> Well, the key bypassing or stealing is the hard and secure part -wink-
13:20:03 <f8sai[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "To compromise GrapheneOS, someon"> Well, somebody did attempt once and it didn't end up successful
13:20:18 <progressive[m]> The police are claiming that os/phones like grapheneos is ilegal, I thing slowly but we are loosing privacy and freedom
13:21:11 <f8sai[m]> <progressive[m] "The police are claiming that os/"> Nobody can tell you are running GrapheneOS until you restart/show settings thougj
13:21:15 <f8sai[m]> It just looks like stocj
13:21:16 <f8sai[m]> stock*
13:21:54 <pikey[m]> <progressive[m] "The police are claiming that os/"> not sure which police are claiming that, but it's false
13:21:56 <progressive[m]> I understand that but they can knock on Daniels doorstep and offer him life sentence :)
13:22:10 <progressive[m]> Just a thinking
13:22:28 <f8sai[m]> Well, he can also just destroy the keys
13:22:37 <pikey[m]> <progressive[m] "I understand that but they can k"> that's why nothing is ever 100% guaranteed, and Daniel would be the first to say so, which is why he can be trusted  imo
13:23:02 <f8sai[m]> No secure OS will protect you from poor opsec
13:23:22 <progressive[m]> They could not give him a chance, you know how it works, sometimes you dont have 2 spare seconds when police catch you
13:23:30 <pikey[m]> <f8sai[m] "No secure OS will protect you fr"> nor a $5 wrench ;)
13:23:41 <f8sai[m]> LOL
13:24:11 <f8sai[m]> No AFU exploit if you always restart your phone
13:24:29 <pikey[m]> life = risk. we do what we can. at least we in here ARE doing what we can. Most morons aren't, can't be bothered. I wold rather die trying than live in wilful ignorance!

13:25:49 <SchismXL[m]> the*
13:25:59 <SchismXL[m]> :p
13:26:58 <pikey[m]> at the end of the day, in  the UK (and most of EU I imagine).. the police can just say "please unlock your device for me", or "please give me your encryption keys for xyz". You say "no" - you are now guilty of an offence and liable for 4 or 5 years in prison IIRC.
13:27:20 <pikey[m]> but it's not a reason not to use encryption.
13:27:46 <f8sai[m]> <pikey[m] "at the end of the day, in  the U"> Reformat your phone, save backup on (encrypted) storages ^^
13:28:06 <f8sai[m]> Can't see anything that's not there
13:28:45 <pikey[m]> <f8sai[m] "Reformat your phone, save backup"> the point I am making is that by doing ANYTHING to prevent handing over eveyrthing to the stasi, you go to prison if caught (or suspected and found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, from a judge on side with thegovt in probably what woul dbe a closed court!) - so I dont bother mitigating, I just know where i stand in this piece of shit country.
13:29:37 <f8sai[m]> well, I mean
13:29:44 <f8sai[m]> It depends on what they ask for
13:30:38 <f8sai[m]> <pikey[m] "at the end of the day, in  the U"> This is one reason I am happy living on the east
13:30:45 <f8sai[m]> Or central
13:30:56 <pikey[m]> <f8sai[m] "It depends on what they ask for"> no it doesn't. the new law (newish anyway) is simple. They want the keys to unlock your device, files, servers, ANYTHING. IF they ask, and you do NOT hand over, you CAN go to prison. That for me is all I need to know. With that, and some creative thinking by the boys in blue, yo're fucked every which way if they want you to be. Of course, you just comply. There's a good boy.
13:31:40 <f8sai[m]> Assuming it passed, but this is getting off-topic
13:31:45 <pikey[m]> anyway, off topic
13:31:46 <pikey[m]> haha
13:31:54 <pikey[m]> laters
13:32:04 <f8sai[m]> Also, there are some mitigation, not necessarily a foolproof plan
13:32:28 <SchismXL[m]> Think we need a GOS off-topic channel lol
13:32:35 <f8sai[m]> Yeah lol
13:32:43 <progressive[m]> <pikey[m] "no it doesn't. the new law (newi"> The is soft with few password option for pc’s i don’t remenber the name. You type your password you boot up in your private os and if you type other password you boot into clean os, would be nice to have something simmilar on graphene
13:32:56 <progressive[m]> There is* sorry for my english
13:33:23 <f8sai[m]> <progressive[m] "The is soft with few password op"> Mutiple user exists
13:33:45 <progressive[m]> Nice to hear!
13:33:57 <f8sai[m]> But then, as usual precautionary measures, wipe your phones when crossing borders
13:34:07 <f8sai[m]> (Maybe they will look on other profiles so yeah)
13:35:13 <f8sai[m]> <f8sai[m] "Mutiple user exists"> You can just show a user with clean OS if that's what you mean
13:36:58 <dazinism> progressive: GrapheneOS users have to trust that Daniel knows what he's doing and that he has the signing keys well secured.
13:37:29 <progressive[m]> I know. We always have to believe in something but hard part is to choose in what to believe :)
13:37:50 <dazinism> Of course there are ways it could be compromised, but that is true of pretty much any device.
13:38:15 <f8sai[m]> <dazinism "Of course there are ways it coul"> Not even iOS is safe from this
13:39:25 <f8sai[m]> choose the lesser evil or something, choose which to trust/compromise a little more than others
13:39:36 <dazinism> If you look back at Daniels previous work its pretty clear they know what they are doing and have a very good understanding of computer security issues
13:39:37 <f8sai[m]> It all boils down to threat and trust model
13:40:53 <progressive[m]> We always have to think that someone car read our chats and do not disclose sensitive info, I think that would be the right thinking
13:45:13 <f8sai[m]> <progressive[m] "We always have to think that som"> some of the statements posted are referenced on the grapheneos.org though, nothing sensitive at all
13:46:26 <f8sai[m]> <progressive[m] "We always have to think that som"> But in general I would agree
13:49:21 <progressive[m]> Well guys thanks for your answers, I’m glad to be here
13:51:00 <dazinism> Technically iPhones & pixels give whats has to be the most secure/private (somewhat) general purpose computer operating systems ever
13:52:24 <dazinism> I think that if you are careful you can have reasonable confidence that they provide security/privacy of data and communications
13:54:14 <dazinism> But nothing is foolproof if a target is valuable enough to an attacker, and the attacker has enough resources, they can probably break it.
13:56:03 <progressive[m]> One more option would be never use what most people are using like signal, because sooner or later it will be the target (my opinion)
13:56:31 <progressive[m]> Blackberry hacked
13:56:31 <progressive[m]> Encrochat hacked
13:58:09 <dazinism> Yeah its kind of a weird balance. More people using something gives more of a chance that people who know how will be checking for vulnerabilities.
13:58:54 <dazinism> Also if something is actually good and secure more and more folks are likely to adopt it.
14:03:33 <progressive[m]> Even enigma cose was cracked :)
14:03:42 <progressive[m]> Code*
15:13:04 <lqdl66oi62[m]> I got an unlocked Pixel 3a yesterday but when I check Developer options, OEM unlocking is disabled. What should I do to unlock it?
15:15:13 <crueltekk[m]> lqdl66oi62 maybe the bootloader is unlocked? There should be a note to OEM Unlock if it is unlocked. If not you maybe got a Verizon one which is not unlocked.
15:16:00 <crueltekk[m]> And to my knowledge it Verizon ones can't be unlocked.
15:16:15 <crueltekk[m]> * And to my knowledge Verizon ones can't be unlocked.
15:16:21 <lqdl66oi62[m]> How can I know if I got a Verizon one or not?
15:17:29 <crueltekk[m]> <lqdl66oi62[m] "How can I know if I got a Verizo"> Check your Buildnumber
15:17:44 <Cyrinux[m]> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_3a#Models
15:22:25 <lqdl66oi62[m]> My buildnumber starts with QQ2A and it's not on the list, am I looking at the wrong page?
15:26:32 <f8sai[m]> Regulatory Lables
15:26:36 <f8sai[m]> labels*
15:27:59 <f8sai[m]> <lqdl66oi62[m] "How can I know if I got a Verizo"> Does a Pixel 4 have this Verizon model too?
15:28:09 <lqdl66oi62[m]> Ok mine's North America and not Verizon, nice to verify that
15:28:11 <f8sai[m]> If it ends in E, though lufk
15:28:15 <f8sai[m]> luck*
15:28:30 <f8sai[m]> But if not, try to update it
15:28:50 <f8sai[m]> Connect it to the internet, update it, then flash GOS
15:30:50 <lqdl66oi62[m]> I looked around all menus in settings but don't see an update button
15:31:13 <f8sai[m]> System, updates
15:31:52 <lqdl66oi62[m]> There's no updates in System on my screen
15:32:03 <lqdl66oi62[m]> Maybe cause I went through the app list and disabled every single app that has "Google" in its name?
15:33:30 <f8sai[m]> <lqdl66oi62[m] "Maybe cause I went through the a"> Probably
15:34:46 <lqdl66oi62[m]> Ok so which one do I need to restore to do an update?
15:36:32 <lqdl66oi62[m]> Just Google Play?
15:37:02 <nickcalyx[m]> Who knows
15:37:32 <nickcalyx[m]> If you dont have irreplacable data just do a factory reset
15:40:00 <f8sai[m]> Or... Get a factory image
15:40:13 <f8sai[m]> From Google itself for the latest sargo factory image
15:40:27 <f8sai[m]> If you are already comfortable flashing on fastbooy
15:40:31 <f8sai[m]> fastbooy
15:40:35 <f8sai[m]> fastboot*
15:40:46 <f8sai[m]> If you are already comfortable flashing on fastboot
15:41:15 <f8sai[m]> (Oh wait... I forgot the oem unlock not yet toggle-able)
15:41:17 <SchismXL[m]> crueltekk have you seen any update regarding the P4XL green refresh at low brightness? Saw your issue on github (https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/239). Got the same thing happening here. I think anupritaisno1 is maintaining that.
15:41:23 <f8sai[m]> Nvm
15:41:32 <nickcalyx[m]> Wont he need to unlock to flash the factory image
15:42:44 <f8sai[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Wont he need to unlock to flash "> Oh yeah, my apologies
15:43:18 <f8sai[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Wont he need to unlock to flash "> Well, if they can connect to internet and untoggle it maybe it would help
15:43:32 <f8sai[m]> Unless the 3a is refurbished to disable OEM unlock
15:44:15 <f8sai[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "If you dont have irreplacable da"> Well, this is the best option for now
15:44:25 <crueltekk[m]> <SchismXL[m] "crueltekk have you seen any upda"> No sorry, don't have any updates to that. Still the same problem. And maintainer of Pixel 4XL is paintedman I guess.
15:45:01 <SchismXL[m]> Ah okay, my mistake!
15:45:05 <crueltekk[m]> Next time add am @ in front of the nickname so the person can't miss it :)
15:45:20 <crueltekk[m]> * Next time add an @ in front of the nickname so the person can't miss it :)
15:45:53 <SchismXL[m]> Danke <3
15:46:23 <crueltekk[m]> At least another German :D
15:47:13 <SchismXL[m]> Haha, nah. Brit here. Just after our convo the other day, I remembered you are :p
15:48:03 <crueltekk[m]> Ah okay :D names are not my strength :D
15:52:30 <SchismXL[m]> Having a look at the issue, its definitely the gamma calibration at 90hz for the device. Battery saving mode puts the display to 60hz, which has a different calibration. If there were a toggle in settings to change the screen refresh rate (which may be an idea to save battery life without "battery saving" mode), it would be a temporary fix. Just noticed on github that Daniel made a comment actually
15:53:55 <SchismXL[m]> This issue was from always on display, but links to 239, crueltekk's bug:
15:53:55 <SchismXL[m]> "Each device needs to have their resource configuration ported over properly from the stock OS. There are already other issues like #238 and likely #239 tied to the same thing. Device maintainers need to extract the resource overlays from the stock OS and port them to GrapheneOS."
15:58:09 <lqdl66oi62[m]> I'm in system updates now but it keeps saying waiting for wifi although I'm connected to one.
16:02:19 <crueltekk[m]> Battery over 80%?
16:03:14 <lqdl66oi62[m]> Yes, it's full
16:05:29 <crueltekk[m]> Hmm try to start the update over mobile data (you can abort it, just turn off data) or open up a hotspot and try again.
16:18:47 <dazinism> lqdl66oi62: think  you have to have an internet connection to throw the OEM unlock toggle
16:22:37 <lqdl66oi62[m]> ok finally update is starting
16:22:55 <lqdl66oi62[m]> so I update, toggle OEM unlock then go to recovery mode?
16:24:36 <dazinism> lqdl66oi62: fastboot mode. Follow the instructions at grapheneos.org - they get regularly updated
16:24:40 <f8sai[m]> <lqdl66oi62[m] "so I update, toggle OEM unlock t"> fastboot
16:31:05 <lqdl66oi62[m]> looks like android finished downloading the update but takes long to install it
16:34:21 <lqdl66oi62[m]> I no longer need any Internet connection until I finish installing GrapheneOS do I?
16:36:23 <f8sai[m]> <lqdl66oi62[m] "I no longer need any Internet co"> Provided that you downloaded the necessary stuffs before flashing then yes
16:36:23 <SchismXL[m]> If you've downloaded everything already, then no.
16:36:34 <f8sai[m]> (fastboot and factory images)
16:46:35 <lqdl66oi62[m]> ok so my phone's in fastboot mode
16:47:08 <lqdl66oi62[m]> now I type fastboot flashing unlock on command line and just wait?
16:47:58 <crueltekk[m]> Just follow the instructions on the website. Nothing should go wrong
16:49:10 <lqdl66oi62[m]> ok I typed the command but I see no confirmation screen on phone and command line says waiting for any device
16:49:16 <lqdl66oi62[m]> nothing seems to be happening
16:51:25 <f8sai[m]> Go on
16:51:37 <f8sai[m]> Check fastboot --device
16:52:40 <lqdl66oi62[m]> command line says unknown option
16:53:57 <f8sai[m]> Oh
16:54:15 <f8sai[m]> You may want to read it fully before doing it again
16:54:31 <f8sai[m]> (The installation instructions)
16:54:31 <f8sai[m]> You need the platform tools files
16:57:24 <lqdl66oi62[m]> I'm sure I got the necessary files
16:57:33 <lqdl66oi62[m]> adb reboot bootloader works fine
16:58:17 <lqdl66oi62[m]> fastboot --version returns the version correctly

17:21:08 <jneplokh> <pikey[m] "Thanks Jacob, SchismXL and jknse"> Happy to help!
17:35:07 <lqdl66oi62[m]> still can't find a way around it
17:35:49 <lqdl66oi62[m]> As soon as adb reboot bootloader command is executed PC no longer recognizes my device
17:36:38 <crueltekk[m]> u need to use fastboot then instead of adb
17:37:08 <crueltekk[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install
17:37:14 <crueltekk[m]> read this site and follow instructions
17:38:40 <lqdl66oi62[m]> wait I got it in my 6th try
17:38:53 <lqdl66oi62[m]> not sure what changed but whatever
17:52:49 <passstab> is the Pixel 3a the only supported phone with a headphone jack?
17:53:26 <nickcalyx[m]> I believe so. maybe 3a XL has one too?
17:54:57 <passstab> is there any plan to support another one?
17:56:05 <nickcalyx[m]> It seems like Graphene is pixel-only for the forseeable future, so the question is will there be another pixel with a headphone jack
17:56:20 <crueltekk[m]> <passstab "is there any plan to support ano"> Newer ones didn't have a headphonejack
18:03:35 <pikey[m]> I wouild say 3a is last chance for a 3.5mm jack. Such a shame. Damn 'progress'!
18:03:57 <pikey[m]> gotta love the fingerprint on back too, so tactile and logical.
18:04:22 <pikey[m]> does anyone know how to delete an account on attestation.app?
18:04:36 <alex-resist> The 4a won't have a 3.5 mm jack?
18:04:41 <passstab> :( my current phone is a moto x4 and it arguably is better then the 3a.
18:04:53 <passstab> IIUC there will not be a 4a
18:05:27 <rover1[m]> 4a status unknown, delayed many times
18:05:42 <pikey[m]> <passstab ":( my current phone is a moto x4"> motos are awesome. i keep grabbing them for $20-30 on ebay already running lineageos. I know I know! I just use each one for one specific thing, like connecting to dashcam in car or wifi management app etc, often chinese apps and i like to give them a device all to themselves ;)
18:05:49 <alex-resist> I thought it was very recently scheduled for august 3
18:06:32 <passstab> I like it, but it isn't connecting to the computer to get updated and is stuck on lineage 15.1
18:07:21 <passstab> it is starting to do weird things, I need a new phone.

18:26:15 <spaceinfinite[m]> Is it true what he says that android is locking down same as ios
18:26:28 <geritol[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "Is it true what he says that and"> Kinda
18:26:47 <geritol[m]> Mostly apps that use Google services
18:26:50 <spaceinfinite[m]> And that custom roms will dissapear
18:26:58 <geritol[m]> Which is a ton of them
18:27:25 <geritol[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "And that custom roms will dissap"> They won't, but they are getting actively worse look at the stock apps even for a sign for that
18:27:38 <geritol[m]> Chromium, Calendar, Email
18:27:46 <spaceinfinite[m]> More concerned if they lock down prevent different os like graphene etc being installed
18:28:09 <geritol[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "More concerned if they lock down"> That won't happen at least entirely
18:28:09 <spaceinfinite[m]> Thats what he says anyway
18:28:21 <geritol[m]> It's becoming harder
18:28:43 <spaceinfinite[m]> Yea ... globalisation in everything
18:28:51 <geritol[m]> It's not the end of the world especially for GrapheneOS which doesn't even have safety net
18:28:58 <spaceinfinite[m]> If that made any sense
18:30:10 <geritol[m]> GrapheneOS is not effected by this specific issue
18:30:24 <geritol[m]> As there is no Google compatibility in the first place
18:30:24 <spaceinfinite[m]> Not now
18:30:42 <spaceinfinite[m]> But if google going the apple way then who knows
18:30:57 <spaceinfinite[m]> So android is not google?
18:31:20 <spaceinfinite[m]> Dont they control android aosp?
18:31:38 <geritol[m]> spaceinfinite: I wish Google would copy the privacy and security of Apple.. alas
18:31:53 <geritol[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "So android is not google?"> It kinda is mostly is
18:32:22 <geritol[m]> Android 11 is closed source right now and fully developed behind closed doors
18:32:29 <geritol[m]> It will become open source after release
18:32:36 <spaceinfinite[m]> Hmmm
18:32:39 <faxing[m]> It is made by Google but there is AOSP (the Android Open Source Project) that is also by Google that you can make to respect user privacy
18:32:43 <geritol[m]> Google is in total control. Chromium is actually open development
18:33:08 <spaceinfinite[m]> Maybe his fears are baseless then
18:33:09 <faxing[m]> it's what Graphene, Lineage, OmniROM, GlassROM, and all of that other stuff is based on at a core level
18:33:22 <spaceinfinite[m]> Yea i know that
18:33:40 <geritol[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "Maybe his fears are baseless the"> They absolutely aren't
18:34:06 <faxing[m]> they technically control the project, but that still doesn't change that it is a fully open source project
18:34:09 <faxing[m]> AOSP at least
18:34:13 <geritol[m]> Android is really not as open as it should be and it's getting much much worse
18:34:45 <geritol[m]> The closed source parts are becoming more and more important to apps and basic functionality
18:34:49 <SchismXL[m]> <geritol[m] "Android is really not as open as"> Which is why there are companies and people out there working on other hardware and software variants.
18:34:56 <faxing[m]> Something not being baseless does not necessarily mean likely or reasonable
18:35:26 <geritol[m]> Very few people can fully degoogle and now it is getting much much harder
18:35:37 <faxing[m]> but Graphene is
18:36:04 <spaceinfinite[m]> Hopefully wont happen
18:36:13 <geritol[m]> People on GrapheneOS already this shouldn't hurt much. People who haven't switched and need things that don't work would struggle more
18:37:16 <SchismXL[m]> Degoogling isn't as hard as people make out. It is just their reliance on the ecosystems that are already in place. If people reevaluated their expectations of what it is to leave the big corps behind, then perhaps things would be easier.
18:37:41 <geritol[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Degoogling isn't as hard as peop"> Many people need certain apps for work or their lifestyle
18:37:46 <faxing[m]> Also I don't think people realize that there are good alternatives out there
18:38:03 <geritol[m]> We are lucky we can

18:38:23 <SchismXL[m]> Google Maps seems to be the main one. People say "oh, but the navigation isn't as good on X, and you can never find Y" etc. But, if there was worldwide contributions from even 1% of users, many alternatives would be much, much better. OsmAnd is quality
18:38:37 * crueltekk[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/xWyqnLSsZzlOJCtHQTMPKVBl >
18:38:38 <SchismXL[m]> But, OsmAnd does have caveats.
18:38:46 <faxing[m]> OsmAnd still isn't that good
18:38:51 <geritol[m]> Google Maps can track so many people. You just can't match it
18:38:51 <alex-resist> The question is how CalyxOS will deal with those changes. They have somewhat promoted microG as a viable alternative
18:38:54 <faxing[m]> It can't do adresses really
18:39:07 <larncat[m]> Magic Earth is equivalent
18:39:48 <SchismXL[m]> <faxing[m] "It can't do adresses really "> Depends where you are in the world. Currently, in the UK, it is difficult to search with postcodes; however, with a user defined postcode add-on, it makes it perfect.

18:40:35 <geritol[m]> lqdl66oi62: what install guide did you use?
18:40:38 <crueltekk[m]> @lqdl
18:40:39 <faxing[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Depends where you are in the wor"> In the US, it is next to impossible to get anything more specific that a city or if you're really lucky a section of a city
18:40:46 <faxing[m]> at least where i am
18:40:56 <lqdl66oi62[m]> I've been following the official guide the entire time
18:40:56 <faxing[m]> and in the bordering states
18:41:07 <crueltekk[m]> lqdl66oi62:  Do you added fastboot to your path or enviorment?
18:41:23 <geritol[m]> Yeah I've struggled a lot in the US with alternatives I live with it
18:41:36 <geritol[m]> If my job relied on it that would suck
18:41:52 <faxing[m]> mhm
18:42:15 <lqdl66oi62[m]> I don't think so
18:42:18 <faxing[m]> I had to ask someone who had an iPhone who I was with to use Apple Maps for it
18:42:21 <lqdl66oi62[m]> How do I do that
18:42:33 <crueltekk[m]> lqdl66oi62:  Linux or Windows?
18:42:39 <lqdl66oi62[m]> Win10
18:43:04 <faxing[m]> Cause OsmAnd was just not near precise enough
18:43:24 <crueltekk[m]> lqdl66oi62: https://www.xda-developers.com/adb-fastboot-any-directory-windows-linux/
18:47:10 <SchismXL[m]> @faxing:matrix.org: we're getting pretty off topic for this channel. We can discuss it more in the PrivacyTools Privacy Discussion group, if you'd like?
18:48:40 <lqdl66oi62[m]> Thanks now flashing does work
18:49:03 <lqdl66oi62[m]> So now all I need to do is stay calm and don't touch anything until the process is over?
18:50:20 <SchismXL[m]> <lqdl66oi62[m] "So now all I need to do is stay "> Lol :)
18:50:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> Osmand can get you in the general location of anything you can find on DuckDuckGo's map tab, faxing
18:51:01 <crueltekk[m]> lqdl66oi62: After flashing is done you will see "Press any key to exit..." in your commandline. The Phone gets back to bootloader, just lock the bootloader again and start bootup
18:52:13 <cyborgninjaneer[> You can get OpenStreetMap directions from DDG, then copy the coordinates to OsmAnd if desired. It usually works well enough.
18:52:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> Or just run your navigation in Vanadium...
18:52:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> Either way.
18:53:48 <cyborgninjaneer[> Duckduckgo searches Apple maps, which are privacy respecting and quite good these daya
18:53:53 <cyborgninjaneer[> Days*
18:54:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you want to avoid F-Droid for highest possible security, just use DDG and navigate with your browser.
18:54:53 <cyborgninjaneer[> Specifically Vanadium.
18:54:56 <lqdl66oi62[m]> yes it boots
18:55:18 <lqdl66oi62[m]> Is Google logo showing up for a few seconds normal behavior during boot?
18:55:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yes
18:55:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> Google hardware running GrapheneOS will show both logos during boot
18:56:01 <cyborgninjaneer[> As well as a warning screen about modified software
18:56:52 <lqdl66oi62[m]> how does it automatically recognize my time zone though
18:56:57 <lqdl66oi62[m]> feels like magic
18:58:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> I don't remember exactly, but Daniel was careful to do it in the most private way possible

19:01:44 <cyborgninjaneer[> > it's kinda spooky that it's possible in the first place without any kind of internet connection
19:01:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> Not really. I mean, GPS is a completely passive sensor.
19:04:02 <lqdl66oi62[m]> oh so gps is always turned on?
19:27:20 <strcat[m]> that's not what they said
19:28:06 <strcat[m]> lqdl66oi62: it recognizes your time zone because you're connected to a cellular network
19:28:23 <strcat[m]> there is no time zone detection based on location or based on internet access (not sure how that would work)
19:30:51 <lqdl66oi62[m]> what? I have no sim inserted though
19:43:27 <lqdl66oi62[m]> Anyways thank you so much guys for helping me throughout the entire installation process :)
19:44:01 <lqdl66oi62[m]> gotta spread the word now
19:59:26 <LinusSexTips[m]> <rover1[m] "switching profiles end processes"> Same question
20:23:09 <madaidan[m]1> <rover1[m] "switching profiles end processes"> No
20:31:44 <zoraver[m]> WiFi calling works fine for me on GrapheneOS
21:10:34 <rover1[m]> <madaidan[m]1 "No"> reboot after switching does?
21:12:25 <spaceinfinite[m]> <rover1[m] "reboot after switching does?"> It logs off the profile
21:12:48 <spaceinfinite[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "It logs off the profile"> So it wont connect in the background
22:07:12 <marquisderad[m]> If using Graphene in a corporate environment how much of an attack surface does MDM open up?
22:07:18 <marquisderad[m]> Would a better solution be a fork of Graphene with the ability to install unapproved apks, use a web browser or external email restricted at that level?
22:09:45 <marquisderad[m]> I'm thinking that an MDM opens the potential for a lot of exploits should the MDM itself become compromised
22:10:54 <marquisderad[m]> That being said I'm not even sure that something like Blackberry UEM would function with Play Services
