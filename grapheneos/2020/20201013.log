00:52:22 <adeus[m]> Anyway to share file or text between profiles without going thru internet ?
00:54:57 <louipc> usb storage?
00:56:57 <adeus[m]> <louipc "usb storage?"> I set usb to allow new when unlocked in admin account then I set it to disable new and switched to profile and usb does not work.
01:18:10 <louipc> i dont understand
01:25:07 <adeus[m]> Damn
01:25:19 <adeus[m]> I been spending the day setting up new Graphene OS phone
01:27:21 <adeus[m]> Mainly because the power of the work profile feature that lets you end sessions and eject encryption keys per account I thought was amazing opportunity compartmentalize different purposes to ensure at any one time only what is necessary is running. So I have personal, business and PIM and crypto. It seems you can only have two “active” at any one time so more than two the other “active” profiles automatically end
01:27:21 <adeus[m]> logout.
01:29:03 <strcat[m]> adeus: the default is 3 active profiles
01:29:18 <strcat[m]> user profiles and work profiles are different things
01:29:46 <strcat[m]> and note the owner account can't be logged out once logged in
01:30:14 <strcat[m]> so primarily for that reason, ideally you mostly use other profiles (like a secondary personal profile rather than using owner for that)
01:30:19 <strcat[m]> although then you have to unlock 2 profiles on boot
01:30:34 <strcat[m]> but only on boot so not that inconvenient
01:30:58 <strcat[m]> and if you used same passphrase for the owner account and secondary main one it shouldn't hurt
01:44:08 <adeus[m]> <strcat[m] "adeus: the default is 3 active p"> 3 active profiles including the main “admin” right? So two active user profiles ? Is anyway to increase this to 4?
01:44:42 <adeus[m]> <strcat[m] "so primarily for that reason, id"> Correct I down use the admin/owner profile for anything now.
01:46:21 <adeus[m]> The ability to add additional user profiles is not new. What is incredibly amazing about recent update is you can end a session and eject encryption key without having to do full reboot. For those of us that follow rules of compartmentalization this is so powerful! Main issue now is limit on how many active profiles. Anyway around this ?
02:22:37 <strcat[m]> we could raise it
02:22:38 <strcat[m]> ourselves
02:22:39 <strcat[m]> in GrapheneOS
02:23:09 <strcat[m]> we patch it to enable the logout feature as standard
02:23:21 <strcat[m]> instead of just something for device managers that are device owners
06:54:02 <pencildeek> So today I made a second profile with everything that I have on my administrative profile. How do I best utilize this second profile? Should I delete my apps off the main profile and just use the second? Should I share phone and text with the second profile in the profile settings?or keep those separate
08:26:01 <lickidysplit7[m]> <pencildeek "So today I made a second profile"> Yes delete all the apps off your "admin" profile and use the secondary profile when you need to use these apps.
08:26:42 <lickidysplit7[m]> Keep ur phone and texts separate in the main profile if your using GSM and accepting phone calls / text over sim carrier
08:56:28 <antiquare> Hi there. I am wondering if grapheneos has any history of paying for features. I understand that you can donate to the project but wondering if there are any channels to go down when looking for specific feature s
08:58:26 <dazinism> lickidysplit7Theres usability issues with doing it that way and not sure how much there is to gain.
09:00:08 <dazinism> Still can receive calls and if you got the contact details in the secondary profile you can see whos calling, but you don't get a notification of missed calls until you open the main user profile
09:01:14 <dazinism> Not sure about SMS. Think likely you may not get any notification till you change user. I'll test now....
09:14:22 <dazinism> Yes, as suspected no kind of notifications in the secondary user when an SMS is received.
09:37:12 <pikey[m]> Since the last update i notice Vinyl Music Player app crashes as soon as its opened, It can't run at all. Does anyone know if this is an issue with the app or the OS?
09:46:00 <sphinxcat[m]> [pikey](https://matrix.to/#/@pikey:matrix.org): Are you using the latest Vinyl version? (0.24.1)
09:52:40 <pikey[m]> thanks sphinx. i couldn't find the version but i just found it by tap hold the icon and advanced. 0.23
09:52:52 <pikey[m]> i guess i need to update (blush)
09:53:00 <pikey[m]> any idea how i do that? (blush harder)
09:58:34 <sphinxcat[m]> <pikey[m] "any idea how i do that? (blush h"> Depends on where did you download it from. Either from Aurora Store (Play store) or F-Droid.
09:58:55 <pikey[m]> i got it from fdroid
09:59:25 <sphinxcat[m]> [pikey](https://matrix.to/#/@pikey:matrix.org): https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/VinylMusicPlayer/issues/288 seems to be the issue that is fixed in latest release.
09:59:27 <pikey[m]> i spent hours setting up playlists with 60GB of music , updates make me nervous as i dont want to have to do that again! used to iphone in the past
09:59:37 <pikey[m]> cool yeah thats the issue
10:34:22 <pikey[m]> Dammit! Installed fdroid update for Vinyl music player. Tracks and albums are there, but the playlists disappeared, thats where i had all my stuff sorted which took hours. grrr
10:48:56 <sphinxcat[m]> [pikey](https://matrix.to/#/@pikey:matrix.org) Sorry, should've mentioned that you could try to back up app data with Seedvault (included in GrapheneOS). Not sure if Vinyl allows all of its data to be backed-up though.
10:52:51 <engulf[m]> <sphinxcat[m] "[pikey](https://matrix.to/#/@pik"> That would not work as the f-droid versions signature is different from the play stores
10:53:23 <engulf[m]> > <@sphinxcat:matrix.org> [pikey](https://matrix.to/#/@pikey:matrix.org) Sorry, should've mentioned that you could try to back up app data with Seedvault (included in GrapheneOS). Not sure if Vinyl allows all of its data to be backed-up though.
10:53:23 <engulf[m]>  * That would not work as the f-droid versions signature is different from the one from play store
11:09:56 <kopolee11[m]> <lickidysplit7[m] "Yes delete all the apps off your"> One thing I noticed is that two apps I use don't seem to work on secondary profiles. Specifically Shelter and Termux.
11:15:07 <pikey[m]> i haven't heard of seedvault. is that a new thing in latest Graphene relase?
11:15:44 <pikey[m]> gonna try androidfiletransfer (on mac here), see if the folder of playlists is still tehre and can be nudged to right place or something. can't believe  i lost playlist!
11:16:31 <pikey[m]> too busy right now but dying to learn how to backup my pixel. need to for normal reasons but also becaue i want to move to 4a asap and need a full backup first. not sure how to do it but i know its doable so will have to get learning
11:17:33 <sphinxcat[m]> <pikey[m] "i haven't heard of seedvault. is"> It has been included since https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.03.23.22
11:18:41 <pikey[m]> where would be best place i could go to learn about this, seedvault and how to backup and restore graphene phones. is there a guide anywhere or just get duckducking
11:45:33 <dazinism> pikey: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
11:46:33 <pikey[m]> thanks Daz. will have a read of that with interest
11:46:55 <pikey[m]> i dont suppose you know how to easily invert the colours to light mode? i can't read it until i suss that
11:50:57 <louipc> maybe disable css styles
11:51:48 <louipc> hmm not so straightforward
11:56:52 <randombloke[m]> if in chrome, install a high-contrast extension that applies contrast templates (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/high-contrast/djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph)
11:57:18 <randombloke[m]> firefox and others should have similar addons available
12:13:02 <louipc> surprised there isnt a website that will do this
12:23:13 <io_23[m]> Does SIM cards work on Graphene?
12:23:22 <lpcvoid[m]1> yes, they work
12:23:30 <io_23[m]> OK Thanks
13:41:34 <Sellerie> Does the grapheneos kernel include wireguard?
13:42:02 <Sellerie> Or is it generally rather recommended to use the userspace variant via Android's VPN backend?
13:48:38 <zfnmxt> https://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support
14:28:58 <Sellerie> Thanks
14:44:35 <kjhlkjhlkjhl> Would using another launcher like Blloc launcher defeat the purpose of GrapheneOS?
14:46:32 <dazinism> pikey: if you are looking on phone there is colour inversion  in accessed settings
14:46:58 <dazinism> *the android accessibility settings
14:55:38 <Sellerie> kjhlkjhlkjhl: i dont see the reason why another launcher would defeat the purpose of GOS
14:56:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Sellerie "Or is it generally rather recomm"> There is a CAF driver that causes a kernel panic when a kernelspace wireguard tunnel is brought up
14:56:32 <Sellerie> anupritaisno1[m]: wtf
14:56:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> It will not be supported until google ships a kernel that has support for it
14:56:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Sellerie "anupritaisno1: wtf"> Well it is clearly some kind of issue with wireguard itself
14:57:09 <Sellerie> I see
14:57:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember that the CAF driver was just there, we are adding wireguard
14:57:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> So in a loose sense if it breaks we will need to find a way to fix it
14:58:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> * So in a way a driver we added conflicted with a driver that had no issues before. We need a proper fix before we can include wireguard
15:01:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW we don't ship that driver yet on graphene
15:01:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> It needs to be determined if stock ships it first
15:40:43 <res4[m]> flash-all doesn't work for me.
15:40:43 <res4[m]> PowerShell says the term Faltboot is not recognized.
15:40:52 <res4[m]> *fastboot
15:42:05 <res4[m]> I also get a "fastboot too old" error message, but I just downloaded it today.
15:53:03 <p00l00p[m]> add your android-tools folder into your PATH
15:53:33 <p00l00p[m]> and don't use android-tools from every distro EXCEPT arch (if you're on linux)
15:59:45 <pencildeek> lickidysplit7Theres usability issues with doing it that way and not sure how much there is to gain. I would like to use GSM with my second profile. Is that more advisable? Sorry I'm just trying to understand the use of a second profile and don't want to botch it up
16:11:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> <p00l00p[m] "and don't use android-tools from"> Dude he said windows
16:13:38 <res4[m]> Thank you, that was a stupid mistake.
16:24:20 <res4[m]> <p00l00p[m] "and don't use android-tools from"> Installation successful, thanks for the help.
16:29:08 <brockin042[m]> Bug maybe, pixel xl 2 beta build. Bluetooth headphone volume extremely low. Yes, I checked volume settings and tried different head phones.
16:30:55 <p00l00p[m]> <res4[m] "Installation successful, thanks "> you're welcome :P
16:40:04 <Pencildeek>  I would like to use GSM with my second profile. Is that more advisable?
16:43:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Pencildeek](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_Pencildeek:matrix.org) no
16:45:26 <Pencildeek> so basically you use the GSM/SIM for the main profile and web, music apps etc, for the second profile?
16:45:57 <Pencildeek> i'm very new to this
17:00:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Pencildeek "so basically you use the GSM/SIM"> Oh that
17:00:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah you can use the main profile for that
17:02:11 <Pencildeek> do you what the benefit of keeping the SIM seperated from the second profile are?
17:02:23 <Pencildeek> And thank you for the reply
17:04:36 <pl3x> Hello, quick question is there a way to get Wickr with F-Droid on GrapheneOS?
17:07:22 <Linux-Love> …
17:07:32 <Linux-Love> iLinux OS https://ilinuxos.com - New Debian 10 (Stable) based distro with 500 Apps Pre-installed that runs from USB Stick!
18:39:11 <pikey[m]> Does anyone know if it is possible to roll back vinyl music player to last version. Lost all my playlists and not easy to do it all again by hand.
18:41:19 <burningdaemon[m]> Yes
18:41:37 <burningdaemon[m]> In f droid. Scroll down and tap in the Version you want
18:42:10 <burningdaemon[m]> I had the same problem
18:49:54 <trismous[m]> Linux-Love: That is offtopic. It doesn't belong in the main channel.
19:06:55 <Volkoz[m]> seems like a bot
19:19:20 <pikey[m]> Riot notifications not working for me sorru
19:19:39 <pikey[m]> <burningdaemon[m] "I had the same problem"> Did reverting fix your playlists?
19:25:34 <burningdaemon[m]> <pikey[m] "Did reverting fix your playlists"> Yes. Cause they were not deleted. My playlist was broken , had no name and no tags. In the changelog the dev mentioned that songs without tag don't show up properly.
19:37:55 <pikey[m]> Hmm. Thanks but not sure how I can make my playlists work in new version then. I am certainlu not about to 'tag' (whatever that is) 64,000 tracks!
19:38:09 <pikey[m]> Where can I contact devs?
19:38:58 <Sheru[m]> <pikey[m] "Hmm. Thanks but not sure how I c"> Hmmm, no way to retrieve unless it is backed up, and the app is reinstalled
19:39:15 <Sheru[m]> Seedvault should prompt or something, given the app is in same signature
19:40:25 <pikey[m]> I am sure you are trying to make a point but if so try again as it flew over my head
19:40:43 <pikey[m]> Never seen seedvault.
19:41:01 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, well, did you use backup function?
19:42:00 <pikey[m]> I have never used any backup function

19:44:52 <pikey[m]> I haven't sussed backups yet
19:45:39 <pikey[m]> But I doubt vinyl updated deleted folders so hopefully rolling back might help. Or maybe I can drag folders out with android file transfer which is how I saved stuff off phone before
22:57:44 <Pencildeek> Can someone please explain the why it's best for security to not have calls and texts connected to the second profile. It's a bit of a pain going back and forth to check messages.
23:00:50 <louipc> because then spies can look at all of your stuff more easily. But thats up to you how you want to set it up. maybe the second profile has access and the third one doesnt.
23:01:14 <louipc> increasing restriction per profile
23:03:52 <Pencildeek> Can you please give me an idea of a setup that would be used for these profiles to make them secure and reasonable. Maybe profile one is for GSM. Two is for web browsing and three???
23:04:49 <louipc> three for camera only maybe
23:05:01 <Pencildeek> any insight into how a seasoned user would use them?
23:05:35 <louipc> better to discuss at #grapheneos-offtopic now
23:05:39 <Pencildeek> Ok. That sounds reasonable
