01:16:21 <dazinism> charlesql: can force stop apps in main user profile to stop them, can restart phone to stop apps in other user profiles
01:17:09 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
01:18:31 <spoonhoarder82[m> Thanks nikitalita! Forgive my n00biness, when reading that thread it sounds like VoLTE will work out of the box with no changes on Verizon, do I have that right?
01:18:31 <spoonhoarder82[m> Also, it seems unclear on WiFi calling.  Is that working for anyone with a P4xl?
01:18:34 <dazinism> Think there are settings that could do this better, just nothing exposed to users
01:19:31 <dazinism> Talking killing user profiles, rather than WiFi calling
01:19:49 <nikitalita[m]> spoonhoarder82: I think? It looks like he's gotten the changes required for verizon into the image but I haven't tested it so I don't know
01:20:05 <nikitalita[m]> Dunno about wifi calling
01:23:35 <nikitalita[m]> Also, not sure about the activation part; you may have to activate the new phone first on stock android to provision VoLTE before reflashing with grapheneos
01:36:43 <nikitalita[m]> I may have to get a couple of burner pixels and some prepaid sims to test this one of these days
01:40:21 <charlesql[m]> <dazinism "Think there are settings that co"> Thank you! This is helpful.
02:00:09 <luna> Hi grapheneOS people. I just joined you.
02:00:29 <cn3m[m]> luna: ehllo
02:00:33 <cn3m[m]> hello* I can't spell
02:00:49 <luna> Haha, I was just taking it the canadian way.
02:00:56 <luna> or is that british?
02:01:19 <dazinism> Burner Pixels? ðŸ¤³ðŸ”¥  ðŸ˜®
02:01:53 <dazinism> hey luna
02:03:32 <luna> How does everyone handle the apps that expect google services for notifications? Or is the answer "you don't"?
02:04:22 <cn3m[m]> no solution right now
02:04:28 <cn3m[m]> an offline fallback could be added
02:04:30 <cn3m[m]> if someone cared
02:04:45 <luna> What would it take to create?
02:04:54 <cn3m[m]> not much xD
02:04:59 <cn3m[m]> ideally it would be absolutely tiny
02:05:13 <cn3m[m]> it would spoof the signature only and send the no connection error to the app
02:05:22 <cn3m[m]> you would add a toggle per app to fake gapps
02:05:32 <renlord> signature spoofing is not the direction we wanna take
02:05:49 <luna> Oh, I meant that needs the notification server to know if a message was recieved, for example.
02:06:14 <mero> Test
02:06:21 <luna> test success?
02:06:42 <renlord> you can just stub out the api, but if there's a hard dependency on it, the app might just not work
02:07:04 <renlord> the best way is to raise this as an issue with the app developer
02:07:10 <cn3m[m]> yeah I meant a stub as an offline fallback only
02:07:20 <luna> Is it? let's see if someone else has, then.
02:07:26 <mero> Yes matrix is a protocol for end to end encryption correct?
02:07:44 <renlord> mero: #grapheneos-offtopic
02:07:44 <cn3m[m]> <mero "Yes matrix is a protocol for end"> sure, you can do that. Makes no sense for public rooms
02:08:40 <mero> Is grapheneos working on integrating that into the default messaging and phone apps?
02:08:57 <renlord> mero: no
02:09:09 <cn3m[m]> <mero "Is grapheneos working on integra"> out of scope
02:09:09 <mero> would it be possible?
02:09:14 <renlord> mero: no
02:09:49 <mero> Ok. Just curious. First day with a grapheneOS phone
02:10:08 <renlord> that'd be analagous to asking signal to be integrated as the default SMS app.
02:10:20 <renlord> and no, we wont do that.
02:10:29 <renlord> users pick wtv app they want to use for their purposes
02:10:56 <luna> That makes me curious, how is the default app chosen, then? Just the AOSP app?
02:11:12 <mero> isnâ€™t librem 5 trying it?
02:11:20 <renlord> usually yes, unless the stock aosp app is too old and needs to be replaced
02:11:32 <renlord> mero: we dont compare ourselves to librem and librem is offtopic
02:12:04 <mero> Iâ€™m wondering if such a thing is possible is all.
02:14:22 <mero> Also, I am attempting to install a fiverr APK to grapheneOS. But it crashes on launch. Iâ€™m assuming it is trying to use Google Play Services or something to that effect, but wondering if someone else had a better idea
02:15:03 <luna> That doesn't usually crash apps, does it? Normally I'm just given warnings that tell me it is needd.
02:15:26 <mero> Not sure, first day off an iphone
02:15:55 <mero> Was hoping to use fiverr as I use that app a lot and like the notifications
02:16:45 <luna> Found an APK, got it from Aurora store, some other store?
02:17:20 <mero> Apkpure?
02:20:58 <nikitalita[m]> I wouldn't recommend installing apps from unofficial sources like apkpure; use the aurora store you need to get something from the play store
02:31:10 <luna> Has anyone else had notification sounds not function when first installed?
02:32:37 <luna> and ringtone and alarm sounds... I can play music just fine. Not sure what all the alternative sounds are called as a whole.
02:38:13 <renlord> luna: i used to have that problem
02:38:28 <renlord> but it went away, couldnt really collect the logs for it to figure out the problem
02:38:52 <renlord> since it happens once in a while only and by the time i plug it in to collect the logs, the problem doesnt show anymore
02:39:28 <luna> Strange.... So like a thing that comes/goes with the next update or something?
02:40:14 <renlord> no
02:40:28 <renlord> luna: you're on the pixel3xl?
02:40:56 <luna> No, pixel 3a.
02:41:01 <renlord> it doesnt come and go with updates.
02:41:19 <renlord> its just been ongoing but no one have been able to capture the logs and figure out why it happens
02:41:26 <luna> I see.
02:41:28 <renlord> ok, i havent seen ti happen on my 3a
02:41:46 <luna> Think just reinstalling is worth doing?
02:42:08 <luna> (doesn't want to, but can)
02:43:27 <renlord> usually rebooting makes it go away
02:43:33 <renlord> no need to reinstall
02:43:35 <luna> No.. tried that.
02:44:43 <renlord> can you capture the logs?
02:45:01 <renlord> capture a bug report
02:45:41 <luna> If you can instruct me on how. Never done that for android.
02:49:44 <renlord> dev options, enable bug report capture, then power button, there should be an option to capture a bug report
02:50:02 <luna> okay...
02:51:04 <luna> capturing...
02:54:05 <luna> Where do I share to?
02:54:39 <renlord> you can send it to me by email
02:54:52 <luna> Can certainly try. What email?
02:54:59 <renlord> pm-ed
02:55:17 <mero> Test
02:56:31 <mero> Was disconnected. Downloaded Aurora store. Fiverr is not in it, do I need a seperate repositor
02:56:35 <luna> Success?
02:56:41 <mero> repository
02:56:57 <luna> So it isn't in the google play store to begin with?
02:57:20 <mero> Hmm. I doubt that
02:58:42 <mero> Looks like I'm only connected to the fdroid repos at the moment
02:59:13 <luna> Yeah, I see it on the aurora store.
02:59:23 <luna> Then you are on fdroid?
03:00:32 <mero> Which repo do I need?
03:00:50 <luna> Aurora store is in the regular fdroid repos.
03:02:20 <nikitalita[m]> to be clear: there are two Aurora apps: Aurora Store and Aurora Droid
03:03:22 <nikitalita[m]> Aurora Store lets you download and install apps from the play store, Aurora Droid is an alternative to F-Droid which lets you install apps from F-Droid repositories
03:04:05 <nikitalita[m]> (I find Aurora Droid to be better than F-Droid, it tends to be more responsive)
03:05:29 <mero> OK. I activated all repos in aurora waiting for them to sync
03:09:09 <mero> I see now, downloading aurora store
03:09:32 <nikitalita[m]> cool
03:12:04 <mero> Still crashing
03:12:40 <nikitalita[m]> Fiverr is, after you installed the app from the Aurora Store?
03:12:52 <mero> Yes
03:13:00 <spoonhoarder82[m> <nikitalita[m] "spoonhoarder82: I think? It look"> Glad I wasn't the only one it wasn't clear too haha.
03:14:22 <nikitalita[m]> I don't have verizon, so I can't, unfortunately
03:14:57 <nikitalita[m]> spoonhoarder82: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/ search here for volte and see if anyone else has talked about it
03:16:12 <nikitalita[m]> mero: it may just require google play services, unfortunately
03:20:34 <mero> It says GSF dependant, but most apps on there say that. Possible to check the logs ?
03:21:21 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, you can do that
03:22:43 <mero> https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/135267/
03:25:03 <nikitalita[m]> mero: you can run adb logcat then attempt to run the app, stop it after it crashes, then see what you get in the logs
03:26:14 <renlord> just want to bring everyone's attention if you used nextcloud as your backup solution
03:26:16 <renlord> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/257
03:26:22 <renlord> it is not 100% reliable (yet)
03:26:46 <renlord> and we're monitoring/following upstream closely
03:26:57 <nikitalita[m]> ah, that sucks
03:27:08 <mero> Searching for adb logcat not seeing it
03:27:12 <nikitalita[m]> oh well, we'll wait for the fix
03:28:25 <luna> Well.. Fits my "convenience" threat model at the moment. Fine by me!
03:28:28 <luna> For now...
03:31:01 <nikitalita[m]> mero: you can try turning it down to just "error" verbosity to see what errors you get at the time of the crash, it may not be tagging fiverr in them: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat
03:41:59 <lev[m]> I can't tell if I'm just being an idiot, but I can't get the guardian repo to work in fdroid in my other user profile
03:42:34 <lev[m]> I get the error about being unable to download the index.jar, even though I'm using the default repo included
03:42:58 <lev[m]> I've only found a few references to this online, nothing was particularly useful
03:43:50 <nikitalita[m]> lev: just tested it myself on my main profile, can't get the index from the guardian project, their repo may just be having issues atm
03:43:53 <lev[m]> if I had downloaded fdroid from the aurora store, would that have this effect? something about differing signing keys?
03:43:58 <lev[m]> oh hmm
03:44:14 <lev[m]> my main profile seemed to just work, but let me check again
03:45:13 <lev[m]> oh dang yeah it failed.. hmmm
03:45:41 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, probably an issue on their end
03:50:05 <lev[m]> well that's not great
03:50:30 <lev[m]> maybe just a blip, I swear I saw it succeed earlier
03:51:59 <nikitalita[m]> I dunno
03:53:52 <nikitalita[m]> noticing similar issues crop up with other repos; libretro's repo has been down for like 4 days
03:54:32 <nikitalita[m]> though that may be just a hosting issue
03:55:39 <lev[m]> oh heh, I actually just installed retroarch via aurora; I didn't even know they had a repo for fdroid
03:56:13 <nikitalita[m]> they don't recommend getting it from the play store any more because they're not gonna be able to push more updates
03:56:37 <nikitalita[m]> they started enforcing the "can't download executable code from outside the play store" rule on them
03:56:57 <nikitalita[m]> and they can't pack it into the apk on the play store because it would increase its file size over the limit
03:57:09 <nikitalita[m]> so they're kinda screwed right now unless they rearchitect the app
03:57:58 <lev[m]> dang, that's no good
03:58:09 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
04:00:00 <nikitalita[m]> you can download the apk from their website though
04:04:21 <lev[m]> hmm seems not
04:04:46 <nikitalita[m]> ?
04:04:51 <lev[m]> I mean they intend you to be able to, but the server is horked
04:05:08 <lev[m]> cf 521
04:05:16 <nikitalita[m]> ah, son of a bitch
04:05:17 <nikitalita[m]> https://www.libretro.com/
04:07:11 <nikitalita[m]> very curious timing
04:07:59 <lev[m]> jeez... what kind of emotionally damaged weirdo do you have to be to target a group like that
04:08:28 <lev[m]> why, what does this line up with?
04:09:13 <lev[m]> oh the play store thing
04:09:19 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
04:09:23 <nikitalita[m]> probably just a coincidence
04:10:07 <nikitalita[m]> the emulator scene in general has problems with... sociopaths with irrational grudges
04:11:31 <lev[m]> yeah I guess I could see that tbh, retro gaming already attracts a singular type
04:12:04 <lev[m]> I could see it spanning from "nostalgic" to "unable to move on emotionally from 1995"
04:12:40 <nikitalita[m]> heh, yeah

22:06:07 <spoonhoarder82[m> On the topic of WiFi calling and VoLTE, I made some calls and did some SIM switching with friends.  I CAN CONFIRM that on the unlocked Pixel 4XL both Wifi calling and VoLTE works out of the box ON Verizon.  This even works without setting it up on ASOP first. It worked for me (and in theory should for anyone else) to just SIM swap with GrapheneOS to Verizon and WiFi calling+Volte works great.
22:06:31 <spoonhoarder82[m> It also works with at least one Verizon reseller.
22:07:05 <spoonhoarder82[m> Might want to update the QA on the site with that info once maybe a few more people confirm it isn't just a 1 off for me.
22:07:43 <spoonhoarder82[m> I can also say that neither WiFi calling noe VoLTE work on AT&T or any of the resellers we tries at all.
22:09:28 <spoonhoarder82[m> I was told that maybe if you buy a phone from AT&T and the swap the IMEI it may work, but I am not in a position to try that
22:13:26 <cdesai> spoonhoarder82[m: Wi-Fi Calling and VoLTE would work on the Google OS that you get out of the box. Are you saying that it's also working on GrapheneOS for you (I _think_ VoLTE might, but not sure about wifi calling)
22:18:12 <nickcalyx[m]> Why not ask att tech support
22:21:41 <spoonhoarder82[m> On Verizon, VoLTE and WiFi calling work on both stock AND GrapheneOS with no changes
22:22:38 <spoonhoarder82[m> On AT&T, it will not work on stock without the IMEI thing.  And I have no idea if even then it would work with GrapheneOS.  It doesn't work at all as of now
22:24:55 <spoonhoarder82[m> Happy yo help in whatever limited way I can as a non-coder n00b
23:12:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> spoonhoarder82: WiFi calling is fixed on glassrom
23:13:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> But nobody wants to help clean up my patch so I can't send it to grapheneos yet
23:13:46 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: got a link?
23:13:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> And tbh I don't have much interest in that patch either
23:14:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://github.com/GlassROM-devices/android-prepare-vendor/commits/lineage-17.1
23:15:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's a mess
23:16:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I have more cleanup commits locally
23:16:07 <cdesai> https://github.com/GlassROM-devices/android-prepare-vendor/commit/3462b9d70b72fd1e33825a2f66d203ec426320fc yeah that could definitely be trimmed down quite a bit
23:17:00 <cdesai> re: refresh rate control - an older apk works, january iirc.
23:17:00 <cdesai> but we should something oss, it'll be useful everywhere
23:17:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh cdesai I'd start by comparing the blob list on guacamole as a reference
23:17:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wifi calling is fine there
23:17:59 <cdesai> wfcactivation stands out, that just sounds like wifi calling
23:17:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Same SoC
23:18:15 <cdesai> it's fine on lineage on pixels too, but that has this same list / something similar.
23:18:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need to remove Oslo feedback
23:19:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> And there's an XML that declares esim that I didn't remove
23:20:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: an easy test is to install aurora store
23:20:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Any apps that are being updated
23:20:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Probably shouldn't be there in the ROM
23:21:08 <mxnorvak[m]> Does anyone know which Pixel 4a model I should avoid and which one is fine so that OEM unlocking is not locked?
23:21:35 <nickcalyx[m]> Dont buy it from verizon
23:21:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> mxnorvak: for now don't
23:21:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can't buy one at the moment
23:22:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nobody else is stepping up to maintain
23:22:17 <mxnorvak[m]> It's okay i know
23:22:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also have time issues rn
23:22:48 <mxnorvak[m]> Tnx for maintaining Pixel 4 and 4 XL
23:23:34 <mxnorvak[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Dont buy it from verizon"> Thanks, i guess ordering from Google will be fine then yeah?
23:29:53 <nickcalyx[m]> Yes for sure
23:59:01 <mxnorvak[m]> Thanks
