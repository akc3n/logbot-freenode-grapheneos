00:32:47 <TheJollyRoger-M> Bridge test.
00:33:02 <TheJollyRoger-M> Huh wow. I don't see foos from the other side.
00:33:34 <JTL> I noticed that too
00:33:58 <TheJollyRoger-M> Might have to wait until tomorrow. :(
00:34:08 <TheJollyRoger-M> Glad to see you guys got it working!!
00:35:02 <TheJollyRoger-M> foos: oh no it's not your problem, sometimes what happens is that matrix seems to forget someone in a room is in the irc channel.
00:35:40 <TheJollyRoger-M> Usually this problem sorts itself out eventually and it goes away on its own.
00:37:16 <TheJollyRoger-M> I like to joke that between being bridged by IRC and Matrix I get about maybe 60% of the messages sent to me :)
00:41:26 <greenmoon[m]> I'm uninstalling the riotx app, it use too much battery, 22% of my phone battery over the last 2 days while I barely use it, there should be a feature to poll the server only when you  open the app instead of constanly!
00:41:43 <greenmoon[m]> Maybe the other riot app have this feature, not sure
00:44:54 <greenmoon[m]> I'm going to try minivector instead
00:51:12 <greenmoon[m]> Yea the other client have multiples features related to that, perfect
01:01:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> JollyRoger: I'm back
01:02:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Done with work
01:02:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Though I think I'm beyond 48 hours of no sleep
01:03:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Probably another 4-8 hours before the caffeine reduces to 6.25% (using standard elimination half life)
01:06:52 <JTL> lol
01:14:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> JTL: yep
01:14:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW anyone uses syncthing on grapheneos?
01:14:35 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nFOBQFZLaCdHghcijchmLDNS >
01:14:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm getting this weird crash
01:42:18 <brenneke[m]1> Syncthing yes, problems no.
01:43:37 <altoslos[m]> I used syncthing on graphene before and didn't have problems either
02:03:02 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: aaargh! Go and rest up!
02:03:54 <TheJollyRoger> And drink some water X(...
02:04:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sadly the coffee still there
02:05:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will see if I can fix that build error
02:08:12 <TheJollyRoger> Ack! Okay :(
02:08:17 <TheJollyRoger> Please rest as soon as you get the chance.
02:11:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm good
02:11:39 <qyo3462572445[m]> So, I'm not a dev, but Im curious as to what the best programming language to get into is as a beginner, but also that will help the Foss community on projects such as this one.
02:12:39 <aeonsolution[m]> qyo3462572445: any language that gets you interested in development is the best way; there is no one path
02:13:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> qyo3462572445: it depends on what layer you want to work on
02:13:23 <fluoridatedsheep> <qyo3462572445[m] "So, I'm not a dev, but Im curiou"> probably python, go, knowledge of C
02:13:40 <fluoridatedsheep> <qyo3462572445[m] "So, I'm not a dev, but Im curiou"> actually nevermind, definitely C# and SQL ;)
02:14:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> SQL isn't even a programming language
02:14:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Structured query language even the name says it
02:14:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless you're PL/pgSQL?
02:14:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> But then you'd better look at ada
02:16:18 <qyo3462572445[m]> Thank you for the answers. Appreciate it.
02:18:16 <fluoridatedsheep> <anupritaisno1[m] "SQL isn't even a programming lan"> trolling 😇
02:19:08 <TheJollyRoger> I'm hoping to do Python and Java!
02:20:09 <qyo3462572445[m]> I've heard python is a good language and can be pretty useful too. Seems like that's a good stepping stone
02:20:42 <renlord> c is a good starting language
02:21:12 <renlord> other languages do too much for a beginner to learn the ropes
02:22:21 <TheJollyRoger> I'm imagining the first programs I write in C...
02:22:49 <TheJollyRoger> ...and now I'm imagining typing "run" and then watching liquid memory starting to drip out of the computer :P.
02:28:03 <TheJollyRoger> "Why is the memory leaking?" "Peter, because you didn't release the memory at the loop." "No I mean WHY IS MY COMPUTER MELTING AND NOW DRIBBLING OUT THE CASE AND PUDDLING ON THE FLOOR!"
04:00:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger ""Why is the memory leaking?" "Pe"> int a[10];
04:15:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: BTW try building now
05:24:49 <strcat[m]> main things requiring help atm: Pixel 4 and 4 XL support for Auditor, Pixel 4 and 4 XL support for the OS, handling Auditor samples to expand device support
05:25:12 <strcat[m]> also every 6 weeks porting Vanadium to new major release of Chromium

05:28:56 <zxwayland> hello
05:29:46 <aeonsolution[m]> could i ask you to help with the steps to rebase properly strcat in PM
05:29:56 <strcat[m]> yes
05:30:07 <strcat[m]> just checkout new tag
05:30:08 <strcat[m]> cherry-pick commits one by one

05:34:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "could i ask you to help with the"> Honestly if you must ask that you should read up more on it
05:34:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway what you want is definitely a 3-way merge
05:34:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> git am -3 ../patches/*
05:34:46 <Arhu> Are there already people actively working on Pixel 4 and 4 XL support for the OS?
05:34:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Git will stop at conflicts
05:34:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Arhu: I am
05:34:58 <renlord> paintedman is working towards it
05:35:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Painted man is
05:35:15 <strcat[m]> really need the kernel commits submitted
05:35:15 <renlord> you is paintedman?
05:35:16 <strcat[m]> proper 1:1 port
05:35:18 <renlord> o_O
05:35:26 <strcat[m]> hasn't been submitted yet
05:35:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord: no
05:35:31 <strcat[m]> going to run out of time to add Pixel 4 support
05:35:39 <renlord> i need more handles
05:36:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will do once I get the patches cleared up for pixel 4
05:36:16 <renlord> anupritaisno1[m]: how do you do it without a pixl4?
05:36:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> WiFi needs a couple patches more and we can't exactly release with a major feature broken
05:36:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> With testers
05:36:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> And reading logs and dmesg
05:36:46 <renlord> like getting antoher person to test your patches?
05:36:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yep
05:36:58 <renlord> that latency must be huge
05:36:59 <Arhu> strcat[m]: out of time because you want to focus on Android 11?
05:37:12 <strcat[m]> yes
05:37:15 <strcat[m]> among other things
05:37:28 <strcat[m]> no progress that I see being made on Pixel 4 support
05:37:37 <strcat[m]> and lack of landing the kernel support means people can't build and help debug atm
05:37:49 <strcat[m]> I could spend 30 minutes porting the kernel stuff and testing it
05:37:55 <strcat[m]> the whole point is trying to find maintainers
05:37:59 <strcat[m]> if we can't find others to do that it won't work out
05:38:17 <strcat[m]> also not ready to wipe stock OS off the devices until Auditor support for stock is done
05:38:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Arhu: main issue on pixel 4 is that when QCACLD=y due to config_modules=n there is no WiFi because the driver needs more patches to work in built
05:38:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> On stock QCACLD=m
05:38:41 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: getting everything landed for kernel would still be helpful
05:38:43 <strcat[m]> fixing that later
05:39:48 <renlord> 4a is also coming out soon
05:40:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: getting everythin"> I think painted man already has those
05:40:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only thing we need to change is that he split the configs for pixel 4 and xl but there are no device specific drivers that need the split
05:41:01 <jcpicard32[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): Is there anything I can do for the P4 without access to a device? If so I'd be willing yo take a crack at it when I get home tomorrow.
05:41:29 <strcat[m]> not really other than a 1:1 port of the kernel commits
05:41:44 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: there are also some extra commits in crosshatch now
05:41:50 <strcat[m]> the ASLR and FORTIFY_SOURCE stuff is added back
05:41:55 <jcpicard32[m]> I see. Sorry to bother you
05:42:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> I already have a merge of that on 4.14
05:43:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I can undo the split of configs
05:45:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://github.com/paintedman/kernel_google_coral
05:45:15 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: i do appreciate the feedback but some of your comments aren't really helpful and even condensing; the whole reason anyone asks questions new or experienced is to make sure we dont duplicate work and mistakes
05:45:37 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: undid the split of configs in device repo
05:45:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: apologies
05:46:35 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: thank you for understanding
05:46:44 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: can you rebae out the split then
05:47:00 <strcat[m]>  * anupritaisno1: can you rebase out the split then
05:47:03 <strcat[m]> I removed that commit for device repo
05:47:14 <strcat[m]> the way it was done there was off anyway
05:47:19 <renlord> aeonsolution[m]: you need to rebase and then reapply all the patches, during the re-application process, there will be conflicts you need to resolve, resolve them and make new patches.

05:47:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's one change I still want to ask paintedman about
05:48:03 <renlord> wa
05:48:10 <renlord> lovely bot
05:48:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also strcat I'm not sure why this is needed but without it this is a compilation error https://github.com/paintedman/kernel_google_coral/commit/a4a553c0783d86b807c11ad5d0c67979416ce131
05:48:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: if drivers are the same it shouldn't be split
05:48:34 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: are you using the right version of clang
05:48:46 <strcat[m]> it has to match the one in the config they provide
05:48:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> The right version?
05:48:57 <strcat[m]> it isn't necessarily same as other kernels
05:49:03 <strcat[m]> yes the right version of clang
05:49:10 <strcat[m]> for the build script
05:49:10 <strcat[m]> it has to match their config
05:49:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll check that against my build
05:49:19 <strcat[m]> look at the build.common config stuff
05:49:29 <strcat[m]> build.sh is supposed to take the version from there
05:49:41 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I removed the device/google/coral commit splitting them
05:49:49 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: so build is probably broken now
05:49:57 <strcat[m]> need to fix that
05:49:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll do that in a bit
05:50:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> First will pull request the aslr changes
05:50:08 <aeonsolution[m]> renlord: thank you!
05:50:12 <strcat[m]> the kernel commits need to be submitted soon properly
05:50:23 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I think you need to do it in your repo and submit it
05:50:31 <strcat[m]> if this isn't done by around the 20th I'm probably calling it
05:50:37 <strcat[m]> because this is step 1
05:51:03 <strcat[m]> getting the kernel commits ported is just a 30 min time block
05:51:23 <strcat[m]> also if the slab canary feature doesn't break on the new kernel it shouldn't be reverted
05:52:34 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: essentially nothing has happened for 2 weeks
05:52:36 <strcat[m]> that's how I see it
05:52:53 <strcat[m]> I don't see hope for getting it added atm unless other people step up to help
05:53:12 <strcat[m]> you're not going to be able to do it without a device
05:53:40 <strcat[m]> I shouldn't have to do it all myself
05:53:43 <strcat[m]> it's not sustainable
05:53:51 <strcat[m]> I'm deliberately not doing everything
05:54:16 <strcat[m]> I could spend a day on it and get it all working but the whole point is that takes my time away from the rest
05:54:29 <strcat[m]> and it's not sustainable, there is too much stuff my time needs to be split between
05:54:41 <strcat[m]> if there aren't device maintainers we can't support any devices
05:54:57 <strcat[m]> I can't add Pixel 4 support if it takes so long to address issues
05:55:04 <strcat[m]> because that means I will be the one always dealing with it
05:55:28 <strcat[m]> so ~20th is deadline for having everything landed to build it, and then everything else by the 30th (wifi working, Auditor support added)
05:55:40 <Arhu> anupritaisno1[m]: you don't have a Pixel 4 (XL), or you don't have both the Pixel 4 and the XL?
05:55:51 <strcat[m]> realistically it's 2 days of work
05:56:50 <strcat[m]> atm no one seems to be actively working on it that has a device
05:57:00 <strcat[m]> so it's not going to get added
05:57:10 <cn3m[m]> Man I wish I had more skills and time
05:57:12 <strcat[m]> so Pixel 4a support won't be added either and it will be really problematic having no available devices supported
05:57:35 <strcat[m]> I see this as the final chance for people to start doing their part
05:57:55 <strcat[m]> it's not optional
05:58:03 <strcat[m]> if people are mistakenly thinking that
05:58:18 <strcat[m]> the project continuing requires turning things around
05:58:29 <strcat[m]> it's not a good situation right now and putting 100% of the burden on me doesn't work
05:58:40 <strcat[m]> I have less time/energy to dedicate to it than ever
05:58:46 <strcat[m]> if I stop working on it how is it going to continue?
05:58:47 <strcat[m]> it won't
05:58:58 <paintedman[m]> I've been working for almost 1.5 weeks trying to fix the problem with wifi in qcacld
05:59:38 <paintedman[m]> and yesterday I, apparently, found code in qcacld which we need to make it works
05:59:46 <strcat[m]> the changes need to be merged 1st
05:59:53 <strcat[m]> so people can build it and work on stuff
05:59:59 <paintedman[m]> but there is still another problem with android-prepare-vendor
06:00:26 <paintedman[m]> ok, we have 1:1 commits in my github
06:00:29 <strcat[m]> step 1 is getting kernel changes merged today
06:00:38 <strcat[m]> paintedman: no it's missing the ASLR and FORTIFY_SOURCE stuff
06:00:51 <strcat[m]> and need to make sure it's using the right version of clang and need to undo the device split if they don't need diff modules
06:00:53 <paintedman[m]> haven't seen that yes
06:00:58 <paintedman[m]> *yet
06:01:32 <TheJollyRoger> Shoot.
06:02:07 <strcat[m]> if the modules are 100% the same for both rebase out the split
06:02:07 <paintedman[m]> <strcat[m] "step 1 is getting kernel changes"> I'll add this commits today
06:02:08 <strcat[m]> and fix build script
06:02:16 <strcat[m]> and make sure clang version matches the config
06:02:30 <strcat[m]> and get ASLR / FORTIFY_SOURCE added
06:02:30 <paintedman[m]> it matches
06:02:33 <strcat[m]> can refer to linux-hardened for versions of those commits that apply cleanly if needed
06:02:45 <strcat[m]> paintedman: I mean matching the common config not necessarily other kernels
06:02:48 <strcat[m]> haven't looked at it
06:02:57 <paintedman[m]> I've tried original google's build script and it fails on tsens too
06:03:30 <strcat[m]> I don't mean their build script
06:03:36 <strcat[m]> I mean the version of clang has to match
06:03:53 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/paintedman/kernel_google_coral/blob/10/build.config.common
06:04:10 <strcat[m]> alright it matches
06:04:12 <strcat[m]> but just for future reference
06:05:20 <paintedman[m]> https://github.com/paintedman/kernel_google_coral/blob/10/build.sh#L23 ?
06:07:18 <strcat[m]> also need to squash the SCHED_BATCH commit into build script one but I can do that
06:07:43 <paintedman[m]> btw, do we have to split coral and flame configs?
06:07:57 <strcat[m]> paintedman: if the modules are the same it shouldn't be split
06:07:58 <strcat[m]> I undid the split in device repo for now
06:08:47 <paintedman[m]> got it, so I'll add your new commits and undo split
06:10:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh god
06:10:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are so many changes to defconfig
06:11:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm still trying to rebase each commit it is taking a while
06:11:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> <paintedman[m] "btw, do we have to split coral a"> Already discussed in PM
06:11:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Besides the configs for flame and coral are 100% the same
06:12:21 <strcat[m]> paintedman: also squash the SCHED_BATCH commit into the build script commit
06:12:22 <strcat[m]> or I can do that
06:12:29 <strcat[m]> I did it for the others
06:12:40 <strcat[m]> just hadn't cleaned it up yet
06:12:48 <paintedman[m]> ok, I'll do
06:20:47 <strcat[m]> once kernel stuff is done / merged
06:20:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> paintedman:
06:20:54 <strcat[m]> just need wifi issues resolved (kernel and userspace) and Auditor support added
06:20:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> You haven't sent your WiFi patch yet
06:20:55 <strcat[m]> easiest to add stock OS Auditor support 1st
06:20:56 <strcat[m]> I can start on it
06:21:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Send it in pm
06:21:08 * TheJollyRoger buries his head in his hands.
06:21:12 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry.
06:26:23 <eligiblecoffee[m> Anybody having issues with the clock app? The alarm doesn't seem to work. Any suggestions?
06:27:32 <aeonsolution[m]> eligiblecoffee: have you tried resetting the app or looking at the github issues to see if others are experiencing this error?
06:28:10 <eligiblecoffee[m> aeonsolution: yes, I did clear the cache and the data. Still it doesn't work
06:28:10 <jalb66> eligiblecoffee[m, it doesn't work if you use the battery saver
06:28:41 <eligiblecoffee[m> jalb66: battery saver is disabled.
06:28:50 <jalb66> eligiblecoffee[m, ok, then IDN, mine works
06:29:03 <eligiblecoffee[m> jalb66: okay.
06:29:39 <aeonsolution[m]> did you close the app or tried resetting the phone?
06:30:23 <eligiblecoffee[m> I haven't tried resetting the phone.
06:33:40 <aeonsolution[m]> give that a try, if that doesn't work check out https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
06:34:13 <eligiblecoffee[m> aeonsolution: okay. Thanks
06:34:36 <aeonsolution[m]> np
06:44:59 <strcat[m]> eligiblecoffee: it should work at least if you clear the clock app data
06:45:04 <strcat[m]> maybe try rebooting and setting the alarm again
06:48:33 <jalb66> is it normal that enabling WIFI only when I'm in another user or profile and then disabling it before changing to the main profile I see that I received messages in the main profile and so it was connected too?
06:53:57 <strcat[m]> jalb66: yes
07:01:37 <jalb66> strcat[m], thanks!
07:02:12 <strcat[m]> jalb66: disabling network access for a profile is something we could support
07:02:37 <strcat[m]> jalb66: certain things are already done upstream like disabling audio recording when a profile isn't active
07:02:49 <strcat[m]> so if a profile is running an app that has been granted mic permission in the foreground
07:03:01 <strcat[m]> it can't record if the profile isn't active
07:03:07 <strcat[m]> but that's not done for networking by default
07:03:21 <strcat[m]> and networking not per profile
07:03:32 <strcat[m]> like if you enable a VPN, the Updater app and other system stuff goes through it too
07:03:39 <strcat[m]> and they use the same network connections
07:03:48 <jalb66> strcat[m], I thought in that VPN problem I read people commenting here and in the issue tracker, maybe it has something to do with this?
07:04:03 <jalb66> That would be great 🙂
07:04:43 <jalb66> Yes, that's what I mean with VPN
07:04:55 <jalb66> Thanks
07:05:47 <jalb66> I always thought if Vanadium webview needs Network access or not, it works well without it
07:06:02 <jalb66> But IDN if it can't be bad
07:06:44 <jalb66> So, I allow this permission
07:16:35 <furofuro_01[m]> Which pixel 3a model should I get G020F, G020G or G020H?
07:16:51 <furofuro_01[m]> G020E is out of question due to Verizon's crap.
07:18:31 <furofuro_01[m]> Whoops. Maybe I shouldnt have disturbed you yet...
07:19:42 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "I always thought if Vanadium web"> If the extra permissions being off on certain built in system apps would be meaningfully more secure I'm free it would be off by default
07:22:07 <jalb66> cn3m[m]: yes, but I don't know if that permission is really necessary for some reason or not, do you allow it?
07:23:04 <dallemon[m]> strcat : I have just bought a Pixel 4 XL. Let me know what I can do to help you or paintedman

07:58:50 <renlord> does slab_canaries still not work on the pixel4?
07:58:53 <renlord> :(
08:06:08 <paintedman[m]> <renlord "does slab_canaries still not wor"> how to test this?
08:07:04 <renlord> paintedman[m]: remove the reverted commit, compile and then see if it boots
08:08:02 <renlord> on the pixel3, if you removed the revert commit, it will fail to boot
08:14:32 <jalb66> Should we consider GOS as Android or not?
08:15:03 <renlord> jalb66: we pass CTS so yes we are android-compatible.
08:15:34 <renlord> and therefore can run android applications
08:15:40 <jalb66> I mean if GOS is something different than android now, or a hardened fork of the Android Open Source Project
08:16:04 <renlord> it is a standalone mobile operating systems project
08:16:05 <jalb66> I think Daniel posted something about it, IDN where, if it was in reddit or what
08:16:31 <jalb66> renlord: thanks
08:16:41 <renlord> we implement features on top of stock aosp and also harden standard aosp stuff
08:16:59 <jalb66> Yes
08:16:59 <renlord> they are written up in https://grapheneos.org
08:21:11 <aeonsolution[m]> hey who has the pixel 4 in the chat that is willing to help with testing? i can help you setup your device to prime it for when testing pixel 4 is ready
08:23:03 <aeonsolution[m]> you'll have to setup your computer to install the development branch too
08:24:04 <magntcf[m]1> People turned paranoids on matrix servers 😂

08:57:50 <aeonsolution[m]> send a message if you have any questions on the setup
08:59:54 <aeonsolution[m]> if the devs manage to get an initial pixel 4 setup for development testing, you'll be able to complete the build
09:00:14 <r4v3r23[m]> do backups survive factory reset?
09:01:09 <aeonsolution[m]> dallemon: these are the dependencies you need https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies
09:01:33 <dallemon[m]> I'll see if I can get it running on my new laptop using WSL. Otherwise I do have sightly older laptop running Manjaro
09:02:22 <aeonsolution[m]> if there are others with pixel 4, please hit me up; its crunch time so ill help you get setup so you can help out the devs that may not have the device
09:03:14 <aeonsolution[m]> i dont know if you can build it on WSL
09:03:56 <aeonsolution[m]> i can help if its manjaro
09:07:54 <dallemon[m]> Got it running on Manjaro previously, like, a year ago.

09:18:04 <dallemon[m]> <renlord "sad no archlinux on WSL"> Well, no official.
09:22:57 <cdesai> Lineage has patches for building in wsl, and some should be in aosp master too
09:53:34 <paintedman[m]> <renlord "on the pixel3, if you removed th"> on pixel 4 xl it doesn't work too

12:08:24 <Arhu> Is there any way to stop a user? GrapheneOS nicely bumped the maximum supported users from 4 to 16, but to save RAM and battery, or just not wanting the background services from users to be active all the time, it is often desirable to explicitly stop users, like what "adb shell am stop-user [user id]" does, but from the phone itself

13:14:45 <fll[m]> > 3 years of support for firmware, blobs and aosp, that s what pixels have. Titan hardware is also pixel only atm
13:14:45 <fll[m]> What xabi said here is the important and hard part. Especially hard to realize affordable
13:48:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> What exactly is a titan M
13:48:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat can you explain
13:51:11 <fll[m]> anupritaisno1: https://www.blog.google/products/pixel/titan-m-makes-pixel-3-our-most-secure-phone-yet/
13:51:54 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the implementation of the security chip for Pixel 3 and later providing the citadel APIs
13:52:26 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: provides the implementation of the StrongBox keymaster (HSM-based keystore) which is a more secure replacement for the traditional TEE-based keystore (TrustZone)
13:52:41 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: and also Weaver, which is one of the key hardware-based encryption features
13:52:51 <strcat[m]> Weaver has a slot for each profile
13:53:04 <strcat[m]> mapping auth token -> randomly generated token used as part of key derivation
13:53:20 <strcat[m]> the security chip only provides the token for key derivation to the OS after it has provided the correct auth token for the profile
13:53:41 <strcat[m]> this allows the security chip to implement exponentially increasing throttling (quickly throttles up to 1 day of delay) for decryption attempts
13:53:56 <strcat[m]> it's hardware enforcement for the previously UI-based exponentially increasing delay
13:54:18 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 has Weaver too, via an NXP secure element (doesn't have the other APIs)
13:54:57 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: also provides secure storage / enforcement for the bootloader lock state and verified boot key
13:56:10 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: and it has the concept of 'insider attack protection' which requires that the owner account authenticates before it will accept a firmware upgrade, so malicious firmware can't be created to bypass Weaver
13:56:38 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's also where the factory reset protection data is stored for Pixels, as opposed to a dedicated partition on the regular flash, but we don't use that feature - the rest is all relevant
13:57:08 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you can look at citadel in AOSP to see the software / drivers for it
13:57:19 <yekip[m]> Looking to install a Matrix client on Graphene. Is the standard Riot app recommended, or RiotX?
13:57:30 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1:  it might be called citadel in the kernel too, I forget, I think it has a lower level name there too
13:57:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: cool also does it do wrappedkey?
13:58:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since pixel 4 uses the CAF kernel the kernel sure does support ICE+wrappedkey
13:58:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is not the standardized R stuff. CAF had wrappedkey for a while now
13:59:51 <hitchhooker[m]> Yekip, riotx is alpha and riot app is beta. I recommend riot app still
14:00:45 <renlord> whats CAF?
14:01:19 <dazinism> Or minivector from Fdroid, its a fork of riot android with less permissions, tracking (also doesnt do calls)
14:02:59 <dazinism> Code Aurora Forum
14:03:23 <jiibus[m]> Honest question, how do we know the Titan M  doesn't have anything malicious going on?
14:03:44 <renlord> lol
14:03:52 <renlord> jiibus[m]: have you checked out their website?
14:04:03 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: doesn't seem relevant due to weaver
14:04:10 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: read https://www.qualcomm.com/media/documents/files/file-based-encryption.pdf
14:04:27 <jiibus[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): whose?
14:04:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: so there's coldboot security?
14:05:01 <renlord> jiibus[m]: open titan project
14:05:09 <yekip[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "Yekip, riotx is alpha and riot a"> Thanks. I thought alpha was better than beta. hahahaha. I will keep quiet now and install Riot app. :D
14:06:02 <hitchhooker[m]> Is Titan M related to opentitan?
14:06:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord: grapheneos shipping self built titan firmware when?
14:06:32 <renlord> anupritaisno1[m]: you own a fab?
14:06:38 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: firmware is signed
14:06:41 <renlord> i was hoping you can print some
14:06:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord "whats CAF?"> Qualcomm's hacks for snapdragon devices
14:07:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: firmware is signe"> So you mean it can't be replaced?
14:07:26 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: in general, firmware is signed
14:07:39 <jiibus[m]> renlord I didn't know about it, I take it that's what graphene uses?
14:07:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmmm
14:07:49 <renlord> jiibus[m]: the pixel phone
14:07:55 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: whether or not firmware is open source, you can't replace it, unless it's an insecure implementation which would be very problematic
14:07:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> So it is a look but don't touch?
14:08:06 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the Titan M would not be useful if it didn't have firmware signing
14:08:34 <strcat[m]> and you could not have verified boot if the firmware on the device wasn't signed/verified
14:08:48 <strcat[m]> part of verified boot is that all firmware is signed/verified
14:09:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> So why can't we pin own keys?
14:09:13 <strcat[m]> you can't have verified boot for the OS without verified boot for the SoC firmware, etc.
14:09:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> For the titan m
14:09:28 <jiibus[m]> renlord: ah, gotcha. Good to know
14:09:29 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't know how you expect that to be done when it is what implements setting a custom key for the OS

14:09:38 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: have another security chip that secures the Titan M?
14:09:48 <strcat[m]> where does the key go
14:10:04 <strcat[m]> the AVB key is flashed to the Titan M
14:10:04 <renlord> what if fab leaked keys?
14:10:07 <strcat[m]> that's how the Pixel implements verified boot for a custom OS
14:10:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: have another secu"> That'd probably drive the production costs up a lot
14:10:30 <renlord> root of trust so hard to solve
14:10:45 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it also demonstrates why it just doesn't make much sense
14:10:47 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't know how other devices implement verified boot or if any even have a real implementation
14:10:56 <strcat[m]> the Pixel 2 used Qualcomm SoC features to implement it
14:11:24 <strcat[m]> earlier devices didn't have the same kind of verified boot (AVB) and instead relied on displaying the key id + the TEE enforcement (which still exists)
14:11:41 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: like a Pixel 1 or a Nexus 5X
14:11:44 <strcat[m]> they have verified boot
14:11:51 <renlord> isnt TEE already broken
14:11:56 <strcat[m]> lets say an attacker exploits the device and gains root/kernel access
14:12:06 <strcat[m]> renlord: TEE is a generic term
14:12:13 <strcat[m]> renlord: don't know what you mean by broken
14:12:21 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have unpatched public vulnerabilities
14:12:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: lets say an attacker compromises the OS, gains root/kernel access
14:13:00 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: and replaces the OS partitions with their own, using their own key, and they have valid signatures / dm-verity trees
14:13:12 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: on a Pixel 2 or 3, it sees the key doesn't match, fails verification
14:13:21 <strcat[m]> red boot state
14:13:45 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: on the Pixel 3, the bootloader retrieves the key from the Titan M (in addition to whatever SoC enforcement there is)
14:13:59 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: when you do 'fastboot flash avb_custom_key avb_pkmd.bin' like our factory images do
14:14:03 <strcat[m]> that stores the key on the Titan M
14:14:20 <strcat[m]> the Titan M tracks bootloader lock state and is the main thing responsible for verified boot state storage for the OS
14:14:54 <strcat[m]> i.e. storing the AVB custom key (which can only be flashed when unlock), storing the OS rollback index, storing the bootloader lock state, storing the OEM unlocking state
14:14:57 <randomuser> How do I make f-droid work properly on GOS? I'm aware of the issue when downloading an older version of the app, but I don't think my problem is about that. I just installed f-droid for the first time, and it works for a while but then stops. Now I can't list apps, can't search apps or anything.
14:15:03 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: this is extra enforcement on top of the usual enforcement (like on a Pixel 2)
14:15:23 <strcat[m]> randomuser: nothing needs to be done that's special for GrapheneOS
14:15:31 <strcat[m]> randomuser: F-Droid is buggy, that's a problem everywhere, try clearing the app data/cache
14:18:43 <randomuser> Buggy indeed. Clearing the app storage worked though. Thanks!
14:24:17 <jiibus[m]> randomuser: try aurora droid, I find it a better client, you can install it in f-droid.
14:38:03 <randomuser> thanks, I'll try aurora droid.

15:16:34 <yekip[m]> I think my user account is at a different homeserver, rather than the Matrix one. Is it possible to move it, or do you have to sign up for a new account at the desired homeserver?
15:26:33 <hitchhooker[m]> there's much better channels to get that knowledge like #matrix:matrix.org but its account per server just like you cant log in  to gmail with outlook email

15:40:29 <BalooRJ> I will have to give Aurora Droid a try.
16:04:32 <meltedcheddar[m]> <BalooRJ "I will have to give Aurora Droid"> What's the difference with Aurora Store?
16:05:07 <jalb66> It's for F-droid, not Aurora Store
16:07:13 <randomuser> I just tried aurora droid. It doesn't seem to be able to download/install anything, even though I've given it the permissions...
16:10:36 <nickcalyx[m]> there's also g-droid I think
16:10:44 <nickcalyx[m]> a fork of fdroid with a nicer interface
16:10:46 <nickcalyx[m]> and ratings
16:19:50 <randomuser> If I have two users on the phone, and one of them has wireguard installed (but not the other), set to "always-on vpn" and "block connections without vpn". Will the other user automatically use the vpn connection, or does it just use the internet without it?
16:25:03 <meltedcheddar[m]> <jalb66 "It's for F-droid, not Aurora Sto"> But it's made by the same developer
16:25:46 <meltedcheddar[m]> There is one called Aurora Store and other called Aurora Droid and it's the same developer
16:27:45 <meltedcheddar[m]> Ok, its an alternative to F-Droid
16:27:47 <jalb66> meltedcheddar[m], of course, but I was answering about what you posted before. This app is for F-droid
16:27:59 <jalb66> Aurora Store is for Google Store

17:26:55 <AppAraat[m]> hi all, is there any news on definitive EoL date for the Pixel 2?
17:33:25 <dallemon[m]> <AppAraat[m] "hi all, is there any news on def"> Most likely October 2020
17:35:24 <dazinism> Pixel 1 was guaranteed till October 2019 and got a December update (but interestingly not a November update)
17:35:50 <dazinism> Think there was a Pixel tablet that got 6 months longer than guaranteed
17:36:12 <dazinism> Dont think Google ever announced any of that.
17:36:14 <dallemon[m]> <dazinism "Pixel 1 was guaranteed till Octo"> Same thing with the Nexus 6P iirc
17:36:22 <dazinism> Just have to wait and see....
17:36:57 <dazinism> dallemon: yeah, right, something like that
17:37:31 <AppAraat[m]> hmm, that should be just in time since I'll probably be able to get a Pixel 3(a?) in Sept.
17:38:15 <dazinism> Its a bit weird that they dont announce what they are upto.
17:38:31 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Pixel 1 was guaranteed till Octo"> Pixel 1 was dropped in October here. The November update was not very important for Pixels specifically. December heavily effected Pixels
17:38:44 <dazinism> But I guess its similar with like iPhones
17:40:46 <dazinism> And I think maybe OnePlus, somewhat strangely recently released an update for a phone that was   ~ 4 years old?
17:45:54 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "And I think maybe OnePlus, somew"> Samsung and it was a lot longer back than that due to their own specific issue. Though do keep in mind Samsung only has monthly patches on flagships only and it's only for 3 years. Galaxy S is the ONLY line that matches Pixel on updates. And that hasn't historically fared well.
17:46:22 <cn3m[m]> Samsung A and M line start at quarterlies such is not acceptable
17:47:32 <Hirppa> Samsung has Enterprise Edition lineup of phones that has better support than consumer devices
17:52:10 <Hirppa> For the Enterprise Edition devices they also announce end of sales and end of support dates
17:53:09 <dazinism> Theres also android rugged devices, from various manufacturers that get 5 years...
17:53:48 <dazinism> They are more like warehouse / stock taking devices
17:54:33 <dazinism> Think it was the OnePlus 5 I was thinking of, which recently got an update
17:54:39 <dazinism> Update to android 10
17:54:51 <dazinism> Its 3 years since launch
18:00:24 <Hirppa> unfortunately all those fancy enterprise devices are useless for the GrapheneOS project
18:01:13 <Hirppa> including the samsung ones
18:02:24 <Hirppa> but I really like the way manufacturers announce planned end-of-life dates for such devices
18:11:21 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Theres also android rugged devic"> They don't get the latest Android version though
18:18:39 <hapssmak[m]> Will GrapheneOS be able to run apps that relay on Gapps in the future? I mean, is there any roadmap for a workaround?
18:25:30 <cx2[m]> > Will GrapheneOS be able to run apps that relay on Gapps in the future? I mean, is there any roadmap for a workaround?
18:25:30 <cx2[m]> There are plenty of apps that say they rely on Google, that still function fine on GrapheneOS.
18:25:30 <cx2[m]> That said, GMS will likely never be in the future for GrapehenOS.
18:25:52 <jalb66> Thanks God 🙂
18:27:53 <yekip[m]> I have an app called Vinyl on Graphene. Its a music player. I created a playlist but can't see it in Android File Transfer window. Does anyone know where playlists would get stored so I can drop tracks in it please?
18:52:56 <yekip[m]> Maybe seems a silly question but... I have a lot of music on my device, but I also listen to a lot of audiobooks. Always was a pain on iphone in that it would 'forget' which chapter of a book i was listening to, randomly, and obviously when I accidentally played a music file. Being a noooob to android completely, i just had an idea. Could I install two different audio player apps, and 'point' one to music folder and the
18:52:56 <yekip[m]> other to audiobooks folder, so the two players are separate with one doing music and one doing audiobooks?
18:57:54 <dallemon[m]> <yekip[m] "Maybe seems a silly question but"> Usually yes, but it is of course app dependent
19:20:01 <ForeverNoob[m]1> hi, I have a question. Suppose I want to use both mobile data and wifi, but... I didn't have Internet on my wifi. Since the reason I'm connected to wifi with my phone is to connect to a host that is only available via the wifi network. Would it be possible to have Internet via mobile data while still having access to that host via wifi?
19:20:30 <cn3m[m]> Brave is currently 26 days behind Chromx on patches..
19:21:11 <AppAraat[m]> ForeverNoob: are you by any chance using your phone as a remote control of something?
19:22:33 <ForeverNoob[m]1> yes, I want to connect to a server running on a raspberry pi (which is used as a wifi AP) running a service (mpd)
19:23:28 <AppAraat[m]> haha I did a very similar thing, I'm basically using my Pi Zero W as a jukebox connected to a nice DAC :p
19:23:52 <cn3m[m]> It's sad when Firefox is a more secure alternative.. Brave needs to get on top of this
19:24:11 <AppAraat[m]> portable too, connected to 20MAh battery and everything. Could last for 12+ hours.
19:24:58 <ForeverNoob[m]1> AppAraat: same here but I don't have it that portable, just as a media server for my living room
19:25:32 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "Brave is currently 26 days behin"> No, it's not. It's at the latest version: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/blob/master/package.json#L32
19:25:44 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "It's sad when Firefox is a more "> Firefox isn't more secure. I've already told you this.
19:26:09 <AppAraat[m]> ForeverNoob: having said that, I remember trying and failing. IIRC you can't do the whole "host with no Internet" on a rootless phone.
19:26:39 <AppAraat[m]> (but if anyone here would suggest otherwise, I'm all ears (pardon the pun :)))
19:27:09 <ForeverNoob[m]1> aww that sucks ☹︎
19:27:28 <yekip[m]> thanks dallemon
19:27:49 <AppAraat[m]> my potential "fix" for this is to get a cheap phone and basically use that as remote control, although I haven't tested it.
19:29:47 <ForeverNoob[m]1> wtf, get another phone? :S
19:32:08 <AppAraat[m]> you can get pretty cheap Android phones these days AFAIK
19:35:37 <aeonsolution[m]> <hapssmak[m] "Will GrapheneOS be able to run a"> Hey Gapps, the short answer is no because the goal of the project is not to add Google Play services to GrapheneOS. https://grapheneos.org/#grapheneos

19:54:13 <aeonsolution[m]> hey everyone, here an open call to those that have pixel 4 phones that want to help with the migration but dont have development experience

19:56:19 <aeonsolution[m]> so asking them to help you do that setup is not a great use of their time, given that we have a deadline for the 20th of this month
19:57:25 <cn3m[m]> madaidan.: They might get in a few days, but that's creeping up on a month. I clean installed it just now
19:57:56 <cn3m[m]> My Ungoogled Chromium took 3 days to switch to 83
19:58:00 <aeonsolution[m]> without support for the Pixel 4, no other models will be supported

20:01:05 <cn3m[m]> Ultimately Brave and Firefox both suck for security so it is moot

20:12:10 <skwisgaar[m]> Not saying brave is great, but that seems kinda silly
20:12:23 <aeonsolution[m]> skwisgaar: I think he is making a reference to how they are marketed not necessarily that they are the same
20:12:58 <aeonsolution[m]> as very secure browsers
20:13:23 <skwisgaar[m]> aeonsolution I can agree with that, except for brave actually delivering on some of what they promise

20:15:42 <cn3m[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "Not saying brave is great, but t"> Brave is 26 days out of date and that's been a theme with them. I kept thinking it would get better after they stopped using electron (which was so stupid). Both are tremendously flawed browsers
20:16:46 <skwisgaar[m]> <cn3m[m] "Brave is 26 days out of date and"> I agree with that, but being one month behind on chromium is still way better Firefox
20:17:11 <cn3m[m]> Firefox has a terrible sandbox and lacks basic hardening. It patches on time. Brave has an excellent sandbox and basic hardening features. It doesn't patch on time. Both are terribly bad
20:20:44 <skwisgaar[m]> I get what you're saying, also I can't validate most of this stuff myself. I'm just surprised to hear an equivalence like that, it seems to gloss over a lot of details.
20:21:07 <stuux[m]> cn3m: what do you recommend for browsing then? I am currently using chromium but would like to switch to ungoogled. Only thing holding me back is the lack of proper installation (only over aur not with pacman)

21:01:57 <madaidan[m]> track you. Enumerating badness via content filtering is not a viable approach to achieving decent privacy, just as AntiVirus isn't a viable way to achieving decent security.

21:12:34 <altoslos[m]> IDK of ur just saying you're an expert,cuz I met a lot of people on here that just say that with no job in security
21:12:37 <concat[m]> When did I claim to be an expert?

21:16:05 <generateduser392> that's fine, I'm anonymous
21:16:11 <generateduser392> could be a bot
21:16:14 <generateduser392> or not
21:16:30 <altoslos[m]> I was just wondering
21:16:42 <madaidan[m]> <concat[m] "He didn't, but you said *nobody*"> I meant that nobody claimed themselves to be an expert
21:16:48 <altoslos[m]> What a coincidence I am also a bot
21:17:06 <concat[m]> madaidan. Could've phrased better then.
21:17:26 <concat[m]> madaidan. "they" could be interpreted as "cn3m" in that particular context
21:17:43 <generateduser392> english not everyone's first language
21:19:03 <generateduser392> concat: does ung chromium offer same amount of "hardening" firefox allows in about:config?
21:19:36 <concat[m]> generateduser710 Elaborate on hardening, as most Firefox "hardening" is just theater
21:19:58 <generateduser392> https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config
21:19:59 <concat[m]> You still stand out with certain configs
21:19:59 <generateduser392> that

21:21:03 <fluoridatedsheep> <concat[m] "generateduser710 Elaborate on ha"> damn boyo roast the fox some more
21:21:14 <madaidan[m]> Changing a few settings will not substantially improve security
21:21:37 <concat[m]> Most of those aren't sufficent for privacy or security in general.
21:21:38 <madaidan[m]> At most you can reduce attack surface by disabling a bunch of things but I doubt anyone does that enough for it to matter
21:22:24 <fluoridatedsheep> <madaidan[m] "At _most_ you can reduce attack "> Tor Browser obv does but it has its issues
21:22:48 <altoslos[m]> Didn't u guys say you were not experts,so how do u know

21:23:20 <fluoridatedsheep> I'm not a browser expert but I am a Junior cybersecurity analyst associate in training
21:23:38 <altoslos[m]> U do need to be an expert to understand hardening otherwise u don't know what ur talking about
21:23:44 <aeonsolution[m]> just compare https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security with the browser you want to use, and then make statements about how "x" browser is better
21:24:05 <aeonsolution[m]> there's no need to fight over which browser is better based on personal feelings
21:24:28 <aeonsolution[m]> nor is it productive to call out people for not being experts
21:24:36 <concat[m]> <altoslos[m] "U do need to be an expert to und"> Nonsense. You can still have knowledge on hardening without officially being an "expert".

21:25:55 <AppAraat[m]> according to their ["brag sheet"](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/brag-sheet) - "We dedicate thousands of CPU cores to fuzz projects such as WebKit, Adobe Flash or Chrome's PDF viewer." - holy crap.
21:26:28 <cn3m[m]> <altoslos[m] "U do need to be an expert to und"> It's really not that complicated to look at the code and determine privilege in a sandbox, if they try to mitigation certain attacks at all (such as code reuse attacks). Firefox is so far behind a casual observer of the code would pick up on that
21:26:46 <madaidan[m]> <AppAraat[m] "according to their ["brag sheet""> Google's fuzzing is amazing
21:27:04 <madaidan[m]> They fuzz tons of open source projects

21:27:06 <jcpicard32[m]> @altoslos:tchncs.de: As an unbiased third party madaidan is the only one here who has been claimed to be an expert. The others are referencing information others much more knowledgeable have shared on twitter. Much of what they're saying is consensus among the security community. Check some of the people Daniel follows on Twitter, for example. They will agree with concat
21:27:27 <altoslos[m]> Madidian has a good github
21:27:56 <AppAraat[m]> madaidan.: I wonder whether fuzzing would still be effective against Rust codebases.

21:28:43 <concat[m]> Thankfully I do use GitLab
21:28:48 <jcpicard32[m]> Who is making the recommendations for you to tweak a bunch of about:config tweaks to harden firefox? And why? A consensus of people in PTIO's issue tracker? I can believe that. But I don't believe for a second if you're saying people with more experience than any of us scrubs are suggesting it makes a significant difference
21:28:57 <altoslos[m]> IDK I think it's weird ur avoiding a basic question and it's kinda reg flaggish

21:31:11 <cn3m[m]> <altoslos[m] "I see a lot of people use firefo"> I see a lot of people use shoes that don't fit them properly which hurts their health
21:31:11 <jcpicard32[m]> It doesn't matter that you want about:config to make firefox's security comparable to chromium's
21:31:16 <jcpicard32[m]> The fact of the matter is it's not
21:31:26 <AppAraat[m]> <altoslos[m] "I see a lot of people use firefo"> that is not a good metric for browser security though...
21:31:28 <jcpicard32[m]> It's weaker in both semantics and implementation, to varying degrees on all platforms
21:31:33 <concat[m]> <altoslos[m] "I see a lot of people use firefo"> Firefox has a very petty market share, and is only popular amongst the false permeating echo chambers that don't understand basic security models.
21:31:44 <altoslos[m]> IDK why u guys are so defensive lol

21:33:11 <jcpicard32[m]> @altoslos:tchncs.de: The way I've seen this conversation unfold, The conversation in general heated up when people's credentials were all called into question. If you want recommendations my advice (as I mentioned above) is to follow Daniel and the people he follows on Twitter
21:33:19 <jcpicard32[m]> They do this for a living and know more than us

21:37:37 <jcpicard32[m]> cn3m: Thanks. At one point on the sub Daniel brought it up in conversation. Since I definitely trust his advice I saved the link and bring it up when discussing as I'm not knowledgeable enough to make better recommendations yet.
21:37:57 <cn3m[m]> generateduser710: just use Chrome or Microsoft Edge. You can opt out of data collection and they are very safe and good
21:38:25 <fluoridatedsheep> madaidan.: Reading your github.. I knew about somehow inversing speakers to act as a microphone.. but I never knew gyroscope could be used effectively as a mic
21:38:38 <concat[m]> @altoslos:tchncs.de Firstly, nobody was angry. And that's a false equivalence as stating your own rule of thumb is not the same as applying for a job. And you're building this illusion that people were pretending to be experts when they're not.

21:41:27 <generateduser392> madaidan.: read your github on linux, which os do you suggest?
21:41:31 <AppAraat[m]> cn3m: but GrapheneOS is based on Android and only supports Android phones, no?
21:41:49 <concat[m]> AppAraat I think you're taking what he said out of proportion.
21:42:11 <concat[m]> AppAraat GrapheneOS accounts as an Android phone but he was specifically referring to stock
21:42:18 <madaidan[m]> <fluoridatedsheep "so you're saying i stabbed my mi"> Probably
21:42:42 <fluoridatedsheep> <madaidan[m] "Probably "> :'(

21:43:05 <AppAraat[m]> concat: in that case the guide should say so as well. Even when tech-oriented people read it, they'll think that about Android phones in general.

21:44:21 <jcpicard32[m]> AppAraat: This guide was written with most stock builds in general. If an average user wants the most private and secure phone available today, they should get a current generation iPhone. GrapheneOS seeks to do substantially better than that. In its current state it is largely comparable. However it's an a very early state of development and requires the user making compromises, as apps they are used to may not
21:44:21 <jcpicard32[m]> work or have reduced functionality. It's also much less accessible as the user has to flash it themselves
21:44:23 <cn3m[m]> iPhones are what the average person and all their family should use
21:44:23 <concat[m]> AppAraat I don't think it should, it's targeted at novices and GrapheneOS is certainly not for a complete novice. The article is meant to be short and simple without any nuances.
21:44:31 <madaidan[m]> The desktop in general is pretty insecure though.
21:44:49 <jcpicard32[m]> Keep in mind who the guide was targeted for. All of the recommendations made in it were designed for an average user to follow easily
21:45:04 <nickcalyx[m]> qubes is so cumbersome as to be not usable for most people

21:45:47 <generateduser392> plus relying on tor for everything
21:45:47 <cn3m[m]> iOS and iPhones are 5 years ahead of Android in general for privacy and security. GrapheneOS is around the same lead
21:46:31 <concat[m]> <madaidan[m] "The desktop in general is pretty"> Part of the reason why I think phones with a mimicked computer set-up could be the future
21:46:52 <cn3m[m]> * iOS and iPhones are 5 years ahead of Android in general for privacy and security. GrapheneOS is around the same lead. The Android ecosystem holds GrapheneOS back even though it's largely better

21:47:39 <EssentialChaos[m> I should show this to someone, who's using Linux-libre :P
21:47:49 <fluoridatedsheep> i always assumed an airgapped PC with an easily pullable external battery, no mic or webcam with kicksecure would be the best bet over a device that is constantly pinging towers and receiving inbound connections
21:47:53 <cn3m[m]> Windows S on a Secured Core PC is probably the way to go right now
21:48:25 <fluoridatedsheep> <cn3m[m] "Windows S on a Secured Core PC i"> i want that cloudready without a goog account
21:48:30 <cn3m[m]> ARM MacBooks are appealing too

22:04:10 <AppAraat[m]> cn3m: I think you are severely overestimating the knowledge and skills of the vast majority of the people that use a computer.
22:04:47 <cn3m[m]> <xabi[m] "There are trade offs, android is"> Privacy and security is what's being considered
22:06:54 <concat[m]> I guess it's a similar case with Android and iOS where there's too many variables to truly conclude which is better than the other. Like, iOS is usually better as an out of the box sort of thing but GrapheneOS could be better for some people. In terms of stock I think iOS is a clear-cut winner though.
22:09:59 <concat[m]> <AppAraat[m] "cn3m: I think you are severely o"> He isn't, most of the advice requires the most basic comprehension skills. I think it's you that's lowballing them.
22:10:06 <jcpicard32[m]> <AppAraat[m] "cn3m: I think you are severely o"> I disagree. Most people don't see the problem with SMS or email. There's a reason they're still standard in the US and other places despite objectively superior replacements being available. For as much good information as there is there's a lot of bad information on the internet, particularly regarding privacy and security. For example, guides recommending users
22:10:06 <jcpicard32[m]> secure themselves using desktop linux, firefox and lineage OS
22:10:33 <jcpicard32[m]> Substance largely doesn't matter to people, who are often unwilling to examine the veracity of their sources past what Google tells them
22:10:48 <jcpicard32[m]> What's obvious to us may seem pointless but keep in mind this room is a self-selecting group to begin with
22:11:15 <jcpicard32[m]> It's best practice to assume people know nothing, especially when they can secure themselves quite well without having to learn to code or install obscure software
22:13:14 <AppAraat[m]> But I mean like... most people don't even know what a web browser is. Like the really really basic stuff. If this is written for those kind of people then I have my doubts about its efficacy.
22:14:18 <AppAraat[m]> But I do only now see the first thing that's pointed out: "Basic security precautions for non-profits and journalists in the United States, early 2019." - So I guess that narrows it down a bit.
22:14:35 <concat[m]> <AppAraat[m] "But I mean like... most people d"> Who is "most people"? In general? No freaking way. Elderly people and infants? Ok, maybe.
22:16:08 <jcpicard32[m]> I have to go eat dinner. Nice talking with you all!
22:16:27 <concat[m]> jcpicard32 Bon appetite.
22:17:52 <AppAraat[m]> I know it sounds silly and unbelievable, but it's common to think this way. It's normal behavior to surround ourselves with people that are more like us, and thus know more about technology, but the vast majority of people are just really in the dark when it comes to technology.
22:18:39 <AppAraat[m]> I believe reading a few years ago that 80%+ smartphone users in the US don't install any additional apps on their smartphone.
22:18:56 <AppAraat[m]> (let me try and find the source)
22:20:30 <concat[m]> It is just silly considering how standardized technology such as phones and computers are for our millennials. To say that most people don't know what a browser is without any sort of source makes it hard to believe. Not to be fallacious and say you're wrong because it sounds absurd, but without any evidence and seemingly appeal to common sense I quite frankly stand by my perspective that most people do know what a
22:20:30 <concat[m]> web browser is if we're speaking in general. Especially if they're looking for security/privacy guides.
22:23:46 <concat[m]>  * It is just silly considering how standardized technology such as phones and computers are for our millennials. To say that most people don't know what a browser is without any sort of source makes it hard to believe. Not to be fallacious and say you're wrong because it sounds absurd, but without any evidence and seemingly appeal to assumption I quite frankly stand by my perspective that most people probably do know
22:23:46 <concat[m]> what a web browser is if we're speaking in general. Especially if they're looking for security/privacy guides.
22:24:51 <concat[m]> <AppAraat[m] "I believe reading a few years ag"> That doesn't necessarily indicate they don't know what a browser is. They could just like their default browser.
22:25:30 <concat[m]> That wouldn't be a valid statistic to base your claim.
22:26:05 <cn3m[m]> <concat[m] "I guess it's a similar case with"> iOS largely dominates for all but the 1% of technical users which really should only use Graphene and maybe CalyxOS
22:26:17 <concat[m]> If there were a study on how many people actually understand very standard terminologies and it supports your narrative then I'd concede.
22:27:59 <AppAraat[m]> I can't find that article, but I bet if you ask most of those people whether they know what a web browser is, they wouldn't know.
22:28:23 <concat[m]> <cn3m[m] "iOS largely dominates for all bu"> Yeah but that doesn't really matter. That wasn't about the article but a statement regarding which can be concluded overall better objectively. I think for a more in-depth guide I would mention GrapheneOS but seeing the demographic the guide previously linked was attempting to target it makes sense to just advice the general best option for everyone rather than additional
22:28:23 <concat[m]> suggestions for technical users.
22:28:24 <AppAraat[m]> Also, I base my claims based on stuff I read (wish I'd bookmark more) and also working in tech support :p
22:29:12 <concat[m]> <AppAraat[m] "Also, I base my claims based on "> Anecdote isn't really a viable source to base claims.
22:29:43 <AppAraat[m]> I know, I was only half-kidding.
22:32:22 <AppAraat[m]> I'll try to find better sources once I have more sleep in my system.
22:32:47 <concat[m]> Do you have any specific sleep schedule?
22:33:26 <concat[m]> On weekdays I usually go to sleep at 21:30 - 5:30
23:31:55 <AppAraat[m]> I have a very specific sleep schedule, it's called "Try falling asleep anywhere except sitting in the bathroom"
23:32:32 <AppAraat[m]>  * I have a very specific sleep schedule, it's called "Try falling asleep anywhere except in the bathroom"
23:32:36 <AppAraat[m]> it's hard, but I try my best
23:32:42 <madaidan[m]> especially in the bathroom*
23:33:40 <AppAraat[m]> I mean falling asleep isn't the hard part, it's usually the waking up that takes getting used to
