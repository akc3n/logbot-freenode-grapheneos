00:00:59 <cn3m[m]> This claims to work on S10e. It says it's a security ROM, but the instructions are garbage
00:02:18 <cn3m[m]> Looks like a terribly put together ROM, but if his claim is correct it looks like Samsung Galaxy S Exynos is technically a very viable candidate for GrapheneOS
00:03:01 <cn3m[m]> Monthly security updates for 3 years, not completely horrific HSM, custom verified boot keys
00:04:18 <cn3m[m]> It can boot a GSI with no major issues so AOSP compatibility is not a mark against it
00:04:28 <cn3m[m]> It's also supported by Auditor
00:14:47 <gcbrown> @aeon
00:15:10 <gcbrown> whoops i can't use irc. aeonsolution[m] saw your message on github, what kinds of things need help on vanadium?
00:15:35 <gcbrown> alternatively what's high priority and also not requiring security knowledge?
00:15:44 <aeonsolution[m]> Riot is a good client too
00:16:45 <aeonsolution[m]> gcbrown: i would start small first, if Vanadium sounds interesting to you try building it first
00:17:05 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#browser-and-webview
00:18:42 <aeonsolution[m]> if not, exploring the issue tracker https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues would be your best bet
00:20:33 <gcbrown> yeah that's where i found the gallery fix, my main issue is i don't wanna waste time fixing things that aren't urgent/important in general
00:20:37 <aeonsolution[m]> i can't tell you what is high priority because i'm not in charge of the project
00:20:41 <gcbrown> gotcha
00:20:56 <bonerdose[m]> Is there a way to open tabs in incognito always like in bromite but for vanadium?
00:21:02 <aeonsolution[m]> if there is something you can contribute to and also lets you understand the project
00:21:12 <aeonsolution[m]> even if it doesnt get merged, you'll learn two things
00:22:04 <aeonsolution[m]> 1. how those issues are related to the project overall
00:22:25 <aeonsolution[m]> 2. how we communicate and fix issues
00:23:13 <aeonsolution[m]> anytime you as a new contributor add more work thats not easy to understand, it most probably wont get merged
00:23:49 <aeonsolution[m]> because the developers are already juggling their schedules with maintenance
00:25:12 <aeonsolution[m]> gcbrown: the gallery is a good issue and lets you see how everyone communicates fixes issues
00:25:37 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] gcbrown: the gallery is a good issue and lets you see how everyone communicates fixes for similar issues
00:26:25 <aeonsolution[m]> in order to help with that, in my opinion you need to be able to build the development branch and test your changes
00:26:59 <aeonsolution[m]> contributing changes and putting it on the developers to test the change also probably won't get the change merged either
00:27:42 <gcbrown> is the CTS the thing to use?
00:28:07 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
00:29:25 <aeonsolution[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Is there a way to open tabs in i"> i think that's an option issue for Vanadium
00:29:36 <aeonsolution[m]> bromite has that option?
00:30:13 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/issues/65
00:31:29 <aeonsolution[m]> if you find where bromite added that feature on https://github.com/bromite/bromite, please hit me up
00:31:53 <aeonsolution[m]> that is something i can help bring to Vanadium
00:33:42 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] that is something i can help create a pull request so we can bring it to Vanadium
00:45:18 <gcbrown> do you really need 100 GB to build?

01:38:16 <icy-sprite[m]> Are PRISM members required to put backdoors in their products?
01:39:28 <jiibus[m]> <alex-a-soto[m] "Yeah, I'm looking to use somethi"> I went with jmp.chat, it's a pretty great service. Very private, too.
01:46:22 <icy-sprite[m]> cn3m: strcat if you guys don't mind
01:46:47 <strcat[m]> what?
01:46:54 <strcat[m]> why ping
01:46:59 <greenmoon[m]> About jmp.chat and the conversation app it's just me or this jabber client use almost no battery??
01:48:22 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "why ping"> Probably about their PRISM question
01:48:39 <strcat[m]> @Icy-Sprite ;^): you have a serious misunderstanding about what PRISM is
01:48:48 <strcat[m]> and it applies to every US company
01:49:01 <strcat[m]> any company with a presence in the US really
01:49:19 <strcat[m]> if you have a presence in the US you are subject to the laws there
01:49:22 <strcat[m]> like any other country
01:49:36 <jiibus[m]> <greenmoon[m] "About jmp.chat and the conversat"> Yea, I find it great on battery use. I pair it with orbot and everything through conversations goes through Tor.
01:49:53 <strcat[m]> and PRISM is part of the legal mechanisms they have put in place to request data from companies
01:49:59 <strcat[m]> which apply to every US company
01:50:01 <strcat[m]> not specific ones
01:50:21 <icy-sprite[m]> So it's just about data requests? No backdoors or whatsoever?
01:50:21 <strcat[m]> @Icy-Sprite ;^): here's my suggestion: read and research
01:50:28 <strcat[m]> @Icy-Sprite ;^): read
01:50:29 <strcat[m]> and research
01:50:36 <strcat[m]> don't ping me for no reason
01:50:57 <icy-sprite[m]> Alright, alright! Thanks btw.
01:55:07 <greenmoon[m]> <jiibus[m] "Yea, I find it great on battery "> Yea its crazy how the battery usage is low for that app compared to signal which is pretty bad on battery even with the recent battery fix or even compared to whatapps which use a less battery than signal.
01:56:38 <jiibus[m]> Also, did you see their script to import a .vcf to your jabber account? Quite handy
01:57:23 <greenmoon[m]> Not i have just the sms trial thing with jmpchat
01:57:39 <jiibus[m]> Ah! Well I can dig it up for you if you're interested
01:58:11 <greenmoon[m]> I dont need that but tanks
01:58:45 <jiibus[m]> Alrighty
02:04:23 <proof_jr> there a way to stop app run at startup?
02:04:56 <proof_jr> want app only run when needed
02:06:24 <strcat[m]> force stop
02:06:38 <proof_jr> second question, accessing tor on graphene unique?
02:06:41 <strcat[m]> proof_jr: startup is not the only thing that's relevant
02:06:49 <strcat[m]> dunno what you mean by that second question
02:06:52 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense
02:07:08 <strcat[m]> if you force stop an app it can't run into you launch it again
02:07:37 <strcat[m]> stopping an app from running at startup wouldn't stop it from running, so you were asking the wrong question
02:07:43 <proof_jr> tor recommends not changing screen size to blend in, pixel phones have somehwat unique screen resolutions
02:07:50 <proof_jr>  * tor recommends not changing window size to blend in, pixel phones have somehwat unique screen resolutions
02:07:56 <strcat[m]> proof_jr: are you talking about tor or browser privacy
02:08:01 <proof_jr> tor
02:08:09 <strcat[m]> then why are you talking about browser privacy
02:08:27 <jiibus[m]> I think there's likely an XY problem. Why do you want to control which apps start with the phone?
02:08:30 <strcat[m]> the Tor Browser doesn't hide the hardware that the browser is running on if JS is enabled - it doesn't successfully do that
02:09:09 <strcat[m]> jiibus: I answered the real question
02:09:09 <strcat[m]> already
02:09:45 <proof_jr> strcat: what else should i worry about other than start at boot?
02:09:57 <strcat[m]> proof_jr: you shouldn't worry about it you should use force stop
02:10:12 <strcat[m]> proof_jr: force stops works
02:10:30 <strcat[m]> apps can start based on broadcasts, alarms, jobs, and other things
02:10:37 <strcat[m]> if you don't want an app running, force stop it
02:10:54 <strcat[m]> starting at boot is just an example to listening to ONE kind of broadcast
02:11:11 <strcat[m]> use force stop
02:11:20 <proof_jr> can summarize to force stop is kill switch?
02:12:28 <strcat[m]> force stop kills the app and stops it from running again until launched manually
02:12:30 <strcat[m]> as I explained
02:12:35 <proof_jr> jiibus: using most default apps, but some don't have good alternatives or web app
02:12:52 <proof_jr> got it!
02:13:09 <strcat[m]> asking how to stop an app from running at startup is just not a relevant questionb
02:13:11 <strcat[m]>  * asking how to stop an app from running at startup is just not a relevant question
02:13:18 <strcat[m]> what if the app runs every 15 minutes via a job?
02:13:22 <strcat[m]> or an alarm?
02:13:26 <strcat[m]> or listens to other kinds of broadcasts?
02:13:34 <strcat[m]> it's just the wrong question based on misunderstanding how stuff works
02:13:40 <strcat[m]> the answer to the real question is using force stop
02:13:42 <strcat[m]> that's all I'm saying
02:14:02 <strcat[m]> which AMONG EVERY OTHER WAY THE APP CAN RUN stops it from starting based on the startup broadcasts
02:17:03 <strcat[m]> and it is force stopped until you launch it again
02:17:22 <strcat[m]> also apps are force stopped after you install them - that's the initial state before launching them
02:18:30 <greenmoon[m]> Did not know that force stopping was preventing them from being triggered by others kind of brodcasts, it must ne a récent feature, Nice!
02:18:43 <greenmoon[m]> * Did not know that force stopping was preventing them from being triggered by others kind of brodcasts, it must ne a recent feature, Nice!
02:19:13 <TheJollyRoger> Force Stop's been around since as long as I can remember...
02:19:29 <greenmoon[m]> Damn i removed my message
02:20:28 <greenmoon[m]> Yea but i remember that before it did not prevented them from restarting when triggered by an brodcast thing
02:20:31 <TheJollyRoger> On the IRC side of things, our clients don't actually see the flags for removing a message, any edits are just appended as another message prepended by an Asterisk, and the deletion flags are ignored entirely.
02:22:22 <greenmoon[m]> I tried to removed the first message for people using the old riot app that don't display edits but 2 messages but it removed both 😕
02:48:57 <greenmoon[m]> So the superfreeze app from fdroid do that exactly, either you have to click force stop manually or you can enable the feature to register it as accessibility service to do that automatically
02:56:06 * greenmoon[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200629-045033.png (284KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/oZwSijMIiNFjnlIBSaKlXuRP >
02:56:48 <strcat[m]> and then how are you going to use anything that needs to deliver notifications etc
02:56:59 <strcat[m]> or run jobs
03:01:23 <greenmoon[m]> I just don't add them to the list of app to stop
03:01:36 <greenmoon[m]> * I just don't add them to the list of apps to stop
03:04:40 <marquisderad[m]> Just a quick question about connectivity. If the device is on GrapheneOS in WiFi only mode and assuming all traffic from the device is encrypted but the network is hostile or compromised, what kind of attack surface does that open the device up to as far as execution of malicious code etc?
03:07:52 <fluoridatedsheep> <marquisderad[m] "Just a quick question about conn"> https greatly reduces attack surface. Use a trusted VPN or TOR with https attack surface is minimal
03:08:12 <fluoridatedsheep> > <@marquisderad:matrix.org> Just a quick question about connectivity. If the device is on GrapheneOS in WiFi only mode and assuming all traffic from the device is encrypted but the network is hostile or compromised, what kind of attack surface does that open the device up to as far as execution of malicious code etc?
03:08:12 <fluoridatedsheep>  * https greatly reduces attack surface. Use a trusted VPN or TOR with https and attack surface is minimal
03:18:08 <marquisderad[m]> So by using a VPN or TOR to filter all device traffic with a kill switch so that the network is not accessed without it, even on a hostile network the device would essentially remain secure yes?
03:40:48 <marquisderad[m]> One more thing also, if manufacturing a device with the idea of porting GrapheneOS or having it manufactured with security in mind, would a micro sd hardware security module be a suitable replacement for something like the Titan M?
03:40:55 <marquisderad[m]> Something like this
03:41:00 <marquisderad[m]> https://www.smartcard-hsm.com/features.html
03:44:18 <strcat[m]> no
03:44:27 <strcat[m]> not at all...
03:45:50 <marquisderad[m]> Is there only OpenTitan or are there other suitable equivalents?
03:46:25 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean but some random HSM like that doesn't have comparable functionality or security
03:46:45 <strcat[m]> you can't just drop in some random component offering a crappy HSM for RSA/ECC keys
03:46:57 <strcat[m]> that's not what the security chip provides
03:48:40 <strcat[m]> marquisderad: the whole point of the security chip is that it provides high quality hardware-based implementations of APIs used by the OS
03:48:53 <strcat[m]> it is not a random security chip dropped in and available for use
03:49:21 <strcat[m]> marquisderad: if you want to make an equivalent, that involves designing and implementing a chip providing the same APIs
03:49:53 <strcat[m]> can use the same open source drivers / HAL
03:54:06 <strcat[m]> the OS has no use for a random HSM, it has specific APIs that need to be implemented, you have the way it works backwards
03:54:10 <strcat[m]> AOSP has a specification
03:54:14 <strcat[m]> chip has to implement that
03:54:53 <strcat[m]> no use in one that doesn't and does not make sense to add some new half-baked, drastically inferior keystore that's not actually used by apps along with missing all the other stuff
04:07:05 <TheJollyRoger> I hope we don't have to ask NXP Semiconductors to make it. Or they'll tell us that we should ask our retailer for the documentation on those functions, then the retailer will tell us that the OEM needs to provide the documentation on those functions, then the OEM will tell us that NXP Semiconductors needs to provide the documentation on those functions.
04:07:23 <TheJollyRoger> T_T
04:50:15 <marquisderad[m]> Thank you for the in depth answer. I have a better understanding of it now. Will designing the chip to suit the AOSP specifications be a major hurdle in developing a security oriented device designed for GrapheneOS then?
04:51:54 <TheJollyRoger> marquisderad[m]: consider that chip design is expensive. Very expensive. As in, a multimillion-dollar company like Intel has to gamble its existence on a chip doing well.
04:52:25 <JTL> AMD is starting to eat their lunch </joke>
04:52:29 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehehe.
04:52:36 <JTL> Tasty
04:53:28 <cyborgninjaneer[> Apple is breaking up with Intel.
04:54:04 <cyborgninjaneer[> Now if only Tim Cook would break up with Xi Jinping... But I'm getting off topic.
04:54:11 <TheJollyRoger> heh.
04:54:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> Anyway, it might help with security on Macs
04:54:52 <marquisderad[m]> <TheJollyRoger "marquisderad: consider that chip"> Okay should I consider the idea of having a suitable device manufactured not feasible? It would be more beneficial to focus on existing hardware?
04:55:08 <JTL> My thoughts is they're going to move closer to the iDevice platform over time
04:55:14 <JTL> So that's entirely possible
04:56:47 <TheJollyRoger> I wouldn't say it's not feasible, just, it's going to be expensive and would require much more resources and manpower than the project has available at this point.
04:58:17 <cyborgninjaneer[> Need to focus on existing hardware the next few years.
04:58:27 <marquisderad[m]> Okay understood.
04:58:39 <cyborgninjaneer[> Grow the project, get more resources, then think about it again
05:00:47 <marquisderad[m]> How far off in the future is getting to the point of virtualization? Is it something that is accomplishable with hardware available today or is it a question of resources and manpower again?
05:01:20 <marquisderad[m]> Or for example the idea of using a microkernel
05:04:04 <TheJollyRoger> If people complain about anything less than twelve hour battery life, I don't think virtualization would be a viable approach for phones.
05:04:47 <TheJollyRoger> for a microkernel, I'm pretty sure the project can start looking into that when we've got a ready supply of maintainers for all its devices and a surplus of manpower and volunteers.
05:05:27 <JTL> > 22:04 <@TheJollyRoger> If people complain about anything less than twelve hour battery life, I don't think virtualization would be a viable approach for phones.
05:05:28 <JTL> I don't complain. There are also some workarounds and solutions for that issue,  but I'm also somewhat of a vocal minority these days.
05:05:55 <sheruleeya[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If people complain about anythin"> Not really much of an issue with fast charging though
05:12:41 <joshman[m]> <sheruleeya[m] "Not really much of an issue with"> Fast Wireless charging is a big issue with Google phones
05:14:35 <defconanon12[m]> Fast charging when wired is a non issue. To increase the charging have the phone in Airplane Mode. The estimated time tells me that it will be done in 3 hours but it usually takes 1 hour and 15 minutes.
05:15:41 <defconanon12[m]> This is all based on estimation but next time I can time it if you want.
05:19:24 <defconanon12[m]> The key is to have nothing running on in the background. At least this how I do it. It really is a non issue if the phone is dead though. Mainly talking about if you want to charge the phone while it is alive.

06:16:54 <cn3m[m]> Use PrivateDNS for all blocking
06:17:02 <cn3m[m]> It's far more secure and robust
06:18:00 <cn3m[m]> This is all covered in the FAQ
06:18:13 <cn3m[m]> It's there for a reason and it is more reliable than anyone here
06:18:42 <cn3m[m]> If it's in the FAQ that's what you do
06:21:36 <AdventureCommuni> Netguard allows you to distinguish between mobile and wifi for each app and gives the option to only enable when the screen is on
06:21:55 <AdventureCommuni> vs just revoking network access completely

06:37:58 <cn3m[m]> <sheruleeya[m] "Wdym by the network permission b"> Content providers, clipboard management, intents, and storage drops could bypass it without an exploit. Even a direct browser intent.
06:38:45 <cn3m[m]> Vastly harder to pull off than normal firewall bypases, but GrapheneOS firewall will benefit from scoped apps when support for that is added
06:39:13 <defconanon12[m]> Adventure Communist: Spotify as far as I know doesn't brick phones. Now my only worry with Spotify is that they may switch to fully Google API which means no access when you get rid of Google services.

09:20:47 <h3rb_> When I click on share I dont see any nfc option
09:25:30 <dazinism> h3rb_: Bluetooth, or USB C to USB C works. Never tried nfc
09:27:02 <h3rb_> Hi Dazinism
09:27:31 <h3rb_> Actually I tried sharing with Bluetooth and it works but I dont see an option for nfc
09:28:39 <dazinism> cn3m: had a pretty good look at the XDA post, unless i missed it/misunderstand (lots of replies, but i searched) couldnt see anything suggesting that they get verified boot working with the S10e
09:31:14 <x0axff> Hi guys, does someone know what are these strange requests vanadium is doing on every start? e.g http request to wiotuzj, kjkaldkaj and so on?
09:31:31 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "cn3m: had a pretty good look at "> I searched the comments
09:36:19 <jknsec[m]> x0axff I think those are Google domains? Not sure what their exact purpose is. Might be more info on the Github/docs (if Vanadium has docs).
09:36:47 <cn3m[m]> <x0axff "Hi guys, does someone know what "> Removed Google domains
09:36:57 <cn3m[m]> They won't resolve
09:37:02 <jknsec[m]> Ah
09:40:06 <dazinism> cn3m: whats the magic search term? Or got a link to the comment?
09:44:38 <x0axff> cn3m Ah so basically it changes the google links to something else?

18:42:46 <TheJollyRoger-M> Since you won't find it here.
18:44:21 <TheJollyRoger-M> We don't provide software support for booting GrapheneOS without initialization of components assumed to be present and functioning on your phone. Each instance of GrapheneOS on a given device is bitwise identical for devices of its type.

18:46:11 <TheJollyRoger> M5jd92[m]: you're welcome to download, fork, and modify the sources as you see fit, self-build, and self-sign your own builds and provision your own OTA infrastructure, but at that point you're not really running GrapheneOS.
18:47:05 <M5jd92[m]> I don`t understand why incompatant people don`t get hobbys instead of wasting others time. This OS is a securty os and this is his matrix channel,  where the f you want me to ask arround? If not in the security OS channel then where ???
18:47:27 <TheJollyRoger> Last warning.
18:47:29 <proof_jr> this for software, you asking about hardware

18:48:51 <greenmoon[m]> There is a guy on github issues that removed his WiFi chip and now his phone is broken he don't have cellular anymore 😹
18:49:37 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to find out, you will need to build a debugging cable using a Serial TTL UART cable to debug the phone over UART.
18:49:51 <TheJollyRoger> It's very likely that the phone won't boot if it doesn't find what it needs, and you'll need to self-build.
18:50:06 <TheJollyRoger> This means maintaining your own fork.

18:56:48 <M5jd92[m]> I do not understand why would I have to debug?
18:56:50 <TheJollyRoger> faheem5[m] 's said it.
18:57:43 <TheJollyRoger> M5jd92[m]: if you excise the hardware components and your phone has trouble booting, using a Serial TTL to UART cable to retrieve the kernel logs encountered during boot is about the only way to tell conclusively where it's failing.
18:58:25 <M5jd92[m]> > ^^ I think what folks are to say is this channel (support) is for the product as is.. if you want to modify/customize it.. ur more than free to do so.. but won't find much help here afterwards
18:58:25 <M5jd92[m]> I never will modify, i have no time for that, i just want one simple thing, removed sensors. And I pay for it and I know  many more people who will and are already paying for.
18:59:17 <proof_jr> 5jd92: open phone, disconnect cable and boot. if not boot, reconnect cable. Report results

19:02:31 <defconanon12[m]> Has anyone tried casting on Graphene OS? I used to cast and I am just wondering how insecure casting really is?
19:02:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hey defconanon12[m], I haven't tried using screencast.
19:03:44 <privacy_based_li> its as secure as the wifi hotspot of your display device
19:04:31 <privacy_based_li> if it connects without any password, then its just over a unsecured wifi network
19:05:41 <defconanon12[m]> WiFi hotspots usually aren't that secure.
19:06:24 <privacy_based_li> unless you configure your tv or whatever and put up a password
19:08:12 <defconanon12[m]> privacy_based_lifeform: Well I would be casting to a device. Not directly to the TV.
19:08:30 <M5jd92[m]> <TheJollyRoger "5jd92: if you excise the hardwar"> Are you so kind andl send me a link of a example cable when  i google i find only fancy once, or imaging it diffrent/wrong? :P
19:09:10 <privacy_based_li> <defconanon12[m] "privacy_based_lifeform: Well I w"> Casting always works over a wifi network
19:09:26 <TheJollyRoger> I have a complete start-to-finish walkthrough and itemized list of materials posted on my github, in fact. https://github.com/Peter-Easton/android-debug-cable-howto
19:09:57 <privacy_based_li> what device do you want to cast it to
19:10:19 <defconanon12[m]> privacy_based_lifeform: Correct. I don't know if there really is a way to cast it.
19:10:30 <M5jd92[m]> <greenmoon[m] "> <@5jd92:matrix.org> > There is">   Can I have link to that github issu? So like I asked the OS seems to starting. Yeah doesn`t really which one he intended to rempve, since wlan and celluar are on same single chip xD
19:10:52 <defconanon12[m]> You don't need to know the device. All you need to know it is a device that supports DLNA connectivity.
19:12:50 <privacy_based_li> for casting your phone and the display device should be connected to the same wifi network. Make it secure by putting up a WPA2 password on it. thats it
19:13:22 <M5jd92[m]> Am I wrong that GraphaneOS has its own sensors disable feature? Or does it use the official one?
19:13:39 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS indeed has its own sensors permission toggle.
19:14:39 <TheJollyRoger> This is per-app, so for instance, if you have a fitness app that you use while running to count the number of steps you've taken, and an app that you don't want to have feeling the movements of your phone, you can turn sensors for one off, while leaving the other unaffected.
19:15:10 <TheJollyRoger> There is no user-facing sensors permission on the vendor operating system. It is not a part of the Android specification.
19:15:35 <TheJollyRoger> The same goes for the Network permission toggle; the Android specification does not have it, it is unique to GrapheneOS.
19:15:39 <defconanon12[m]> privacy_based_lifeform: Oh well that is already done. If I don't have to do any other hardening configurations and just that layer of protection then I might be good.
19:15:47 <privacy_based_li> <defconanon12[m] "You don't need to know the devic"> > As you might expect, DLNA hardware is designed to work on a home network. It doesn't matter whether that network is wired or wireless, although with Wi-Fi you'll need to ensure that your network has sufficient bandwidth for what you want to do. We'd recommend 802.11n Wi-Fi for serious home sharing.
19:16:16 <M5jd92[m]> <TheJollyRoger "GrapheneOS indeed has its own se"> How do they act? My orginal thought is who ever coded sensors permission toggle, has a high posibilty to can imagine how the phone will behave when sensors where physcaly removed.
19:16:56 <jknsec[m]> It just zeros out the input, correct?
19:16:58 <TheJollyRoger> If you were to switch the "Sensors" permission to "Off" then what it does is it zeroes out sensor input to the app.
19:17:11 <privacy_based_li> <defconanon12[m] "privacy_based_lifeform: Oh well "> yeah, just make sure to put up a very strong password
19:17:17 <TheJollyRoger> This will give the app the impression that the phone is lying perfectly level, and perfectly still.
19:17:48 <defconanon12[m]> privacy_based_lifeform: Yep. Now I just need to worry about the app.
19:18:08 <TheJollyRoger> Note though that this will cause some apps, most notably SuperTuxKart, to stop functioning properly, because SuperTuxKart uses the sensors on your phone to act as your Go-Kart's steering wheel.
19:18:50 <TheJollyRoger> As well as some step-counting apps that use the accelerometer on your phone to measure when you've taken a step.
19:18:58 <M5jd92[m]> <TheJollyRoger "This will give the app the impre"> Ahh i see kinda emulating it, instead of removing it making a noise or stand photo. So as example if app forces active cam, it can start, but will dark, instead of crashing as example.
19:19:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <TheJollyRoger "Note though that this will cause"> By default =D I use the touch-steering
19:19:15 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderPr: ahahaha got it X3.
19:19:17 <privacy_based_li> <defconanon12[m] "privacy_based_lifeform: Yep. Now"> what app? are you using a seperate app to host the casting? or the media player app?
19:19:27 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Couldn't lay down as good of best laps with the g-sensors hahaha
19:20:53 <defconanon12[m]> privacy_based_lifeform: Host the casting. Not sure what app. Aurora Store is still down. I don't know of any open source ones. When I checked Aurora Droid I don't see anything of the casting nature.
19:21:48 <M5jd92[m]> I will use this phone only for secure communication, nothing else.

19:35:04 <M5jd92[m]> Ok perfect, so since wlan/celluar chip can be fried, and camera can be taken out, and OS will start fine. So then i guess the microphone should make least problems at least i hope so.
19:36:02 <privacy_based_li> yeah
19:36:44 <greenmoon[m]> But once you removed all that stuff the phone will be useless lol
19:36:49 <privacy_based_li> not sure about the wlan/cellular chips tho, thats your joyride

19:39:07 <M5jd92[m]> Yeah i will need wlan chip, so i will not burn it, but i meant the guy und github kinda made a stress test for me already xD when it comes to the topic "taking" frieing parts out. xD

19:48:02 <worldwideworld[m> <worldwideworld[m "Hi is their a way make every app"> Anything guy's?
19:49:36 <greenmoon[m]> Some launchers have that double tap feature
19:50:47 <privacy_based_li> <worldwideworld[m "Anything guy's?"> the developer options has a "override/force dark mode to all apps" option i guess
19:50:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <M5jd92[m] " A friend of mine knows a crazy "> He doesn't sound very crazy to me. Without knowing the resistance etc involved in each part, doesn't sound like a bulletproof rule, either. There's calculations involved.
19:58:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you had the right kind of documentation you could solder in resistors to compensate.
20:00:23 <worldwideworld[m> <privacy_based_li "the developer options has a "ove"> It doesn't override all apps
20:02:53 <privacy_based_li> Do you need to? I have this lenovo that I have tore down and poked alot on it, took off the notification led, camera, viberation motor, headphone jack and powered it on with motherboard in my hand and still it works
20:03:45 <privacy_based_li> <worldwideworld[m "It doesn't override all apps"> edit the app and build it?
20:06:05 <defconanon12[m]> privacy_based_lifeform: Oh to answer your question my display device doesn't receive anything. Usually I accomplish this by using third party apps.
20:06:11 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <privacy_based_li "Do you need to? I have this leno"> Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Without testing everything max power, it's tough to tell if you'll fry your board.
20:06:21 <M5jd92[m]> Read the full usage pages, and this paragraph makes me just wet and horny :P
20:06:21 <M5jd92[m]> MAC randomization is always performed for Wi-Fi scanning. Pixel phones have firmware support for scanning MAC randomization going significantly beyond a naive implementation. On many other devices, there are identifiers exposed by Wi-Fi scanning beyond the MAC address such as the packet sequence number and assorted identifying information in the probe requests.
20:07:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Wit"> These days, shit being broken but still in place seems fine, removing things is where you get into trouble if you're gonna find any. But, still unlikely to have trouble.
20:07:17 <privacy_based_li> <defconanon12[m] "privacy_based_lifeform: Oh to an"> ohkay
20:07:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Fun real world example: I crushed the shit out of the voice chip in a Fire TV remote. Worked exactly as expected - not at all.
20:08:39 <privacy_based_li> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Wit"> what do you mean max power?
20:09:40 <privacy_based_li> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Fun real world example: I crushe"> you crushed it, not removed it properly. It must be shorting
20:10:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <privacy_based_li "what do you mean max power?"> As in, all of the devices pulling as many amps as they're able to simultaneously
20:10:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <privacy_based_li "you crushed it, not removed it p"> That is correct.
20:12:17 <privacy_based_li> <DannyWorkOrderPr "As in, all of the devices pullin"> yeah it works normally, no problem
20:36:05 <defconanon12[m]> Has anyone in here used Image Pipe to remove the EXCIF metadata? It is terrible at changing the file path and not exactly sure how.
20:44:47 <defconanon12[m]> What is more advisable to do when it comes to preserving battery life? Should I always have battery saver turned on? I already am on Airplane mode for the most part. Is it more advisable to charge the phone as soon as it hits one percent or let it die? If anyone knows elaborate please thanks.
20:45:16 <defconanon12[m]> I utilize battery saver a lot by the way.
20:51:04 <worldwideworld[m> <privacy_based_li "edit the app and build it?"> How do you do that?
20:58:43 <faheem5[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I utilize battery saver a lot by"> thought I read with newer phones (battery type) cycling is not needed at anymore.. u can charge at 1% or 50%.. over the life of battery it wont make much difference..    not a SME on this topic though
20:59:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Don't let it die, there's no "life" to get it used to like old nickel-based batteries, but definitely try not to charge it a little bit over and over, there are a limited number of cycles (no matter the size) before the battery degrades.
21:00:04 <faheem5[m]> the biggest benefit to battery saver is it turns off background data.. so if ur in airplane mode..  maybe it's not making that much of an impact (unless ur wifi all day)
21:13:17 <faheem5[m]> <mrmanpants[m] "is this a good place to ask/disc"> https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0IN2YJFptu9DQAw/giphy.gif
21:13:41 <faheem5[m]> jk.. sup? i can help if i know the answer
21:15:07 <defconanon12[m]> faheem5: WiFi all day heh.
21:17:11 <defconanon12[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: Thanks for the info there is a reason they say let it die so they can make more chi chang! $v$
21:19:25 <faheem5[m]> <defconanon12[m] "faheem5: WiFi all day heh."> makes sense.. battery saver vs disabling each app permission (background data)
21:20:57 <defconanon12[m]> faheem5: I limit the background data as much as possible.
21:21:00 <faheem5[m]> <mrmanpants[m] "i'd prefer to keep my phone in a"> hmm good questions.. back in the day, when i was naive.. i had GV.. i suppose if there are pre-paid vendors willing to accept BitCoin that would be ideal..  i personally use Mint (its' cheap and uses T-Mobile's network) along with Signal
21:21:04 <greenmoon[m]> <mrmanpants[m] "I plan to use wifi 95% of the ti"> So leave VoIP calls receive ONwhile on wifi
21:21:16 <defconanon12[m]> Not completely eliminating cause that will be inconvenient really.
21:22:18 <faheem5[m]> sorry I don't have any good recommendations for VOIP ..other than NetTalk (mainly for home services for last 5 years)
21:26:52 <faheem5[m]> i'm not as hard core as i once was.. so i keep the celluar radio on at all times to recieve calls/txt from people.. but i try my best to get those closest to me on Signal
21:27:24 <faheem5[m]> each their own.. i
21:27:47 <faheem5[m]> i've settled on a balance.. bit of privacy and not giving up too much conveniences
21:28:54 <faheem5[m]> still have folks in my circle who use fb messenger/apps from their phones (+ IG, whatsapp etc)  ..i've learned not to preach anymore.. if they ask.. ill do my best to explain my stance and reasoning behind it.. but many just don't care or understand
21:33:18 <faheem5[m]> think it's great to be aware of the downfalls (some call it paranoia) but u gota balance it out with ur individual lifestyle
21:37:29 <faheem5[m]> makes sense.. it would be great research on finding a secure/privacy friendly voip provider.. i'd be interesting in learning what u come up with
21:38:48 <faheem5[m]> the native dailer app does have SIP settings
21:39:20 <faheem5[m]> far as the OS/app supporting it
21:40:29 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <faheem5[m] "makes sense.. it would be great "> I'm assuming Twilio is out, for one reason or another?
21:41:44 <faheem5[m]> u can type in ur voip provider info  (server address, u/n - p/w ) to connect to ur provider
21:41:55 <faheem5[m]> without using another app.. or so i think
21:44:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I have not heard info one way or another - but they're the biggest/most popular, which is why I was wondering why you hadn't decided to use them.
21:44:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Would be interested in info either direction.
21:47:30 <greenmoon[m]> Do the grapheneOS Internet toggle also prevent the Intent Filter Verification Service system app from sending data for the app?
21:47:59 <nickcalyx[m]> voip is pretty easy, there is a built in voip client in AOSP
21:48:00 <AdventureCommuni> What kinda name is that lol
21:48:47 <nickcalyx[m]> Signal uses Twilio to send out the SMS verification PIN codes, for whatever that's worth
21:49:43 <nickcalyx[m]> implying that they vetted them somehow
21:50:40 <nickcalyx[m]> android open source project
21:50:52 <nickcalyx[m]> what graphene is based on
21:51:15 <faheem5[m]> android open source project
21:51:40 <faheem5[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Signal uses Twilio to send out t"> and ton of fortune 500 companies.. plus they have certification behind em too.. hippa etc
21:53:10 <nickcalyx[m]> SIP = voip
21:54:19 <faheem5[m]> my only thing is does twilio offer their products/services to individuals or companies
21:54:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <faheem5[m] "and ton of fortune 500 companies"> Is that like a fatter version of HIPAA? 🤣
21:54:44 <bonerdose[m]> Anybody get a gcam apk to run on graphene?
21:54:44 <DannyWorkOrderPr> just bustin, carry on =]
21:55:37 <faheem5[m]> i read once.. and it
21:56:16 <faheem5[m]>  * i read once.. and it's true.. whenever u rely on a provider (i use nextdns instead of pihole) u r assuming they r gona do right by u (guard ur privacy etc) vs building ur own infra
21:56:28 <faheem5[m]> goes true for anything voip.. dns etc
22:02:39 <cn3m[m]> worldwideworld: usually you want to use separate user profiles. The work profile isn't really meant to be used like that
22:06:28 <ruddo[m]> <faheem5[m] "my only thing is does twilio off"> I used to work for them. You register and pay, you can use their service, or at least the most basic layers.  To the extent that I remember, however, there isn't a "VoIP phone service" they offered — it was more low level.
22:19:10 <proof_jr> anyone previously used easer for automation?
22:22:02 <ruddo[m]> Never worked right for me.
22:22:39 <ruddo[m]> I switched to WiFi Manager for WiFi, but that doesn't work either.  GREAT!  😖
22:22:59 <ruddo[m]> Greentooth works fine tho.
22:25:17 <jneplokh> mrmanpants: There is https://voip.ms and https://jmp.chat as well
22:26:36 <jneplokh> Getting SMS with Twilio is a little more complicated afaik, also they do not support receiving short-codes, so if u wanna use it for verification codes I would avoid them
22:36:03 <jneplokh> Voip.ms says they cannot guarantee shortcodes, but I can receive them. Only thing is there are a little more strict with using a VPN to pay, but if u r nice to customer support they usually allow u to bypass. Jmp.chat is more "private" and they fully support sending to and receiving short-codes. Also, they use XMPP for registration and u can pay with any crypto thru shapeshift iirc if u want that
22:37:24 <jneplokh> Voip.ms is fine for my needs, I just wanted a Google Voice alternative, really
22:41:02 <jneplokh> What do you mean exactly?
22:45:21 <jneplokh> Oh ok, yeah I am not aware of those. Maybe someone else can help there :)
22:47:12 <jneplokh> Well, what is your use case/reason to get VoIP?
22:47:13 <jneplokh> SIM is for data I presume(?)
22:47:55 <jneplokh> And no problem, I somewhat recently spent some time looking at different providers ha
23:02:34 <jneplokh> I mean JMP.chat is just $35/year, and it would also provide some compartmentalization between ur sim and VoIP provider. Voip.ms has two different options for pricing. U.S. rates: https://www.voip.ms/en/rates/united-states
23:02:49 <jneplokh> Also for SMS, would you mainly be receiving or both sending and receiving, as that changes things somewhat
23:11:04 <jneplokh> Yeah then Voip.ms/JMP.chat is a great solution
23:11:13 <jneplokh> Yep!
23:15:03 <jneplokh> Fair enough, yeah.
23:42:43 <defconanon12[m]> Is there no sharing button in the default Gallery app?
23:55:53 <concat[m]> Did Jolly Roger do something?
23:56:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <concat[m] "Did Jolly Roger do something?"> Happened a few times today, nah
23:57:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <defconanon12[m] "Is there no sharing button in th"> I have one
23:57:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Tap & hold an image
23:58:38 <nickcalyx[m]> Android is frustrating in its inconsistency sometimes
23:59:48 <defconanon12[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: Uh you mean in the file manager cause I see it there. Just not in gallery. But I see what to do now instead of using a 3rd party app.
