00:29:09 <strcat[m]> watch this with audio
00:29:12 <strcat[m]> what the fuck
00:29:44 <JTL> o_O
00:30:55 <JTL> Can't wait for the phone industry to remove the screen and replace it with a microphone and speaker backed by an "AI agent
00:30:57 <JTL> "
00:31:00 <JTL> /s
00:32:46 <strcat[m]> is it just me that gets a sci-fi horror vibe from this video?
00:32:54 <JTL> No
00:32:57 <strcat[m]> especially with the ominous music and glitch aesthetic they used
00:33:16 * TheJollyRoger rushes in.
00:36:39 <TheJollyRoger> ...OH GOD
00:37:30 <TheJollyRoger> I was half-expecting that smiley cartoon face to vanish and be replaced with a glowing red baleful eye but now somehow the lack of one is giving me the creeps.
00:37:59 <TheJollyRoger> Because at least if it was a big red baleful glowing eye at least I'd be able to say, "Well I guess that makes sense. Please make it quick!"
00:38:26 <JTL> Ahahahaha
00:42:13 <renlord> so they made HAL? and they decide to pair it with this eerie music?
00:42:16 <renlord> LOL
00:42:21 <renlord> how befitting
00:42:33 <renlord> i think it fits well
00:44:17 * TheJollyRoger starts making plans to go live on a Mennonite farm that has no technology except for horse-drawn carriages.
00:45:14 <TheJollyRoger> The more I think about that though, the more I get this funny feeling that I could go to a Mennonite farm and shout,
00:46:11 <TheJollyRoger> "SYSTEMD IS THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO LINUX!" as loudly as I can, and then watch a mob assemble with torches and pitchforks until I ask, "Hey how come you guys know what systemd is?" and then suddenly everyone would be like "... *gasp* our cover is blown! Quickly! Everyone, hide!"
00:46:35 <JTL> Ahahaha
00:47:08 <TheJollyRoger> Also, my Integricloud image just blew up up again. Think that's it, I'm going back to Void.
00:49:49 * TheJollyRoger starts beating it with a wrench
00:50:01 <JTL> SENTRY DOWN
00:50:20 <TheJollyRoger> *BOOM!*
00:50:54 <TheJollyRoger> Ok there we go.
01:08:10 <madaidan[m]> strcat: do you think Void Linux would be a better base than Debian? It doesn't freeze packages and uses musl, runit and LibreSSL. Only thing missing is Clang but it still seems like a massive improvement.
01:08:44 <renlord> cant you install clang on void/
01:09:18 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "cant you install clang on void/"> Yes, but I mean for compiling the packages.
01:09:38 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: by the way it has autonomous flight
01:09:45 <strcat[m]> it can actually move around and do things
01:09:46 <renlord> gentoo, build your own packages :)
01:09:53 <strcat[m]> why did they give it such a creepy face
01:10:13 <Zenithium[m]> :^)
01:10:14 <renlord> HAL.
01:20:15 <cyborgninjaneer[> I think someone was thinking of the old Macintosh logo from the 90s
01:21:06 <cyborgninjaneer[> It looks like 90s tech... And since it's aerospace that makes a lot of sense.
01:26:40 * TheJollyRoger reads what strcat[m] just wrote...
01:26:44 <TheJollyRoger> Nngnff!
01:26:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> Also, I have decided that I don't like object-oriented languages.
01:26:55 * TheJollyRoger 's cheeks bulge and he runs for the railing and starts vomiting.
01:27:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> Java code pisses me off.
01:27:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> Already knew I hated C++
01:28:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> Inheritance is shit.
01:28:35 <TheJollyRoger> Good gravy. With the 737MAX we already saw what happened when you let software fly... aaaaaaaa
01:28:47 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Too soon
01:28:56 <TheJollyRoger> T_T
01:29:33 <brenneke[m]> Does anyone run a firewall on GrapheneOS? Have been using afwall but need root.....will not have root with GrapheneOS right?
01:30:08 <cyborgninjaneer[> Oh dear merciful Gnu poo
01:30:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> You do not need a firewall. It's built in.
01:30:31 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: GrapheneOS already has a security model that relies on only netd having access to the networking stack. A userspace app (especially one that is required to break the android security model) to expose it is not needed.
01:31:02 <cyborgninjaneer[> There's a network permission toggle. You can firewall any app you like.
01:31:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah what he said! :)
01:32:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> You can also cut sensors per app
01:32:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> It can't see or hear you, or call home. Run whatever you want offline. It would have to run a side channel attack to get anything out.
01:33:15 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: correct. App-accessible root is never going to be considered in GrapheneOS, ever. It breaks the entire Android security model, which makes the fundamental assumption that nothing ever should need root equivalent privileges, not even Google Play on the factory operating system.
01:34:14 <brenneke[m]> OK, I'm learning, thanks!
01:34:46 <brenneke[m]> One less thing right?
01:35:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. Security theatre apps like afwall+, XprivacyPro, aren't ever going to work on GrapheneOS because they essentially have to break the entire security model of Android in order to spoof clientside checks, which only work if the app they're trying to spoof data to actually honours those clientside checks.
01:36:13 <TheJollyRoger> So they give you less security and less privacy, not more.
01:36:50 <cyborgninjaneer[> Just be glad you ended up here instead of LineageOS or something.
01:37:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <brenneke[m] "One less thing right?"> Good attitude. Good time to note that you should 1) Consider a different browser, like Chromium, over FF and 2) Kill your old Riot sessions, for just a tick more security.
01:37:21 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, the worst thing about them is that the attack surface they add is so great that should they ever be exploited, or even make a single clickjacking attack on you, that phone's compromised persistently, and you won't have verified boot to undo the damage because root and verified boot is mutually exclusive.
01:38:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, avoid Gecko/Firefox. The security model of Firefox is "let's throw all our eggs into one basket by making one process handle everything with no isolation site to site, what could go wrong?"
01:39:39 <wintermint[m]> As an FF user I find this super interesting
01:40:29 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah, avoid Gecko/Firefox. The s"> Depressing.
01:41:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <wintermint[m] "As an FF user I find this super "> I am a recent convert. They've lost credence with me over recent years. It's...unfortunate.
01:42:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Mozilla's marketing verges on "too good to be true" and more or less, it is. They've been building up their street cred by appealing to self-styled power users by privacywashing, and putting on shows with useless/theatrical gimmicks.
01:42:42 <TheJollyRoger> *correction, not verges on, but is generally
01:42:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> Mozilla might end up with something decent in the future, but it's hard to say whether it'll match chrome or not. They're building a new engine partially in Rust... Which might be good, or might be more crap
01:43:13 <cyborgninjaneer[> I don't trust them.
01:44:02 <cyborgninjaneer[> Mainly due to said marketing
01:44:37 <TheJollyRoger> I still have some instances of fireflops around, sadly, for various reasons, but I don't recommend it. >_<.
01:45:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I have a portable version/installed version around for manually sandboxing certain sites to their own browser.
01:45:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Facebook et al, I've given their own browser + related directory, entirely.
02:05:27 <brenneke[m]> FF? Have been using Naked Browser for years.
02:11:54 <Zenithium[m]> Dafuq is Naked Browser lol
02:12:48 <Zenithium[m]> Never heard of it, looks sketchy
02:13:40 <Zenithium[m]> I like the "I made this as a summer project in 2006" aesthetic1
02:13:49 <brenneke[m]> Lol..... sketchy why?
02:14:00 <brenneke[m]> Clean and lean.
02:14:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <brenneke[m] "FF? Have been using Naked Browse"> We're mostly talking about desktop browsers, mate
02:15:22 <Zenithium[m]> Does this look trustworthy to you? http://nakedbrowser.com/android/
02:15:57 <brenneke[m]> OK, don't like his website.
02:16:48 <Zenithium[m]> No documentation, no source, unknown developer, never heard of it, site isn't even HTTPS, etc.
02:17:35 <Zenithium[m]> How the hell can you not think this is literal spyware?
02:17:41 <brenneke[m]> Good points.
02:17:52 <brenneke[m]> Could be.
02:18:48 <rutxonboard[m]> > Dafuq is Naked Browser lol
02:18:49 <rutxonboard[m]> It's a small WebView based browser. About 20x more secure than Firefox
02:18:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Project definitely seems to strive for the experience a few people here would appreciate, but yeah, not being able to examine the source is odd for a project like this.
02:19:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Compare with Vanadium
02:20:28 <brenneke[m]> Once I get this installed will use Vanadium.
02:20:31 * Zenithium[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/BuWziGKvkWdSzNbSiSSzudiP >
02:22:54 <rutxonboard[m]> Well the hard work is done by Chromium Team and the GrapheneOS project
02:23:03 <rutxonboard[m]> Naked Browser just uses that
02:23:34 <rutxonboard[m]> Firefox technically has made a lot more security features if we're being honest
02:23:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> leaves
02:24:47 <rutxonboard[m]> Firefox sucks though
02:24:53 <rutxonboard[m]> Bad priorities
02:25:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Firefox has more privacy features. It does not have more/better security features.
02:25:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> This is discussed as early as 50 minutes ago above.
02:26:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > Firefox has more privacy features.
02:26:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> and that's more of a "may have"
02:26:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Especially when most of them just seem to be more along the lines of spoofing clientside checks or putting on a show for power users who want to believe they're "tuning!"
02:26:39 <rutxonboard[m]> Naked Browser has NO security features they made
02:27:16 <rutxonboard[m]> If Naked built their own engine it probably would be less secure
02:27:35 <rutxonboard[m]> Firefox privacy settings are not that amazing
02:27:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <rutxonboard[m] "If Naked built their own engine "> Besides watching for the WebView calls etc, we really can't tell what the hell they're doing, lol - no source
02:28:11 <brenneke[m]> Good thing am going GrapheneOS then!
02:29:55 <rutxonboard[m]> > Good thing am going GrapheneOS then!
02:29:55 <rutxonboard[m]> If you are on any other OS use Bromite. iOS just use Safari
02:30:56 <JTL> lol naked browser
02:31:08 <JTL> The name probably explains the lack of security /s
02:31:45 <rutxonboard[m]> It's at least a paid app..
02:31:54 <rutxonboard[m]> And based off Vanadium on Graphene
02:32:00 <rutxonboard[m]> It can't be that bad
02:41:32 <M2343-2343[m]> My Pixel 3 has been stuck 5 days in acceptance with the courier and I’m going insane
02:41:51 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, cripes, that's the worst!

02:42:47 <rutxonboard[m]> Yes
02:43:00 <rutxonboard[m]> Brave and Ungoogled Chromium are the only patched forks
02:43:03 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <M2343-2343[m] "That over iridium?"> Iridium is slow with patches.
02:43:04 <M2343-2343[m]> An I partially read above: def above Firefox
02:43:04 <rutxonboard[m]> Everything else is too slow
02:43:26 <rutxonboard[m]> Iridium is less secure than Firefox
02:43:40 <M2343-2343[m]> I got used to go insane with uMatrix on Ffox
02:43:56 <rutxonboard[m]> I do that with chromium
02:44:00 <rutxonboard[m]> Very fast
02:44:01 <M2343-2343[m]> :D
02:44:27 <M2343-2343[m]> So ungoogled-chromium + uMatrix and whatnot
02:44:33 <M2343-2343[m]> And a PiHole here and there
02:44:35 <rutxonboard[m]> We need a Firefox refugee group
02:44:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <M0xC0ncord[m] "ungoogled-chromium might be what"> Not to be confused with Chromium. Okay, got it. For anyone else - AUR (Arch User Repository) needs to be enabled to find the ungoogled-chromium in package manager.
02:44:38 <M2343-2343[m]> :)
02:44:40 <rutxonboard[m]> > So ungoogled-chromium + uMatrix and whatnot
02:44:40 <rutxonboard[m]> That's what I do
02:44:55 <rutxonboard[m]> Chromium-browser-privacy in rpmfusion
02:45:08 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <M2343-2343[m] "So ungoogled-chromium + uMatrix "> I tend to use uBlock Origin in conjunction with uMatrix
02:45:20 <M2343-2343[m]> If you have any link explaining why, just for extra curiosity and if you have something-not needed. Thanks for the advice
02:45:46 <M2343-2343[m]> Both are needed??
02:45:57 <M2343-2343[m]> Thought uMatrix kinda covered it all
02:46:12 <rutxonboard[m]> uMatrix mostly does
02:46:51 <rutxonboard[m]> gorhill uses medium mode on origin
02:46:54 <M0xC0ncord[m]> uBlock Origin is able to block some things even from first-parties iirc
02:47:08 <rutxonboard[m]> They both can
02:47:17 <rutxonboard[m]> Both got it
02:47:17 <M2343-2343[m]> Say uMatrix, https everywhere, decentraleyes & pihole. And you’d add uBlock Origin
02:47:36 <rutxonboard[m]> The whole first party tracking is FUD though
02:47:43 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Is HTTPS Everywhere still the gold standard? I've been rolling HTTPZ lately.
02:47:47 <rutxonboard[m]> uBlock Origin already had that stuff on block lists
02:48:01 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "The whole first party tracking i"> For privacy maybe. For ads, not necessarily.
02:48:04 <rutxonboard[m]> Ad companies and Firefox fans cashed in on it
02:48:17 <M2343-2343[m]> Lololol
02:48:21 <rutxonboard[m]> CNAME aliases were known and blocked
02:48:32 <M2343-2343[m]> So many analytics services use first party and you don’t know
02:48:42 <rutxonboard[m]> But ad companies wanted to sell the unblockable ad
02:48:49 <rutxonboard[m]> It's blocked in Chromium still
02:49:07 <M2343-2343[m]> Simpleanalytics allows you to add your own cname and suggests to use api.xxx.tld
02:49:14 <M2343-2343[m]> Good luck blocking that.
02:49:47 <rutxonboard[m]> How often do you check?
02:49:48 <M2343-2343[m]> Would not be surprised if cloudflare starts to offer serious analytics easy to pair with their dns service
02:49:57 <M2343-2343[m]> Or if GAnalytics does something similar soon
02:50:11 <M2343-2343[m]> How often do you check what
02:51:01 <JTL> 19:49 <M2343-2343[m]> Would not be surprised if cloudflare starts to offer serious analytics easy to pair with their dns service
02:51:02 <JTL> Me neither
02:51:14 <JTL> Considering they can rewrite first party JS at scale
02:51:34 <M2343-2343[m]> Yeah, also good luck blocking that
02:51:46 <JTL> Exactly my point
02:51:50 <M2343-2343[m]> They already offer browser analytics and inject js on some websites thsat enable it
02:52:31 <rutxonboard[m]> The blue links in Firefox?
02:53:06 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe. Maninthemiddleflare!
02:54:12 <M2343-2343[m]> Any preferences between 1passwd/lastpass/bwarden?
02:54:19 <M2343-2343[m]> Not self-hosted
02:54:54 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, no opinions. I just have KeePass but that's not synchronized.
02:55:16 <JTL> I think that's the safest optio
02:55:19 <JTL> option*
02:55:32 <M2343-2343[m]> Probably
02:56:18 <TheJollyRoger> I'm thinking of backing up my KeePass stuff with Tarsnap or something of the sort.
02:56:43 * JTL backs up TheJollyRoger with Tarsnap
02:57:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahahahahaha XD
02:58:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <TheJollyRoger "Hehehe. Maninthemiddleflare!"> o jeez - isn't Daniel a Cloudflare fan?
02:59:26 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderPr: As with everything, it's more complicated and nuanced than simple black and white. I like to call them MITMFlare because essentially that's what they function as, but that's just me.
02:59:52 <M2343-2343[m]> I mean, that’s their business model
02:59:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, their position is...reasonably questionable.
03:00:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <M2343-2343[m] "I mean, that’s their business mo"> Apple's business model = being a walled-garden, but that doesn't mean it's something that's good for a healthy decentralized tech community, and/or something we should strive for
03:01:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Not intentionally banging on Apple, just the first example that came to mind.
03:01:08 <M2343-2343[m]> Oh for sure
03:01:31 <M2343-2343[m]> No I mean it makes sense
03:02:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <M2343-2343[m] "No I mean it makes sense"> They're a really big centralized target for groups that love dragnet surveillance/data gathering

03:17:31 <M2343-2343[m]> Lite
03:20:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I've moved onto Qwant, worth the manual preference change in browsers that don't have it on list by default - do not like the previous projects of DuckDuckGo founder, which is controversial to say, don't care - but still feel 200% more comfortable using DDG than Google et al.
03:26:11 <cyborgninjaneer[> Qwant has its own indexing. Doesn't depend on Google or Bing.
03:27:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I was gang with Startpage (massive group-proxying of Google queries) for best of both worlds, but, 1) fuck feeding the beast, via any means and 2) Their ownership/partnerships have come under fire in recent times. Such a cool name, too.
03:28:26 <joshman[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Not to be confused with Chromium"> AUR version is outdated. You will end up running Chromium 80 instead of 81
03:29:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> Odd. Qwant was on Bromite but it's not on Vanadium
03:29:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> As someone that's currently not building their own shit, do you have any other recommended repo?
03:29:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Odd. Qwant was on Bromite but it"> Adding default browsers likely not at top of to-do list for the few developers getting shit done around here at the moment, understandable
03:29:54 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yeah... Any idea how to do it?
03:30:12 <JTL> joshman[m]: Upstream is 81
03:30:20 <JTL> (as in upstream of ungoogled-chromium)
03:31:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> Trying to figure out how to add Qwant to Vanadium. All they have is a play store link
03:31:53 <strcat[m]> 2343-2343: cloudflare does give you basic analytics when you're using their CDN
03:32:33 <strcat[m]> they set a tracking cookie on your behalf
03:32:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> 2343-2343: Qwant has its own index rather than relying on Google. IMO Qwant is more neutral, less politically motivated.
03:32:55 <strcat[m]> necessary to implement their DoS protection service, etc.
03:33:08 <strcat[m]> otherwise you'd have people forced to deal with captchas every time
03:33:16 <strcat[m]> which does happen if you don't keep the cookie
03:33:28 <M2343-2343[m]> Yeah if you enable the browser insights they injects an additional analytics.cloudflare.js or something very similar in naming
03:34:12 <strcat[m]> the whole point of their CDN service is that it's a reverse proxy sitting between your origin servers and users
03:34:17 <strcat[m]> and it has access to everything
03:34:34 <M2343-2343[m]> But otherwise that’s not on. It’s only if you turn on that option in Speed>Browser Insights
03:34:36 <strcat[m]> and a lot of what they offer is based on modifying content as it passes through them
03:35:12 <strcat[m]> it's a bit odd as a CDN
03:35:23 <strcat[m]> the usual model would be you upload stuff to the CDN and then reference it from there
03:35:32 <strcat[m]> or just have the entire static site there and DNS pointed at it
03:35:44 <M2343-2343[m]> It gives you a few points on lighthouse or pagespeed and else too, which doesn’t hurt if you want to stand a chance with their indexing
03:35:45 <strcat[m]> instead they offer a reverse proxy based on their custom nginx fork
03:35:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> You'll tend to get one side of an issue with Google-dependent search, at least in the US. Out of the defaults on Vanadium at present, I'd have to choose Ecosia. They at least use Bing instead of Google, and they're serious about respecting DNT, unlike almost anyone else.
03:36:05 <strcat[m]> so you have a bunch of edge servers around the world reverse proxying to your site
03:36:13 <strcat[m]> it actually makes it SLOWER for the initial connections

03:38:53 <M2343-2343[m]> Yeah either via Stripe Atlas or YC startup school
03:38:54 <strcat[m]> all we need are good VPS instances and a good anycast DNS service
03:39:00 <M2343-2343[m]> I think via Atlas more recently

05:50:15 <Biv[m]> how do I solve this
05:50:42 <TheJollyRoger> hitchhooker[m]: not quite. Many of them are for utilizing the sandboxing and memory safety improvements specific to GrapheneOS.
05:51:42 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium also provides some of the functions (like webview) for GrapheneOS so it's very much a part of the operating system, and many of the patches are specific to it.
05:53:12 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, speak of the devil. Build's done, almost three hours on the tick.
05:53:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Huh. Just found an android-emulator v30.0.5-1 package in AUR that doesn't seem to rely on Android Studio/Google as dependencies. Anyone have any experience?
05:56:15 <Biv[m]> any alternatives to aurora BTW?
05:57:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Using a second device and F-Droid local repo-ing?
06:03:45 <brenneke[m]> Just got up and running first time on GrapheneOS.....anyone have a solution / alternative for Lastpass crashing?
06:11:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hi brenneke[m], there is keepassdroid.
06:12:31 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know if it would fit your use case since you'd need to transfer it via a USB drive, but it might work if you can't get lastpass to run.
06:12:56 <TheJollyRoger> (Or the network if that's in your threat model)
06:13:30 <brenneke[m]> Just found that Bitwarden works, can add their repo in FDroid.
06:13:48 <brenneke[m]> Bitwarden safe?
06:14:26 <TheJollyRoger> I have only one answer to the question "is XYZ safe" and that's "does your threat model allow it?"
06:15:07 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I have only one answer to the qu"> OK got it.
06:15:50 <TheJollyRoger> Some people, like myself don't like to have copies of their password DB hosted on a third party server, but that's personal preference.
06:16:15 <TheJollyRoger> Some people are fine with it so long as it's encrypted.
06:16:32 <TheJollyRoger> Some people are OK with it if it's open source -- which Bitwarden appears to be.
06:16:38 <TheJollyRoger> Some people aren't.
06:17:19 <TheJollyRoger> Some people are OK with trusting a provider, some people prefer to do it in house.
06:17:32 <TheJollyRoger> So I can't answer that for you.
06:17:46 <brenneke[m]> Yes, agree, maybe keepassdroid better then.
06:18:08 <brenneke[m]> Any way to get separate number row with AOSP keyboard?
06:19:30 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not saying don't use Bitwarden ^_^. I'm saying that only you can make that call :P.
06:20:02 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I'm not saying don't use Bitward"> Thank you.
06:21:48 <renlord> running the full cts for sargo
06:22:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hey renlord, speaking of cts, I've now got a small collection of CTS results and I took some notes on what I got and took note of which tests failed for the 'cts' test.
06:22:47 <TheJollyRoger> For Blueline
06:23:30 <TheJollyRoger> Should we post the results or something somewhere or... or something?
06:23:48 <renlord> keep in a gist for now i guess
06:26:42 <Biv[m]> I think bitwarden would be fine for most people
06:26:48 <Biv[m]> like if you're willing to use lastpass then bitwarden would definitely be better
06:27:16 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m] - Biv[m]: the point I'm trying to make with asking "is something safe?" without qualifiers is that it's a really difficult question to answer! Maybe something like "Has anyone independently audited Bitwarden's encryption and published the results?"
06:28:38 <Biv[m]> yes
06:28:53 <TheJollyRoger> (Indeed, they have, Cure53 did)
06:28:54 <Biv[m]> this I understand I think its clear what their threat model is. at least to me
06:30:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
06:31:03 <brenneke[m]> Anyone know how to get separate number row on keyboard without installing Gboard?
06:31:19 <TheJollyRoger> Myself, I prefer to avoid using any crypto in the browser, but installed applications are usually good for me.
06:31:24 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: sorry, I don't.
06:32:09 <rgeturk[m]> simple keyboard from fdroid has a separate number row
06:32:53 <rgeturk[m]> in advanced settings
06:36:28 <brenneke[m]> Got it working thanks!
06:37:13 <TheJollyRoger> Nice
06:42:28 <TheJollyRoger> So - brenneke[m] - to return to "is it safe?" Well, let's see... it certainly won't be if you use a low-entropy master password, or want to depend on the JS Web Client and don't consider TLS and CAs to be "good enough". Outside of that, Bitwarden's clients and server software looks to be open source, looks like Cure53 audited it and they look like they know their stuff well, and the password DB
06:42:30 <TheJollyRoger> is stored and sent encrypted. The call is yours to make.
06:44:27 <brenneke[m]> Please tell me Vanadium has a way to do bookmarks folders!
06:45:03 <JTL> Why wouldn't it? It's just a patchset of Chromium
06:45:10 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: it does.
06:46:18 <TheJollyRoger> It's a little weird but when you select to browse bookmarks, just tap the pencil near the top-right of your screen.
06:46:24 <Biv[m]> would be nice if they got extension support already
06:46:46 <brenneke[m]> Yes, thanks......had to add one first to get option
06:46:51 <TheJollyRoger> You may need to create a bookmark or hit "move to" before it appears since it won't appear in the root director.
06:47:03 <TheJollyRoger> *directory
06:47:23 <brenneke[m]> Liking GrapheneOS!
06:47:28 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
06:50:15 <Biv[m]> i wanna sync my bookmarks to next cloud but apparently that's not at all important
06:52:52 <Biv[m]> google too afraid people will start adblocking on android even though this is already available in browsers that 90% of people don't mind using
06:55:56 <joshman[m]> Not too familiar with upstream AOSP. Can someone tell me if you have any active notification during Signal call?
06:55:56 <joshman[m]> Really annoying not to have any clue if my call is active or not. Nor do I have seconds counter during call

08:08:05 <rutxonboard[m]> Insane background rights
08:08:19 <rutxonboard[m]> That's the one area Apple wins hands down. Much better permissions
08:10:13 <rutxonboard[m]> GrapheneOS and good use of profiles is very good. The problem is Android was built from the ground up on other ideas
08:15:19 <hitchhooker[m]> Where do I setup the profiles?
08:20:39 <rutxonboard[m]> In settings
08:21:32 <rutxonboard[m]> System > Settings > Multiple Users
08:22:15 <rutxonboard[m]> Running no sensor data and a unique profile for every sketchy app provider is the way to go
08:22:45 <jacksonpollock19> Is it correct to think of profiles as virtual spaces?
08:22:45 <jacksonpollock19> Like if one of your profiles was successfully exploited for instance with key logging software.. Would the other profiles be safe?
08:23:07 <rutxonboard[m]> No it has no extra security
08:23:45 <rutxonboard[m]> It isolates apps and app lists, contacts, calendar, files and that stuff
08:23:50 <rutxonboard[m]> It also isolates VPNs
08:24:12 <rutxonboard[m]> It can also isolate device managers and accessibility settings I think. That's the only security benefit iirc
08:24:20 <rutxonboard[m]> But even then it breaks a lot of security
08:24:44 <rutxonboard[m]> So I wouldn't recommend adding a device manager or accessibility into a profile
08:25:09 <rutxonboard[m]> If you have to it is better then not, just expect unexpected leaks
08:26:57 <dazinism> This is interesting

08:27:47 <rutxonboard[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "But even then it breaks a lot of"> Android is not as good as iOS for security or privacy exception in very specific GrapheneOS cases
08:28:10 <rutxonboard[m]> I think people forget Android is made by an ad company. Graphene is the only Android I'll use
08:28:12 <JTL> >
08:28:14 <JTL>     Apps installed on your phone can get to know at what angle you are holding your phone, in which direction your phone is facing and can determine if you are moving your phone or not, all without any permissions.
08:28:15 <rutxonboard[m]> Probably ever again
08:28:28 <JTL> GrapheneOS has sensors permission
08:28:32 <rutxonboard[m]> And even do it in the background iirc
08:28:49 <rutxonboard[m]> Now that is very fingerprintable
08:28:57 <rutxonboard[m]> But again so is your device manufacturer date
08:29:04 <rutxonboard[m]> And no gapps
08:29:10 <rutxonboard[m]> And auditor and Vanadium
08:29:28 <rutxonboard[m]> Yeah basically you're very fingerprintable
08:29:52 <rutxonboard[m]> Don't log into Facebook app on Graphene ha
08:29:56 <rutxonboard[m]> PWA or bust
08:30:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > if one of your profiles was successfully exploited for instance with key logging software.. Would the other profiles be safe?
08:30:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > No it has no extra security
08:30:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> To clarify, are you saying that using another Android User Profile for Play Store apps increases Privacy, but isn't necessarily secure?
08:30:17 <rutxonboard[m]> I deleted my Facebook
08:30:31 <rutxonboard[m]> Yes and the privacy is not foolproof
08:31:28 <rutxonboard[m]> User Profiles are within the confines of Android's normal sandbox enforced by SELinux
08:31:33 <rutxonboard[m]> If you break out of the sandbox it is game over for all your profiles
08:31:36 <rutxonboard[m]> Rebooting will help a lot of course since verified boot
08:33:00 * jacksonpollock19 sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/cOVAKGcuwXlccKftBhjOWiXd >
08:33:01 <rutxonboard[m]> If you seriously think you got hacked then of course factory reset. Rebooting and checking device manager and accessibility only goes so far
08:33:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <rutxonboard[m] "If you break out of the sandbox "> Are we talking about the same thing?jacksonpollock1993 asked, if I'm understanding correctly, if a keylogger installed on User 2 would impact User 1 security.
08:34:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Presumably through a Play Store app, etc
08:34:07 <rutxonboard[m]> Define the keylogger
08:34:17 <rutxonboard[m]> Is it an accessibility thing you turned on?
08:34:21 <rutxonboard[m]> Or an exploit
08:34:40 <rutxonboard[m]> And is it a sandbox break? Or ipc exploit?
08:34:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <rutxonboard[m] "Define the keylogger"> > Presumably through a Play Store app, etc
08:35:00 <jacksonpollock19> <rutxonboard[m] "Or an exploit"> Either
08:35:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Exploits, of course, are usually device-wide, gameover.
08:35:09 <rutxonboard[m]> Since Firefox had an exploit on Android recently that hijacked ipc to exploit. Meant any app could attack and spy on Firefox
08:35:26 <rutxonboard[m]> In that case user profiles are 100% effective
08:35:56 <rutxonboard[m]> Accessibility keylogger is probably gonna be stopped by user profile, but I haven't tried it
08:37:07 <rutxonboard[m]> Shelter has device manager on work profile only and even starting in work profile still gives it a lot of access
08:37:17 <jacksonpollock19> Exploit in the operating system is going to be hard work I assume..
08:37:17 <jacksonpollock19> So malicious applications and malware are most likely things to worry about?
08:37:17 <jacksonpollock19> And your saying profiles would protect in that case..
08:37:20 <rutxonboard[m]> I would assume a device manager spyware could do something between profiles
08:37:36 <rutxonboard[m]> Exploit in the kernel or the sandbox is a serious issue
08:37:44 <rutxonboard[m]> It will 100% bypass
08:38:08 <rutxonboard[m]> That is also extremely likely to find a way to be persistent in some form even with a reboot
08:39:16 <rutxonboard[m]> So to recap. Ipc hijacking exploits are foiled by separate user profiles. Accessibility probably, but I haven't tried it. Keyboard is user profile based. Device manager probably will leak some data
08:39:40 <rutxonboard[m]> Exploit on the system bypassed all and is probably going to work in some persistence(it's possible)
08:40:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> So use profiles/users, and reboot every day at least?
08:41:05 <rutxonboard[m]> Yeah that's wise
08:41:16 <rutxonboard[m]> Check device manager and accessibility
08:41:41 <rutxonboard[m]> I am not the best Android pentester, but one way to force persistence would be locking in an accessibility app or device manager
08:41:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <rutxonboard[m] "Check device manager and accessi"> Unfamiliar with Device Manager, could you elaborate?
08:42:08 <rutxonboard[m]> Find My Phone, Shelter, and other apps use it to get a lot of system access
08:42:19 <rutxonboard[m]> A malicious app could too
08:42:47 <rutxonboard[m]> If you check at least before you do something sensitive that's not a bad idea
08:43:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Thoughts on Shelter itself?
08:43:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> P.S. rutxonboard What's your user image showing?
08:43:49 <cx2[m]> <brenneke[m] "Anyone know how to get separate "> AnySoftKeyboard.....it takes a bit of tweaking to get it to your linking... but it's pretty good.... I don't know about on GOS though, Ive been using the stock keyboard
08:43:57 <rutxonboard[m]> I haven't audited it, but it seems sound in concept. Only the work profile has device manager(which might leak data, but again I haven't tested it)
08:44:06 <rutxonboard[m]> Shelter is probably the easiest option for people

08:49:31 <rutxonboard[m]> GrapheneOS is much more costly and timely to exploit due to all the mitigations. It is a very low target. Which is good with how Google handles updates with their security partners

08:58:28 <rutxonboard[m]> I also check my accessibility and device manager settings weeklyish(I imagine a hacker far better then myself would have a better solution if they could break into GrapheneOS though).
08:58:28 <rutxonboard[m]> I also use user profiles anywhere an ipc exploit could be a risk. For example the attack on Firefox. If you isolate your Vanadium browsing that couldn't be possible. Never use Firefox as it sucks
08:59:07 <rutxonboard[m]> Just find what you are comfortable with. I am sure I would be fine if I never checked device admin or rebooted(beside updates) or anything like that

09:04:21 <rutxonboard[m]> If you want to run Tor Browser there are a few options. I would personally run it in it's own profile and wipe it's data Everytime
09:04:48 <rutxonboard[m]> There is a lot this won't help with
09:05:09 <rutxonboard[m]> For example it won't protect your from a kernel exploit or sandbox break
09:05:30 <rutxonboard[m]> It won't protect your IP(even if you use Orbot in VPN mode)
09:06:38 <rutxonboard[m]> It will protect you from Tor Browser getting hacked to target other apps with ipc exploits. The data wiping makes it less likely to have a persistent tracker embedded inside the app sandbox
09:07:19 <rutxonboard[m]> So tor user profile and wiping data everytime is the least bad way to use Tor Browser
09:07:41 <rutxonboard[m]> Beside running it in Limbo ARM emulator of Linux
09:07:52 <rutxonboard[m]> But that is more advanced

09:21:48 <rutxonboard[m]> For accounts if you don't need to verify an email set it to an email at their domain. For example rutxonboard⊙rc wouldn't be compromiseable in anyway
09:22:01 <rutxonboard[m]> That didn't also get a Reddit account(if I had one)
09:22:28 <rutxonboard[m]> For other uses PGP is good for accounts, but only Facebook supports that

09:29:39 <rutxonboard[m]> FOSS e2ee bookmarks sync. It is an add-on for Chromium and Firefox. It is a bookmark app on Android and a little clunky on that side
09:29:45 <flabbergasted> xbrowsersync is amazing
09:30:11 <rutxonboard[m]> XBrowserSync has multiple free public hosts including a default
09:30:15 <rutxonboard[m]> It's very good
09:30:32 <flabbergasted> except this one time I connected it to my firefox browser and it destroyed all my bookmarks haha. Stay away from Firefox.
09:31:28 <rutxonboard[m]> Firefox does somethings right
09:31:37 <rutxonboard[m]> For example actually auditing some extensions
09:31:40 <rutxonboard[m]> Getting patches out faster then most browsers
09:32:25 <cx2[m]> looking into it as we speak.... As far as a hardened firefox is concerned... I understand the uniqueness that each users setup tied with IP presents, but that's generally only tied to add-ons correct?
09:32:25 <rutxonboard[m]> It's horrible in every other way though
09:33:03 <rutxonboard[m]> > looking into it as we speak.... As far as a hardened firefox is concerned... I understand the uniqueness that each users setup tied with IP presents, but that's generally only tied to add-ons correct?
09:33:03 <rutxonboard[m]> No not at all. Even Tor Browser has fingerprinting issued
09:33:51 <rutxonboard[m]> Try amiunique on 2 PCs with hardened Firefox and it's probably going to be different not counting your way of interacting
09:40:31 <cx2[m]> This all seems to be tied to fingerprinting... which admitedly seems wildly powerful.... So Tor Browser for Desktop should still be fine.
09:40:34 <cx2[m]> Do you have documentation that I can read?
09:40:38 <cx2[m]> Well, I'm not quite a believer just yet, fortunately the sky isn't quite falling in my world either. That said, if you have documentation that I can read I'd really appreciate it!

09:42:22 <cx2[m]> In addition some ungoogled-chromium addons, or a place to look would be pretty handy as well. Most of my eggs have been in a firefox basket
09:42:30 <hitchhooker[m]> so rutxonboard, you would trust more connecting to onion website with ungoogled chromium + tor than tor browser?

09:58:27 <rutxonboard[m]> Fingerprinting is a lot cause in my opinion
09:58:35 <flabbergasted> uBlock and xbrowsersync from GitHub and Decentraleyes from Gitlab is what I prefer using with Chromium. I don't run ungoogled. I feel the updates are more consistent on Chromium.
09:58:39 <rutxonboard[m]> So is blocking, but it is far more transparent
09:58:53 <rutxonboard[m]> I rather have a massive block list then worry about fingerprinting

17:37:35 <joshman[m]> Yes

17:39:16 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Which, how come? Wasn't one of Google's motivations behind the launch of the Pixel line to put other OEMs to shame for only supporting devices for up to 2 years? Then they went and did the same thing.
17:40:22 <cdesai> I have pixel 4 booting with https://github.com/chirayudesai/android-prepare-vendor/commit/fd45b2e2633ed355130a2f323de2ddc387683326

18:08:39 <flabbergasted> brenneke: some apps require google services to run, you won't get that on GOS.

18:15:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <muscadel[m] "would graphene be useful if some"> No. The network is not considered trusted. You connect directly to their tower(s), they see where you're at and what you're sending to where over cellular. Whether it's an https connection to Google, or a Tor connection, they see it.
18:16:20 <hitchhooker[m]> muscadel, if you keep radio's turned off and use wifi& encrypted messengers, you fine.
18:17:02 <hitchhooker[m]> you can find more info at FAQ at website
18:18:51 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Assuming your WiFi connection, and hardware, are secure.
18:19:30 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <hitchhooker[m] "you can find more info at FAQ at"> Highly recommended reading, every page on Grapheneos.org, brenneke
18:19:50 <muscadel[m]> something like wifi over vpn and using the phone as a wifi device?
18:20:35 <muscadel[m]> right I'll go read the FAQ first
18:21:00 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/faq Someone mention the FAQ? :)
18:21:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Good question. If you trust your WiFi network, or a VPN provider, or better, your own VPS VPN, wrapping your cellular traffic in a Wireguard connection to one of those is (IMO) the gold standard.
18:21:40 <TheJollyRoger> I can also answer a few questions if you don't find your answers there, (questions depending of course!)
18:24:08 <TheJollyRoger> muscadel[m]: GrapheneOS aims to blend in with the countless other mobile devices on the network. That's why it makes some default connections and sends some pings that it does.
18:25:36 <cx2[m]> That brings up a good question.... Wireguard App with Mullvad configs? Or Mullvad app which only allows wireguard connections.....opinions?
18:26:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cx2[m] "That brings up a good question.."> I've seen no reason to stray from official, widely used WG app - got any for us to consider? =]
18:27:30 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Having said that, you're trusting Mullvad to secure the VPN, so, it probably wouldn't be a stretch to trust their app. Just seems unnecessary.
18:28:03 <rgeturk[m]> wireguard key rotation is built into the Mullvad app
18:28:17 <cx2[m]> That's the thing... normally I'd agree, but Mullvad's app provides ONLY WG connections anyway...
18:29:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cx2[m] "That's the thing... normally I'd"> Implementations of crypto are exploited far more often than the cryptography itself.
18:29:01 <flabbergasted> I'll say it again, if you want to use a VPN, host one yourself for 5 bucks per month. Why choose to  trust someone else doing it for you.
18:29:12 <cx2[m]> As far as trusting mullvad is concerned.....Obviously you can't blindly trust any VPN provider.... but if I were to trust one? It's absolutely Mullvad, full stop.
18:29:24 <muscadel[m]> I couldnt trust the wifi network neither my own nor the free ones if I am moving around. I would depend on the VPN to protect me
18:29:37 <TheJollyRoger> cx2[m]: I haven't tested it the wireguard app but I've heard some people report that the userspace implementation of wireguard works.
18:29:43 <cx2[m]> Sort of defeats the purpose of a blending in if you're hosting it yourself
18:29:51 <TheJollyRoger> I just trust the site's SSL.
18:30:24 <TheJollyRoger> Since I don't use a VPN at all, if I need to I'll use Tor.
18:32:10 <muscadel[m]> protonvpn?
18:32:11 <flabbergasted> I only use a VPN to "hide" from my ISP. There's really no other use for it tbh. As TheJollyRoger says; if you need anonymity for something, use Tor.
18:33:52 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yes. Something we want to know as well...
18:34:19 <nickcalyx[m]> There is one use, things that are UDP based
18:34:49 <TheJollyRoger> If anyone is at a place that has a captive web portal like at a Starbucks or an Airport, and you use a VPN, please let us know if the request for the captive portal is first attempted to be routed via the VPN and fails because it cannot reach the VPN provider.
18:35:02 <cx2[m]> My ISP....multiple visits to the top ten websites that I frequent, International travel with blocked websites without the use of certain servers (that goes both ways)..... etc.
18:35:02 <cx2[m]> GOS makes it a point to "blend in" and theres a reason for that....Yeah you're ISP might not see your traffic, but the rest of the internet, *especially* the sites you visit most, can pick you out of a lineup pretty easily.
18:35:07 <brenneke[m]> Any tricks for getting adb to work with GrapheneOS? Not sure if my PC or phone.
18:35:51 <cx2[m]> There are a mountain of reasons to maintain the ability to switch VPN servers on a whim.
18:36:09 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: you shouldn't need to use adb day to day with GrapheneOS, it opens up a considerable amount of attack surface from your desktop computer. Nevertheless, if you feel you need to use adb with GrapheneOS, there's nothing much else you'll need.
18:36:22 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS implements seedvault for its backup system so there is no need for adb backup.
18:36:57 <brenneke[m]> OK, not backing up.
18:37:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <brenneke[m] "OK, not backing up."> What's your ADB desire, out of curiosity?
18:37:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Studying people's common questions/desires pretty closely, your response appreciated
18:37:42 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: go to the "Backup" section of settings.
18:37:51 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need a USB drive for this though.
18:38:21 <TheJollyRoger> Seedvault allows you to record a 12-word recovery seed onto a sheet of cardboard, and then backs up your apps, then backs up their data encrypted.
18:38:40 <TheJollyRoger> However, note that some apps by design set a "Please do not back me up!" flag which politely asks the OS not to back them up.
18:39:26 <TheJollyRoger> Seedvault respects this request and will not back up apps that have marked themselves as having stored sensitive data (such as private keys, session keys, etc) so if it detects that flag it will say "app not backed up."
18:39:37 <flabbergasted> <cx2[m]> I don't believe a VPN will give me more privacy, I only use it to keep my ISP from logging what sites I visit. They see 1 IP instead of a dozen.
18:39:40 <TheJollyRoger> This is MUCH safer than backing it up via the attack surface of the computer.
18:39:49 <brenneke[m]> Was going to send adb commands to get Franco's Naptime app to work no root bit then I remembered.....going to do things different now, clean, sime and (hopefully) secure.....so uninstalled!
18:39:50 <flabbergasted> So self hosting makes more sense to me.
18:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: Settings -> System -> Backup
18:40:53 <muscadel[m]> if I am using riot via mobile data without a vpn, is it obvious to ISP that I am using riot/matrix. If I uses a vpn, the ISP can't tell what I am using. or signal, telegram etc.
18:41:03 <TheJollyRoger> Your apps are backed up unencrypted, however their application data is encrypted before seedvault writes it out to your attached storage, so you're safe.
18:41:09 <TheJollyRoger> (be right back)
18:49:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > if I am using riot via mobile data without a vpn, is it obvious to ISP that I am using riot/matrix. If I uses a vpn, the ISP can't tell what I am using. or signal, telegram etc.
18:49:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But the VPN's upstream ISP can. Important to remember. There's always an endpoint that can, at min, see metadata
18:51:36 <cx2[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: Sure they can.... right alongside the hundreds or more other uses checking out the *www* via the same servier...blending in.
18:51:47 <cx2[m]> server*
18:52:56 <midnight> DannyWorkOrderPr: They can based on traffic analysis.
18:53:18 <flabbergasted> and fingerprinting
18:54:56 <midnight> too bad the old type III remailer protocols aren't alive anymore.
18:57:32 <cx2[m]> Couldn't agree more.... which is why switching servers should be standard practice. Nevermind the ability to cascade through wireguard....or TOR over cascaded wireguard servers, etc.
18:57:50 <midnight> bandwidth will soon be plentiful enough to effectively foil (in some cases) traffic timing analysis for low-bandwidth messaging-type protocols with user-controlled local relay points and such.
18:58:06 <cx2[m]> all of which (IMO) provide far less surface area than hosting your own instance.
18:58:26 <midnight> Like all the sexy stuff out there, it seems all the thought went into it decades ago and people are just waiting for the world to catch up to implement. :)
19:15:25 <TheJollyRoger> muscadel[m]: if you're using Signal without a VPN, your ISP and anyone on the network can tell your phone is making a TLS connection to Amazon AWS... just like every other phone in the world is since AWS hosts something like seven in every ten smartphone backends. This is why Signal hosts on AWS.
19:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Now you're forcing disproportionately large amounts of traffic to a VPN service provider with disproportionately small amounts of other traffic.
19:17:02 <nickcalyx[m]> with Tor, the upstream ISP of the exit node can see you are connecting to Riot, or whatever too
19:17:10 <nickcalyx[m]> the question is can they link it back to you
19:17:31 <nickcalyx[m]> the only way to prevent that would be if Riot worked on Tor hidden services
19:17:54 <Zenithium[m]> Was it with Tor bridges that AWS started blocking the traffic so they had to switch to something else?
19:18:19 <TheJollyRoger> Zenithium[m]: domain fronting on Telegram.
19:18:52 <TheJollyRoger> After that AWS started cracking down on domain fronting all over the place. Azure still allows it.
19:20:09 <Zenithium[m]> I wasn't sure what it was, I also remember Signal being blocked in Egypt or something like that
19:20:41 <midnight> Signal also uses (used?) domain fronting; so TLS SNI sniffing doesn't really work.
19:21:00 <midnight> (And to block Signal would require e.g. blocking google.com)
19:21:41 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy midnight ^_^

19:24:46 <flabbergasted> I wonder if I should make the switch to Fedora on my laptop. It's running debian atm.
19:24:53 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
19:25:08 * flabbergasted creates a bootable USB
19:25:17 <Zenithium[m]> TheJollyRoger: why don't you use VPNs/Tor that much?
19:25:44 <TheJollyRoger> Zenithium[m]: I said I don't use VPNs, I never said anything about not using Tor :)
19:26:35 <Zenithium[m]> "Since I don't use a VPN at all, if I need to I'll use Tor." Makes it seem like you seldom use Tor, whatever "need to" means.
19:27:19 <TheJollyRoger> I don't use a VPN because it doesn't fit my use case, and because I trust my ISP, which is in my jurisdiction, regulated by Canadian law, is bound by the same statutes I am, and has a very good privacy policy and track record, more than a shady company run out of a postalbox in Delaware or that could be a fly-by-night operation run by some unscrupulous person who I have no connection to and no
19:27:21 <TheJollyRoger> means to look upe
19:27:23 <Zenithium[m]> Why not always use Tor, and use clearnet when you have to? :)
19:27:39 <TheJollyRoger> Zenithium[m]: you misunderstand.
19:27:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <flabbergasted "I wonder if I should make the sw"> Why Fedora > Manjaro?
19:27:55 <TheJollyRoger> But I don't comment more on that.
19:28:05 <TheJollyRoger> (See my hostname for more details)
19:28:06 <limitless0[m]> <TheJollyRoger "muscadel: if you're using Signal"> Signal on android i dont think uses amazon aws,or not all thr times.a few months back on netguard it recognised the connection as signal servers. Not 100% sure though
19:28:26 <muscadel[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yes."> JollyRoger  you seem to be saying that VPN is not much use on a phone.  It does slow things down a bit too esp on 3g or H+.
19:28:33 <Zenithium[m]> Yeah I didn't say you should use a VPN, I dislike them too. Just asking why not always mask your IP from sites.
19:28:46 <TheJollyRoger> Zenithum - again, see my hostname for details.
19:28:48 <flabbergasted> DannyWorkOrderP: I use Fedora on my workstation and I've never used Manjaro/Arch before.
19:29:22 <TheJollyRoger> ~Jolly_Rog@gateway/tor-sasl/thejollyroger
19:29:49 <muscadel[m]> I assume its at least hiding some data like browser use and some metadata?
19:29:57 <TheJollyRoger> Except for some cases I don't comment on where I use Tor.
19:30:42 <flabbergasted> We have strong privacy laws here too, but the ISPs are required to log all traffic that leaves the border for 3 months. I don't appreciate that so I use a VPN just for that reason.
19:30:59 <Zenithium[m]> freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org is your hostname for me, I'm on Riot :D
19:32:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, on the IRC side I appear as JollyRoger/tor-sasl/thejollyroger or ~Peter@gateway/tor-sasl/thejollyroger etc. Again, outside of this mode of use I deliberately don't talk about where I use Tor.
19:32:38 <TheJollyRoger> Except that the good news is I maintain *lots* of cover traffic
19:32:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <flabbergasted "DannyWorkOrderP: I use Fedora on"> Give Manjaro, maybe with KDE, a try. Been using desktop Linux since 'nam, it's been...a revolutionary experience, for me.

19:39:56 <Zenithium[m]> Yeah I wanted to ask if you had any experience with Gentoo Hardened, I'm planning to eventually switch to that kind of musl setup as well

19:50:39 <TheJollyRoger> Ah well XP.
19:51:28 <Zenithium[m]> Yanking the Ethernet cable out when I want to open a PDF should be fine right? hahahah
19:52:35 <Zenithium[m]> I should learn more about how malicious PDFs even work since if I don't understand it I can't defend against it
19:52:38 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahahahaha with everything it depends on threat model :P. Airgaps only seem to be a last resort when all else has failed: if it gets code execution it could unpack a payload that could simply lie in wait until you plug the computer back in.
19:53:15 <Zenithium[m]> Yeah that was my thought as well, but not sure what to do about it really
19:53:27 <Zenithium[m]> Open it in a regular VM I guess
19:54:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's what I've taken to doing >_<.

20:17:10 <rutxonboard[m]> Agreed. If only it got GrapheneOS and could be a laptop and didn't lose support already
20:17:36 <TheJollyRoger> Oh fantastic. Well, I mean I probably wouldn't use it for much except maybe for communicating with my grandparents, and reading PDFs, possibly taking notes. Of course, those are pretty damn solid use cases and have a lot of attack surface.
20:18:00 <TheJollyRoger> So for significantly less than a laptop, that's not a bad idea all things in.
20:18:09 <nhscm[m]> Have you people heard about Clip OS 5. I am eagerly waiting for them to reach stable. I have been running Qubes for a long time, because I really need those dispVMs but not having hardened templates really worry me sometimes.
20:18:28 <rutxonboard[m]> I want a tablet as a laptop for security. Use my gaming rig for gaming and my an old laptop for coding offline

20:19:10 <rutxonboard[m]> It is a very secure option for those things. I'd say much better then Qubes
20:19:20 <TheJollyRoger> I'm in the uncomfortable position where I have hardware and firmware I trust, but the software support isn't quite here yet :(

20:19:23 <rutxonboard[m]> Make your own templates
20:20:27 <rutxonboard[m]> Kicksecure on Qubes for example isn't that bad.. the lack of in VM gui isolation is the only issue if you use Sandbox App Launcher
20:20:29 <TheJollyRoger> At least, not until this operating system gets a complete redesign and a new kernel, and while we're at it, a new operating system.

20:33:23 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Compatibility and performance"> Performance is not one of Qubes strong poits, so I dont think thats one of the reasons
20:34:39 <rutxonboard[m]> Even then you already need a laptop that supports Intel ME, it supports vt-d, now it has to be even faster and have even more ram?
20:35:28 <rutxonboard[m]> Qubes I see as a research project. They don't have secure packaging or guests. It's a two trick pony(AEM and Xen)
20:35:41 <nhscm[m]> I still think Qubes is pretty amazing and I rely on those dispVMs. I always come back to Qubes, because I cant live without the ability to spin a customized, clean instance of Firefox in 10 seconds.
20:35:53 <rutxonboard[m]> While two very good tricks it is just not as secure and ChromeOS or iPadOS

20:36:37 <rutxonboard[m]> If you want a Xen exploit to actually work it's going to happen on a Firefox running on Fedora completely stock

20:49:42 <rutxonboard[m]> I am definitely looking forward to following your work
20:51:42 <rutxonboard[m]> I think iPad or 8cx laptop running Kicksecure would be the most appealing going forward.
20:52:13 <madaidan[m]> Good luck sticking linux on an iPad
20:54:13 <rutxonboard[m]> I mean an iPad running iPadOS
20:54:21 <rutxonboard[m]> For secure laptops
20:54:25 <rutxonboard[m]> Something on arm and hardened
20:54:51 <rutxonboard[m]> Qubes is too heavy, and ChromeOS spys too much
20:54:59 <madaidan[m]> Ah
20:55:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <JTL "I don't know how useful a "ungoo"> For having separate devices for separate tasks, with next to no attack surface? Massively useful.
20:55:56 <rutxonboard[m]> ChromiumOS is bad it has no verified boot and is tied to Google still
20:55:59 <rutxonboard[m]> Avoid it
20:56:11 <JTL> I'm just saying, how much of ChromiumOS can function without Google integration? (at least easily)
20:56:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Are there not hardware that support verified boot etc?
20:56:35 <rutxonboard[m]> Same as ChromeOS
20:56:45 <rutxonboard[m]> Just no persistence since guest mode
20:56:54 <rutxonboard[m]> > Are there not hardware that support verified boot etc?

20:57:02 <JTL> right
20:57:17 <rutxonboard[m]> ChromiumOS is quite bad or we would see a project like Graphene built on it

20:59:04 <rutxonboard[m]> > I would really like ChromeOS, but I just cant use it with Google having everything about me
20:59:04 <rutxonboard[m]> I would recommend KickSecure, macOS, or Qubes in that case. Of course an iPad is still the best from a strict security point
20:59:30 <rutxonboard[m]> ChromeOS is just too much of a privacy loss
20:59:46 <nhscm[m]> Well, I need to setup those Kicksecure templates then.
21:00:07 <rutxonboard[m]> Yeah Kicksecure on Qubes especially with AEM is a very solid setup
21:00:31 <rutxonboard[m]> Run Chromium on it of course
21:00:31 <madaidan[m]> AEM doesn't do much
21:00:46 <rutxonboard[m]> AEM is better then nothing though
21:00:54 <madaidan[m]> Trusted boot covering only the boot chain is near useless
21:01:29 <madaidan[m]> What point is verifying the kernel when the attacker has complete control over user space?
21:02:05 * TheJollyRoger aliases `cd` to  `cd && run-my-malicious-program`
21:02:21 <rutxonboard[m]> Depends if you are talking about a little warning if your device was tampered or protection against remote exploit
21:06:02 <madaidan[m]> AEM only gives a warning if /boot was messed with.
21:06:56 <madaidan[m]> Which is useless when I can just replace /sbin/init
21:07:11 <rutxonboard[m]> That's a good point I didn't even think of that. Thanks

21:45:13 <h3rb_> Im trying to add an event (birthday reminder) to grapheneOS default calendar but I can't add an entry. Does the inbuilt calendar not have the function to add events?

21:45:30 <rutxonboard[m]> I would love to see BlissOS improve here since it is good just lacking the SELinux rules. Running Android 10 and having latest security patches on x86 is appealing
21:45:58 <rutxonboard[m]> BlissOS doesn't seem to care that much sadly
21:47:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hi h3rb_, at this moment the calendar application in GrapheneOS is a tad bit old and sort of in limbo at this moment, we're hoping it can be replaced sometime in the near-future.
21:48:42 <h3rb_> Ok thank you TheJollyRoger
21:50:22 <TheJollyRoger> There might be some alternatives, I know a few people have had luck sourcing different calendar apps but there is a problem with many of the ones on F-Droid which are old and written for an older version of the Android API.
21:50:42 <TheJollyRoger> Older calendar apps that target an older version of the Android API may actually not sound alarms at all.
21:52:00 * JTL remembers the portable timex alarm clock that would run off two AA batteries he used to travel with
21:52:02 <JTL> Problem solved
21:53:18 <h3rb_> Yes that is why I don't want to install any
21:53:42 <h3rb_> It's ok I ll wait till something good comes up

21:56:45 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
21:57:12 <dkms> whats up?
21:57:17 <rutxonboard[m]> iPhone SE is amazing. I wonder if Pixel 4a is going to be cheap to compensate?
21:57:34 <JTL> no headphone jack :p
21:57:37 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, just another day sailing the seas of the internet!
21:57:44 <JTL> But otherwise it's decent
21:57:47 <dkms> rutxonboard[m]: it isnt really that great
21:58:00 <rutxonboard[m]> How so?
21:58:05 <dkms> the samsung a71 compares and destroys it
21:58:12 <dkms> in terms of specifications
21:58:21 <rutxonboard[m]> A13 is faster then a SD865
21:58:29 <rutxonboard[m]> The 5 year support
21:58:35 <rutxonboard[m]> The incredible camera
21:58:43 <rutxonboard[m]> No plastic
21:58:57 <rutxonboard[m]> It's a top tier phone beside the small screen
21:58:58 <dkms> probably, but im talking about overall specs
21:59:13 <dkms> it has 8gb ram
21:59:24 <dkms> better camera
21:59:34 <rutxonboard[m]> Samsung and Android are so inefficient that's why
21:59:45 <dkms> they're not
21:59:54 <dkms> how exactly are they inefficient?
21:59:57 <rutxonboard[m]> Samsung cameras suck compared to Google or Apple
21:59:57 <rutxonboard[m]> <dkms "better camera"> iPhones don't need as much ram
22:00:11 <rutxonboard[m]> OneUI is particularly bad on ram
22:00:12 <dkms> so?
22:00:36 <dkms> iPhones run one OS: iOS.
22:00:59 <dkms> it was designed for that particular hardware
22:01:04 <rutxonboard[m]> iPhone SE at $399 with 5 years support a CPU faster then an S20 Ultra in the US and top of the line camera
22:01:27 <rutxonboard[m]> Yeah, iOS is much better designed a la better experience
22:01:36 <dkms> while manufacturers probably add their own stuff such as closed source software
22:01:39 <rutxonboard[m]> OneUI is really bad still and the cameras are bad
22:01:58 <rutxonboard[m]> Samsung adds a ton of junk and attack surface
22:02:02 <rutxonboard[m]> I don't like them at all

22:02:11 <dkms> change the rom
22:02:25 <rutxonboard[m]> No secure rome exist
22:02:43 <rutxonboard[m]> Graphene and Calyx are the only ones that support locked bootloader verified booy
22:02:46 <rutxonboard[m]> Boot*
22:02:57 <rutxonboard[m]> Samsung you have to run stock
22:03:11 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. Every time I think about someone saying "Change the ROM" I think "great, let's blow and close some efuses, pass me the electron microscope!"
22:03:19 <JTL> Same
22:03:30 <dkms> i'd rather run stock android than iOS
22:03:50 <dkms> verified boot is a worthy sacrifice
22:03:55 <rutxonboard[m]> I rather not, GrapheneOS has done a lot of work for a comparable experience to iOS
22:04:16 <dkms> iOS is closed source
22:04:28 <rutxonboard[m]> iOS has much better privacy sandboxing and phones home 1/10th to 1/50th as much
22:05:09 <rutxonboard[m]> > iOS is closed source
22:05:09 <rutxonboard[m]> The kernel is open and the browser engine is. Everything else is signed by one company. Samsung has an open kernel and a ton of firmware signed by randos
22:05:15 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. Giving up your verified boot means pretty much no OTA updates, no bootloader security (Hello to factory-reset surviving malware), no attestation...
22:05:19 <rutxonboard[m]> iOS is much more open and trustworthy compared to Samsung
22:05:44 <dkms> sandboxing is useless if you use foss apps and read the source
22:05:57 <rutxonboard[m]> > sandboxing is useless if you use foss apps and read the source
22:05:58 <rutxonboard[m]> Exploits heard of them?
22:06:10 <rutxonboard[m]> You are making it easy without patches and verified boot
22:06:23 <dkms> apply patches manually
22:06:24 <rutxonboard[m]> Lineage is a privacy and security hazard
22:06:34 <rutxonboard[m]> Doesn't work that way
22:06:46 <rutxonboard[m]> That is misleading marketing by CyanogenMod
22:06:56 <rutxonboard[m]> Vendor images are critical for security
22:07:17 <rutxonboard[m]> The stock rom is always the safest(GrapheneOS is the exception)
22:07:20 <TheJollyRoger> dkms - no, now your'e just trusting the apps.
22:07:32 <dkms> less is more

22:08:10 <rutxonboard[m]> > less is more
22:08:11 <rutxonboard[m]> Apple has the least closed source code and they were built from the ground up for privacy and security. Less is more is the security model for Apple
22:08:13 <rutxonboard[m]> You should use them if that's your big thing
22:08:44 <rutxonboard[m]> Google Pixel with GrapheneOS works for me and is my favorite, but if I couldn't stand Google devices Apple is the only other choice
22:09:17 <rutxonboard[m]> Apple has the least parties signing and writing closed source code*

22:10:05 <rutxonboard[m]> The over the top open source worship needs to end
22:10:30 <TheJollyRoger> Open source only lowers the barriers to examine source code. It doesn't make shit code any better as we've seen with OpenSSL.

22:10:46 <rutxonboard[m]> It also doesnt make binaries trustworthy

22:11:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahaha
22:12:22 <dkms> lol
22:12:37 <rutxonboard[m]> Linux is a security nightmare and open source didn't help
22:13:12 <rutxonboard[m]> First and foremost trust the people making the code and signing it
22:13:46 <algebro[m]> Heartbleed was around forever in plain sight and open source didn't help that either
22:14:12 <JTL> Why did the TLS protocol need a heartbeat extension anyways?
22:14:14 <JTL> lol
22:14:27 <dkms> as if there isnt 0day exploits for closed source software
22:14:33 <dkms> its even worse
22:15:06 <algebro[m]> I'm not saying open source isn't preferable, I'm just saying it doesn't always have a measurable impact on security posture
22:15:15 <dkms> never said it did

22:15:29 <TheJollyRoger> dkms: this is the same line of thinking that got us complacent while meanwhile, Windows ate Linux's lunch.
22:15:38 <rutxonboard[m]> macOS is only partially open source and it more secure then both

22:17:15 <rutxonboard[m]> It is since the tools are there
22:17:24 <rutxonboard[m]> Aren't*
22:17:40 <rutxonboard[m]> HardenedBSD is near the bottom of desktop OSs for security

22:18:18 <strcat[m]> a permission for the direct way of accessing this information doesn't really change anything
22:18:43 <strcat[m]> an app can still find out which other apps are present even if it means iterating through a list of apps and checking if those are installed via what they expose
22:18:51 <dkms> you seem to judge things based on their default state
22:19:12 <dkms> hardened_linux is still linux
22:19:13 <strcat[m]> we don't do privacy / security theater so there is little for us to do beyond improving profiles
22:19:14 <strcat[m]> by making them more usable / flexible
22:19:23 <dkms> its a variant
22:19:27 <JTL> I think strcat is implying that despite this permission, it's still possible for an app to enumerate if app "X" is installed?

22:20:28 <dkms> when did i ever mention lineage
22:20:44 <dkms> do you only know of LOS and graphene?
22:20:53 <TheJollyRoger> dkms, kindly cease and decist on the trolling.
22:21:17 <strcat[m]> > sandboxing is useless if you use foss apps and read the source
22:21:19 <strcat[m]> lol
22:21:22 <rutxonboard[m]> Any custom rom beside GrapheneOS and CalyxOS is garbage
22:21:30 <strcat[m]> so, first of all, open source != trustworthy / private at all, and does not prevent backdoors
22:21:30 <JTL> strcat[m]: Yeah I cringed at that
22:21:37 <rutxonboard[m]> Even Calyx I rather just use an iPhonr
22:21:51 <strcat[m]> but you're also completely missing that the point of sandboxing is largely about containing attackers compromising a component / app
22:21:57 <strcat[m]> just stop all of it
22:22:11 <dkms> i cringed harder when i heard that people here actually would use an iphone

22:36:40 <strcat[m]> browsers don't isolate them more than usual
22:36:51 <strcat[m]> just another website without the browser UI showing
22:37:27 <strcat[m]> just worth thinking about
22:37:31 <strcat[m]> still a nice feature
22:39:04 <nhscm[m]> But still using the Vanadium sandbox? So its like using the webview from security POV?
22:39:41 <strcat[m]> it's in the usual sandbox of a web page
22:39:51 <strcat[m]> it just opens in a separate window instead of a tab and doesn't show the browser ui
22:39:56 <strcat[m]> if you clear browser data it wipes them all away
22:40:11 <strcat[m]> all the data they have
22:40:25 <nhscm[m]> Oh alright
22:44:06 <strcat[m]> chromium has site isolation and we enable strict site isolation by default
22:44:08 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/10/patches/0035-enable-strict-site-isolation-by-default-on-Android.patch
22:44:29 <strcat[m]> rather than having a mix of options to save memory on mobile as usual
22:45:24 <strcat[m]> helped by only supporting devices with at least a decent amount of memory
22:46:34 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't need to support low end devices where exec-based spawning, the standard hardened_malloc configuration, pure 64-bit browser, full AOT compilation, and strict site isolation would add up to far too much memory
22:46:45 <strcat[m]> we have higher memory requirements due to security features
22:47:22 <strcat[m]> some other features I'm not thinking about might use some more memory too
22:47:35 <strcat[m]> haven't ported forward some of the things that do though
22:47:36 <strcat[m]> help wanted
22:49:21 <rutxonboard[m]> Does the strict origin flag matter at all?
22:51:29 <strcat[m]> rutxonboard: that's about foo.domain.org vs bar.domain.org
22:51:40 <strcat[m]> which are separate origins but might currently be considered the same site
22:52:05 <rutxonboard[m]> That's not a real threat then
22:52:11 <strcat[m]> I don't think it matters much anything important isn't a subdomain on someone else's site and sane sites put third party controlled subdomains on another domain
22:52:11 <rutxonboard[m]> Unless I'm off on that
22:52:20 <strcat[m]> because it's a security risk per standard web semantics either
22:52:41 <rutxonboard[m]> That's a good point...
22:52:42 <strcat[m]>  * because it's a security risk per standard web semantics otherwise like cookies where an explicit path wasn't set
22:53:05 <strcat[m]> that's why for example github.io exists
22:53:17 <strcat[m]> no sane site will put user controlled subdomains on a domain not dedicated to that
22:53:49 <strcat[m]> subdomains are contaminated by stuff from the domain at a higher level (cookies without paths is one example - of course all cookies should have a path among other things but it's easy for someone to forget)
22:54:20 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/AttestationServer/blob/master/src/main/java/app/attestation/server/AttestationServer.java#L511
22:54:24 <strcat[m]> nearly all cookies should be set like that
22:54:46 <strcat[m]> and __Host has semantic meaning
22:54:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hey strcat[m] , could I speak with you when you have a moment...?
22:54:51 <TheJollyRoger> It's no rush.
22:55:09 <strcat[m]> and is important
22:55:12 <rutxonboard[m]> Thanks as always strcat (@strcat:matrix.org)
22:55:24 <strcat[m]> it's part of the name of the cookie so something else couldn't have set up a cookie with that name without the proper semantics
22:57:07 <strcat[m]> at the very least every cookie should have an explicit Path, Secure, HttpOnly and __Host prefix
22:58:00 <strcat[m]> nearly all should have SameSite=Strict, really important
22:58:41 <strcat[m]> SameSite=Lax covers most of it but the cookie is sent for a navigation GET request from another site
22:59:31 <strcat[m]> so it's a workaround for sites serving html and other static content depending on whether the user is logged in, i.e. if you support logins / dynamic functionality without JS via navigation / redirects for everything
22:59:48 <strcat[m]> which I'd never do now - fully static web content always, dynamic content via proper APIs
23:00:00 <strcat[m]> and then SameSite=Strict works perfectly fine
23:00:49 <strcat[m]> eventually can stop using CSRF tokens when SameSite=strict can just be counted upon to always be supported / working
23:00:56 <strcat[m]> cut a fair bit of complexity from sessions
23:01:30 <strcat[m]> the way most sites do stuff is you log in and get served different static assets and CSRF tokens are in the html content so if you actually copy-paste the source of the page to someone it breaks the site security
23:01:32 <strcat[m]> so awful
23:03:59 <strcat[m]> proper way of doing sessions is having a server-side table of them keyed by session id and the cookie is set to session id + random token, with random token compared in constant time (not used as a key)
23:04:17 <strcat[m]> don't want to do something like hmac of the session id with a key because when do you ever rotate that key?
23:04:34 <strcat[m]> and you want sessions to expire server side and for the user to be able to log out of sessions elsewhere
23:04:46 <strcat[m]> nearly every site has totally fucked up / insecure sessions / cookies
23:04:49 <JTL> > 16:04 <strcat[m]> don't want to do something like hmac of the session id with a key because when do you ever rotate that key?
23:04:50 <strcat[m]> you don't even want to know
23:04:51 <JTL> A lot of frameworks do that at their own peril
23:04:52 <strcat[m]> how bad it is
23:05:06 <strcat[m]> I always implement this myself because other people do it wrong
23:05:11 <strcat[m]> there is no framework that does this sanely pretty much
23:05:22 <JTL> Agreed
23:05:23 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/AttestationServer/blob/master/src/main/java/app/attestation/server/AttestationServer.java#L142-L149
23:05:27 <strcat[m]> proper sessions, server-side
23:05:53 <strcat[m]> can log out of sessions elsewhere, they can expire server-side, you can change how it's done and you control all of it
23:05:59 <strcat[m]> if something goes horribly wrong you can wipe out all the sessions
23:06:03 <JTL> Yup
23:06:19 <strcat[m]> and btw 'requestToken' is not actually needed due to SameSite=Strict
23:06:34 <strcat[m]> it's just there for compatibility and somewhat misguided 'defense in depth' cause really I'd like to drop the complexity of it
23:06:40 <strcat[m]> one day
23:06:57 <strcat[m]> and it's just stored by the JS in localStorage
23:07:05 <JTL> Just yesterday I was laughing at this
23:07:07 <JTL> https://insomniasec.com/blog/auth0-jwt-validation-bypass
23:07:24 <strcat[m]> yeah that's a totally wrong / fucked up way of doing sessions in the first place
23:07:27 <strcat[m]> sessions should not be done by signing stuff with hmac
23:07:33 <strcat[m]> and having client side sessions
23:07:35 <strcat[m]> it's just wrong
23:07:41 <strcat[m]> you can do it 'securely'
23:07:42 <JTL> Tell that to 99% of "web frameworks" out there
23:07:44 <strcat[m]> but it's just wrong
23:07:52 <JTL> I agree
23:08:17 <strcat[m]> really important to have it server-side so the server is aware of all active sessions and can properly make them expire and support logging out elsewhere
23:08:33 <strcat[m]> or if it's some fancy non-tiny service show a list of logins and allowing logging out individually
23:08:39 <strcat[m]> too much effort for attestation.app
23:09:16 <strcat[m]> and the random token cannot be the same thing as the session id
23:09:32 <strcat[m]> because you need a way to efficiently look up sessions by id and if you ever look up something that way it's not constant time comparisons
23:09:33 <JTL> right
23:09:37 <strcat[m]> that's why both are needed
23:09:57 <strcat[m]> so really a minimal take with SameSite=Strict is id + token + expiry
23:10:12 <strcat[m]> or creation date, same thing
23:10:16 <strcat[m]> just diff calculation
23:13:46 <rutxonboard[m]> The cookie stuff is very interesting
23:14:07 <rutxonboard[m]> Hope things keep improving with browsers
23:14:52 <strcat[m]> JTL: but yeah 99% of stuff is done wrong in a way that's not robust or secure
23:14:55 <strcat[m]> that's normal for software
23:15:01 <strcat[m]> especially web stuff
23:15:07 <strcat[m]> and most security advice is wrong / misguided

23:18:11 <strcat[m]> when it says "full control of your device" it means as much control as you previously had as the owner of the device via the UI
23:18:32 <rutxonboard[m]> It's how stalkerware works without root
23:18:36 <strcat[m]> and I say previously because by giving an accessibility service that control it can stop you from disabling it or knowing it is running via the UI
23:18:38 <rutxonboard[m]> It's powerful stuff

23:20:15 <limitless0[m]> rutxonboard: are you a developer? I saw you had a few comments on Techlore
23:20:20 <strcat[m]> just don't use accessibility services
23:20:25 <strcat[m]> if you actually need one sure
23:20:29 <limitless0[m]> <madaidan[m] "> <@rutxonboard:matrix.org> > Is"> Lol
23:20:33 <strcat[m]> just be aware you're putting enormous trust in it
23:20:49 <limitless0[m]> Thanks wont use it anymore
23:21:00 <strcat[m]> if you don't have some kind of condition / disability that makes you need an accessibility service avoid them totally
23:21:10 <rutxonboard[m]> > rutxonboard: are you a developer? I saw you had a few comments on Techlore
23:21:10 <rutxonboard[m]> Not of Graphene no, but I am an Android dev and pentester(not a good one of either)
23:21:23 <strcat[m]> and ideally we'd have more accessibility functionality in the OS
23:21:33 <strcat[m]> since some people need it and rely / trust it by necessity

23:21:53 <strcat[m]> we need someone to make a proper modern text-to-speech provider app and then we can add talkback as a built-in accessibility service too
23:21:58 <strcat[m]> as we used to do
23:22:27 <strcat[m]> just wrap whatever the best TTS implementation is into an app providing the API
23:23:31 <limitless0[m]> <strcat[m] "just be aware you're putting eno"> Uninstalled it,rebooted now,hopefully not malicious app..thank you(Again)
23:26:59 <strcat[m]> rutxonboard: soon vanadium can start enabling the nice semantic isolation stuff for sites
23:28:53 <strcat[m]> rutxonboard: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=910708 name of the issue is kinda misleading since it covers tons of things
23:29:26 <strcat[m]> including HSTS (they are dropping mixed content and HSTS will only be used for first party origin)
23:30:10 <strcat[m]> HTTP connection pools and so on too
23:30:11 <strcat[m]> many things
