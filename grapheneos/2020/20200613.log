02:28:02 <furofuro_01[m]> Heya... What IMEI number should I avoid in 3a?
02:30:24 <furofuro_01[m]> Besides 35 that is?
03:21:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> They don't
03:21:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> IMSI is the important one
03:32:49 <furofuro_01[m]> <altoslos[m] "How do IMEI numbers affect anyth"> It does.
03:33:32 <furofuro_01[m]> It's a dealbreaker to know whether I could unlock OEM or not...
03:33:32 <furofuro_01[m]> Besides Verizon's 35, nothing else to avoid?
03:33:32 <furofuro_01[m]> Is 99 failproof?
03:33:52 <furofuro_01[m]> If it starts at 35, it's risky

08:44:53 <dallemon[m]> <jalb66 "Buy it from Europe"> Buying from Europe is no guarantee. Got 2 Pixel 2 XL that were OEM locked before getting one that I could flash with GrapheneOS
08:47:44 <jalb66> dallemon[m], :-o
08:47:54 <jalb66> Normally they are free to install any other os
08:48:14 <jalb66> But of course I contacted the seller before asking about that
08:49:04 <dallemon[m]> I bought them second hand. One was a Verizon phone. The other was something else.
08:49:17 <jalb66> Ok
08:49:23 <jalb66> I bought it from Italy
08:49:34 <dallemon[m]> The one I am currently using is actually an Australian phone
08:49:47 <dallemon[m]> I bought from Germany and Denmark
08:50:37 <jalb66> Those with ORM locked?
08:50:43 <jalb66> Those with OEM locked?
08:52:24 <dallemon[m]> Yes, but like I said, they were Verizon and some other telco pre-owned
08:52:37 <jalb66> Ok, bad luck
08:54:37 <dallemon[m]> Returned one and gave the other to my mum üòù

09:01:50 <furofuro_01[m]> But online

09:40:34 <jalb66> furofuro_01[m], thanks
09:41:22 <furofuro_01[m]> I honestly dont want to keep a Google phone if it cant be unlocked lol. That's like head-on being spied on
09:41:37 <jalb66> furofuro_01[m], disable Google apps
09:41:57 <furofuro_01[m]> It's dealbreaker if I cant use GrapheneOS
09:42:14 <jalb66> And turn off notifications. Maybe you'll find some problem with Telephone notifications not possible to avoid. in that case there are apps to avoid notifications in the app you want
09:42:19 <jalb66> Ah ok
11:54:02 <Wonderfall[m]> Regarding the IMEI, mine starts at 35 and it was unlocked. Pixel 3a from Google Store (France), one year ago now. So there might be something else to look at.
12:39:59 <furofuro_01[m]> any reports about IMEI that starts with 99?
12:40:32 <eligiblecoffee[m> Mine starts with 99. What about it??
12:40:41 <furofuro_01[m]> Is there any locked OEM greyed out at IMEI: 99_______
12:40:55 <furofuro_01[m]> Or any incidents?
12:41:35 <eligiblecoffee[m> Well mine is unlocked. But I did receive a phone when ordered from amazon which was locked.  The seller was shady hence it was returned.
12:41:54 <eligiblecoffee[m> Check the model number to see whether its locked or unlocked.
12:44:24 <furofuro_01[m]> Where can I find it?
12:44:42 <furofuro_01[m]> So you mean IMEI 99 isnt silver bullet?
12:45:54 <eligiblecoffee[m> furofuro_01: the only phone with locked bootloaders seem to be coming from Verizon. Make sure the one you buy isn't from Verizon.
12:46:17 <furofuro_01[m]> Alright.
12:46:43 <furofuro_01[m]> So avoid IMEI 35/34?
12:46:53 <eligiblecoffee[m> And the model no. Is g013c. Its a pixel 3xl.
12:47:24 <furofuro_01[m]> How about 3a?
12:47:25 <eligiblecoffee[m> > So avoid IMEI 35/34?
12:47:25 <eligiblecoffee[m> Try XDA. They have some info regarding the same.
12:48:03 <eligiblecoffee[m> furofuro_01: I can't say for 3a since I don't have one.
12:56:20 <furofuro_01[m]> Cant see one on Pixel 3a... On XSA
12:56:34 <furofuro_01[m]> XDA*
12:58:43 <furofuro_01[m]> I saw it on reddit, thanks.

15:31:52 <b3n10> Hi guys, i was wondering if GrapheneOS is right for me. My company uses GSuite apps (Google Chat & Google Meet) and i can install them via Aurora. And aurora said these apps don't contain trackers. Will they work in graphene?
15:34:46 <cn3m[m]> <b3n10 "Hi guys, i was wondering if Grap"> They won't work on GrapheneOS. iOS is highly recommended if you have to use anything Google
15:36:09 <cn3m[m]> You ideally should have a separate work device as a rule, but it especially makes sense here
15:36:46 <cn3m[m]> If an app doesn't work without play services it won't run on GrapheneOS. You can turn this off to test on your current device
15:37:22 <cn3m[m]> Web apps might do the trick, but I've never had great luck with them and Google
15:43:39 <b3n10> ok i'll try turning off g services and see if these apps will still work. Thanks for advise
15:47:47 <cn3m[m]> If they do work you might want to clear data and try again b3n10
17:10:26 <xabi[m]> Your best bet is running them inside a bowser
17:10:57 <xabi[m]> * Your best bet is running them inside a browser, using desktop mode where needed
17:20:28 <skwisgaar[m]> cn3m I decided to try 1password, and it seems to have similar issues to what you described in bitwarden. Unable to change password in app, unable to import vault in app, accessibility options presented as good feature. Not sure if this is really any better.
17:37:05 <yekip[m]> <jiibus[m] "You try [this](https://www.app.c"> Thank you. I don't want cloud stuff but at the bottom it suggests it can just be drag and dropped. I knew I could do that, was wondering if it will retain playlists but I will just give it a whirl and found out. thanks again.
17:38:19 <yekip[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "cn3m I decided to try 1password,"> I used 1P for quite a few years. Just switched over to BitWarden mainly due to the cost of 1P. But I find it way behind in functionality and speed/reliability. I get lots of buggy problems with opening the browser extension in BW, and it's very slow. Although I do have around 2000 entries so maybe it's just not built for that size database. Not sure, but 1P was awesome in
17:38:19 <yekip[m]> my experience
17:47:53 <dazinism> 2000 passwords ü§Ø
17:52:51 <joshman[m]> People blame bitwarden, yet 1password is no different AND ITS FOR $
17:53:24 <yekip[m]> <dazinism "2000 passwords ü§Ø"> hehe, showing my age that's all :D
17:53:33 <TheJollyRoger> dazinism: not entirely implausible, I have hundreds of passwords and I try to keep the number of accounts I have to a very minimum.
17:53:38 <yekip[m]> 1% of those are just for Google :D
17:54:05 <skwisgaar[m]> yekip I see what you mean, I've used bitwarden for a while and 1password is a nicer user experience. Bitwarden can be wonky sometimes
17:54:12 <altoslos[m]> I absolutely love Bitwarden. Only thing I see that's almost as good is xkeypass for those who prefer that
17:54:19 <skwisgaar[m]> But I have less than 100 passwords lol
17:54:21 <altoslos[m]> I even pay the $10/yr for Bitwarden premium
17:54:52 <yekip[m]> <joshman[m] "People blame bitwarden, yet 1pas"> Different in my experience, and I only blame BitWarden for what BitWarden does. It has some features I like better than 1P. But stability wise, 1P was much faster and slicker in busy usage
17:55:00 <joshman[m]> I have 200 pswds I'm on free version. It's fast
17:55:42 <altoslos[m]> When was bitwarden slow for you? I have maybe 250+ accounts and have no issues
17:55:56 <yekip[m]> <TheJollyRoger "dazinism: not entirely implausib"> Phew, glad it's not entirely implausible!
17:56:43 <yekip[m]> 60-70% are very old and the sites are probably dead or i dont need them any more. one of my tasks is to clean it up and hope it speeds up BW a bit which I expect it to. that's a nasty vault to be syncing in a FF extensions

17:58:34 <yekip[m]> dont get me wrong, I love BW, i love what they stand for, and I will definitely be a paying user within a week or two. I woiuld rather use something slightly less than perfect which is worth supporting, than get the best ride out of a project I don't like quite so much. and with the 1P constant upgrade fees, I had enough of it a long while ago but was tied in until I took the plunge. BW inherited my nasty looking vault
17:58:35 <yekip[m]> (i did have to do tons of manual cleanup as many fields contained too much data to import properly), but I will work to BW standards rather than expect them to come to mine (shoddy ones)
18:00:19 <dazinism> I just have one password I use for everything üòá
18:00:41 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
18:01:13 <yekip[m]> besides my experience may not reflect on the BW extension, but could be more to do with my FF profile and other extensions/compatibility issues etc. I am working through it, creating a new Profile to begin with, and after clean up of the vault i am sure it will be much better. But I do love BW, and the only issues I get are in FF extension. The vault/app  itself works solidly. One thing I did like was findinhg out why
18:01:13 <yekip[m]> they disallow auto submit - that's nice, as I didn't know there were exploits with hidden forms and stuff to take advantage of the old way i used 1P, fill and submit all in one click.
18:01:31 <yekip[m]> <dazinism "I just have one password I use f"> haha, hi mom
18:01:58 <TheJollyRoger> XD
18:02:10 * TheJollyRoger tries guessing "one two three four five" :P
18:05:13 <yekip[m]> I have a 40GB itunes music folder on mac. I would like to stick that on my 128GB Pixel 3. I can drag and drop with Android File Transfer, expecting a few crashes! If anyone knows if there is a way to retain playlists, please shout. the only way I can find is using the "Sync & Play" headed info on this page - https://eu.app.com/story/money/industries/technology/2016/06/06/itune-android-sync/84996824/ - not really an
18:05:13 <yekip[m]> option.
18:05:34 <dazinism> yekip: dont think folks on IRC (or on Riot Android) get to see reactions. Also think your longer messages probably don't get straight thru to IRC. They end up with a link they have to click on.
18:06:06 <dazinism> So some folks won't read them
18:06:28 <yekip[m]> is that right?
18:06:32 <yekip[m]> thanks
18:07:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I don't see reactions at all.
18:07:26 <yekip[m]> that's a relief for them I am sure :D

18:21:13 <TheJollyRoger> You need me to test that patch...?
18:27:55 <hsv> found a new 3xl for sale close by. shoud i get it or there is a chance of a release for a newer model?
18:28:28 <TheJollyRoger> In and out!
18:29:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You need me to test that patch.."> Didn't get time to work on it
18:29:19 <TheJollyRoger> Okay
18:29:22 <TheJollyRoger> *Okay!
18:30:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well here's what happened
18:30:31 <TheJollyRoger> A build VPS was generously donated to me DarkUranium, so I'm just testing a full build on it right now, I'm just on the step of building the tool needing to generate A/B updates, and then I'm going to run the release script.
18:30:58 <DarkUranium> It's EU-based, if anyone needs to know.
18:31:04 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy! \o
18:31:06 <DarkUranium> They do offer US-based, but at a much higher cost.
18:31:07 <DarkUranium> o/
18:31:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> So I was low on cash and decided to WFH for a startup. Turned out to be a huge mistake
18:31:12 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
18:31:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seems they're making me do their entire backlog eh
18:31:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yikes.
18:31:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't think I'll find another company though sadly
18:32:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> And my original job is long lost, thanks to corona
18:32:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Don't think I'll find another co"> The most I have is an associate's and that's it
18:33:08 <DarkUranium> anupritaisno1[m], what's WFH?
18:33:16 <DarkUranium> Oh, work from home.
18:33:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Corona kinda threw the wrench in me pursuing for a degree to
18:33:21 <DarkUranium> =\
18:33:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah I am majoring in CS and did a little bit of EE
18:37:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... I've wanted to go upgrade my existing education and go from mechanical to computers but same story :(
18:40:13 <DarkUranium> anupritaisno1[m], it's weird, though ... I'd imagine companies would be looking for programmers a lot.
18:42:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> <DarkUranium "anupritaisno1, it's weird, thoug"> They aren't
18:42:42 <DarkUranium> I know I'm looking for one, but only part-time ... I can't afford full-time ('tis out of my pocket)
18:42:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> They're probably looking for
18:42:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> 1) that one intern who'd pay them to work
18:42:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> 2) that one person who's desperate for money
18:43:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> They aren't exactly hiring senior developers. They are either already WFH or given a paid leave
18:43:25 <DarkUranium> =\
19:03:12 <yekip[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah... I've wanted to go upgrad"> The world will always need those who can trim the rigging :D
19:04:15 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, I'd hope so.
19:13:58 <yekip[m]> any votes for a nice audio player for Graphene?
19:17:27 <DarkUranium> TheJollyRoger, lemme know how that build works out RAM-wise, BTW.
19:17:49 <DarkUranium> Also, build time might be longer. Hopefully compensated by much faster download (& upload) times.
19:17:49 <nickcalyx[m]> The music app from lineage is nice, called eleven
19:18:06 <TheJollyRoger> DarkUranium: it works!
19:18:16 <DarkUranium> Nice!"
19:18:18 <DarkUranium> s/"//
19:18:46 -SEdbot[m]- > <@freenode_DarkUranium:matrix.org> Nice!"
19:18:46 -SEdbot[m]- Nice!
19:18:47 <TheJollyRoger> There's some other problems I'm diagnosing right now, but they're unrelated to the VPS and more about python. I'm trying to fix that now.
19:20:28 <aeonsolution[m]> hopefully ninja will exclusively use python3 in the near future so we dont have to deal with that
19:20:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
19:20:55 <TheJollyRoger> I'll upload what I'm getting...
19:21:10 <yekip[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "The music app from lineage is ni"> Thanks, will take a look at that.
19:21:22 <TheJollyRoger> But I think I might've missed a step so I'm going back to fix that.
19:40:25 <organella[m]> Anyone knows how is it possible to see and revoke persisted SAF permissions?
19:41:17 <organella[m]> I used a text editor (turbo editor) to edit a file in the home directory of termux
19:42:07 <organella[m]> Termux acts as a SAF provider and the home directory is private, i.e. it's not in the external storage so you can't see it via the storage permission
19:42:52 <organella[m]> Opening the file was normal via the file picker, so I opened it, edited and saved
19:43:45 <organella[m]> However now the turbo editor has access to that file directly without the need of the file picker and can open and save - afaik this shouldn't be allowed
19:43:57 <organella[m]> And it can do it even after device restart
19:53:09 <organella[m]> SAF was supposed to provide good management and control over what app can access what files in the external storage but this seems as bad or even worse than the old storage permission...
19:59:04 <organella[m]> Found it - app info, then storage&cache and you see a list of the providers the app has been given access to. Very hidden and obscure though
20:18:47 <DarkUranium> <aeonsolution[m]> hopefully ninja will exclusively use python3 in the near future so we dont have to deal with that
20:19:03 <DarkUranium> aeonsolution[m], honestly, given how long Python's been around, it's criminy that it still doesn't have a way of reliably producing self-contained binaries.
20:20:11 <aeonsolution[m]> yup
20:28:48 <sbav> hi guys, would like to try GOS on my p3, i agree Google is too intrusive and even getting more and more complicated/confusing imho.. i did read some Reddit about this project and alternatives to my must have apps, and this is regarding I fund out, could you maybe confirm/correct something? tia
20:28:48 <sbav> gcam: open camera
20:28:48 <sbav> sync contacts and cals: davx5
20:28:48 <sbav> telegram: foss version on f-droid
20:28:48 <sbav> photos backup: nextcloud
20:30:28 <sbav> in particular pics quality is my top priority especially now that i also got a child.. is opencamera quality really comparable to gcam I've which is simply great? best I've had on a phone
20:30:34 <sbav> tia
20:33:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hi sbav, the camera quality in OpenCamera isn't directly comparable to GCam. In some cases it pulls ahead, in some cases, it produces shots with too much contrast.
20:33:50 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to make sure you enable the camera2 API.
20:35:20 <cx2[m]> sbav: If you like DavX^5, I would look into EteSync as well! Devs are great and super responsive, and it‚Äôs E2EE.
20:39:22 <sbav> thanks guys for the answers! TheJollyRoger guess I can just try it :) hope quality is good enough, especially indoor and with not super light, where gcam is superb.. cx2[m] I've not tried anything yet, I'm still on Android now, collecting info atm before trying the switch ;) cool to know there are already a come of alteratives for contacts/cals sync, in the past i tried going gapps free, and always had to come back to Android because i child find anything
20:39:41 <sbav> *couldn't find anything good
20:40:20 <sbav> i used to use fruux, but it stopped working suddenly with no reason... will surely try etesync, thanks!
20:41:20 <cx2[m]> That‚Äôs too bad about Fruux, I do like them as well.... though i believe they are more focused on team + solutions.
20:42:51 <sbav> is nextcloud really good and user friendly? or to backup stuff without paying third servers, I'll need to setup my own server at home? (I'm not good at networks stuff..!!) ;(
20:43:39 <sbav> especially camera pics istant backup i mean..
20:44:13 <cx2[m]> <sbav "is nextcloud really good and use"> While it‚Äôs sorta of easy, I would look into something like Syncthing for now, and spin yourself up on next cloud.
20:44:47 <cx2[m]> Fortunately there are some pretty cheap VPS spaces out there to practice / learn
20:45:52 <cx2[m]> Or you could just jump right into with with Nextcloud Pi.... plenty of documentation out there to follow along... and of course, there‚Äôs invidious.snopyta.org
20:48:28 <sbav> thanks for your help cx2[m] will continue looking around :p
20:49:18 <sbav> that's all for now thanks and see you soon guys ;)
20:58:39 <thehun[m]> Hi guys
21:03:19 <thehun[m]> Could anyone tell what im doing wrong, please. Im trying to backup with seedvault but the phone is not recognising the USB. I tried to format to FAT32, FAT, ExFat. Even tried to change the settings in the phone.
21:09:40 <sss> [Moses believed in Allah as his creator so did Jesus and mohammed *; For he is: (Allah) the only God; our refuge; follow islam The true religion of God & jewel of THE SEAS to be lifted, [that is, be true muslimS to be lifted ****]
21:13:41 <xabi[m]> Cool story bro
21:15:02 <fll[m]> sbav: I love nextcloud. Totally worth spending the time (to learn) to set it up imho. And all the available plugins (they call them apps) offer a ton of functionality
21:16:04 <fll[m]> And if you don't want to setup/admin it yourself you can always rent an instance from the many providers
21:18:30 <greenmoon[m]> Wtf this spammer and his fake god shit
21:18:55 <thehun[m]> Thanks, fil. Does anyone have experience with Seedvault?? Is it working correctly or just im doing wrong something.
21:19:00 <fll[m]> If you want to have a peek you can demo at https://try.nextcloud.com/
21:23:48 <fll[m]> thehun: I think it's working fine here. Only used a backup once to see if it works and it did
21:25:23 <thehun[m]> Then its me, do you remember in what format was the USB.
21:26:11 <fll[m]> Ah sorry. Didn't pay attention. I use it with nextcloud. Didn't try USB
21:27:15 <fll[m]> I assume you don't see the USB as storage provider in seedvault?
21:27:54 <thehun[m]> Yes, thats the problem. Can not click on that
21:31:59 <fll[m]> I guess it's more of an android issue than seedvault then. No idea though what is required for android to make a USB device a storage provider
21:33:00 <thehun[m]> Thanks anyway, fill
21:34:27 <fll[m]> You can try asking in seedvault channel
21:35:45 <fll[m]> seedvault has a irc bridged to matrix channel too
21:36:40 <thehun[m]> I will definitely try that
21:40:48 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about the delay.
21:58:40 <xabi[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Sorry about the delay."> Same happened on fdroid channel
21:59:28 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense >_<.
23:03:44 <thehun[m]> Hi foos, what kind of Pixel you have
23:04:05 <BalooRJ> 3a
23:04:41 <thehun[m]> You want to install Graphaneos, correct??
23:05:58 <thehun[m]> You working on Mac, Windows, Linux??
23:06:32 <thehun[m]> Just a sec
23:08:44 <thehun[m]> Did you follow this page : https://grapheneos.org/install#disabling-oem-unlocking
23:11:11 <thehun[m]> ok, you have it in developer mode??
23:12:07 <thehun[m]> ok
23:15:14 <thehun[m]> let me see, 1 sec
23:17:42 <thehun[m]> Its little bit different from Mac, give me just a sec
23:20:07 <thehun[m]> curl.exe -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/factory.pub
23:20:29 <thehun[m]> try to hit that in terminal
23:22:22 <thehun[m]> finding the other two, 1 min
23:23:05 <thehun[m]> ahhh, ok then
23:23:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> foos: you've said everything except your problem
23:23:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> What is the error?
23:23:59 <thehun[m]> You unziped ??
23:24:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Without it nobody can help
23:24:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just edit the script
23:25:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Make it point to where fastboot is
23:33:41 <thehun[m]> I belive you can do that also from the terminal, more esay in my opinion
23:41:06 <aloevera___> does anybody know what could cause long wake times? My Pixel 3 XL suddenly takes about 5secs to wake or respond after pressing the button or using a fingerprint...
23:43:48 <nickcalyx[m]> Maybe you can set up wireless ADB logging and watch the logs
23:44:41 <aloevera___> how would i do that?
23:46:23 <nickcalyx[m]> Or just plug the USB cable in and use ADB logcat
23:46:41 <nickcalyx[m]> Thats easier
23:48:40 <aloevera___> I just rebooted it about 5 times and now it works again. I'll try that if it ever happens again, Thanks!
23:49:15 <thehun[m]> aloevera___:  Did you got it right??
23:50:15 <thehun[m]> About installing
23:50:47 <overheadscallop[> foos: the check is in the script for a reason. Removing it can brick the phone
23:51:00 <overheadscallop[> are you just double clicking the script?
23:51:08 <overheadscallop[> or are you running it from the powershell prompt
23:51:10 <thehun[m]> im sorry
23:51:23 <thehun[m]> missed that
23:51:54 <thehun[m]> Apologise, my bad
23:53:52 <overheadscallop[> So just typing `fasboot --version` without ./ in front gives the correct version (30+)?
23:54:42 <JTL> Bridge test
23:55:17 <overheadscallop[> JTL: I see your message
23:55:42 <overheadscallop[> <foos[m] "batch directory being C:\Graphen"> So maybe the fastboot executable wasn't added to the path
23:56:58 <JTL> overheadscallop[: Yeah, just seeing messages dropped from matrix->irc
23:56:59 * JTL sighs
23:57:24 <JTL> and only some messages at that
23:57:26 <JTL> odd
23:59:05 <overheadscallop[> <foos[m] "running fastboot --version in th"> So if I'm reading the backlog right, you moved fastboot.exe to C:\GrapheneOS? What happened to everything else in the platform-tools folder?
