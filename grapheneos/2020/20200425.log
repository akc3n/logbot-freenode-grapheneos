00:26:45 <skwisgaar[m]> Hey guys, hope you're all doing well. Had a question about the OS (been on Graphene for a few months now, love it) - I'm curious what security features of AOSP/Graphene (mainly) permit a device to be comparably secure to, say, an iPhone, while still be open to third-party sources. It feels a bit strange to be installing apks, apps from fdroid, etc. without having serious security ramifications (coming from a
00:26:46 <skwisgaar[m]> layperson).
00:27:21 <algebro[m]> Installing from fdroid does have serious security implications
00:28:07 <algebro[m]> I think the official recommendation is to install apps directly from their respective devs
00:28:18 <algebro[m]> But a lot of us still use fdroid
00:30:25 <skwisgaar[m]> Yeah that's what I've read from a few different developers. A bit scary that so many people recommend fdroid just because it's open source.
00:36:18 <JTL> skwisgaar[m]: In the future a version of the OS disallowing all but preloaded APKs could be produced
00:37:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(...
00:37:50 <TheJollyRoger> (Yeah with a frowny-face er, in response to the "scary about recommendation" ehehe)
00:37:57 <JTL> right
00:38:46 <TheJollyRoger> I think in the far future, when we have some application developers and possibly dedicated app developers, it might be possible to do something like have a dedicated app store with a small number of very carefully selected apps to give people some extra choice.
02:31:54 <algebro[m]> how do you update the bootloader after a fresh build and adb sync? my device wont boot and fastboot flashall says a newer bootloader version is required
02:32:00 <algebro[m]> for an unsigned dev build
02:38:57 <algebro[m]> aside from downloading an official graphene release zip and flashing the bootloader from there
02:54:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> skwisgaar: >iphone
02:54:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> >secure
02:54:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> We can all dream
02:55:47 <algebro[m]> got everything working but i guess i figured prepare-vendor would grab the radio and bootloader images

03:20:30 <dfxlv[m]> Hey
03:22:26 <dfxlv[m]> : (
03:23:25 <madaidan[m]> Hi
03:23:32 <dfxlv[m]> Room history is not willing to show
03:25:10 <dfxlv[m]> Who's using grapheneos
03:25:13 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
03:25:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, most of us be!
03:26:15 <dfxlv[m]> Only on Pixel phones ?
03:27:10 <TheJollyRoger> Only on phones with the best security, whose vendors have chosen to be forthcoming with support and source code and have good source code quality. Those just coicidentally happen to be Pixels.
03:29:00 <TheJollyRoger> Please be sure to read the faq on device support!
03:29:06 <dfxlv[m]> and Google allowing it for it's customers to get rid off their OS ??
03:29:06 <TheJollyRoger> Letme fetch it for you...
03:29:24 <madaidan[m]> <dfxlv[m] "and Google allowing it for it's "> Yes.
03:29:36 <madaidan[m]> Google devices are great for flashing new OSes on.
03:29:46 <madaidan[m]> They even support custom verified boot keys.
03:29:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. Google is the only vendor thus far that has actually been forthcoming with full support for all hardware security features and bootloader security features with different operating systems that aren't their own.
03:30:15 <TheJollyRoger> The drivers for their devices are also open source, and firmware is source-available to partners (but you have to ask for it)
03:31:09 <TheJollyRoger> With the exception of the debugging cables (which can be produced using a USB breakout board and a serial cable) they also make their tools and debugging tools available and usable and open source to everyone.
03:33:55 <TheJollyRoger> Vendors like Samsung will permanently disable bootloader security if you unlock the bootloader, and OnePlus don't have any security to begin with since it seems they don't even follow the specification for verified boot and simply leave their phones vulnerable.
03:35:11 <madaidan[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Vendors like Samsung will perman"> Verified boot that doesn't verify boot
03:35:18 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
03:35:25 <dfxlv[m]> Why Google following a policy that would results in dumbing their own OS , don't say Google respect people will and freedom to use OS of their choice . Because it has long dark history of tracking people and abuse their privacy
03:36:05 <TheJollyRoger> dfxlv[m]: Because they've got a vested interest in the android ecosystem flourishing and their namesake carries the android brand?
03:36:16 <madaidan[m]> <dfxlv[m] "Why Google following a policy th"> Google violates privacy with some of their services. Their hardware, firmware etc. are fine.
03:36:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:36:30 <dfxlv[m]> I'm afraid that I'm chatting with Google paid promoters
03:36:35 <madaidan[m]> Lol
03:36:38 * TheJollyRoger rolls his eyes.
03:36:41 <TheJollyRoger> Er,
03:36:43 <TheJollyRoger> eye.
03:36:45 * TheJollyRoger puts his eyepatch on.
03:36:49 <TheJollyRoger> There we go that's better.
03:36:54 <JTL> > 20:36 <dfxlv[m]> I'm afraid that I'm chatting with Google paid promoters
03:36:57 <JTL> Please pay me
03:37:06 <algebro[m]> I wouldn't say they make it easy to flash alternative OSes because they care about us
03:37:06 <madaidan[m]> If you're gonna immediately call us shills, just leave.
03:37:17 <algebro[m]> I assumed it was more about making it easy for vendors
03:37:20 <TheJollyRoger> Well, that's dandy, I accept Spanish Gold!
03:37:25 <JTL> And a reference design for the Android platform
03:38:02 * TheJollyRoger waits around for his treasure from the Spanish treasure fleet to appear.
03:38:27 <madaidan[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Well, that's dandy, I accept Spa"> I accept pepsi.
03:38:30 <dfxlv[m]> > Google violates privacy with some of their services. Their hardware, firmware etc. are fine.
03:38:30 <dfxlv[m]> Do you have any evidences ? Because if that true , then it sounds really fine to me
03:38:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. Their drivers are open source and their firmware's available if you ask for it.

03:41:25 <TheJollyRoger> madaidan[m] speaks truth.
03:42:39 <dfxlv[m]> You were acting as if you know it all about grapheneos a while ago maidian , but when it came to evidences it happened you don't have any of them , then how you came to the conclusion they are not spyware or anything
03:42:58 <TheJollyRoger> So, dfxlv[m], if you'd like, you're more than welcome to follow the channel and what we discuss here and learn a bit about the extremely complex and nuanced topic that's mobile phone development, but I do not take kindly to people coming in to stir the pot.
03:43:02 <TheJollyRoger> So. Which'll it be?
03:44:15 <madaidan[m]> <dfxlv[m] "You were acting as if you know i"> There's no evidence of it being spyware. You're the one lacking any evidence. Please tell me how I'm meant to give you a non-existent link.
03:44:28 <madaidan[m]> You just seem like a troll.
03:45:05 <dfxlv[m]> You been here I assume for long time talking to hundreds of people , is it true that you still have no evidences yet ? While you strongly promoting the thing
03:45:18 <TheJollyRoger> madaidan[m]: I'm inclined to agree.
03:45:47 <madaidan[m]> dfxlv: troll elsewhere
03:46:01 <JTL> Meh
03:49:06 <TheJollyRoger> Hope that this works on both sides of the Matrix and IRC bridge.
03:49:34 <madaidan[m]> It kicked him on matrix if that's what you mean
03:49:57 <madaidan[m]> He's talking to me in pms lol
03:50:01 <madaidan[m]> Saying he's not a troll
03:50:46 * TheJollyRoger cracks up
03:51:26 <TheJollyRoger> Whew! Glad to hear it works on both sides of the bridge. I heard some funny stories about how people in IRC rooms get kicked but not in the Matrix side of things so people on the Matrix side end up with one memberlist and people on the IRC side end up with another.
03:51:36 <TheJollyRoger> Ah well. Thanks for the aid madaidan[m].
03:55:35 <TheJollyRoger> Whoever he is he's not your problem, nevermind him.
03:56:46 <madaidan[m]> Now he's calling me savage
03:56:48 <madaidan[m]> Great
03:59:05 <TheJollyRoger> Argh. Just block him. It's not your duty or your job to play punching bag to some little kalikiddie's paranoia.
03:59:35 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think any paying job would pay enough to do that.
04:02:32 <madaidan[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Argh. Just block him. It's not y"> I've a lot of experience dealing with them
04:02:43 <madaidan[m]> The groups I'm in are infested with them
04:02:54 <madaidan[m]> I just want interesting infosec stuff :(
04:03:38 <madaidan[m]> Them = kalikiddies, not this specific person
04:03:41 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, shipmate :(
04:07:09 <algebro[m]> I had to unsub from all the privacy subreddits today because of people like that
04:07:41 <madaidan[m]> Reddit is a cesspool
04:08:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. :(
04:08:45 <algebro[m]> Are you a TU madaidan?
04:10:15 <madaidan[m]> What's a TU?
04:10:37 <algebro[m]> Trusted user, I'll take that as a no...your handle just looked familiar
04:11:37 <madaidan[m]> Idk what you mean by "trusted user"
04:11:51 <madaidan[m]> But I'm probably not
04:12:35 <algebro[m]> People in charge of maintaining the community arch repo
04:13:02 <madaidan[m]> Then definitely not
06:29:02 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you assert tls when you relay?
06:29:22 <renlord> the last time i used opensmtpd and had relay tls set, alot of people couldnt receive my emails lol
06:29:48 <JTL> > 23:29 <@renlord> the last time i used opensmtpd and had relay tls set, alot of people couldnt receive my emails lol
06:29:54 <JTL> "Halp my mailserver is junk"
06:30:11 <renlord> so many mailservers are stupidly broken
06:30:19 <JTL> Unsurprising
06:30:44 <JTL> As I jokingly said (no offense intended to strcat) "Must be nice being able to securely email yourself and 10 other people"
06:30:44 <renlord> situation may have improved over the years since so many academics run public port scanner utils
06:30:52 * JTL shrug
06:31:04 <renlord> there were a few ndss papers from this
06:31:23 <JTL> oh?
06:43:00 <renlord> or could be ACM IMC
06:43:06 <renlord> cant remember which one to be exact
06:43:19 <JTL> Alright
06:48:46 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahaha. One of these days I will have a secure E-mail address X(
06:49:24 <TheJollyRoger> Secure as in, I'm not gonna go to sleep each night wondering, "Did my inbox provider check incoming DMARC alignment?"
06:50:15 <TheJollyRoger> "Did my mail provider validate the cert this year?"
06:50:21 <TheJollyRoger> X(
06:53:46 <renlord> yeah, so much of email security actually relies on mailserver maintainers to do the right thing
06:54:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(
06:54:59 <TheJollyRoger> The answer so far I've found is, my inbox provider doesn't check incoming DMARC alignment, doesn't check DKIM or SPF or authenticate internal mail. They do have a valid SSL certificate, but...
06:55:29 <TheJollyRoger> They don't have anything more than STARTTLS on server to server connections.
06:55:52 <renlord> i read that you can even get mitm-ed with starttls, the best is smtps
06:56:05 <renlord> smtp over tls (that is)
06:56:20 <renlord> could be wrong, just off the infosec S.E.
06:56:22 <strcat[m]> renlord: DANE is enabled so it enforces TLS with DANE pinning for outbound mail
06:56:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I was kinda surprised at the rationale behind STARTTLS, something I've often wondered about it,
06:56:40 <strcat[m]> so if there's a DANE TLSA record it enforces that and DNSSEC provides proof if there isn't one
06:57:04 <renlord> ah, so no issues anymore with smtp over tls
06:57:19 <renlord> why dont people just use smtps?
06:57:27 <TheJollyRoger> Is why couldn't we just make STARTTLS something that would not allow downgrades? Like, for instance once it gets a valid certificate, it won't accept connections to another server if suddenly that server fails to send a START TLS status code, or presents a selfsigned certificate?
06:57:45 <TheJollyRoger> It'd be the same as a trust on first use arrangement.
06:58:24 <renlord> strcat[m]: also i asked earlier, if you relay with tls using opensmtpd?
06:58:55 <renlord> strcat[m]: last time i had relay tls set, many people couldnt receive my emails
06:58:56 <renlord> kek
06:59:24 <strcat[m]> renlord: no I started using postfix
06:59:40 <strcat[m]> because opensmtpd can't do SPF enforcement for inbound mail, and can't do DANE or MTA-STS for outbound mail
06:59:54 <TheJollyRoger> Oh cripes, that sucks.
07:00:00 <renlord> oh no
07:00:05 <strcat[m]> renlord: you should use DANE + MTA-STS
07:00:06 <renlord> but i like opensmtpd!
07:00:14 <renlord> the config file is so readable
07:00:17 <strcat[m]> and then TLS is enforced for outbound mail to people with DANE or MTA-STS set up
07:00:22 <strcat[m]> MTA-STS uses Web PKI
07:00:24 <strcat[m]> DANE pins
07:00:33 <strcat[m]> you can use both, I have both set up for inbound, and DANE for outbound
07:00:39 <strcat[m]> need to set up MTA-STS for outbound still
07:00:40 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: er... there was something I wanted to ask about this, but... do you have any thoughts on using clientside Certificates for client authentication to the mail server?
07:00:55 <TheJollyRoger> I've.... I've recently been getting kinda antsy about passwords and just wondering why we can't use SASL or SASL External everywhere.
07:01:01 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: *shrug* easier to just use randomly generated passwords
07:01:07 * TheJollyRoger gasps.
07:01:09 <TheJollyRoger> Wow.
07:01:11 <renlord> strcat[m]: i dont understand why you say i can use both when you just mentioned it cant do things for both in/out-bound mails
07:01:11 <TheJollyRoger> Really...?
07:01:27 <strcat[m]> I generally just generate random 32 character passwords
07:01:32 <renlord> do you use opensmtpd to relay into postfix again?
07:01:40 <strcat[m]> renlord: DANE and MTA-STS are designed for 1 side to use them, the one sending mail
07:01:51 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. I just get keepass2 to spit out some random words and use those...
07:01:55 <strcat[m]> renlord: I just use postfix
07:02:10 <strcat[m]> renlord: inbound DANE means you set up a DNS record and have certbot preserve your key with reuse-key
07:02:11 <TheJollyRoger> But I get kinda antsy about just sending the password to the server in plaintext, kinda...?
07:02:13 <strcat[m]> pin the key
07:02:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: and then inbound mailers with support for DANE will verify your key
07:02:38 <strcat[m]> renlord:  the server sending mail is the one that has to verify, that's how the standard works
07:03:02 <strcat[m]> renlord: DKIM is how the source is verified, not TLS
07:03:04 <strcat[m]> since that mail server may not be where it originated from
07:03:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: the MTA sending mail is responsible for checking DANE and MTA-STS
07:03:35 <strcat[m]> so, I have DANE records for all the mail.grapheneos.org services
07:03:43 <strcat[m]> and it uses valid Web PKI certs via certbot with reuse-key
07:03:56 <strcat[m]> so I have MTA-STS enabled via the DNS records and subdomains on each server that sends mail too
07:04:10 <strcat[m]> and I have TLS reporting enabled which can be used for both MTA-STS and DANE
07:04:21 <strcat[m]> renlord: setting up *outbound* DANE / MTA-STS is totally separate
07:04:32 <renlord> and this is all supported with the postfix base package?
07:04:40 <renlord> no need to pipe between programs and what not?
07:05:13 <strcat[m]> renlord: to set up DANE for people sending you mail, that's just a DNS record pinning your key
07:05:31 <renlord> specifically, the DKIM part
07:05:36 <strcat[m]> and MTA-STS is similar, few DNS records and serving policy via mta-sts subdomain for each subdomain you use to send mail
07:05:43 <renlord> because in opensmtpd, DKIM support does not come with the application
07:06:08 <strcat[m]> renlord:  same with postfix, I use opendkim, but it has a nicer protocol using a socket
07:06:37 <strcat[m]> renlord: and SPF requires a policy daemon but it doesn't exist for opensmptd, just postfix etc.
07:06:40 <strcat[m]> I use spf-engine
07:07:00 <strcat[m]> renlord: opensmptd is missing a way to do SPF verification
07:07:06 <strcat[m]> renlord: and it can't do DANE or MTA-STS verification when sending mail
07:07:13 <strcat[m]> so opensmtpd is missing those 3 things
07:07:24 <strcat[m]> postfix can do SPF via spf-engine, DANE itself, MTA-STS via a TLS policy daemon
07:07:40 <strcat[m]> the only thing I haven't set up is MTA-STS enforcement when sending mail
07:08:16 <danvittegleo[m]> lol omg.. mail servers are way too complicated.
07:08:21 <strcat[m]> renlord: enabling DANE with postfix is easy
07:08:30 <renlord> ok, sounds like postfix is the way to go then
07:08:31 <strcat[m]> renlord: you just install unbound, make sure it's set up properly
07:08:46 <strcat[m]> and set that as your DNS server in resolv.conf and make sure it's not overwritten by dhclient or whatever
07:08:47 <renlord> oh shit, i dont want to maintain my own dns server also
07:09:00 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's easy the config file is 4 lines
07:09:01 <strcat[m]> I can show you
07:09:17 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's not a DNS server
07:09:21 <strcat[m]> it's just a DNS resolver really
07:09:41 <renlord> uh ok
07:10:04 <danvittegleo[m]> why are you running your own mail server?
07:10:14 <renlord> i thought i had to maintain a zonefile, and i was Zzz
07:10:27 <renlord> danvittegleo[m]: being a good internet citizen
07:10:33 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://paste.xinu.at/AqQK here is a full unbound configuration
07:10:48 <strcat[m]> renlord: forward-zone is OPTIONAL you can delete that if you don't care about DNS-over-TLS for privacy
07:11:12 <strcat[m]> renlord: you can use this on a desktop/laptop too
07:11:13 <danvittegleo[m]> i can think of about 1000 other things i'd like to do with my time lol..
07:11:16 <renlord> thanks
07:11:19 <strcat[m]> if you don't have forward-zone, it queries authoritative / root servers directly
07:11:35 <strcat[m]> i.e. it queries the website DNS servers itself
07:11:36 <danvittegleo[m]> i maintained my own mail server for a bunch of years.. not fun.
07:11:42 <strcat[m]> so you really want forward-zone for privacy
07:11:53 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: I care about things being done right
07:11:56 <strcat[m]> I don't have to maintain much it was just a pain to set it up
07:12:17 <strcat[m]> now I know how and have a set of instructions and config files to reuse
07:12:31 <strcat[m]> but yeah there were like 20 different things to change
07:12:52 <strcat[m]> renlord: you need unbound set as the DNS server so that you have a DNSSEC enforcing resolver
07:13:08 <danvittegleo[m]> strcat: yeah i think setting it up and tweaking it takes a while, it's more of pain like when you get blacklisted randomly and you don't get some important email
07:13:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: and DNSSEC enforcement has to be local, you can't trust some remote server to do it and then connect to it unencrypted
07:13:25 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: never had any issues
07:13:33 <renlord> danvittegleo[m]: if the relay is setup correctly, why'd it be blacklisted?
07:13:48 <strcat[m]> it's obviously not an open relay and there strong auth
07:13:50 <JTL> > 00:13 <strcat[m]> renlord: and DNSSEC enforcement has to be local, you can't trust some remote server to do it and then connect to it unencrypted
07:13:52 <JTL> I've seen so many people forget this
07:14:03 <strcat[m]> and I have DKIM/SPF/DMARC properly set up for sending mail
07:14:10 <renlord> strcat[m]: were you able to resolve the the blacklisting with attestation.app?
07:14:22 <strcat[m]> renlord: that's not blacklisting
07:14:28 <strcat[m]> that's just people flagging the mails as spam
07:14:35 <strcat[m]> it can be resolved by sending them from a different attestation.app email eventually
07:14:40 <strcat[m]> I tested
07:14:51 <renlord> different alias?
07:14:58 <strcat[m]> gmail considers alert⊙aa to be a spammer
07:15:00 <strcat[m]> not attestation.app itself
07:15:04 <renlord> ok
07:15:05 <JTL> renlord: I've heard allegations of blacklist operators in the past go "HAIL MARY" and blacklist subnets, as opoosed to "spamming hosts"
07:15:53 <strcat[m]> renlord: so then once you have DNSSEC set up via unbound (and DNS-over-TLS because why not) you point resolv.conf at that, make sure it stays that way past reboot, and then you can enable DNSSEC and DANE in postfix
07:17:03 <strcat[m]> renlord: I use postfix + dovecot
07:17:11 <strcat[m]> renlord: and postfix set to auth via dovecot
07:17:18 <strcat[m]> dovecot is imap
07:17:30 <strcat[m]> smtp_dns_support_level = dnssec
07:17:33 <strcat[m]> smtp_tls_security_level = dane
07:17:49 <strcat[m]> is how you enable DANE for postfix, which makes it enforce DANE for outbound mail
07:18:01 <strcat[m]> if people don't have  DANE record, doesn't improve things, but doesn't break them either
07:18:22 <strcat[m]> setting up TLS properly == bunch of config options
07:18:26 <gosuser> I would like to save webpages as pdf for offline viewing on graphene. How can that be done?
07:18:27 <strcat[m]> and more to set up other things
07:18:50 <strcat[m]> gosuser: you can save webpages in Vanadium, it won't make them PDFs, but it can save them
07:19:29 <strcat[m]> go to a webpage, click the menu button, click the download arrow icon in the middle of the row at the top
07:20:19 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah idk, i'm all for running my own stuff, but running anything sufficiently complicated like an email server, it will break, need to be tweaked, need to be updated, etc. i guess i just don't see enough value in investing that time in a service that is inherently insecure.
07:20:39 <strcat[m]> I don't see any reason it'd break
07:20:46 <strcat[m]> but yeah it took time investment
07:21:05 <strcat[m]> I need to have my own email server to have DANE enforcement for outbound mail
07:21:07 <strcat[m]> among other things
07:21:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ehehehe.
07:21:14 <gosuser> What happened to the share-print method? Is that unique to chrome?
07:21:17 <strcat[m]> lots of people have DANE records set up
07:21:23 <TheJollyRoger> I... I have a hell of a time trying to keep my own computer afloat T_T.
07:21:24 <danvittegleo[m]> lol, every service eventually breaks
07:21:30 <strcat[m]> gosuser: no it's not unique to Chrome
07:21:40 <danvittegleo[m]> and needs love and attention
07:21:40 <strcat[m]> it's not going to break
07:21:44 <TheJollyRoger> My system breaks just about every time I try to "experiment" :D
07:21:45 <strcat[m]> it won't break randomly
07:21:52 <strcat[m]> it might break in a major upgrade
07:22:00 <strcat[m]> which I'll notice in testing generally
07:22:16 <TheJollyRoger> I guess I shouldn't have added "*/* **" to my package.accept_keywords :D
07:22:26 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm joking, I actually didn't do that :P)
07:23:13 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://paste.xinu.at/ydG8tz/ DNSSEC + TLS setup in main.cf
07:23:18 <gosuser> I'm testing with a random medium article, but the download arrow icon is greyed out
07:23:50 <strcat[m]> don't know why it's be greyed out
07:23:54 <strcat[m]> it'd*
07:26:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: and then you need opendkim, spf-engine (provides python spf-policyd)
07:26:36 <strcat[m]> and I had to set up dovecot, TLS for dovecot
07:27:02 <strcat[m]> assorted changes to postfix
07:27:20 <strcat[m]> if you only use the server via ssh + mutt then not as much to set up
07:27:29 <strcat[m]> cause you don't need to properly set up submission and imap
07:27:31 <renlord> can i have a more relaxed policy when relaying from my public MTA to my internal MTA
07:27:53 <renlord> so emails dont sit on disk too long on the public MTA
07:28:02 <renlord> do you have a similar setup?
07:28:15 <strcat[m]> I just have mail.grapheneos.org with postfix / dovecot, that's it
07:28:21 <gosuser> is mutt worth learning?
07:28:23 <renlord> ok
07:28:25 <strcat[m]> and I'm using mutt on my workstation to connect
07:28:29 <strcat[m]> gosuser: it's a terrible program
07:28:30 <renlord> i use neomutt
07:28:43 <strcat[m]> gosuser: I can't think of a less terrible one tho
07:28:54 <strcat[m]> renlord: I don't think I need any of the neomutt patches - unsure if any are relevant
07:28:56 <renlord> its the best CLI mail program
07:28:58 <gosuser> I'm struggling to find a single decent graphical email client on linux :(
07:29:01 <strcat[m]> sidebar is upstream now and I don't actually use it
07:29:11 <gosuser> mutt seems freaking arcane
07:29:18 <strcat[m]> gosuser: it's important to understand that there are no good or decent mail clients, graphical or otherwise
07:29:32 <strcat[m]> there are only LESS BAD mail clients
07:29:37 <strcat[m]> and mutt is less bad than the others
07:29:44 <renlord> very true ^
07:29:48 <strcat[m]> it has 1 thing that I can't stand about it though
07:30:05 <TheJollyRoger> Good gravy >_<.
07:30:06 <gosuser> doesn't seem like email is dying off anytime soon :'(
07:30:07 <renlord> even apple mail core dumps every now and then
07:30:20 <renlord> that was high sierra days
07:30:23 <renlord> dont know how it is now
07:30:36 <strcat[m]> renlord: do you need IMAP set up? and auth?>
07:30:46 <strcat[m]> renlord: or just MTA
07:30:51 <renlord> just MTA
07:31:21 <strcat[m]> renlord: so yeah I'd just install postfix, test that the defaults "work" (ofc it won't do DKIM, etc.)
07:31:26 <renlord> i actually just need a properly setup MTA
07:31:30 <strcat[m]> renlord: copy my unbound + DNSSEC + TLS config
07:31:36 <renlord> dont mind keeping my emails myself
07:31:49 <strcat[m]> set up opendkim, make sure that works, then spf-engine
07:32:09 <danvittegleo[m]> strcat: not sure if you're interested, but currently working on the early stages of a web installer with cdesai (https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-flash-tool), basically just a modified version of https://flash.android.com/ at the moment.
07:33:02 <strcat[m]> renlord: I think all my other tweaks were to set up SMTP submission, auth with dovecot, stripping the Received header for that so it doesn't leak my IP
07:33:04 <TheJollyRoger> Wow!
07:33:15 <strcat[m]> renlord: I'd recommend using Maildir rather than mbox too
07:33:17 <strcat[m]> but that's a generic thing
07:33:52 <renlord> i probably want to run dovecot in a separate server (i.e. my home) and then use LMTP to bring the mail back
07:34:08 <renlord> but does not look like LMTP has encryption
07:34:11 <renlord> kek
07:34:20 <renlord> maybe just chuck it inside a VPN
07:34:29 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's a good idea to put dovecot on the same server so you can use dovecot for postfix auth
07:34:33 <strcat[m]> it knows how to delegate auth
07:34:43 <strcat[m]> smtpd_sasl_type = dovecot
07:34:43 <strcat[m]> smtpd_sasl_path = private/auth
07:34:43 <strcat[m]> smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
07:34:44 <strcat[m]> in main.cf
07:34:50 <renlord> but i dont want to keep my mail on the server for long though
07:35:05 <renlord> but still want IMAP and dont want to use POP3
07:35:42 <strcat[m]> renlord: IMAP seems fine for that? just set up client to wipe it after dling it?
07:36:08 <strcat[m]> I'm perfectly happy just using mutt with IMAP with it set up properly
07:36:42 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://paste.xinu.at/Ia8E is my mutt config
07:37:04 <strcat[m]> imap_idle so it has push notifications of new mail
07:37:21 <strcat[m]> and I have it stick sent mail into my inbox
07:37:26 <strcat[m]> so that it threads my mail with their mail
07:37:34 <strcat[m]> and I can actually understand what's going on like gmail
07:38:09 <danvittegleo[m]> actually, does anyone have a pixel 2 or newer device that they are willing to wipe device to test out: https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-flash-tool?
07:40:05 <danvittegleo[m]> earlier today we were able to flash calyxos, but had to make a custom built zip file to do so. i think i've got it so it can flash normal factory images now - but need someone to test
07:40:38 <danvittegleo[m]> my only dev devices are pixel xls and they aren't supported by the tool
07:41:17 <renlord> i use mbsync to do imap sync
07:41:55 <renlord> so i can receive emails even without mutt on
07:45:52 <strcat[m]> renlord: I keep them on the server though so I might be thinking about it differently
07:48:10 <danvittegleo[m]> i guess it's about that time to go look for the cheapest ebay pixel 2+ phone i can find
07:52:54 <danvittegleo[m]> strcat: if you were gonna get one cheap dev device, what would you get. if i go pixel 2 it's eol no too long from now.
07:54:12 <strcat[m]> 3a
07:55:20 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah, that's what i was thinking. i could probably get a better deal on a 3 with a broken screen/cracks or w/e. but pricing doesn't seem too far off.
07:55:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
07:55:34 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy danvittegleo[m], good to see you.
07:56:08 <danvittegleo[m]> hey TheJollyRoger: same to you
07:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr \o/
07:57:10 <danvittegleo[m]> TheJollyRoger: you got any test phones :D?
07:57:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hi! Aw crap, I'm sorry, I don't. :(. I have one old Sailfish Pixel which I use as a sort of testbed phone and I keep it in the spare parts bin, but I don't have one that supports avb2.0 :(
07:58:11 <TheJollyRoger> So I have that old Sailfish? It's in like new condition except for a few small scratches near the USB slot.
07:58:22 <TheJollyRoger> But I keep it switched off and at 60% battery.
07:58:25 <danvittegleo[m]> no worries - i'll wait for cdesai to come back online. just being impatient :)
07:58:30 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
07:59:04 <TheJollyRoger> Fingers crossed!
08:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know when I'll have more spare phones. I think it would be a good idea for me to maybe see if I can find one in the future though.
08:00:35 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah it would be pretty neat to remove the complexity of flashing phones from the setup process.
08:00:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
08:00:55 <TheJollyRoger> Imagine, just click, *zap!* done! That would be boss ^_^
08:04:49 <TheJollyRoger> I had at one point tried to make a bash script but I gave up, it's really commendable you're working on an application like this!
08:07:50 <danvittegleo[m]> that's the idea. and yeah making things work cross platform or even cross distro is always difficult.
08:08:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
08:08:53 <TheJollyRoger> I... I think the hardest part for me was trying to deal with the differences between Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian >_<.
08:39:32 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/g7q9ml/if_youre_having_issues_installing_follow_the/
08:40:06 <gosuser> is thunderbird a terrible mail client?
08:40:32 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: Aye!
08:43:23 <strcat[m]> gosuser: yes really bad
08:43:41 <strcat[m]> honestly all mail clients are terrible
08:43:59 <gosuser> I'll have to bite the bullet and learn mutt then!
08:45:09 <TheJollyRoger> Join the club! I'm unmerging Thunderbird myself :(
08:51:19 <strcat[m]> https://paste.xinu.at/HzJ is the mutt configuration I use to access / send mail with mail.grapheneos.org but bear in mind that has a standards compliant IMAP server unlike many providers, and it's also currently only set up to have an inbox, not other folders
08:51:58 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow.
08:52:14 <TheJollyRoger> Wow, thank you, I think I will have to try to use this!
08:53:54 <strcat[m]> mutt has odd keybinds and takes some time to learn those
08:54:07 <TheJollyRoger> I hope I can remap them to dvorak!
08:54:28 <strcat[m]> for example since navigation in the index uses j, k or up / down arrows as you'd expect, the pager uses enter and backspace
08:56:50 <Zenithium[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I hope I can remap them to dvora"> Woah you use Dvorak? :o
08:57:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, I've used Dvorak since roughly 2008.
08:57:22 <TheJollyRoger> I can still type in QWERTY if I have to but I prefer Dvorak.
08:57:24 <Zenithium[m]> What made you switch? :P
08:58:17 <TheJollyRoger> It's a bit of a story. I experienced a boxer's fracture in my dominant hand and had to learn to type without the use of one hand.
08:58:28 <TheJollyRoger> Afterward I transitioned to two-handed Dvorak.
08:58:52 <gosuser> dat flex :D
08:59:01 <strcat[m]> finally made a 404 page https://grapheneos.org/non-existent
08:59:21 <TheJollyRoger> Heh.
08:59:36 <TheJollyRoger> Oh fantastic.
09:00:18 <TheJollyRoger> There is a Dvorak for left hand, but it's different from the Dvorak for two hands. I just found that it's easier for me now.
09:03:59 <Zenithium[m]> There was a time when I looked into keyboard layouts extensively and from what I understood Dvorak makes little improvement over QWERTY as anything is better than QWERTY which wasn't made for finger placement and movement optimization at all, and rather to prevent the typewriter jamming or whatever. From what I saw, Colemak-DH and Workman seemed the best, but I kinda concluded that it's not worth investing time into
09:03:59 <Zenithium[m]> relearning to type. Maybe I'm wrong and I'll do it eventually but eh... Not now.
09:04:25 <Zenithium[m]> Don't know if those were even around in 2008 xD
09:04:49 <TheJollyRoger> Figured I was already using a nonstandard keyboard layout, what's picking up a second! So I just decided hell with it and I was going to learn Dvorak, and just stayed. Honestly, I actually like it a lot better. It feels nice, although things like CTRL-C/CTRL-V require two hands now, since it looks like "CTRL-I and CTRL-."
09:05:16 <TheJollyRoger> Or you use your right hand.
09:05:39 <TheJollyRoger> I've actually tried Colemak and Workman as well, I ended up just going back to Dvorak.
09:05:45 <TheJollyRoger> It's a personal choice.
09:06:22 <Zenithium[m]> I wonder if you could make it so you have QWERTY while you're holding CTRL, it would unbreak a lot of shortcuts but it seems really hacky hahahah
09:06:51 <TheJollyRoger> Mac OSX does that, I've been told.
09:07:18 <TheJollyRoger> So I just use my right hand or when using Qubes for CTRL-SHIFT I just use two hands.
09:09:29 <TheJollyRoger> But I can still type in QWERTY because it's never left me. It does take some time getting used to.
09:09:53 <Zenithium[m]> I'm curious, do you actually box or were you just pissed and hit something? :D
09:10:47 <TheJollyRoger> I bailed trying to grind a rail on my skateboard and smashed my hand against concrete steps.
09:10:54 <TheJollyRoger> However I do actually box now.
09:12:09 <Zenithium[m]> sk8 or die I guess x)
09:12:54 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, yep. Tip when trying to do 50-50s on a handrail... if your back trucks aren't locked in, don't think you can "recover it" on the rail, just get off the board while you still can on your terms.
09:13:10 <TheJollyRoger> Or you're getting off the board on its.
09:14:25 <Zenithium[m]> Now I know where to for skating tips hehe
09:14:31 <TheJollyRoger> ^_^.
09:14:48 <Zenithium[m]> Though I never really got into it properly, I got as far as being able to cruise around without falling off and going down ramps but that's it, so I'm a n00b
09:15:12 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, ah don't worry, these days I can barely cruise and drop in :P.
09:15:57 <TheJollyRoger> But yes, for actual boxing, I don't buy commercially produced Mexican elasticated handwraps, I just buy nonelastic cotton twill tape and sew a little velcro to it.
09:17:06 <Zenithium[m]> This has gotten so off-topic hahah
09:17:13 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, ah, sorry XP.
09:17:15 <TheJollyRoger> It's late at night :P.
09:17:18 <TheJollyRoger> I'll PM you!
10:42:38 <limitless0[m]> Any recommandation on Maps app ?
11:10:17 <dazinism> limitless0: possibly depends what you need it for, but I use osmand and find it works pretty well for me
11:11:58 <dazinism> Would be weary of Magic Earth -
11:14:00 <dazinism> Apparently most of its connections are over http.
11:19:12 <dazinism> I leave mapillary off in osmand, its a third party service and its collecting location data.
11:29:37 <limitless0[m]> <dazinism "limitless0: possibly depends wha"> Usually before i used Waze for daily ,mostly just day to day usage traffic avoidance
11:56:42 <dazinism> limitless0: yeah traffic is a problem. I tend to avoid driving times of day / places where traffic is likely to be heavy.
12:08:45 <cx2[m]> see, when you live in a place that has some of the country's course traffic, you dont' need an app that provides live updates.... you already know it's going to be shitty no matter what!
12:11:40 <dazinism> You can overlay the traffic map from Google onto osmand
12:12:22 <dazinism> So you can see traffic levels, it wont do routing due to traffic though
12:13:09 <dazinism> I dont think.... theres a lot to it so maybe somehow it can be done
12:15:27 <dazinism> To add Google traffic, go into the options for the profile you are using (or create a new one)
12:15:55 <dazinism> Then 'map source'
12:16:03 <dazinism> Define new
12:16:20 <dazinism> Sorry define/edit
12:17:11 <limitless0[m]> dazinism: Waze is very good in traffic avoidance
12:17:19 <limitless0[m]> For london anyway
12:17:22 <dazinism> The URL in there is
12:17:25 <dazinism> http://mts0.googleapis.com/vt/lyrs=m,traffic&x={1}&y={2}&z={0}&style=15
12:17:43 <dazinism> The expire is 10 mins
12:18:13 <limitless0[m]> Best to use googlemaps on browser then
12:18:37 <hitchhooker[m]> Why dont you just use waze if you happy witht their privacy invasive tech?
12:19:24 <dazinism> Google maps in browser doesn't do navigation though any more (does it?)
12:19:58 <limitless0[m]> <dazinism "Google maps in browser doesn't d"> Dont know havent tried it lately
12:20:50 <dazinism> I've got a new 'traffic' profile on osmand. That I can switch to quickly if I need to check traffic.
12:21:22 <dazinism> Before that I'd check Google maps in browser, without giving my location data..
12:22:40 <limitless0[m]> Navigate in app it says so it wont let u navigate in browser
12:23:15 <dazinism> Following on from above I then switched the map source back to osm vector and set traffic as an overlay

20:50:05 <qyo3462572445[m]> I agree unfortunately (about the iPad thing). Especially for the price. Would be nice to have everything work together but, iPads work well if you need a tablet.
20:50:30 <TheJollyRoger> Battery lasts for a long time, too.
20:50:39 <TheJollyRoger> Way more than my laptop, even.
20:52:58 <qyo3462572445[m]> Absolutely. Also have a couple good terminal emulators if you need to ssh into any boxes or anything. I find myself using my iPad more than my laptop lately.
20:53:07 <TheJollyRoger> Woah, nice!
20:53:41 <TheJollyRoger> That would be boss. Certainly your SSH keys would be a ton safer in the mobile sandbox, than sitting in ~/.ssh/id file.
20:53:55 <TheJollyRoger> *than sitting in a ~/.
20:54:16 <qyo3462572445[m]> I love my laptop but its big and bulky and has a horrible screen lol. Plus the note I learn about security ..or lack of, on Linux, the less I want to use my laptop
20:54:31 <TheJollyRoger> Cripes, yes!
20:54:56 <JTL> Well no desktop operating system does application sandboxing properly
20:55:26 <JTL> and I don't think it's malice, moreso backwards compatibility with legacy applications, at least doing it the lazy way
20:55:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(
20:56:31 <qyo3462572445[m]> For sure. I'm learning that iOS isn't the evil OS that's being thrown around online, and Linux isn't the be all end all for privacy and security that's being pushed.
20:56:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr! \o/
20:56:51 <Zenithium[m]> Imagine a future where everyone's using iPads and people that still use laptops and desktops are seen as crazy people that want to get hacked

20:57:58 <JTL> Not saying it wasn't
20:58:39 <qyo3462572445[m]> I remember being super excited with my first android tablet...my how times have changed.

21:02:11 <TheJollyRoger> Pfft. Does *anyone* inspect their code?
21:03:21 <TheJollyRoger> Who inspects code? Answer: nobody. If everyone inspected their code we wouldn't have the dumpster fire that's thousands of bugs sitting unaddressed in the kernel issue tracker and the blazing inferno that's OpenSSL.

21:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> I read somewhere that Google has a distributed supercomputer with several thousand CPUs to do fuzzing of their Chromium source code. I couldn't help but find myself wishing for one of those for the Linux Kernel Foundation, then I get pulled back to reality when I realize it wouldn't make a difference if the foundation does not have the manpower, volunteers, and the eyes on the code to apply the

21:17:36 <wiringhen[m]> Completely ignoring security aspects for privacy
21:18:11 <TheJollyRoger> I couldn't help but think, if GKH decided to stop maintaining all LTS kernel trees,
21:18:18 <wiringhen[m]> For example
21:18:27 <TheJollyRoger> I wonder if this would force the vendors to simply go to mainline,

21:18:41 <wiringhen[m]> I don't even know where to start
21:18:55 <TheJollyRoger> or if they'd just collectively shrug their shoulders and go full on this_is_fine_im_ok_with_this_dog.jpg
21:19:28 <TheJollyRoger> Knowing how bad the chip vendors are I'm kinda guessing the latter.
21:19:34 <gervarouge[m]> Brave and Hardened Firefox are both such a joke
21:19:57 <JTL> Brave is Chromium? Doing who know what else
21:19:59 <JTL> lol
21:21:15 <nunbit[m]> I thought this is graphene room. I must be and idiot.
21:21:30 <gervarouge[m]> <nunbit[m] "yes because u inspected the open"> Yeah no one has inspected the 10 of millions of lines in Android and Chromium written by Google. You are taking it mostly on faith. Apple is definitely the more trustworthy company. Does that stop me from using Android? No. I MITM both
21:21:32 <cx2[m]> I think ignoring is one way to put it. Or just laziness in that they just throw whatever seems to be the flavor of the month up on their site without much explanation as to how they came to their conclusions.
21:21:48 <gervarouge[m]> Best I can do. I trust both
21:22:10 <wiringhen[m]> <nunbit[m] "I thought this is graphene room."> No you're right. We're just frustrated.
21:23:07 <TheJollyRoger> nunbit[m]: Nope, you arrived at the right place. Only thing is, here in this room, we evaluate operating system security based on testing in the real world under practical circumstances, and not what license is on the installer, or make-believe fantasy scenarios.
21:23:49 <gervarouge[m]> <cx2[m] "Terminal emulator for iPad.....o"> Which one?
21:24:07 <gervarouge[m]> There is no FSF worship here
21:24:50 <TheJollyRoger> We also aren't going to mindlessly repeat privacywashing and privacy myths that have been trodden to *death* and have been crumbling since 2006.
21:24:56 <cx2[m]> Well I don't use one at all yet... I am asking for an opinion on one
21:25:00 <nunbit[m]> <gervarouge[m] "There is no FSF worship here "> seems there is proprietary worship though.

21:25:37 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: "use IE6 with a commercial adblocker that injects code into the browser!"
21:25:43 <JTL> (2006 privacy things I remember)
21:26:22 <TheJollyRoger> nunbit[m]: GrapheneOS is open-source and MIT licensed. Even the configuration files used for the mail server configuration is open-source. Don't start projecting.
21:26:37 <TheJollyRoger> This project has put its money where its mouth is.
21:27:24 <cx2[m]> TheJollyRoger: I think he's refering talks regarding iPad, et. al.
21:27:45 <gervarouge[m]> Closed source isn't inherently bad. Security and privacy violations are. Apple has less privacy and security violations then most products open or closed
21:28:06 <gervarouge[m]> iPad is currently the best option for some oomph. Sadly that's a fact
21:28:41 <nunbit[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nunbit: GrapheneOS is open-sourc"> I am not the one worshiping proprietary and then use words privacy. Those things dont go together. Point of failure =closed cource authority =corruption
21:29:21 <cx2[m]> Geezus.
21:29:58 <gervarouge[m]> <nunbit[m] "I am not the one worshiping prop"> You do realize that GrapheneOS has tens of millions of lines of code written by Google no one has audited. It has closed source binaries. All these things are facts of a secure system. We aren't going to act holier than thou just because it's open
21:30:15 <nunbit[m]> <cx2[m] "Geezus. "> please go implement backdoor to linux kernel
21:30:25 <gervarouge[m]> GrapheneOS, AOSP, and Chromium are all proven products much like iOS and Safari
21:30:33 <TheJollyRoger> nunbit[m], if you're willing to stick around and learn, we're quite happy to have you. But if you're just here to stir the pot, this channel really isn't for you.
21:30:36 <TheJollyRoger> So which is it going to be?

21:32:18 <gervarouge[m]> Oh wait it's open source so they don't bat an eye
21:35:07 <Zenithium[m]> People think backdoors in code look like obvious import backdoor.h; code but it can be an inconspicuous bug like a buffer overflow that leads into remote code execution
21:35:21 <TheJollyRoger> Zenithium[m]: totally this!
21:36:33 <JTL> Zenithium[m]: No shit :D
21:36:54 <nunbit[m]> <Zenithium[m] "People think backdoors in code l"> So another Microsoft suggestion? Seems like I really learn a lot.
21:37:20 <Zenithium[m]> Where did I mention Microsoft?
21:38:45 <Zenithium[m]> I simply said backdoors are not always (or most of the time really) obvious so code being open-source doesn't really help that much, and as others have mentioned above everyone says "well you can just read the code" and then nobody reads the code.
21:39:03 <qyo3462572445[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Which one? "> Blink is FOSS, Prompt isn't, neither is Termius, but Termius is a subscription. All three cost money. Those are the three I know off the top of my head.

21:40:38 <TheJollyRoger> For too long, open source has let itself become complacent. We've ended up in this position where we've just gotten smug, and assumed that that's enough to make something secure and trustworthy.
21:40:47 <TheJollyRoger> It isn't.
21:41:00 <gervarouge[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "Blink is FOSS, Prompt isn't, nei"> Someone recommended iSH which is open
21:41:01 <gervarouge[m]> Could check that
21:41:10 <TheJollyRoger> Just because the work is there and can be done, it doesn't auto-magically mean someone is doing it.
21:41:43 <gervarouge[m]> I have only audited a few things in code
21:42:22 <gervarouge[m]> It's too much work. MITM is all I can consistently do
21:45:17 <skwisgaar[m]> Wait... So there isn't an army of magical open source fairy devs with security expertise who audit ALL open source code 24/7 for no compensation?
21:45:46 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. That's the lesson we should have learned repeatedly.
21:45:58 <gervarouge[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "Wait... So there isn't an army o"> Oh there is it's called Google... They are paid. Hope you trust them
21:46:12 <gervarouge[m]> They don't even scratch the surface

22:04:31 <gervarouge[m]> The misinformation on PTIO is so bad, but none of us take the time to correct it. It's a rough cycle
22:09:46 <jcpicard32[m]> I tried to correct it once, citing security researchers, and was downvoted into oblivion for it. I then promptly decided it wasn't worth my time and haven't checked the sub since. I should probably leave.
22:10:11 <jcpicard32[m]> People hear what they want to hear
22:10:15 <jcpicard32[m]> There's only so much we can do
22:11:40 <gervarouge[m]> Let me guess Firefox?
22:11:45 <jcpicard32[m]> yep
22:12:28 <jcpicard32[m]> That sub and privacy have the biggest hardon for Firefox and Mozilla can do no wrong in their eyes. It's really funny to look at if you take a step back tbh
22:13:23 <analogpathy[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "That sub and privacy have the bi"> They also think Linux is more secure than Mac or Windows.
22:14:28 <jcpicard32[m]> I know. It's so frustrating. I was really glad when I found GOS over the summer. I probably would have been sucked into that thinking too tbh. I'm glad I found Daniel's posts and it got me sucked into this lovely rabbithole
22:14:30 <gervarouge[m]> The problem is Linux and Firefox you are far less likely to get malware. Linux repos are pretty safe. Firefox add-ons are better audited
22:14:40 <silkbrain[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "I tried to correct it once, citi"> It will be better to contact ptio team so they will correct misinformation, especially if strong evidence gathered. Why whine that users downvote you, if you know that they didn't understand the topic?
22:14:46 <gervarouge[m]> They have a point for non technicals maybe, they just don't have that distinction
22:15:57 <gervarouge[m]> My grandparents I want on Linux and Firefox. They are much much safer. For me? Chrome and Windows is much more secure
22:16:33 <jcpicard32[m]> silkbrain: I phrased that poorly. I am a full time student, and work 30 hours a week. I don't have much free time available, and I'd rather use that time to learn more so I can help here rather than point out misinformation on PTIO to the mods.
22:16:58 <gervarouge[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "silkbrain: I phrased that poorly"> Very understandable
22:18:18 <jcpicard32[m]> Linux and Firefox both definitely have a place. But they're not the end all and be all for privacy that people seem to think they are.
22:18:50 <jcpicard32[m]> I certatinly understand the fear of a browser engine monopoly. It was bad enough last time. But I do think it's important to base my decisions on fact.
22:19:08 <Zenithium[m]> <gervarouge[m] "My grandparents I want on Linux "> If you prefer those I would recommend Windows 10 LTSC and ungoogled-chromium if you're not already using them

22:20:11 <gervarouge[m]> I can't use Windows it's too bad for coding. I need Linux or Mac (which I'll switch too in 2021)
22:23:26 <gervarouge[m]> Hackintosh is a possibility, but to keep the integrity of SIP you need to run OpenCore on another flashdrive iirc. I don't know enough to switch confidently. If anyone knows better please let me know
22:24:09 <silkbrain[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "silkbrain: I phrased that poorly"> Hm, yeah, I understand you. But I mean you definitely can make substantial impact in less time if you will send corrections right to ptio team, via github issue, may be.
22:26:02 <nunbit[m]> <gervarouge[m] "My grandparents I want on Linux "> I swear if I was born yesterday you hook me up on Microsoft. I think my favorite feature is daily telemetry uploads with all my perrsonal files.
22:26:30 <gervarouge[m]> <nunbit[m] "I swear if I was born yesterday "> Have you tried Windows 10 LTSC? Debotnet?
22:26:34 <jcpicard32[m]> silkbrain: That's certainly possible. I meant no hostility with what I said. I hadn't really looked into the process there at all tbh. If people think it would be worth it I could look into it. I just want to do the best I can with the time and knowledge I have
22:26:42 <gervarouge[m]> Windows 10 LTSC gives you full control
22:27:13 <gervarouge[m]> Windows is used by large corporations that need privacy. That's why LTSC exists and is so hard to find
22:27:24 <gervarouge[m]> They don't want people having it. It's too good
22:28:28 <nunbit[m]> LOL what are u doing in graphene room?
22:28:40 <gervarouge[m]> <nunbit[m] "LOL what are u doing in graphene"> Trying to secure my data
22:28:56 <gervarouge[m]> And yes getting hacked is the biggest privacy violation
22:30:11 <nunbit[m]> <gervarouge[m] "And yes getting hacked is the bi"> Dont worry about hacking on Microsoft. They got u covered. Literally. all your data covered.
22:30:43 <gervarouge[m]> nunbit: why do you have to be so close minded? Unless you build open source code directly from source for everything you use you don't even know it's the code you think it is. I have to completely trust Daniel to build from the real source (which I do)
22:30:55 <gervarouge[m]> <nunbit[m] "Dont worry about hacking on Micr"> No business would use them if that was true
22:31:33 <gervarouge[m]> Do you even MITM bro? I even MITM GrapheneOS and I trust it completely
22:32:05 <TheJollyRoger> nunbit, you're not listening.
22:32:45 <TheJollyRoger> Please discontinue your trolling.
22:33:38 <gervarouge[m]> nunbit: You don't understand what trust is. You trust code writers to write secure code. You trust code writers to right non malicious code. You trust code compliers to compile the hopefully trustworthy code. You trust their security system. You trust them to not turn on you down the road or be bought out. That's a ton of trust and you can't audit it all

22:35:43 <TheJollyRoger> Hi yzernik, I've used the Google Contacts list before once when I got desperate. I haven't had any problems with getting it to export as a .vcf.
22:36:01 <TheJollyRoger> Zenithium[m]: quite possibly!
22:36:37 <yzernik> For some reason it won't accept the vcf file I exported from Google
22:36:59 <yzernik> And it doesn't show any option for importing csv
22:38:33 <yzernik> I'm thinking of trying to use davx5 but I think that shouldn't be necessary

23:09:30 <TheJollyRoger> I haven't audited a single line, but I can trace my ppc64 install back to another individual on the gentoo-powerpc channel who was able to bootstrap crosscompile a little-endian stage 1, and use it to build a stage 2. That's as far as I've gone. I don't think going any further down is feasible for anyone without highly specialized knowledge.
23:09:47 <TheJollyRoger> *bootstrap, then crosscompile

23:11:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, well, the part about "without highly specialized knowledge" is... heh.

23:31:51 <JTL> Blackberry still supported sideloading apps
23:32:14 <JTL> All you'd need was a "developer certificate" from RIM that was $99, but could obtain it through shell companies or otherwise
23:32:15 <madaidan[m]> Loved that time they applied the grsecurity patch for marketing but disabled all useful features
23:32:23 <JTL> (I'm talking about older BBOS)
23:32:55 <gervarouge[m]> No the old Blackberry's Obama had to use iirc didn't
23:33:37 <JTL> Certain people in the know back then remember this

23:34:06 <gervarouge[m]> <madaidan[m] "Blackberry is security theater"> I don't disagree in the slightest
23:34:11 <gervarouge[m]> <JTL "Certain people in the know back "> I've seen that
23:34:22 <JTL> I remember that at the time :)
23:34:32 <JTL> (Been following strcat's "project" for ~5 years now)
23:35:00 <gervarouge[m]> Sorry lagging
23:35:06 <JTL> TIs okay
23:35:21 <gervarouge[m]> Interesting, well maybe Blackberrys weren't a great choice
23:35:27 <gervarouge[m]> I thought they had a good reason
23:35:56 <gervarouge[m]> I'd have given him an iPhone personally
23:36:02 <gervarouge[m]> A short class
23:39:40 <gervarouge[m]> Obama was using a custom Blackberry though so I imagine the sideloading was disabled on the organizational level. I don't know what their config was. Would be interesting to see
23:40:24 <JTL> I'd assume at least it would have all unneded functions disabled, and not use the public Blackberry network (BBM)
23:41:17 <gervarouge[m]> I read something about that it wasn't on the cellular network
23:41:48 <gervarouge[m]> They had hosted email and call forwarding and his emails were manually examined before he got them
