02:28:02 <izymandias[m]> overheadscallop: its not very clear
02:51:53 <dazinism> izymandias: looks like you have a load of 'active' matrix sessions. I'd recommend getting rid of all the ones you don't use and verify the others.
03:07:39 <izymandias[m]>  dazinism: im just curious if verifying these rooms is something that is safe to do
03:15:35 <dazinism> Think you either verify your sessions with each other (eg. Phone & computer) or other peoples, ideally when you meet them in person
03:15:44 <dazinism> Dont verify rooms
03:17:35 <dazinism> izymandias: its generally a good thing to do. With your own devices, its for sharing end to end encryption keys.
03:18:36 <dazinism> Between the devices that are verified. So you can read encrypted messages from any device.
03:19:29 <dazinism> Verifying other people lets you know your e2ee hasnt been man-in-the-middled
03:20:38 <dazinism> Also allows the client to let you know if your contact has new devices (which in some situations may be suspicious)
03:21:06 <dazinism> Can set it up to only encrypt messages to devices you've verified
03:22:21 <dazinism> Hopefully you can follow that - lol
03:22:51 <izymandias[m]> ok
03:23:09 <izymandias[m]> i get it
03:23:23 <izymandias[m]> thNKS
03:23:36 <dazinism> If you suspected one of your devices may be compromised, probably not a good idea to verify it
03:41:10 <renlord> strcat[m]: this was just merged https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_bionic/pull/5
03:41:18 <renlord> do you still want me to test with the last 2 commits?
03:41:50 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes
03:42:04 <strcat[m]> renlord: test without that commit and without the ASLR commit - just revert the most recent 2
03:45:26 <renlord> ok
04:21:55 <BalooRJ> Does anyone know if there is another public server for Konele available to test out the Speech to Text function?
05:45:35 <mrmanpants[m]> is there a way to stop Graphene from re-promping the password every so often? (when setup with fingerprint)
06:38:33 <greenmoon[m]> It is different from aosp? On aosp it just prompt after many hours, usually when you sleep it ask for password when u wake up, at least on my phone.
06:44:19 <greenmoon[m]> Maybe you press the fingerprint multiples times without noticing it, but nowadays the sensor should be turned off if the screen is covered eg in your pocket, not sure if that feature is present on pixels.
09:34:01 <renlord> strcat[m]: test pass at HEAD~2
09:34:08 <renlord> 5cc8c34e60dbfeb1fd996bf83bb01a0443d93a8a
09:34:26 <renlord> the 2nd stack ASLR was the commit that broke CTS test
10:05:39 <zxwayland> hi
10:53:05 <cdesai> renlord: CTS on emulator would catch this too in theory, right
10:53:53 <cdesai> Wonder if it'd make sense to have an automated test just for the platform failures then. There can still be full device tests for proper verification, but it could still catch failures early
11:17:25 <renlord> cdesai: yes
11:27:17 <renlord> itd be good if it was possible to just run the tests directly in the bionic repo
11:27:44 <renlord> i dont even know how the CTS gets compiled and how the source ends up in the CTS
12:48:27 <renlord> wow, so few real irc users :(
13:09:44 <snark> Hello everyone
13:11:06 <f8sai[m]> <snark "Hello everyone"> Hello
13:13:12 <snark> im using grapheneos with pixel 3a / pixel 3a xl - now installed on pixel 4
13:13:56 <snark> looks like motions sense and smooth display are not supported - I tried to find info on this matter but no success
13:14:44 <f8sai[m]> <snark "im using grapheneos with pixel 3"> Congrats ^^
13:15:01 <f8sai[m]> * Congrats
13:15:08 <f8sai[m]> can't help with that
13:15:10 <renlord> snark: those things are only distributed via the google vendor images i think
13:15:11 <f8sai[m]>  I'm on 3a
13:15:11 <f8sai[m]> Maybe checking sensor permission?
13:15:32 <renlord> if they dont exist on aosp, then you dont have those features
13:16:09 <snark> mmmh, these features are missing in the settings
13:16:25 <f8sai[m]> *  I'm on 3a
13:16:25 <f8sai[m]> Maybe check the sensor permission?
13:16:28 <snark> like the active edges on 3a
13:17:44 <snark> thing is - they appear in google original firmware (never used it - wiped in favor of GrapheneOS immediately)
13:17:46 <f8sai[m]> Yeah, those aren't implemented, for reasons "renlord" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_renlord:matrix.org) have stated
13:17:58 <snark> "not in AOSP" arguement sounds legit
13:18:30 <renlord> its not an argument, it is a fact.
13:18:52 <snark> ok, can live with that fact as well :)
13:19:43 <snark> thanks for clarification
13:20:35 <renlord> no prob
14:15:05 <RedNovember[m]> Hey lads, I'm looking to get the most out of my Pixel 4 with GrapheneOS installed, and I'm looking to install Gcam, Pixel launcher, and Pixel themes. Anyone know if there is any telemetry for these applications with Google and whether they work for Graphene?
14:17:16 <LinusSexTips[m]> Google apps don't work without microG to my knowledge
14:17:16 <MysteriousWizard> You can install a patch to get GCam working
14:17:30 <LinusSexTips[m]> Which we don't have on Graphene
14:17:31 <MysteriousWizard> Yes
14:17:35 <MysteriousWizard> Which is why I said install...
14:21:41 <RedNovember[m]> How can I get it to work?
14:32:39 <SchismXL[m]> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider download and install this apk, then whatever gcam app you wish to use. It'll work then @rednovember:matrix.org
14:39:29 <g65434-2[m]> <RedNovember[m] "How can I get it to work?"> use stock
14:52:05 <f8sai[m]> CalyxOS?
14:52:25 <f8sai[m]> <f8sai[m] "CalyxOS?"> RedNovember
16:40:27 <f8sai[m]> Not really?
16:40:49 <f8sai[m]> Or rather there is none for GrapheneOS
16:41:43 <f8sai[m]> Due to it not meeting the hardware, firmware security requirements
16:41:43 <f8sai[m]> I recommend searching the logs on freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
16:49:57 <strcat[m]> cdesai: any progress on Chromium?
17:01:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> f8sai [GNU/GPL v3]: it doesn't support
17:02:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> I guess if we support pinephone we might as well support every phone on the market
17:02:46 <strcat> it doesn't meet the requirements
17:02:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because pinephone isn't even CTS pass
17:03:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> It was never designed to run android
17:03:14 <strcat> it doesn't have the functionality needed to run the OS and certainly can't be secure
17:03:21 <f8sai[m]> Yeah, thanks for confirming it further
17:03:22 <f8sai[m]> * Or rather there is none (no Pinephone builds) for GrapheneOS
17:03:50 <strcat> no verified boot, no hardware-backed keystore, no hardware encryption support and many other things
17:03:55 <strcat> not a possible target
17:04:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> f8sai [GNU/GPL v3]: also you need a development team
17:04:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are just securing devices that have already been developed for
17:04:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'd have to start from scratch for pinephone
17:04:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> And really we don't have those kinds of resources
17:05:05 <f8sai[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "f8sai [GNU/GPL v3]: also you nee"> Yeah, just answering the question. Not interested in building it due to not meeting the requirements and not having one myself.
17:05:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> We'd also need to create our own security bulletins
17:05:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> And get security researchers to find issues
17:05:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Along with rolling out security patches ourselves
17:08:55 <f8sai[m]> Anyways, thanks for an informative answer. A question, is it possible to tinker or build Android settings without building the whole OS due to limitations in RAM and CPU?
17:09:08 <f8sai[m]> * Anyways, thanks for an informative answer. A question, is it possible to tinker or build Android settings without building the whole OS due to limitations in RAM and CPU of the computer itself?
17:12:05 <f8sai[m]> Maybe that will not be feasible due to it having to be tested. Nvm
17:12:07 <f8sai[m]> (the changes)
17:14:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> f8sai [GNU/GPL v3]: sometimes
17:15:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> But this is strictly developer only and assumes you have a build with your own keys in the first place
17:16:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you have your own keys you can rebuild individual parts like apps and test them quickly instead of building a full system image
17:19:49 <f8sai[m]> Figures, guess I can't do that just yet
17:20:01 <f8sai[m]> Thanks for the info
17:30:55 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I did a bunch of builds with different configs, need to check status. But haven't got it working yet unfortunately
17:31:34 <cdesai> I compiled 85. And master too hoping that if they have a fix we can backport, need to recheck as I fired off the build before logging out on Friday
17:52:16 <cn3m[m]> <lovesausage[m] "Hi! I just ordered my pixel phon"> that breaks verified boot
17:52:26 <cn3m[m]> along with other weaknesses
17:52:45 <cn3m[m]> that is not GrapheneOS if you install magisk
17:53:08 <cn3m[m]> app ipc is too strong on Android anyway that adds a ton of attack surface even if you fully trust the app
17:53:29 <nickcalyx[m]> <lovesausage[m] "Hi! I just ordered my pixel phon"> why do you need root so badly
17:58:06 <theultron[m]> If you go with root then I will recommend you to set a tasker task which will verify important partitions on the boot. It will show if any files have been modified in last 24 hours before you enter your lock screen password.

18:01:07 <cn3m[m]> <lovesausage[m] "Well I use a lot of magisk stuff"> Just use PrivateDNS for blocking

18:01:26 <theultron[m]> <cn3m[m] "that doesn't work"> Why won't it work? It works fine for me.
18:02:00 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "Why won't it work? It works fine"> you can very easily bypass that app if you get root and change what it is verifying
18:02:06 <cn3m[m]> there is not physical root of trust
18:02:14 <cn3m[m]> it is at the whims of the attacker
18:02:31 <cn3m[m]> Verified Boot has to be in software
18:02:53 <cn3m[m]>  * Verified Boot has to be in hardware*
18:03:10 <cn3m[m]> even partially hardware solutions don't work well like CloudReady which has many holes in the implementation
18:03:31 <theultron[m]> But if an attacker is so committed to hack into you then he will find any way. May be he buys an exploit for your device hardware.
18:05:35 <theultron[m]> <lovesausage[m] "I also use root to change encryp"> You don't need root for that. You can set a long password.
18:05:58 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "But if an attacker is so committ"> The blobs and everything is verified with verified boot too
18:06:00 <cn3m[m]> <lovesausage[m] "I also use root to change encryp"> that is not needed with the architectural changes on Android and Pixels
18:06:01 <cn3m[m]> a 4 digit pin on a Pixel would take 650 years to crack with unlimited computing power
18:08:40 <lovesausage[m]> I also use root to change encryption password/key from 4 digits to longer one, is this feature included in Graphene?
18:08:40 <lovesausage[m]> nice, but the same pass for encryption and lockscreen . how come a 4 digit pin takes so long to crack on a Pixel when it goes a lot faster to bruteforce it on others?
18:11:37 <theultron[m]> I think the Pixel have something called Titan M which makes brute forcing difficult. You still may go with a longer password to be on the safer side.
18:13:17 <lovesausage[m]> ah , I never understood what the titan M did really
18:13:31 <theultron[m]> I personally feel the Graphene community enlarges the risk of being rooted on your phone and totally neglect the benefits which come out of it.
18:13:44 <cn3m[m]> The Titan M is extremely close to the Secure Enclave from Apple which has still secure after 7 years
18:13:45 <cn3m[m]> The Titan M and Secure Enclave both offer Insider Attack Resistance and rollback protection
18:13:45 <cn3m[m]> This means Google, GrapheneOS, or Apple could never make a backdoor to open a device after it was locked without your PIN. If they did before it would only work until the next update
18:13:45 <cn3m[m]> lovesausage: it is very cool tech
18:13:45 <rover1[m]> <cn3m[m] "The Titan M and Secure Enclave b"> researchers made work on sep, see Hao Xu abstract https://www.mosec.org/en/2020/
18:14:57 <lovesausage[m]> Very cool :)
18:15:34 <cn3m[m]> The other thing is even if you did attack these chips they have key derivation. For example on the default iPhone with a full SEP exploit would still take on the dedicated crypto hardware 4200 hours
18:15:40 <cn3m[m]> to break a pin
18:15:56 <cn3m[m]> if you had a password or a longer than default pin it would be even longer
18:16:17 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "I personally feel the Graphene c"> rooting breaks the security model of Android. It opens up your device to persistent threat
18:16:39 <theultron[m]> It's not easy for any app to gain root access on your phone unless it finds an exploit (something like xhelper gained access on older android version but there were enough signs of you being infected)
18:16:40 <cn3m[m]> if you want to break your remote security and physical security go for it
18:17:07 <theultron[m]> or you root your phone and manually give access.

18:24:35 <cn3m[m]> you are missing the point we want to have secure devices here not ones you have to figure out when you are hacked
18:24:41 <cn3m[m]> xD
18:24:59 <cn3m[m]> Rooting GrapheneOS is impossible because then it is not GrapheneOS
18:26:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: *installs magisk on grapheneos*
18:26:11 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "cn3m: *installs magisk on graphe"> that is not GrapheneOS
18:26:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> How so
18:26:59 <TheJollyRoger> theultron[m]: all instances of GrapheneOS are signed, verified, built reproducibly, there are multiple levels of digital signature validation, and each installation is bitwise identical across each given instance of each device and traceable back to the release keys.
18:27:09 <TheJollyRoger> This is why we say that "it's not GrapheneOS" if you modify it.
18:27:15 <cn3m[m]> Daniel has clearly stated for something to be GrapheneOS it has to be locked and can't have play services or magisk
18:27:19 <cn3m[m]> If it is not locked and has things like that you are running an OS that is not GrapheneOS
18:27:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Makes sense
18:28:32 <theultron[m]> I am not on GrapheneOS as I am happy with my manufacturer's rom. I am not doubting GrapheneOS security at all. I am saying that the risk of being root is blown out of proportion.
18:30:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> theultron: then recreate dm-verity and use external attestation, it's still weak BTW
18:30:47 <cn3m[m]> if you have root you have a non immutable OS which is just not going to work with verification
18:30:56 <fll[m]> > I am not on GrapheneOS as I am happy with my manufacturer's rom. I am not doubting GrapheneOS security at all. I am saying that the risk of being root is blown out of proportion.
18:30:56 <fll[m]> For average use maybe....graphene is trying to be as secure as possible though.
18:31:01 <TheJollyRoger> Android isn't built like a desktop operating system, but rather, it's built out of many mutually-distrusting and separate components. The attitude that upstream took is remarkably pragmatic: they realized that a perimeter security model breaks down the instant you run code that may not be 100% trustworthy. So what they did instead was attempt to design android as mutually-distrusting components
18:31:04 <TheJollyRoger> that are constrained via mandatory access controls to be permitted to do only what they should be doing.
18:31:15 <g65434-2[m]> but graphene isn't root lmao
18:31:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> find /system | sort ->hashes
18:31:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> assert (hashes=oldhashes) else git diff
18:31:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or whatever diff you like
18:31:34 <TheJollyRoger> This is why only init and a few other components have root-equivalent access.
18:31:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> This isn't a replacement for dm-verity
18:31:44 <TheJollyRoger> By rooting, you're essentially saying "screw good security design."
18:31:49 <fll[m]> Also with root on your phone things like "check logs" become moot, since those could be altered too
18:31:51 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "This is why only init and a few "> init is restricted
18:31:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: iirc 5 processes have root on android

18:33:55 <theultron[m]> cn3m: I saw the mwk labs findings. It uses samsung push service for ipc. It's not possible in my case as the only apps which have internet access is Bromite & Orbot. I have removed the updater component of my OEM. You need to plan a specific targeted attack for me.
18:34:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> I did test them and I was running them for 2 weeks
18:34:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> But if you can, test them one by one
18:34:31 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: ok, uh... might need a bit of help. Sec.
18:34:31 <cn3m[m]> the only area Android gets an F on security is accessibility services and no easy way to check them. GrapheneOS mitigates this with the Auditor app and remote attestation
18:34:35 <TheJollyRoger> I'll go get onto that in a bit.

19:01:00 <cn3m[m]> it does share clipboard and uses a device manager in the work profile
19:01:06 <cn3m[m]> neither of which is ideal
19:06:32 <youpie12> But in case of someone obtaining my device while i restarted it; it shouldn't become less harder to attack right?
19:06:38 <youpie12> Its more of a privacy issue
19:06:43 <youpie12> while on
19:06:46 <youpie12> or am i mistaking
19:06:56 <TheJollyRoger> If someone obtains your device after you restart it, that phone is encrypted.
19:07:13 <cn3m[m]> no it wouldn't make it easier to break your phone physically
19:07:38 <TheJollyRoger> Remember that each profile is encrypted with different keys, which need to be derived using a combination of access tokens contained in the HSM, information in the header partition, and your password.
19:08:17 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If someone obtains your device a"> with restricted usb even not rebooted you should be fine. Apple hasn't had a Cellebrite like attack claimed since doing that and we just added that back a year ago
19:08:28 <youpie12> Thanks, the phone still loads up in a second for me with a 20 character password which makes me sometimes think its not encrypted at all.
19:08:40 <cn3m[m]> Ideally reboot, but GrapheneOS is holding on strong :)
19:08:45 <TheJollyRoger> youpie12: Would you like to try a simple experiment?
19:08:53 <youpie12> Cellebrite is my enemy atm
19:08:56 <youpie12> Yeah
19:09:14 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Got a password set? A four digit pincode will do.
19:09:20 <youpie12> yes
19:09:22 <cn3m[m]> <youpie12 "Cellebrite is my enemy atm"> don't worry about them lol
19:09:38 <youpie12> My ''attacker'' will probably try cellebrite ufed
19:09:42 <youpie12> if got hands on my phone
19:09:49 <youpie12> thats the reason im on graphen
19:10:06 <youpie12> dont trust the standard android encryption
19:10:21 <TheJollyRoger> You do realize those UFED devices when they list supported devices, are for extracting the images of already unlocked devices, correct? Only "lockscreen bypass" means they've got an exploit.
19:10:29 <cn3m[m]> <youpie12 "dont trust the standard android "> you should it is fantastic
19:10:50 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You do realize those UFED device"> they can't extract images with the security chips
19:10:51 <youpie12> I've seen new iphones get hacked
19:11:06 <cn3m[m]> they could but they are useless
19:11:07 <youpie12> This pixel chipset shoudl safe
19:11:18 <cn3m[m]> <youpie12 "I've seen new iphones get hacked"> not really ever since iOS 11 something
19:11:26 <youpie12> They claim they can get in
19:11:28 <youpie12> ios 13
19:11:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, simple experiment coming up: reboot your phone, and then when you see "password required after reboot" at the lockscreen, hit 00000 (unless that is your password, in which case you should change it) and press return. Repeat this 50 times;
19:11:31 <youpie12> in news pages
19:11:38 <cn3m[m]> iPhones are generally more resistant to these things, but GrapheneOS closes that gap
19:11:59 <youpie12> Same 000000
19:12:06 <youpie12> or just similar
19:12:09 <youpie12> and repeat that 50 times?
19:12:21 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, or anything but your password. You'll notice that after the first five attempts, it's going to force you to time out 5 seconds, then after the first ten, it's going to force you to time out for 30.
19:12:30 <youpie12> Ah theres a timer
19:12:31 <TheJollyRoger> Once you hit 50, it's going to force you to time out for one minute.
19:12:37 <youpie12> You cant get around a timer?
19:12:38 <TheJollyRoger> After two weeks of this, it's going to reach 24 hours between attempts.
19:12:39 <youpie12> Like an exploit
19:12:50 <youpie12> Because android stock also
19:12:52 <youpie12> Has one
19:12:57 <TheJollyRoger> No, you can't. The Titan M contains an access token and its own internal incremental timer that doesn't answer to the host timer.
19:13:06 <youpie12> Ah now i get it.
19:13:21 <TheJollyRoger> So even if you found an exploit for the operating system, the Titan M is going to say "Sorry, but your timer doesn't match mine. Fifty seconds, by MY COUNT, and not yours."
19:13:40 <cn3m[m]> youpie12: they can't get into iOS 13
19:13:41 <TheJollyRoger> And remember, the Titan contains the access tokens which are needed to derive the keys from the password.
19:14:10 <cn3m[m]> also key derivation so even if they bypass the timer they still have issues
19:14:32 <TheJollyRoger> So, youpie12 -
19:15:10 <TheJollyRoger> Let's say you set a four digit pincode and that four digit pincode is /perfectly/ random, like you used D&D dice to generate it and it's hard to guess. I know you probably are going to set a much longer password, but bear with me for the sake of a thought experiment.
19:15:19 <youpie12> Yeah i know
19:15:22 <youpie12> Mathematically
19:15:26 <youpie12> This will take a long time for
19:15:27 <youpie12> a brute froce
19:16:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. After two weeks of getting to the maximum, it'll take 650 years to exhaust the keyspace.
19:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> If you're not certain 650 years is enough for you or you want a little extra peace of mind or you want something to remember, you can use a diceware passphrase.
19:16:38 <TheJollyRoger> *want something easier to remember.
19:16:55 <cn3m[m]> It takes half a year for an iPhone encryption chip to break into itself if it were to bypass the timer for a default random pin. That is with bypassing the timer.. crazy hard. I don't know the key derivation on the Pixel though
19:16:59 <youpie12> I'll shrink down my pass
19:17:00 <cn3m[m]> it is probably close
19:17:15 <cn3m[m]> even if you bypassed the timer the PIN would not be trivial to break
19:17:29 <TheJollyRoger> youpie12: I prefer to use a word passphrase, but that's because I find them easier to memorize.
19:17:35 <cn3m[m]> which is a big if
19:17:39 <cn3m[m]> a really big if
19:17:50 <youpie12> I have avery bigg passphrase
19:17:54 <youpie12> 20 characters pass
19:18:09 <youpie12> But by knowing this ill cut down half
19:18:16 <TheJollyRoger> youpie12: size matters, but what matters more in this case, is secrecy, uniqueness, and difficulty of guessing.
19:18:32 <youpie12> Have random symbols and a random numebr
19:18:44 <TheJollyRoger> twenty characters' worth of passphrase accounts for zero security bits if it's your mother's maiden name and her year of birth.
19:18:51 <cn3m[m]> 10 even might be overkill if it is random
19:18:51 <youpie12> Use even longer password for ssd
19:19:17 <youpie12> Yeah i'll use an easier pass
19:19:19 <TheJollyRoger> Even though apparently password guesser thinks that that's ~65 bits if I enter it into the "password strength meter."
19:19:23 <youpie12> Logging in any time took so much effort
19:20:16 <youpie12> Someone any reccomendation to use instead of shelter, seems to not be working everytime i restart the pone fully i have to reinstall it.
19:20:17 <cn3m[m]> even with just upper, lower, and numbers a 10 character password would be very strong even with a timer bypass
19:20:20 <youpie12> Just noticed now again
19:20:44 <youpie12> So using a 8 digit code
19:20:46 <youpie12> Random
19:20:54 <youpie12> Would be already more than enoug
19:21:09 <youpie12> for no person to be able to get in to in a small timeframe
19:21:22 <cn3m[m]> <youpie12 "So using a 8 digit code"> yes, but if you had a timer bypass that would eventually fall
19:22:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's why the Titan has its own timer that's sealed within the chip and it only answers to its own timer.
19:22:05 <TheJollyRoger> Rather than the host's.
19:22:20 <TheJollyRoger> Two randomly selected words from the pocket edition of the Oxford English Dictionary would give you enough brute force resistance to last probably until well after the Earth gets swallowed by the Sun.
19:23:08 <TheJollyRoger> Since the pocket edition of the Oxford English dictionary has more than 50,000 words, that's more than 2.5 x 10^9 possible combinations.
19:23:24 <youpie12> Well eventually there will be a way to still access the data of the phone
19:23:56 <youpie12> With technology in 10 20 years i dont think the earth is swallowed then but we still dont know that much about computers
19:24:08 <cn3m[m]> the iPhone has key derivation of ~150ms with dedicated crypto hardware. The Titan M must be similar that is impressive
19:24:18 <cn3m[m]> that is of course with a timer bypass
19:24:27 <TheJollyRoger> youpie12: the good news is, the devs already gave thought to that.
19:24:42 <cn3m[m]> not enforced at all with hardware or software it is all math
19:24:55 <youpie12> Yeah math
19:25:01 <youpie12> Untill we discover another way
19:25:11 <youpie12> to achieve information from a computer
19:25:12 <cn3m[m]> derivation is very cool
19:25:20 <youpie12> untill we discover bats and rats instead of bits
19:25:28 <youpie12> Which already are there but we dont know
19:25:53 <TheJollyRoger> The cipher on disk is AES-256-HEH for the metadata and AES-256-XTS for your actual data. The cipher was designed to live for more than a century and although there is the possibility of a sufficiently powerful quantum computer being invented in the far future, Grover's Algorithm will only reduce the key strength by its square, which still leaves you with ~128 bit equivalency against a brute
19:25:55 <TheJollyRoger> force attack.
19:26:40 <cn3m[m]> 128bit AES is insanely overkill still imo
19:27:25 <cn3m[m]> it would need a flaw in the spec and an almost physically impossible quantum computer
19:27:36 <cn3m[m]> to get through that AES 256
19:29:14 <youpie12> thats what i mean with bats and rats we will discover the quantum pc and stuff and eventually get in all data in a completely data rich wor;ld
19:29:38 <cn3m[m]> most crypto is highly quantum resistant at this point
19:29:57 <youpie12> Yes and smoking cigarettes was considered healthy
19:30:05 <youpie12> once a time
19:30:49 <TheJollyRoger> youpie12 what are you trying to get us to say?
19:31:04 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to be frank here: what do you want to hear?
19:31:34 <youpie12> Nothing just sharing my not so important opinion
19:32:12 <cn3m[m]> there is really no better option(maybe marginally the secure enclave), but overall Titan M is basically our best option
19:34:44 <TheJollyRoger> What cn3m[m] said. If you start to bog yourself down in "what could happen" you're honestly never going to be satisfied. Security is a complex and nuanced topic, and simple answers to complex and nuanced topics don't tend to get you very far outside of giving you a warm and fuzzy feeling.
19:35:49 <youpie12> No i'm just sharing my opinion as in i dont think that we know enough now to be sure to not be able to not get hacked in 5 or 10 years. Overall i'm already satisfied with the answer that cellebrite cant get in the fking phone more than that i dont have any top nasa secret terrorist information
19:36:12 <youpie12> And i dont think my ''attacker'' would wanna spend more than 5k 10k to get in my phone
19:36:21 <youpie12> So for me i'm safe for what it is now
19:36:29 <TheJollyRoger> Of course.
19:36:58 <TheJollyRoger> Well, in three years, the Pixel 4 will end its support. What I would probably do then, would be to transfer all your data off to cold storage or back it up, then factory reset your phone once it becomes what we call a "pop tart."
19:37:22 <youpie12> I certanily only use it for chatting
19:37:29 <youpie12> No specific  data as photos or hwat
19:37:29 <youpie12> what
19:37:37 <TheJollyRoger> At that point, you can recycle it, or you can keep it as a souvenir.
19:37:55 <youpie12> Buut even with end of support
19:37:59 <youpie12> Will the chipset not be safe
19:38:14 <TheJollyRoger> We call old phones that are no longer supported "pop tarts" because they're useful for supplying energy, but not much else.
19:38:31 <TheJollyRoger> Kind of like how actual Kellog Pop Tarts are good at supplying calories, but they're about as nutricious as a slice of cardboard otherwise.
19:39:30 <youpie12> Well they add
19:39:34 <youpie12> Vitamins to it
19:39:40 <youpie12> Vitamin powder ;)
19:39:46 <TheJollyRoger> Ha! That's funny actually, I didn't know that XD
19:39:53 <youpie12> I didnt know either but recently saw
19:39:55 <youpie12> All these vitamins
19:39:58 <TheJollyRoger> That's hilarious.
19:40:00 <youpie12> But i dont think that my cholocate
19:40:01 <youpie12> breakfast
19:40:06 <youpie12> is helping me
19:40:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ack XD
19:47:58 <zugzwang[m]> <cn3m[m] "youpie12: they can't get into iO"> Its best to think that they can get into iphones or pixels. Cellebrite or Nso may have an os exploit to disable the delay timer.so the advice should be to use alphanumeric password cos i dont think the 4 digit passw is safe.
19:48:39 <cn3m[m]> <zugzwang[m] "Its best to think that they can "> the exploits they use is just attacking the OS so they bypass the lockscreen
19:48:45 <cn3m[m]> USB restricted mode on iOS and GrapheneOS are very effective
19:50:34 <youpie12> Anyone in here who uses some app cloner app that works everytime? Shelter doesnt wanna do the trick
19:51:30 <zugzwang[m]> <youpie12 "Anyone in here who uses some app"> There is a fork of island i read on github
19:51:38 <zugzwang[m]> Island is like shelter

19:52:14 <youpie12> this one?
19:52:18 <riotuser1993[m]> <cn3m[m] "USB restricted mode on iOS and G"> Apparently having to press enter once your password is ready rather than it automatically taking it once the correct amount of characters are entered is a big help as well

19:52:51 <zugzwang[m]> Thats island

19:53:21 <zugzwang[m]> The fork is maintained

20:00:37 <youpie12> Download from apk online?
20:00:43 <youpie12> Alrihgt
20:00:48 <youpie12> will do now thanks
20:01:05 <youpie12> Cant seem to remove
20:01:06 <youpie12> Shelter
20:01:13 <youpie12> Uninstall is greyed out
20:02:56 <youpie12> Can remove any othe app even the aurora store itself
20:06:07 <zugzwang[m]> <youpie12 "Uninstall is greyed out"> Cant uninstall from settings?
20:06:42 <youpie12> Nope but was able via aurora app
20:06:47 <youpie12> Think because of sandbox>?
20:08:24 <zugzwang[m]> <youpie12 "Download from apk online?"> Download it from fdroid
20:08:32 <zugzwang[m]> It should work
20:08:58 <zugzwang[m]> Sometimes you have to force close it when adding app into shelter
20:10:24 <youpie12> cant install because of unknownb error says fdroid
20:10:28 <youpie12> i restart sec
20:10:35 <zugzwang[m]> youpie12: best to use user profiles though  rather than shelter
20:10:53 <youpie12> I have 3 telegram acounts
20:10:55 <youpie12> Is hard to switch
20:11:02 <youpie12> And 3 whatsapp
20:11:10 <zugzwang[m]> Lol
20:11:38 <youpie12> Yeah.. using app cloner on my prior android was easier
20:11:59 <zugzwang[m]> Shelter is easy and works fine on graphene
20:12:19 <youpie12> Still doesnt wanna install from f droid store
20:12:23 <youpie12> Says unknown error while installing
20:12:26 <youpie12> Is there an apk availabel
20:12:30 <zugzwang[m]> Just sometimes have to force close it when its not sheltering apps
20:12:51 <zugzwang[m]> Have you installed on another profile shelter aswell?
20:14:53 <youpie12> Haveno other profiles i know of
20:21:54 <zugzwang[m]> Have you uninstalled it or just removed it from the homescreen
20:22:09 <youpie12> I went fdroid types in shelter
20:22:17 <youpie12> It found the shelter i installed from aurora
20:22:20 <youpie12> clikced uninstall
20:22:24 <youpie12> And restarted phone now click install
20:22:27 <youpie12> Still says unknown error
20:22:36 <youpie12> First time using f droid
20:23:12 <zugzwang[m]> Ok, when you used it from aurora
20:23:21 <youpie12> yees
20:23:24 <zugzwang[m]> What was the prbl
20:23:37 <zugzwang[m]> How wasnt functioning
20:23:39 <youpie12> app started
20:23:45 <youpie12> havent tried using 2 whatsapp
20:23:48 <youpie12> but the app worked
20:23:54 <youpie12> but after restrating
20:23:56 <youpie12> app wouldnt open
20:24:01 <youpie12> i had to reinstall
20:24:03 <youpie12> from aurora
20:24:28 <zugzwang[m]> Which app wouldnt open shelter or the cloned app
20:24:37 <youpie12> shelter itself
20:24:45 <youpie12> havent tried cloning any app yet
20:24:59 <zugzwang[m]> Hmm strange
20:25:15 <zugzwang[m]> Working fine for me
20:27:25 <youpie12> apk from site wouldnt install
20:28:35 <zugzwang[m]> Even from aurora should work as its the same one as from google play
20:29:30 <youpie12> Is there any way to see f droid errors
20:30:15 <zugzwang[m]> I know its stupid but Check under the all apps settingst to see  if you havent uninstalled it cos sometimes
20:30:49 <youpie12> yeah im stupid
20:30:55 <youpie12> but still uninstall is greyed out
20:31:13 <youpie12> it is gone from my app list
20:31:23 <youpie12> thats not in settings
20:32:25 <zugzwang[m]> youpie12: i said its stupid for me to suggest that cos sometimes i just remove apps from screen thinking i uninstalled them
20:32:48 <youpie12> i couldnt uninstall from settings
20:32:59 <youpie12> but i uninsylled via fdroid so thought
20:33:04 <youpie12> now ist gone from ap pscreen
20:33:27 <zugzwang[m]> What you mean STILL greyed out
20:34:19 <zugzwang[m]> You said you uninstalled it from aurora store
20:34:41 <youpie12> No if i go to settings
20:34:44 <youpie12> then apps and
20:34:46 <youpie12> shelter
20:34:53 <youpie12> the button uninstall it not possibel to click
20:34:55 <youpie12> greyed out
20:35:10 <youpie12> Yes uninstalled from store but its apparently
20:35:11 <youpie12> still in
20:35:13 <youpie12> settigns
20:35:25 <youpie12> even after restart
20:35:44 <zugzwang[m]> So you havent uninstalled it thats why you cant install it from fdroid
20:35:52 <youpie12> yep
20:36:39 <zugzwang[m]> Thats why the error on fdroid
20:37:15 <youpie12> yes im trying to find my way to uninstall it restarting phone again
20:37:22 <zugzwang[m]> Its nit recommended here adb but thats the only option to uninstall if its a corrupt install i think
20:37:40 <zugzwang[m]> Someone else can advise better if they know
20:38:21 <youpie12> when i iinstalled shelter it said if you use any custom rom you should click quit the app but i continued to click conttinue
20:38:25 <youpie12> might also be a reason for the issue
20:38:48 <zugzwang[m]> No its not that
20:38:49 <youpie12> As multiple people said shel;ter worked on grapehneos i though
20:38:59 <zugzwang[m]> It does
20:39:27 <zugzwang[m]> But under the apps notifications all apps and still cant uninstall?
20:39:41 <zugzwang[m]> Even drag to uninstall
20:42:13 <iocontr0l[m]> you need to remove it as an administrator first of all if you have enabled it.
20:42:24 <iocontr0l[m]> Then you need to goto serttings and remove work profile
20:42:36 <iocontr0l[m]> then and only then will Shelter uninstall
20:52:44 <youpie12> That did the trick
20:52:49 <youpie12> Now installing it again from fdroid
20:52:54 <youpie12> Creating new work profile
21:01:33 <youpie12> shelter is running but no main screen
21:01:39 <youpie12> It is supposed to be like that
21:02:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai
21:03:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Think you could help me get a device to support android-prepare-vendor?
21:04:27 <cdesai> Sure, should just work as long as you can feed it a factory image, there's an option to give a path to the image and skip download
21:04:42 <cdesai> But why? I'd justt use lineage extract tools
21:06:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai (@freenode_cdesai:matrix.org): lineage extract tools do firmware?
21:06:47 <cdesai> Not extraction afaik, but this doesn't do anything special for that either really.
21:07:07 <cdesai> Worth checking gerrit if you don't see it in the source.
21:10:41 <LinusSexTips[m]> Why would you want use Shelter?
21:10:48 <LinusSexTips[m]> I just make new user profiles
21:11:37 <cn3m[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "I just make new user profiles "> that is much more robust
21:12:00 <cn3m[m]> especially if you reboot before switching profiles
21:12:17 <cn3m[m]> then you have an anti cold boot attack and AFU attack on the other profiles
21:13:14 <LinusSexTips[m]> I usually reboot after switching. Is it better to do it before?
21:13:41 <LinusSexTips[m]> Oh sorry it lagged just saw the last line you sent
21:14:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't use shelter
21:14:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Use island
21:14:15 <cn3m[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "I usually reboot after switching"> yeah even if you get exploited in one profile it can't jump like it normally would
21:14:35 <cn3m[m]> multiple user profiles and rebooting before and after switching is ideal
21:15:22 <LinusSexTips[m]> OK I will start rebooting before as well. Phone is pretty quick actually doesn't take long
21:27:09 <strcat[m]> cdesai: maybe we can alter the build system to make an apk
21:27:11 <strcat[m]> instead of an app bundle
21:27:59 <cdesai> strcat[m]: it has been app bundle ever since trichrome launched right
21:29:39 <cdesai> I can/will look into this tomorrow
21:35:02 <strcat[m]> cdesai: yeah but we can prob generate apk instead
21:35:08 <strcat[m]> like monochrome and the other targets
21:35:27 <cdesai> Yeah good idea
21:35:35 <strcat[m]> might be simple, dunno
21:35:41 <strcat[m]> a lot of the build system is shared
21:35:48 <strcat[m]> might be simpler than it seems to do apk
21:35:55 <strcat[m]> most is templated
22:04:31 <broda721[m]> <cn3m[m] "multiple user profiles and reboo"> What are the implications if you dont reboot at all between switching user profiles? Does that make it significantly les secure? Lets say you have a main user, and a certain app you want seperated (like facebook). Does not rebooting before switching profiles undo/affect the isolation? Or is the rebooting mainly for physical risks. I have not found instructions on how to go
22:04:31 <broda721[m]> about user profile switching on the site/reddit
22:16:14 <zugzwang[m]> <broda721[m] "What are the implications if you"> I would think it has to do with logging off the profile so apps dont run on background after you switch profiles
22:54:17 <dazinism> broda721: zugzwang have a look at https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
22:58:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai:
23:19:24 <dazinism> <anupritaisno1[m] "Don't use shelter "> The shelter dev is working on it again. They got a test build out of the next release.
23:20:01 <dazinism> Thinking they'll probably be addressing the issues they talked to you about?
23:20:34 <dazinism> They also working on a new matrix client
23:21:28 <dazinism> *they got a release candidate out
23:21:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Peter is?
23:24:49 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: yeah, they also got a matrix room for shelter now...
23:25:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Send the link
23:25:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> I know him
23:26:19 <dazinism> #shelter:neo.angry.im
23:45:51 <dazinism> cn3m: thinking the AFU worries are addressed if apps keep data encrypted with Titan when screen is locked?
23:46:48 <dazinism> Pity not many do. Seen password stores and OTP apps
23:47:45 <dazinism> Be nice to have other apps notes, contacts....
23:48:15 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "cn3m: thinking the AFU worries a"> well if the key is in memory that is the issue
23:48:50 <cn3m[m]> there is nothing stopping you from fully owning and dumping a phone if you can exploit it while logged in
23:59:03 <dazinism> cn3m: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyProtection#isUnlockedDeviceRequired()
23:59:18 <dazinism> This is done by titan
23:59:31 <cn3m[m]> dazinism: thanks
