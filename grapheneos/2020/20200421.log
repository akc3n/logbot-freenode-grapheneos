00:00:32 <idanoo[m]> Oh boy, just realised the OEM Unlock toggle is greyed out on my Pixel 3
00:03:38 <nickcalyx[m]> Sometimes you have to let it connect to google over WiFi first
00:07:49 <brenneke[m]> What are you thoughts on the security of non open-source apps from Play Store - is it enough to restrict network permission to prevent apps from phoning home or is there more to the picture? I have an app called ColoNote for example that I used pre-GrapheneOS and really love and have yet to find an alternative that is as clean and functional. WPS Office is another.
00:08:01 <brenneke[m]> ColorNote
00:13:15 <madaidan[m]> Open source or not is irrelevant to an app's security. The network permission is not enough to prevent data exfiltration. It can be bypassed via IPC.
00:13:35 <brenneke[m]> IPC?
00:13:46 <JTL> inter process communication
00:13:59 <madaidan[m]> Apps can make other apps make connections for them.
00:15:22 <brenneke[m]> Ahhh....
00:19:02 <brenneke[m]> So nothing really safe then unless open-source and verified checked?
00:19:16 <renlord> wtf?
00:19:29 <renlord> this is not specific to android is it?
00:20:17 <JTL> renlord: I'm about to run, what's your question exactly?
00:20:21 <renlord> afaik, selinux would be stripping and auditing IPCs
00:20:49 <JTL> I think the android sandbox still allows forms of IPC between apps currently
00:21:03 <JTL> But you're right, not specific to Android
00:21:04 <renlord> sure, the intents and stuff would be using IPC
00:21:52 <renlord> at the very least ashmem is regulated using selinux in android and i've touched code that applies those selinux policies on specific appdomains
00:22:15 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "afaik, selinux would be strippin"> The apps are meant to be able to communicate with each other
00:22:25 <renlord> or ashmem access removed altogether.
00:22:27 <madaidan[m]> This is exactly how things like the download manager works
00:23:08 <JTL> (see also side channels)
00:30:06 <renlord> madaidan[m]: you suggest that there's nothing the host os can do about malicious apps
00:31:15 <renlord> but we can potentially write up a really closed appdomain that can block most/if not all IPC for an app if the user thinks that the app should not be using IPC.
00:35:26 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "madaidan.: you suggest that ther"> That's not what I'm suggesting at all.
00:35:43 <renlord> madaidan[m]: i apologise for misrepresenting your intentions then.
00:35:50 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "but we can potentially write up "> I know. There's even an issue on github about this.
00:40:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy shipmates!
00:41:15 <renlord> TheJollyRoger: hi
00:41:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr
00:56:53 * idanoo[m] uploaded an image: image.png (7KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/riot.kiwi/hWUPHfIJYAIUPTWgSetpjedP >
00:57:04 <idanoo[m]> Aaaaah looks like Im' screwed.
00:58:38 <idanoo[m]> Unless anyone knows a magic way to OEM Unlock a verizon model Pixel 3 :(
00:58:41 <cx2[m]> swappa.com
01:05:58 <renlord> lol
01:06:30 <brenneke[m]> Is there any way to see what apps are phoning home to check the tightness of one's setup......Wireshark or the like?
01:06:48 <bseeinu[m]> pihole dns
01:07:11 <bseeinu[m]> setup a dns resolver and query the logs
01:08:02 <rutxonboard[m]> > setup a dns resolver and query the logs
01:08:03 <rutxonboard[m]> Doesn't work. Apps can work around that
01:24:50 <TheJollyRoger> idanoo[m]: Sorry to hear that :(. You'll probably have to return it. Or if you want to contribute to the project, you could use it to run the Compatibility Test Suite.
01:25:13 <TheJollyRoger> Since we need results from both a phone running the factory operating system, one running GrapheneOS, and one more running AOSP.
01:27:15 <idanoo[m]> Unfortunately we never sold the pixel 3's here in New Zealand so bought off a friend of a friend, I'm tempted to grab another one because this one has a slightly cracked screen.
01:27:15 <idanoo[m]> Yeah I'll look into that
01:28:07 <TheJollyRoger> If you'd like to know how to use the CTS, I can walk you through it. Oh yeah. Ah crap. I gotta get the docs on that done. That's two ahahaha. Sorry. XP.
01:28:55 <TheJollyRoger> The long story short with the CTS, you just leave a phone plugged in and it'll have some media on it, and then the computer will run various tests on it. It just needs to be propped up in a well lit area.
01:29:19 <idanoo[m]> Ah cool, I'll check it out a bit later. Shouldn't have any problems with it üëçÔ∏è
01:29:45 <idanoo[m]> I did try all of the tricks to OEM Unlock.. but nothing works because I'm on latest security patches D:
01:30:12 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome ^_^.
01:30:20 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome on the first and -- ah shoot on the latter :(
01:30:51 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, that's a big problem :(. Exploits to unlock the bootloader generally are known to stop working the moment the firmware is updated. It's really sad that Verizon and co insist on doing this >_<.
01:31:49 <idanoo[m]> Yep! There are some really cheap pixel 3/3a's available on our local buy and sell pages. Very very tempting if I can get one. Going to disable the play services service and see what stuff breaks for now
01:32:25 <TheJollyRoger> Most stuff shouldn't break or can be switched off. It may nag you incessantly about Play Services being missing, athough most of these notifications can be ignored.
01:32:30 <TheJollyRoger> Or hidden.
01:32:54 <M0xC0ncord[m]> I'm paranoid enough to avoid buying a used one. Used phones these days are like used bedsheets. You don't know what kind of germs you'll find in them.
01:33:04 * TheJollyRoger laughs
01:33:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, literally with viruses being able to surivive on most surfaces for several days!
01:33:44 <idanoo[m]> Ha! Yeah most of the ones locally are new and sealed.. but not keen to gamble on it being a non-verizon
01:34:07 * TheJollyRoger readies the disinfectant wipes.
01:37:08 <JTL> I think copper is good for killing germs
01:37:18 <JTL> I should see if I still have some copper mesh handy
01:38:09 <bigtree[m]> hi
01:39:21 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
01:40:36 <bigtree[m]> can someone tell me will it come for pixel 4
01:41:36 <TheJollyRoger> It'll come when the community will step up and make the existing devices we have sustainable, before new ones arrive.
01:41:47 <bigtree[m]> ?
01:43:01 <TheJollyRoger> At this moment we need more maintainers to step forward and share the workload. The lead developer is very badly overworked, so either some devices will need to be dropped, or the community will need to step up to contribute to pull their weight.
01:44:14 <TheJollyRoger> It's a lot of work to support a new device; to do it properly requires a large amount of device-specific coding and testing, implementing device-specific security hardening and exploit mitigations and testing it, etc... right now we need someone who's able to commit to three years of full time work to get that done.
01:44:35 <TheJollyRoger> Either that, or the community will need to step up and hire another developer to make that happen.
01:45:00 <bigtree[m]> <TheJollyRoger "It'll come when the community wi"> I use pixel 3xl and it looks stable
01:45:14 <TheJollyRoger> bigtree[m]: because there's a maintainer for it.
01:46:06 <JTL> No new devices until morale improves
01:46:08 <JTL> Arr
01:46:18 <JTL> Where "morale" = community work
01:47:03 <TheJollyRoger> bigtree[m]: you can use a pixel 3XL stably because you're constantly being saved and rescued by a dedicated maintainer and lead developer who's poured his life's work into giving you that software and making it work.
01:47:19 <TheJollyRoger> We don't have one of those for the 4 or 4XL.
01:47:37 <idanoo[m]> Maybe I should get a 4 ;)
01:47:47 <JTL> He doesn't have the time to do that, plous the Pixel 4, plus general OS work
01:47:52 <idanoo[m]> Not really impressed with it compared to the 3 though
01:48:24 <JTL> That's my theory as for another reason why no one else is supporting it
01:48:33 <JTL> It's a pretty "meh" device in the grand scheme of things imo
01:49:08 <TheJollyRoger> I don't like to spread rumours but... I believe that the reason why the project is more interested in getting maintainers for the devices /we have/ and making that work out now is to avoid the "dumping problem."
01:49:25 <JTL> Agreed
01:49:35 <TheJollyRoger> Where the moment a new device is released, the maintainer vanishes with their shiny new phone, and simply dumps the responsibility on the other members of the project.
01:49:55 <JTL> That happens alot with Lineage and other "ROM" projects
01:50:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:51:52 <TheJollyRoger> If your objective is "just make the darn thing boot" then that's fairly easy in the grand scheme of things. However, to actually do a *full* port of the operating system to the handset with security and privacy properties that will meet (let alone exceed) the security and privacy properties of the commercially supported operating system actually requires a *lot* of work, potentially around the
01:51:54 <TheJollyRoger> equivalent of one or more people committed to maintaining the device full time.
01:52:48 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS *will not* halfass support there, it's either going to be done properly, or not done at all.
01:53:23 <TheJollyRoger> And by "committed to maintaining the device full time" that means "an ongoing commitment for the next three years."
01:53:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <JTL "I think copper is good for killi"> Current virus lasts on copper longer than most "germs", not to go off-topic further üòú
01:54:25 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. maybe I'll have to open up a GrapheneOS-offtopic channel, I'll send in a request.
01:54:35 <JTL> DannyWorkOrderPr: I'm aware
01:54:49 <JTL> hence "I think"
01:56:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> And it's more "can't stay alive as well/reproduce" than "kills" sort of situation =]
01:56:37 <TheJollyRoger> So, this is partially why at this moment the project's keener to find support for /what we have/ before we get new ones. If a device gets dumped, what are we going to tell the users, when we don't have the maintainers to keep their devices secure? I can speak PR speak (kinda) but that's not what this is about.
01:56:38 <JTL> :|
01:56:40 <JTL> right
01:56:56 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Agreed
01:57:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
02:01:45 <TheJollyRoger> So... if you'd like the Pixel 4 supported, please pitch in to help, the more people we have that can take some amount of load off Daniel's back, the better off the entire project will be and the more likely it can grow.
02:02:44 <TheJollyRoger> And the more it grows... then the chances of it being able to expand out into other things and support more devices and include new features start looking better.
02:15:02 <rutxonboard[m]> > Heh. maybe I'll have to open up a GrapheneOS-offtopic channel, I'll send in a request.
02:15:02 <rutxonboard[m]> Could be interesting
02:19:58 <d-rav[m]> I‚Äôm interested in contributing to the project. I plan on getting a Pixel 3a in a couple weeks. However, I‚Äôm a front-end dev and I‚Äôve never worked with anything Android-related before. Do you have any recommended resources apart from the GOS website to bring oneself up to speed enough to contribute?
02:25:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hi d-rav[m], Android is somewhat documented, there's some documentation available directly from Google themselves at https://developer.android.com/guide. I think that's probably the first place that I would want to check in terms of getting familiar with the design of Android.
02:56:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> The only documentation I looked at was webview, and the object oriented code was so spaghetti that I think Java should be called "Noodle-oriented" programming.
02:56:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> Inheritance is shit.
05:54:53 <Biv[m]> I like oop :(
05:55:38 <Biv[m]> idanoo: ask seller to check imei
05:55:49 <Biv[m]> that's what I did
05:56:03 <idanoo[m]> That's a great idea, is that the whole 35 vs 39 or whatever
05:56:17 <Biv[m]> no clue but there are online tools you can use
05:56:47 <Biv[m]> I just linked it to my seller along with instructions for identifying google store devices
05:57:06 <idanoo[m]> Ah yeah, I can use googles repair thing and it returns _vz if it's verison
05:57:09 <Biv[m]> works better on eBay with big used phone sellers cuz they record the imei in a spreadsheet
05:57:23 <Biv[m]> or similar
05:57:30 <Biv[m]> also less messaging required
05:57:47 <Biv[m]> seller was happy to do it if it meant immediately selling a device
05:58:07 <idanoo[m]> It's annoying because there's no private message on our website, and they're not going to post the IMEI publically
05:58:36 <Biv[m]> EBay then?
05:59:00 <Biv[m]> I bought from thegizmotrader and they had one other pixel 2 if that was what you were looking for
05:59:11 <Biv[m]> pixel 2 xl*
05:59:25 <Biv[m]> didn't really ask about any other phones
05:59:26 <idanoo[m]> Shipping at the moment to NZ is going to be nightmare haha. Plus this Pixel 3 I'm looking at is US$239
05:59:34 <Biv[m]> oh gotcha
05:59:45 <Biv[m]> pixel 3 wasn't worth it to me for the extra money spent
06:00:16 <Biv[m]> more support is nice I guess but eh
06:00:26 <idanoo[m]> I wouldn't mind trying a 3a, but they're more expensive here.. :/
06:01:11 <idanoo[m]> Anyway thanks for your help!
06:04:10 <Biv[m]> no problem
06:04:17 <Biv[m]> man who would have thought other countries existed other than the USA /s
06:05:15 <JTL> Buncha people in here are from Canada
06:05:18 <JTL> lol
06:05:25 <JTL> Canada does not exist /s
06:06:54 <idanoo[m]> Hooold up

06:07:22 <idanoo[m]> I've asked for the IMEI anyway
06:49:30 <joshman[m]> Folks, who had luck ripping persistent notifications through adb? I have signal background synchronization notification which irritates me so much
06:51:28 <joshman[m]> * Folks, who had luck ripping persistent notifications through adb? I have this Signal background synchronization notification which irritates me so much
06:54:03 <dextr[m]> remove the other option from the notification and it will disappear
06:55:57 <joshman[m]> The deal breaker is if you toggle "Other" off you no longer see active call notification leaving me blind while having a conversation
06:57:26 <joshman[m]> Not having seconds counter is another down side. But I can live what that
06:57:39 <dextr[m]> ah kk didn't know that - new to all the w/o google stuff
06:58:09 <joshman[m]> Yeah. Cons having unggogled stuff
08:49:52 <hitchhooker[m]> Damn. Cant use banks 2FA app on GOS. I guess hmalloc spots memory bug in app
08:51:29 <rutxonboard[m]> > Damn. Cant use banks 2FA app on GOS. I guess hmalloc spots memory bug in app
08:51:29 <rutxonboard[m]> Wow.. do they have a bug bounty?
08:51:55 <JTL> If it doesn't directly lead to an exploit I doubt they'll care tbh
08:52:10 <JTL> hitchhooker[m]: If you get a logcat dump I'm pretty certain that'll help narrow down the issue
08:52:21 <JTL> I'd be willing to assist if you'd like
08:56:46 <rutxonboard[m]> Quick question
08:56:50 <rutxonboard[m]> Are root certs per profile?
08:57:02 <hitchhooker[m]> Sure, how is the dump exported?
08:57:14 <JTL> Saved to a file
08:57:28 <JTL> (I'm going soon so I can't help right now)
08:57:42 <hitchhooker[m]> Aight.
08:57:57 <JTL> If you have the Android SDK tools installed and know how to use adb, you're already half of the way there
08:59:22 <hitchhooker[m]> Ah, need to usb debug and adb logcat?
09:00:11 <JTL> Yeah
09:00:24 <JTL> I'm going now and I'll be back within a day or so at most
09:03:36 <JTL> hitchhooker[m]: In addition, if you don't mind telling me the name of the bank I might be able to test with an emulator instance of the OS
09:03:45 <JTL> (won't be able to login into account though)
09:03:53 <JTL> so if it fails after login, can't help there
09:04:21 <hitchhooker[m]> Nordea Codes
09:04:34 <JTL> hitchhooker[m]: I thought it was possible to take logcat on device, but that requires root lol
09:04:42 <hitchhooker[m]> Crashes before that
09:04:49 <JTL> right
09:04:58 <JTL> ah finland?
09:05:50 <hitchhooker[m]> In start
09:05:55 <JTL> Gotcha
09:06:18 <hitchhooker[m]> adb aint recognising device :/
09:06:24 <hitchhooker[m]> Any trick for that?
09:06:29 <JTL> Nevermind that
09:06:35 <JTL> I'm seeing if I can reproduce the crash on my end
09:06:47 <JTL> Willing to try before I go :)
09:10:55 <hitchhooker[m]> Yeah no id why adb wont find device
09:12:41 <JTL> Wait, on your device, do you get stuck at the blue "Nordea" start screen, or does something else happen?
09:16:03 <hitchhooker[m]> https://pastebin.com/ns2nisJb
09:17:03 <JTL> looing at it now
09:17:09 <JTL> Disable ADB when your done btw
09:17:53 <hitchhooker[m]> Sorry about lines, MS too focused in telemetry to create usable terminal
09:18:08 <JTL> I'm trying to clean it up myself with some regex
09:23:58 <rutxonboard[m]> Windows ew
09:24:28 <JTL> I thought the new Windows 10 terminal was better?
09:25:13 <rutxonboard[m]> It's dramatically better
09:25:39 <rutxonboard[m]> You actually can maximize
09:25:48 <hitchhooker[m]> Still terrible
09:25:49 <JTL> WOAH
09:25:51 <JTL> lol
09:26:34 <hitchhooker[m]> pastebin.com/FkdjYBdt
09:27:15 <JTL> Yeah I fixed your dump with regex
09:27:17 <JTL> :D
09:27:46 <hitchhooker[m]> Seg fault
09:28:00 <JTL> Yup I see that
09:28:10 <JTL> so it does look it's hardened_malloc exposing a issue
09:28:13 <JTL> Good to know
09:28:45 <JTL> hitchhooker[m]: Incidentally, it looks like the banking app was detecting my emulator and crashing in a different way
09:28:47 <JTL> heh
09:29:09 <JTL> Should be able to fix the emulator detection with enough work, but that's for another "rainy day"
09:29:24 <antranigv> hey all :)
09:29:32 <JTL> Good day
09:30:48 <hitchhooker[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tas0O586t80
09:31:15 <antranigv> I am having a hard time deciding wether to choose GrapheneOS or LineageOS. my main preority is google-lessness and then OS hardening. can you guys give me a direction? :)
09:31:45 <antranigv> oh and my device is Pixel 2.
09:32:39 <rutxonboard[m]> > I am having a hard time deciding wether to choose GrapheneOS or LineageOS. my main preority is google-lessness and then OS hardening. can you guys give me a direction? :)
09:32:39 <rutxonboard[m]> GrapheneOS is sustainably better
09:32:42 <rutxonboard[m]> For many reasons
09:33:31 <rutxonboard[m]> There are so many issues with Lineage and privacy/security I'm not even sure where to start
09:34:08 <rutxonboard[m]> Beside saying Lineage breaks almost everything and lacks a lot of key features for both. Compared to stock with gapps disabled even
09:39:19 <antranigv> I understand
09:39:22 <antranigv> one more question then
09:39:34 <antranigv> I see that it says "Pixel 2 (legacy)", as in, it will not be supported anymore?
09:42:20 <hitchhooker[m]> Might be dropped due the lack of community support for device
09:42:48 <antranigv> I see, well I will install anyway, and will wait until there's a new Pixel device.
09:42:53 <hitchhooker[m]> Interested becoming maintainer for pixel2?
09:43:14 <antranigv> unfortunatly I'm being attacked very often, and now moving back to FreeBSD + some phone device
09:43:17 <antranigv> actually, I am
09:44:00 <antranigv> I'll start by downloading and installing.
09:44:24 <hitchhooker[m]> Awesome :)
09:45:46 <fll[m]> "legacy" is a tag to indicate that there is not that much life left in the device. Firmware updates by the manufacturer are only guaranteed until Oct 2020 and when they drop it GraheneOS will drop it as well. Also legacy devices will be the first to drop if development resources are not increasing
09:46:26 <hitchhooker[m]> Pixel2 hardware aint supported for much longer by google but if device finds new maintainer there might be possibility for some respiration :)
09:48:29 <antranigv> So what's the best device to get (or to wait) in 2020?
09:50:11 <rutxonboard[m]> > So what's the best device to get (or to wait) in 2020?
09:50:11 <rutxonboard[m]> Wait. I think the 4a is going to eat dirt fighting the SE and go on sale very quickly. If someone does the dev work the 4a will be a good one
09:50:39 <rutxonboard[m]> Pixel 4a will be pretty awesome deal by October when you have to replace the 2
09:51:13 <cx2[m]> was going to say almost the exact same thing.
09:51:26 <fll[m]> Because of lack of contributors no new devices are being added right now. So the best is a 3a device, since they have the longest guaranteed firmware update time ahead and also should be the cheapest device
09:52:55 <fll[m]> But if you already have a 2 you might as well use it until updates stop
09:52:57 <rutxonboard[m]> Sure, but hold on to the 2 until it is dropped if you already have it
09:53:01 <rutxonboard[m]> The 4a could be supported by then you never know
09:53:37 <rutxonboard[m]> The 2 isn't that bad hardware security wise. It's a huge step up. Not iPhone tier like the 3 series but it is very good
09:58:05 <antranigv> good, good.
10:04:30 <kohntree[m]> What are the threat model questions to consider when picking between a GrapheneOS phone and an iPhone? For security and privacy of course. I've heard them thrown around as the same and used them both.
10:04:35 <kohntree[m]> As equivalent*
10:11:02 <antranigv> kohntree[m]: in my case, because of my work, it happens that some private companies and even govts might try to hack, I chose an iPhone for that reason, but turns out, 1) macOS is VERY hard to audit and 2) iPhone is impossible to audit. in case of open-source Android at least I can a) view network sockets and processes running b) be able to do forensics if needed.
10:12:05 <antranigv> and I will be moving from macOS to FreeBSD as well, just saving some money to buy a proper laptop.
10:14:41 <antranigv> ideally I'd want to break out of Apple's ecosystem, but I invested too much (MBP, phone, watch, etc). maybe I'll keep the iPhone for photography, but that's it.
10:17:35 <rutxonboard[m]> > and I will be moving from macOS to FreeBSD as well, just saving some money to buy a proper laptop.
10:17:35 <rutxonboard[m]> That's a terrible idea on so many levels. FreeBSD and friends have terrible security and absolutely no security model for a desktop
10:18:21 <antranigv> rutxonboard[m]: out-of-the-box: yes. but I will be running HardenedBSD on my laptop
10:18:25 <cx2[m]> arch?
10:18:36 <rutxonboard[m]> You give up verified boot, you give up sane userland sandboxing, you give up a commonly audited OS, you give up a system that is designed to minimize trust
10:18:43 <antranigv> I can't handle Linux, with all the systemds and puleaudios and BT stacks, etc
10:18:45 <rutxonboard[m]> > rutxonboard: out-of-the-box: yes. but I will be running HardenedBSD on my laptop
10:18:45 <rutxonboard[m]> That's no good either
10:19:03 <antranigv> what about OpenBSD?
10:19:27 <rutxonboard[m]> OpenBSD arguably is the worst for desktop
10:19:37 <antranigv> why?
10:19:42 <rutxonboard[m]> There's no serious option right now beside macOS sadly
10:19:53 <rutxonboard[m]> > why?
10:19:53 <rutxonboard[m]> Terrible mitigations and no sandbox
10:20:12 <rutxonboard[m]> OpenBSD is a security nightmare on a laptop much like all the other BSDs
10:20:21 <antranigv> but OpenBSD has the best mitigations, according to Theo :P
10:20:47 <rutxonboard[m]> > but OpenBSD has the best mitigations, according to Theo :P
10:20:47 <rutxonboard[m]> Haha no they are really really bad
10:20:55 <rutxonboard[m]> Linux also has a slew of issued
10:20:58 <rutxonboard[m]> Issues*
10:21:51 <rutxonboard[m]> If you are really worried about corporate espionage or state sponsored attacks you really can't beat macOS
10:22:02 <rutxonboard[m]> It's not even close
10:22:35 <rutxonboard[m]> ChromeOS wins in some ways and loses in others, but the lack of privacy is very bad. macOS balances the privacy and security very well
10:23:22 <antranigv> I mean I like the new trusted boot stuff of macOS
10:23:47 <rutxonboard[m]> macOS isn't perfect by a long shot and most experts will recommend an iPad Pro as a laptop if security and privacy is the top concern
10:24:19 <rutxonboard[m]> > I mean I like the new trusted boot stuff of macOS
10:24:19 <rutxonboard[m]> It's not just that, macOS has a lot of good security features you don't see
10:25:37 <rutxonboard[m]> It's not comparable to iOS or GrapheneOS, but seriously if you have a Mac already there's no reason to leave it. It's really unmatched, beside maybe ChromeOS
10:26:13 <cx2[m]> is there an ungoogled chromeOS
10:26:44 <antranigv> cx2[m]: yes, ChromeiumOS
10:26:54 <antranigv> rutxonboard[m]: in that case, I'll keep my mac for a while :))
10:27:12 <rutxonboard[m]> > is there an ungoogled chromeOS
10:27:13 <rutxonboard[m]> Yes, but it's crap. No verified boot, no persistence, and it's out of date
10:27:39 <cx2[m]> Just make sure you're hardening it with CCleaner and Avast products
10:28:17 <rutxonboard[m]> > rutxonboard: in that case, I'll keep my mac for a while :))
10:28:17 <rutxonboard[m]> Definitely a good idea. Personally I would keep the iPhone if you already have a Mac since it means someone can use Linux and Darwin family exploits if you have both macOS and Graphene it does raise your attack surface
10:28:33 <rutxonboard[m]> I love Graphene, but if your use case is as serious as you suggest
10:28:49 <rutxonboard[m]> It's probably best to stay as you are
10:29:44 <cx2[m]>  * Just make sure you're hardening it with CCleaner and Avast products
10:29:44 <cx2[m]> just so we are clear..... totally not serious
10:30:24 <rutxonboard[m]> First thing I did on my Pixel with Graphene was sideload Avast. I do feel safe now /s
10:31:18 <cx2[m]> Whew... good call. Glad to have you with us smart people
10:32:40 <antranigv> as far as I know, russians are trying to hack me, that's why I installed Kaspersky!
10:32:54 <kohntree[m]> No antivirus is bad, I use a Bittium phone and I'm totally secure. /s
10:33:10 <kohntree[m]> It's so secure I even will get Android 10 soon!
10:33:34 <cx2[m]> <antranigv "as far as I know, russians are t"> Jason, save some pussy for the rest of us.
10:34:12 <rutxonboard[m]> > It's so secure I even will get Android 10 soon!
10:34:12 <rutxonboard[m]> For the low low price of $1.5k. For essentially a Pixel 3a running a crappy cut down version of GrapheneOS
10:34:53 <dextr[m]> wtf is a bittium phone?
10:35:05 <antranigv> okay, trying to install now.
10:35:40 <rutxonboard[m]> It's literally a Pixel running graphene, but a little worse in everyway
10:35:50 <antranigv> "You can either update the device via over-the-air updates or sideload a full update, which for Pixel phones can be obtained from the full update package page.
10:35:58 <rutxonboard[m]> For the low low price for 1.5Gs
10:36:11 <rutxonboard[m]> But it is an ugly Pixel
10:36:14 <antranigv> how should I know if mine is early or not? lol
10:36:19 <rutxonboard[m]> With a homemade Titan competitior
10:36:47 <rutxonboard[m]> It's so bad it's funny
10:37:53 <antranigv> I still do not understand, before the "Obtaining fastboot" step, do I need to do anything?
10:37:54 <rutxonboard[m]> There is literally no good reason to get it over any Pixel or any iPhone
10:39:37 <rutxonboard[m]> The best part is the features they brag about. The disk is encrypted, we have verified boot, chip to store credentials
10:40:15 <rutxonboard[m]> I legitimately would trust Samsung more than Bittium. The only cool thing is they have workspaces that cleanly merges profiles into the launcher
10:42:01 <rutxonboard[m]> They also brag about rollback protection and a permissions system
10:44:11 <rutxonboard[m]> It disables debugging interfaces. If they want to look incompetent they have done a great job
10:44:22 <rutxonboard[m]> There's nothing special
10:44:27 <antranigv> okay so now OEM is unlocked
10:44:37 <antranigv> now I'm downloading the latest image for Pixel 2
10:44:46 <strcat[m]> we're probably going to need to skip the Pixel 4 because it's a long time since it came out and people still aren't interested in stepping up to help
10:45:12 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a probably not going to be supported either because it doesn't appear people want new generation devices with better security supported
10:45:28 <rutxonboard[m]> So the 4a does have better security?
10:45:46 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 and 4a are a newer generation with various security improvements
10:45:56 <strcat[m]> it would have made sense to support them if we had developers to do it
10:45:59 <rutxonboard[m]> I thought it didn't really move the needle. I haven't looked enough though the 4 was very boring
10:46:00 <strcat[m]> we don't
10:46:18 <strcat[m]> rutxonboard: it didn't make things better
10:46:34 <strcat[m]> it's not supported by GrapheneOS because the community hasn't provided much support for the project
10:46:57 <antranigv> great, my phone is stuck, it says "no command"
10:47:02 <strcat[m]> normally we would want to support each new devices for each generation
10:47:08 <rutxonboard[m]> > great, my phone is stuck, it says "no command"
10:47:08 <rutxonboard[m]> It's in recovery
10:47:15 <strcat[m]> antranigv: it's not stuck and it sounds like you aren't following the official installation instructions
10:47:28 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install nothing elser
10:47:32 <strcat[m]>  * follow https://grapheneos.org/install nothing else
10:48:42 <trampleheft[m]> Grapheme rulz
10:48:56 <antranigv> strcat[m]: I'm still unable to understand most of the stuff phone related
10:49:29 <rutxonboard[m]> > strcat: I'm still unable to understand most of the stuff phone related
10:49:29 <rutxonboard[m]> What step are you on exactly?
10:49:32 <strcat> don't know what you mean but all I can say is that if you try to follow instructions from elsewhere you should expect problems
10:50:19 <antranigv> nah I'm not using any other instructions
10:50:29 <rutxonboard[m]> > normally we would want to support each new devices for each generation
10:50:29 <rutxonboard[m]> Right. I think the hardest thing is with how expensive phones are you can't afford having a dev device too
10:50:29 <antranigv> rutxonboard[m]: "Unlocking the bootloader"
10:50:46 <strcat> rutxonboard[m]: I can afford to buy each generation of devices
10:50:49 <rutxonboard[m]> I haven't made ROMs in years between that and data caps
10:50:53 <strcat> I don't have time to support them
10:51:00 <rutxonboard[m]> No I mean people helping
10:51:03 <strcat> I won't be adding support for new devices - ever
10:51:10 <strcat> other people are going to need to do it
10:51:18 <strcat> if other people don't step up to help, the project will be wrapped up
10:51:23 <rutxonboard[m]> I fully understand that
10:51:25 <strcat> it's a collaborative open source project
10:51:49 <strcat> eventually I'm going to move on and there has to be a community in place that carries it on
10:52:12 <rutxonboard[m]> As it should be, it's more of a research project than a tool for the masses
10:52:16 <strcat> people expecting they can rely on me for everything rather than people stepping up and forming a development team are very wrong
10:52:18 <rutxonboard[m]> Right now at least
10:53:02 <strcat> only because of lack of support / contributions
10:53:11 <strcat> a lot more people trying to cause harm than helping
10:55:55 <trampleheft[m]> <strcat "eventually I'm going to move on "> üò¢
11:01:05 <cx2[m]> So, I'm more of a direct person. So I'll say this. quite obviously there are a fair amount of people interested in GrapheneOS. I would further assess that if those same people have any sort of coding capability (and of course if lives up to your standard), that a good bit of them would contribute. So it seems theres a lack of coding knowledge from what I am understanding.
11:01:17 <antranigv> so how many people are part of this project?
11:02:06 <antranigv> "fastboot: error: Cannot generate image for userdata"
11:02:09 <antranigv> :((
11:02:13 <rutxonboard[m]> > so how many people are part of this project?
11:02:13 <rutxonboard[m]> 2
11:02:57 <antranigv> I'm guessing one of them is strcat[m] ?
11:04:03 <rutxonboard[m]> > I'm guessing one of them is strcat ?
11:04:03 <rutxonboard[m]> Yes he's full time and renlord is part time. They do the vast majority the work on the project. Correct me if I'm wrong
11:04:20 <antranigv> okay seems like a TMPDIR issue, I'll create another tmp directory outside of /tmp
11:05:44 <antranigv> yea well, if this works for me, I'll make sure to donate monthly at least.
11:06:49 <rutxonboard[m]> > yea well, if this works for me, I'll make sure to donate monthly at least.
11:06:49 <rutxonboard[m]> Donate on GitHub if you can they are matching for almost a year still
11:07:32 <antranigv> ah fuck, still issues
11:07:36 <antranigv> not a TMP issue for sure
11:07:57 <cx2[m]> Another way to Support would be througn donations. Something I have personally done (a relatively decent amount I might add), but admitedly, I have no idea $1.00 provices, supports. Perhaps providing a sort of breakdown of what it would cost to do *x*... or we need to reach these goals by this point....something tangible, that the GrapheneOS user/fan/family base can move toward.
11:07:57 <cx2[m]> But to be frank, the defeatist mentality is a bit off putting. I am wildly appreciative of the project, and would love to help in anyway that I personnaly can. I don't doubt that I likely speak for a lot of people in this regard. But on a public channel, threatening, "without support this project is going to be wrapped up..." certainly isnt the answer.
11:07:57 <cx2[m]> I am all for solutions, and couldn't make me happier to help find them, rather than the oposite.
11:08:18 <cx2[m]>  * Another way to Support would be througn donations.

11:08:50 <rutxonboard[m]> Depends. Adding a content blocker to Graphene is probably not an insanely advanced project. Writing a device manager could be a little tricky to do well. You don't have to be the world's best coder. Just prepare to make a lot of mistakes
11:10:03 <dallemon[m]> antranigv: it could definitely be an issue with TMP. when i was first installing and it does all the unzipping and downloading then my 8gb TMP was not enough
11:11:17 * rutxonboard[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/bpVYzaZPLyLuoLHVnWLzaOuO >
11:11:27 <strcat> cx2[m]: it's not a 'defeatist mentality' it's a clear statement about the reality
11:11:32 <antranigv> ah never mind, the extFS tools were missing
11:11:37 <strcat> I'm optimistic that people will finally start stepping up to make substantial contributions
11:11:45 <antranigv> I installed it from macports, now let's try again
11:11:48 <strcat> if they don't, things will be wrapped up, which is not what I expect to happen
11:12:19 <strcat> what I expect is that people start making substantial contributions and EVERY DAY that it doesn't happen, it makes me disappointed and upset, because I'm being let down
11:12:40 <antranigv> how about donating 1 USD every day?
11:12:43 <antranigv> :P
11:12:55 <strcat> if I didn't think it was going to happen I would have stopped a long time ago, I continue on only because I think the community will do better
11:13:12 <strcat> at the moment, we lack the resources to make much use of donations
11:13:17 <antranigv> I honestly think it would be nice if you have some kind of legal representation, like Graphene Foundation
11:13:22 <strcat> there are also some problems with receiving donations
11:13:27 <antranigv> hmm
11:13:45 <strcat> donations aren't a magical solution to the issue of lack of developers / support
11:13:48 <strcat> need people to do things
11:13:53 <strcat> money doesn't get anything done by itself
11:14:00 <strcat> need people to make use of it and the project doesn't have that
11:14:25 <antranigv> like, hiring developers?
11:14:28 <strcat> so for example donations can be used to buy devices for developers, or workstations, debug cable materials, etc.
11:14:33 <antranigv> or givng grants
11:14:43 <strcat> antranigv: hiring developers is not very realistic atm and who would hire them?
11:15:09 <antranigv> yea seems like you will need a whole infrastucture for that.
11:15:32 <strcat> the way this usually works for collaborative open source projects is that companies using the project hire developers to work on it
11:15:38 <strcat> the project itself does not hire developers
11:15:59 <strcat> look at collaborative open source projects like the linux kernel, openssl or many others
11:16:54 <strcat> GrapheneOS is an independent project and isn't going to be strongly tied to a company again, and it isn't going to be a company itself, at most there would be a non-profit foundation
11:17:02 <strcat> and it's not clear what advantages a non-profit would actually offer atm
11:17:06 <strcat> beyond a bunch of extra work to deal with that
11:17:09 <strcat> and costs
11:17:23 <strcat> who would manage it?
11:17:36 <strcat> what problems would it solve?
11:20:07 <antranigv> strcat: what would you want people to do? like, work on the code? help port things? improve performance? anything specific in mind?
11:20:24 <renlord> antranigv: check the os issue tracker.
11:20:29 <renlord> heaps to do
11:20:47 <strcat> development, maintenance, porting, testing, debugging, resolving issues
11:21:02 <strcat> on many different sub-projects and the OS itself
11:21:18 <renlord> what a bizarre issue, just changed my gpu today and i had to pass some kernel parameter to get 2nd monitor working
11:21:21 <strcat> Auditor, AttestationServer, PdfViewer, Vanadium, hardened_malloc, the OS itself
11:21:28 <antranigv> I have run the ./flash-all.sh script, looks like it's done, but the device did not reboot, is that normal?
11:21:34 <strcat> other sub-projects including new ones that are needed
11:21:47 <antranigv> what are the skillsets required? I mean, I'd be happy to help.
11:21:49 <strcat> antranigv: we deliberately disable automatically rebooting so that you can go back to the fastboot menu and lock
11:21:52 <rutxonboard[m]> > if they don't, things will be wrapped up, which is not what I expect to happen
11:21:52 <rutxonboard[m]> Does a contributor specifically need to focus on a new device to get it supported or would someone assisting on main stuff and old devices be enough to push it forward. For instance another renlord shows up tomorrow and wants to take care of a Pixel 3 and normal development. Would you add support for the 4a?
11:21:53 <strcat> before booting it
11:22:03 <antranigv> strcat: thanks! will do that now.
11:22:14 <renlord> valldrac has started contributing
11:22:17 <strcat> antranigv: it's inconvenient for it to reboot automatically since you just need to go back to the fastboot menu and lock so we pass --skip-reboot to fastboot in the script
11:22:23 <strcat> one of the only 2 changes we make to the flashing script
11:22:38 <strcat> the other change is that we automatically flash the GrapheneOS verified boot key
11:22:42 <strcat> instead of having people do that manually
11:23:03 <antranigv> well, in that case, I will try to check github and try to improve
11:23:17 <antranigv> I'll also get an old Pixel 2 and use it for development
11:23:23 <antranigv> aaaaand it's up and running <
11:23:24 <antranigv> <3
11:23:34 * cx2[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/wuHLlkUynwXzOduAGoocxQKx >
11:23:50 <strcat> just make sure it's locked and you get the message saying another OS is loaded (yellow icon) rather than saying it's not being verified (orange)
11:24:05 <strcat> and then you're assured that it's a proper install bit-for-bit identical to every other install
11:24:13 <strcat> via verified boot
11:24:41 <valldrac> renlord: thx, more to come :)
11:25:19 <rutxonboard[m]> cx2: you keep saying that you're an upfront person? How many times are necessary to get that point across?
11:25:44 <cx2[m]> I said it twice
11:25:49 <antranigv> aaand it's up
11:25:52 <rutxonboard[m]> Haha fair enough
11:26:17 <strcat> cx2[m]: the issue is that you and other people are always trying to pass responsibility to me
11:26:21 <strcat> I don't want your suggestions or advice
11:26:30 <strcat> it's YOUR responsibility to act on ideas you think are worthy
11:26:38 <renlord> strcat: i think adding like a short section in each release note highlighting which authors helped with the release is a good way to incentivise contributions with very little cost
11:26:46 <strcat> if people want the project to be used by a company they can start contributing and talk to companies
11:26:53 <strcat> because I'm not particularly interested in doing that
11:27:00 <renlord> 1. it also helps new contributors see what are some low hanging fruits for first-time contributions
11:27:10 <renlord> 2. it also gives authors a 'feel-good' feeling
11:27:32 <antranigv> are there any wallpapers you guys recommend?
11:28:39 <renlord> my hopes is that while it does not necessarily help much attracting long term contributors who'd be committed, it'd at least motivate some one-off contributions also
11:29:23 <rutxonboard[m]> > my hopes is that while it does not necessarily help much attracting long term contributors who'd be committed, it'd at least motivate some one-off contributions also
11:29:24 <rutxonboard[m]> That's a good idea
11:30:22 <renlord> i see that it's quite successful with the bitcoin project, they even have that bitcoin merges bot on twitter congratulating each first-time contribution
11:38:21 <strcat> don't understand what validatornu even validates for svgs

11:46:37 <strcat> it works for html and css...

12:50:06 <joeri_poeri[m]> strange, what device are you using?
13:28:16 <antranigv> Pixel 2
14:13:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat "and it's not clear what advantag"> The biggest one, and possibly the only one, ATM, is, if someone from a Uni wants to commit a bunch of code and have it count as a semester (co-op), it would provide an avenue to offer that.
14:13:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I'd be very willing to coordinate this, and handle the paperwork; I have experience in doing both of these.
14:14:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I'd also be willing to lead a recruitment effort towards such, and have already "unofficially" started putting feelers out.

14:42:52 <bigtree[m]> Hi everyone
14:44:09 <bigtree[m]> I thought about your word about you word about the project.
14:45:16 <bigtree[m]> May it is possible to make something like crowdfounding for it?
14:46:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> As mentioned above, donations and other funding don't help a ton if there's no one to take the money and convert it into project code, or biy devices to help them convert into project code.

14:55:38 <bseeinu[m]> After 9 days, my Pixel 3 started moving from the post office... it was in acceptance for 9 days...
15:01:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > purism found 2+ millions dollars for their project
15:01:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > and it is still unuseful
15:01:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> That's kinda proving my point. Matching coders with the project is the prime directive right now.
15:02:58 <cx2[m]> Is there anything that Purism does that would be benifical to GOS?
15:03:29 <madaidan[m]> <cx2[m] "Is there anything that Purism do"> No
15:04:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> (Besides community marketing)
15:04:01 <madaidan[m]> Purism is just a bunch of bullshit
15:04:22 <bigtree[m]> their task is a little more complicated
15:05:57 <cx2[m]> <madaidan[m] "Purism is just a bunch of bullsh"> Well I get that.... it could be entirely misguided.... but at least from my perspective, they have to have some bright developers.... even if it is trash.
15:06:11 <bigtree[m]> but here you need to find some one wo will fo;;ow the rpoject for 3 year
15:06:24 <bigtree[m]> may be several peoples
15:06:48 <bigtree[m]> so we have donate for their salary for this time
15:07:24 <bigtree[m]> this is not lots of money
15:07:57 <bigtree[m]> several handreds thousends dollars
15:08:53 <bseeinu[m]> So, what‚Äôs the catch with crowdsourcing funds with a campaign? Wouldn‚Äôt that much attention also attract developers as a halo effect?
15:10:17 <bseeinu[m]> Also: any graphics/design contributions needed? While not crucial, maybe some branding can‚Äôt hurt?
15:11:16 <bigtree[m]> <bseeinu[m] "So, what‚Äôs the catch with crowds"> I can't see the future but it sounds logic
15:11:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <bseeinu[m] "So, what‚Äôs the catch with crowds"> Needing an organization to accept the funds without taxation implications
15:12:20 <bseeinu[m]> So that‚Äôs an advantage of an NGO. Crowdfunding campaigns to bring visibility and actually attract talent

15:12:52 <bseeinu[m]> I‚Äôm not talking about UX and Os aesthetics
15:13:09 <bseeinu[m]> I‚Äôm talking about branding. The way you present the project to the world
15:13:09 <cx2[m]> I've never done it, but would be willing to contribute time to figuring something like that out...I understand that money doesn't = code. But it could bring in the people that do.
15:13:09 <cx2[m]> As they say, "Money doesn't buy happiness.... but it does by Jet Skis, and Jetskis make me happy"
15:13:56 <bigtree[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Needing an organization to accep"> I have to check and maybe I can find solution, If they wiil accept my help

15:14:45 <bseeinu[m]> I find that ‚Äúhelp us because we do the right thing‚Äù hardly ever works in the real side of things
15:14:54 <bseeinu[m]> You have to offer a clear and streamlined vision
15:15:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <bseeinu[m] "I‚Äôm talking about branding. The "> The current website, save a few more line breaks, and perhaps a logo, is perfect at communicating the value of the OS to the user.
15:15:12 <bseeinu[m]> Visual identity is part of that
15:15:38 <bseeinu[m]> Cool. So no branding improvement is possible ever and perfection has been reached.
15:15:55 <bseeinu[m]> That‚Äôs why people are flooding.
15:16:11 <DannyWorkOrderPr> There's no need to be passive-aggressive.
15:16:26 <bseeinu[m]> I‚Äôm being critical
15:16:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I would like to see a section with a roadmap, but the problem is, the developers are overwhelmed with simply maintaining the software, and don't have time to "be marketers".
15:17:03 <bseeinu[m]> And provocative.
15:17:13 <bseeinu[m]> Very actively so and not passively :)
15:17:16 <bseeinu[m]> That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm offering, my friend :)
15:17:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> And the people who aren't familiar with the project that ask to do branding stuff largely will need to lean on the developers to ask them to write out their roadmap
15:18:41 <cx2[m]> So strcat said it flat out.... if it's a community project and you guys firmly believe that, then let someone run with it.....then bring it back for approval.... and let it ride.
15:18:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Which is similar in level of effort to just putting on the webpage themselves.
15:19:04 <bseeinu[m]> Okay. The offer stands. It‚Äôs hard to expect people to come without a clear and visible call.
15:19:27 <cx2[m]> <bseeinu[m] "Okay. The offer stands. It‚Äôs har"> Agreed.
15:19:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > Cool. So no branding improvement is possible ever and perfection has been reached.
15:19:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > That‚Äôs why people are flooding.
15:19:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> This is passive-aggressive, and not friendly towards volunteers. Just be cool, man.
15:20:04 <bseeinu[m]> again, it‚Äôs active critical thinking. And not passive, I openly challenged that :)
15:20:18 <hitchhooker[m]> for sure frontend pullrequests won't hurt
15:20:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <bseeinu[m] "Okay. The offer stands. It‚Äôs har"> Flashy marketing = mainstream users. There's currently very little as far as volunteer time to handle the requests of these mainstream users (see Daniels complaints about the frankly dumbass questions on reddit).
15:20:29 <bseeinu[m]> I got a couple calls, the offer stands and I get if it‚Äôs not needed. Offers can be refused, it‚Äôs fine. Trying to help.
15:21:27 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Mainstream users are welcome, but the project would be overwhelmed with requests/bad reviews in its current state if every user and their mom from the Lineage crowd came to install GrapheneOS today.
15:22:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> The roadmap/vision = porting over features that were in the OS pre-corporate nonsense
15:22:06 <bseeinu[m]> There ain‚Äôt no user base with no users.
15:23:02 <bseeinu[m]> Understanding the logics of gaining traction doesn‚Äôt equal with flashy or fishy value propositions.
15:23:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Additional users doesn't help the project right now - additional maintainers do. This is a repeat of what Daniel's said here.
15:23:12 <bseeinu[m]> It‚Äôs just understanding how you get the engine going.
15:23:25 <hitchhooker[m]> user base is about 10 000 times bigger than contributor base, so be welcome, contrinute the way you see best
15:23:30 <bseeinu[m]> Ok no worries, gotta go. I‚Äôll leave this on the side, it was a bad idea üññ
15:24:01 <bseeinu[m]> I have actual work calls :)
15:24:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <hitchhooker[m] "user base is about 10 000 times "> +1
15:24:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If you want to start a crowdfund account, bseeinu, or whomever, and use it to match up devs, let's organize that!
15:24:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Just don't put the onus to make moves on the 1-3 overworked devs we already have.
15:25:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> They're literally doing the best they can
15:25:12 <bseeinu[m]> Let‚Äôs talk later. Obviously the goal is to help, not overwhelm.
15:25:29 <bseeinu[m]> And obviously I adore this project.
15:26:05 <cx2[m]> I think bseeinu is saying he is trying to take the onus of a certain aspect of the project on himself...
15:26:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <bseeinu[m] "And obviously I adore this proje"> Same. Let's figure some shit out. The future of Android/mobile security depends on it </clich√©>
15:28:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cx2[m] "I think bseeinu is saying he is "> "The project needs to do rebranding" ‚â† here's a proposed list of pages I've built that combine the carefully prepared technical language and ideas that Daniel's written up with some friendlier user-facing verbiage.
15:28:47 <bseeinu[m]> No man
15:28:54 <cx2[m]> Of course you need more devs.... got it... but youll have a hard time getting somewhere if when someone (seemingly a professional) offers a service or some guidance. Even if it's not exactly development. I think theres an immense about to be gained by growing the user base, especially if they are educated about what GOS Is, and what it ISNT, from the start
15:28:55 <bseeinu[m]> Not rebranding
15:28:58 <bseeinu[m]> I really got to go
15:29:00 <bseeinu[m]> Please don‚Äôt take this as a challenge
15:29:32 <cx2[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro:  Dont disagree one bit..... but I think he was likely just putting feelers out there as well.
15:29:33 <cx2[m]> All i'm saying is, give someone just a small bit of latitude. If they are a sham? tell them to fuck off.
15:30:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, for sure. Having said that, "getting into" the project is as simple as submitting a PR/posting your work as a proposition.
15:30:57 <bigtree[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "The current website, save a few "> I agree with denny, this project is about security not about the graffic. May be logo, but in all other aspects it have to be simle and usefull. This is the point and this is the stile
15:32:15 <Hirppa> One problem with this project is the aim to support only the very best hardware. I understand why Pixel 1 got dropped, but that means also droppin potential users -- a lot of them. It would be better to have two flavours of GrapheneOS, the ultra secure for new hardware, and a little bit less secure one for older hadware.
15:32:24 <cx2[m]> But even then... folks might not know that.
15:32:24 <cx2[m]> We are talking about Cell phone software... it's the Single bit of tech that nearly every single person on the entire planet owns. Theres a MASSIVE amount of utility in that fact. One of the down sides is that there are plenty of people with a lot of skill that can be helpful... just might not be directly as devs..... solid chance they might not even know what a pull request is
15:32:51 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <bseeinu[m] "Please don‚Äôt take this as a chal"> > You have to offer a clear and streamlined vision
15:33:15 <cx2[m]> Hirppa:  That's a battle thats likely not going ot be won, friend.
15:34:43 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <Hirppa "One problem with this project is"> It would be great. Please read the documentation on GrapheneOS.org. It clearly states why this isn't feasible. 1.) Google no longer publishing upstream security patching
15:35:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> which increase workload for maintaining that device immensely. Like, immensely.
15:35:23 <cx2[m]> Hirppa: I don't know that its ever a bad idea in general to only deal in "the very best." But there are very specific reasons why the Pixel is the one chosen for this.
15:35:49 <DannyWorkOrderPr> 2.) We don't yet have maintainers lined up for the *new* devices!
15:38:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Hirppa: you can still build (for yourself) for the Pixel 1 - but you'll be insecure right out of the gate, because the security patch level is insufficient, which doesn't meet the goals of the project (Android Hardening)
15:38:33 <Zenithium[m]> > It would be better to have two flavours of GrapheneOS, the ultra secure for new hardware, and a little bit less secure one for older hadware.
15:38:34 <Zenithium[m]> I don't think Daniel ever wants to support "less secure" stuff as the goal is being as secure as possible, and older devices don't have the security features that the new generations do
15:39:17 <Zenithium[m]> But I might be wrong, don't want to speak for him. In any case, right now supporting older devices is definitely not a goal since there are not enough resources even for the newer ones as was said above.
15:46:25 <bigtree[m]> <Hirppa "One problem with this project is"> I don't agree. Security without compromises
15:47:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > One of the down sides is that there are plenty of people with a lot of skill that can be helpful... just might not be directly as devs..... solid chance they might not even know what a pull request is
15:47:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> A frontend dev that wants this project to succeed could be picking up the phone today to speak to a University's CompSci/Sec department and ask if they could spread the word regarding potential co-op internship.
15:47:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> No PR required ;D
15:48:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> (cx2: this includes you!!)
15:49:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > "Bolster your r√©sum√© and fulfill your internship/co-op requirements by working on an actual project, with a cutting-edge dev team, maintaining and feature-extending a revolutionary, security-first mobile operating system"
15:49:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Anyone needing verbiage / script help need only to ask! =] As mentioned, I am experienced in handling the related paperwork, and am happy to follow through if you secure someone from a uni that Daniel sees fit.
15:50:20 <cx2[m]> It does indeed include me.... and I do indeed have something that I am working on.
15:51:00 <cx2[m]> That said, I am quite the precarious situation at the moment..... I am stuck abroad thanks to this virus issue that's apparently been going around...
15:58:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Check the subreddit, search wallpaper, couple kicking around
16:01:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Stay safe, cx2 - looking forward to seeing what we can all do together.
16:04:26 <cx2[m]> Thank you!... i'm in a good spot... travel has just been restricted as all... and because of that, I DO have a mountain of time on my hands.... I guess I could learn some Java?
16:07:28 <bseeinu[m]> @danny makes sense. To cx2‚Äôs point: some people won‚Äôt know what a pull request is, and you might have to dedicate time to share a vision so it‚Äôs choral.
16:07:58 <bseeinu[m]> Like a for a movie crew, the movie itself could have a great director, but you need good actors and also fantastic editors to get to a great result
16:08:23 <bseeinu[m]> Not everyone will share the same set of skills, but the overall success is a concert of knowledge and effort.
16:10:46 <strcat[m]> Hirppa: I asked for help for the Pixel 1 over and over again and no one stepped up to take over maintenance, the same thing is happening with the Pixel 2 now
16:11:10 <strcat[m]> Hirppa: the Pixel 2 may be dropped before it even reaches EOL
16:11:28 <strcat[m]> it's not even an option to consider support for it once we can't provide full security updates
16:11:56 <strcat[m]> who is going to take over maintenance of the kernel including all the kernel drivers, who will take over maintenance of all the userspace code and start rewriting it?
16:12:16 <bseeinu[m]> I find the current website very very clear in intent and organization, with no frills.
16:12:20 <strcat[m]> what's the point once serious issues in the firmware need to be patched and can't be patched?
16:12:49 <strcat[m]> the website needs a lot of work i.e. massively more comprehensive usage guide and FAQ along with documentation on what features GrapheneOS provides
16:13:18 <strcat[m]> it would be nice to have a fancy main page and maybe move the content there elsewhere while expanding it, I already moved a lot of content off the main page, it's just where things start
16:13:26 <strcat[m]> but I don't want marketing fluff and useless graphics
16:13:38 <strcat[m]> useful graphics sure
16:13:41 <bseeinu[m]> That‚Äôs content over presentation, makes sense. A developer can help with that, Daniel is right
16:13:51 <strcat[m]> screenshots of things in the tutorials and faq, etc.
16:13:57 <bseeinu[m]> Cool, that‚Äôs a good point. What do you consider useful graphics?
16:14:00 <strcat[m]> useful diagrams / images
16:14:17 <strcat[m]> bseeinu: when it's communicating actual information that's better via image than text
16:14:30 <strcat[m]> it isn't full of stuff like that because I don't have time and I care about things being reproducible / maintainable
16:14:50 <strcat[m]> so if someone wants to make a diagram I want it done with something I can use to edit it as text and regenerate it
16:14:50 <bseeinu[m]> Understood. Any section that comes to mind as an example of what could use graphics?
16:15:01 <strcat[m]> and screenshots / clips should be done in a reproducible, scripted way
16:15:10 <strcat[m]> like a video clip of navigating to some setting, if someone wanted to make those
16:15:23 <strcat[m]> it has to be done using adb shell monkey
16:15:30 <strcat[m]> in a script
16:15:35 <strcat[m]> in some way I can run a script and it makes the video
16:15:39 <bseeinu[m]> Ok. So a screen capture of GrapheneOS navigation
16:15:43 <strcat[m]> Android 11 comes out -> probably moves a ton of stuff around -> all needs to be updated / redone
16:15:54 <strcat[m]> bseeinu: I just mean as part of guides
16:16:03 <bseeinu[m]> How about in the meantime a human captures the screen and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs used for the guides
16:16:07 <strcat[m]> it's an example and not necessarily something that's really useful
16:16:12 <bseeinu[m]> Would that be of help?
16:16:27 <bseeinu[m]> Then no.
16:16:27 <strcat[m]> bseeinu: but then when something changes it has to be removed
16:16:47 <strcat[m]> best to have things divided up into small clips
16:16:50 <strcat[m]> no long videos
16:17:01 <strcat[m]> and ideally it's reproducible with a script not just done by hand
16:17:04 <bseeinu[m]> Yes, say 15‚Äù max clips?
16:17:16 <strcat[m]> there is a tool called monkey for automatically doing interactions with the device
16:17:20 <strcat[m]> you can launch settings and click on things in a script
16:17:26 <bseeinu[m]> I have absolutely no clue on how to script that. I do know how to compress things well and record.
16:17:40 <bseeinu[m]> Ok
16:17:41 <strcat[m]> adb shell
16:17:45 <strcat[m]> am command to launch stuff
16:17:48 <strcat[m]> monkey to click on stuff
16:18:41 <bseeinu[m]> How about a cut of the install process via terminal for people who constantly run into errors?
16:18:50 <bseeinu[m]> Divided by clip/command?
16:19:13 <strcat[m]> I dunno if that will help
16:19:21 <bseeinu[m]> Maybe could even be short, horizontals and ultra wide gifs of the command line running through commands
16:19:26 <strcat[m]> it's only a couple of commands
16:19:43 <strcat[m]> fastboot flashing unlock, cd to the directory you unzipped factory images, ./flash-all.sh, fastboot flashing lock
16:20:01 <bseeinu[m]> There seem to be quite a few users running in trouble as they are unfamiliar with the whole process, maybe even the first time they see it
16:20:08 <bseeinu[m]> Ok
16:20:35 <strcat[m]> for someone that knows the CLI and can deal with fetching dependencies and figuring out issues those are the install instructions in terms of the terminal (just need to add in 'go to fastboot mode' at the right points and that's it)
16:20:54 <bseeinu[m]> Yeah to you or good developers might seem trivial
16:21:04 <bseeinu[m]> But do you spend any time fencing off basic questions about the command line?
16:21:05 <strcat[m]> bseeinu: I merged the troubleshooting section from JollyRoger
16:21:23 <strcat[m]> bseeinu: people's problems are mostly to do with having a broken OS, VM, USB port, USB cable, USB hub
16:21:54 <strcat[m]> get people to buy computers / cables that aren't broken
16:21:58 <madaidan[m]> <bseeinu[m] "Cool, that‚Äôs a good point. What "> We need a fancy anonymous hacker background with a guy fawkes mask and black hoodie /s
16:22:16 <strcat[m]> the device itself comes with a USB-C cable only and lots of people don't have a new-ish laptop or desktop with USB C ports
16:22:24 <strcat[m]> linux USB C / USB 3 support is historically broken
16:22:30 <strcat[m]> most people use distros with ancient software
16:22:40 <bseeinu[m]> So this guy for example: like it or not, 10k humans watched how to do the basic stuff you listed in a message
16:22:44 <bseeinu[m]> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc
16:22:52 <strcat[m]> the 4.9 debian LTS kernel is not like the 4.9 android LTS kernel
16:23:08 <bseeinu[m]> What I‚Äôm thinking is: what is a middle ground to help people who need the video, without the video?
16:23:15 <strcat[m]> for android they don't follow the rule of only backporting security fixes, they backport tons of bug fixes and huge overhauls / features too
16:23:35 <bseeinu[m]> That‚Äôs a good list of things to avoid already I think
16:23:38 <madaidan[m]> <madaidan[m] "We need a fancy anonymous hacker"> Copperhead's new design is actually like that
16:23:52 <strcat[m]> it's the kernel.org LTS + a ton of extra backporting far beyond that, largely features
16:23:56 * madaidan[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20200421_172316_251.jpg (105KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/MMpsmCyXgzjPeTfUmAaPrbhm >
16:23:57 <strcat[m]> but a lot more bug fixes too
16:23:57 <madaidan[m]> Bleugh
16:24:00 <strcat[m]> and still it's hardly enough
16:24:30 <strcat[m]> going to have a big announcement about what James / Copperhead are trying to do to me soon
16:25:01 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it really says everything that he lies about a bunch of companies he falsely claims are partners on that new site
16:25:24 <strcat[m]> any company copperhead ever did every business with is somehow a "partner"? lol
16:25:44 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they claimed that calyx was a partner even
16:25:51 <madaidan[m]> Yeah I saw people talking about that in here
16:26:10 <strcat[m]> got in a fight with some Bitcoin people on twitter about it today
16:27:13 <madaidan[m]> That is a lot of tweets
16:27:42 <strcat> procrastinating dealing with stressful legal and tax issues
16:27:55 <strcat> + really upset me
16:28:09 <strcat> that they say they support me
16:28:11 <strcat> and the project
16:28:30 <strcat> but then they go and promote Copperhead and try making it seem comparable which is a joke
16:28:51 <strcat> and then they start talking about how they want to donate and would donate if I use PayNyms
16:29:09 <strcat> but it makes no sense to me that they want to donate while supporting people that are going to burn all of their donations
16:29:26 <strcat> I could easily end up having to spend 50k+ on legal fees
16:29:38 <strcat> dealing with their bullshit
16:29:48 <strcat> and the government wants 8k from me that I should not owe them due to what they did
16:30:02 <strcat> so there goes half the total donations so far to GrapheneOS
16:30:06 <strcat> and could be more
16:30:24 <strcat> people want me to hire developers? I can't, I need all the donations and more to deal with their BS
16:30:36 <strcat> I need to run a crowdfunding campaign not to develop something but to raise money to deal with this stuff
16:30:49 <strcat> need to choose a crowdfunding platform, suggestions welcome
16:30:54 <strcat> 1 platform
16:33:24 <strcat> I've tried to communicate how seriously this stuff continues to impact me and the project
16:34:02 <hitchhooker[m]> Isis got 35k through GoFundMe for their legal battle https://www.gofundme.com/f/isis-lovecruft-legal-defense
16:34:09 <madaidan[m]> Gofundme?
16:34:17 <madaidan[m]> I've heard good stuff about it
16:34:24 <strcat> I'm worried about getting into a situation like the BS I have with Stripe
16:36:16 <strcat> Stripe successfully sent me a CAD payment btw
16:37:16 <strcat> 17 Apr
16:37:20 <strcat> CA$6,521.07
16:37:25 <strcat> it's like 8 months
16:37:28 <strcat> of GitHub Sponsors money
16:37:41 <strcat> maybe 6 months w/e
16:37:53 <strcat> the first failed payment is november
16:38:01 <strcat> april 17 is first successful
16:38:08 <strcat> because before november github was sending it to me themselves
16:38:10 <strcat> with no issue
16:38:48 <strcat> MATCHING FUND STATUS
16:38:50 <strcat> $2,768.29
16:38:52 <strcat>  / $5,000.00 matched
16:39:29 <hitchhooker[m]> all at once?
16:39:36 <strcat> so people have donated $2768.29 USD
16:39:39 <strcat> and github matches it 1:1
16:39:52 <strcat> so that's 5536.58 USD total
16:40:12 <strcat> and they just sent me a SINGLE payment of 6,521.07 CAD due to how it got backed up and I spent MONTHS working with them to try to fix it
16:40:16 <strcat> and we still haven't fixed it
16:40:23 <strcat> I just gave them my CAD account info instead of USD
16:40:28 <strcat> and for some reason they were able to send that
16:40:36 <strcat> paypal and google deposit into my USD account just fine
16:42:01 <strcat> I need to get a USD credit card and hook it up to my account so I can actually spend USD without paypal
16:42:25 <madaidan[m]> This looks interesting https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1252580680699166720
16:42:35 <madaidan[m]> Anyone I would know on that list?
16:48:52 <strcat> madaidan[m]: dunno just record anyone I see promoting it / supporting James along with companies still involved with them, etc.
16:49:05 <strcat> if they do that publicly, don't see any reason I can't publish a list
16:49:31 <strcat> I would make a twitter list for twitter if it didn't ping people and probably stop you from listing them if they block you
16:51:06 <madaidan[m]> Make a massive, collaborative wall of shame on github or something
16:51:40 <madaidan[m]> PR: added 2 new scumbags
16:52:01 <strcat> I want to give people a chance to inform themselves / stop
16:52:20 <strcat> but if people are publicly posting endorsements of Copperhead and supporting their BS attacks on me I have an issue with that
16:52:28 <strcat> also they are using my code against the terms of the licenses
16:53:06 <strcat> they're clearly using it commercially and they absolutely do not own it
16:53:14 <strcat> they ONLY started claiming to own it AFTER I was not involved
16:53:20 <strcat> until that point it was acknowledged that I owned it
16:53:24 <strcat> explicitly
16:53:35 <strcat> and they NEVER received a commercial license from me
16:53:48 <strcat> madaidan[m]: they weren't the ones publishing the OS and making releases
16:54:20 <strcat> I never actually gave them a license, I just approved certain things like ncrypt using it commercially
16:54:46 <strcat> funny how James respected that I owned it and always made sure to have me sign off on stuff but then after fucking me over he just walks back and retroactively changes the history and our agreements
16:54:50 <strcat> just lies about everything
16:55:15 <strcat> once it no longer made sense to pretend he just completely changed everything
16:55:31 <strcat> he also acknowledged the donations were mine, explicitly
16:55:37 <strcat> I have IRC logs of him acknowledging they are mine
16:55:44 <strcat> and then he just fucking stole them all
16:56:09 <strcat> uses my money (donations and company revenue) to fund a war against me
16:56:18 <strcat> uses a lawyer that's effectively half mine as if it's his personal lawyer
16:56:24 <madaidan[m]> He's such a scumbag
16:56:31 <strcat> uses those company resources to file a fraudulent claim over my copyright
16:56:41 <strcat> and fills out my address in an optional field just to dox me as part of it because why not
16:56:52 <strcat> so now my personal address is public government record
16:57:26 <strcat> madaidan[m]: they filed a copyright claim over my work saying they are the owner and I'm the author even though I NEVER assigned any copyright to them
16:57:28 <madaidan[m]> He doxed you? Shit.
16:57:30 <strcat> they just regularly do fraud
16:57:33 <strcat> madaidan[m]: yes
16:58:19 <madaidan[m]> That's really fucked
16:58:38 <strcat> madaidan[m]: he's an abuser who has stolen huge amounts of my money, engaged in a bunch of fraud against me, a public misinformation / slander campaign including doing media press releases slandering me with false claims
16:58:46 <strcat> complete and utter scumbag
16:59:11 <strcat> madaidan[m]: I knew he was a narcissistic asshole and probably a sociopath/psychopath long before this happened
16:59:22 <strcat> I was stuck in that company wanting out with no clear way out
16:59:34 <strcat> and then he eventually totally fucked me over and screwed over my project
16:59:53 <strcat> company was supposed to be a sponsor but really I'd estimate it did 500k+ in damages to the project
16:59:58 <strcat> or more
17:00:05 <strcat> destroyed years of my work and progress
17:00:14 <strcat> and he barely contributed anything or did any actual work at all
17:00:26 <strcat> yet he took half the income and now he takes 100%
17:00:29 <strcat> and uses it to harm me
17:00:34 <strcat> I still own half the company
17:01:05 <strcat> madaidan[m]: how is it at all fucking sensible that the company's lawyers are going after the 50% shareholder of the company for a PERSONAL dispute between myself and James
17:01:18 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "madaidan.: I knew he was a narci"> Did he do any other scumbag-ish things while you were there?
17:01:30 <strcat> madaidan[m]: some super incompetent lawyers that need to be disbarred and I am 100% going to pursue that
17:01:32 <strcat> madaidan[m]: yes, 100%, many
17:01:39 <strcat> he did many unethical and untrustworthy things
17:01:44 <strcat> and you can see what they did after
17:01:47 <strcat> they added DRM / tracking BS
17:02:04 <strcat> madaidan[m]: so ridiculous for people to try to compare it to the real thing
17:02:38 <strcat> when all they did is rip off my legacy code, pay some cheap outsourced devs and a lineageos dev to poorly port it forward, largely disabling / omitting what was present cause they don't understand it
17:03:01 <strcat> change around the updater ui, add DRM / tracking to it
17:03:08 <strcat> and some other stuff like that
17:03:13 <strcat> app to report bugs
17:03:18 <strcat> where is the privacy/security work? they don't do that
17:03:31 <strcat> they don't do privacy/security research/engineering and they hardly even have devs at all
17:03:45 <strcat> where is their source code? it's not even source available
17:03:56 <strcat> where is the gpl2 kernel code including stuff they copied from me?
17:04:22 <madaidan[m]> I heard that same lineage dev is a massive dick and fucked up even lineage too
17:04:47 <strcat> he stole my work
17:04:54 <strcat> and falsely attributed it to himself / Copperhead
17:05:02 <strcat> fuck that guy
17:05:16 <strcat> they added copyright notices falsely attributing it to themselves
17:05:38 <strcat> when before they forked it, the ONLY attribute was to me using my PERSONAL email since I ALWAYS made sure to split up usage of my personal vs. corporate email
17:05:42 <strcat> personal email for open source work I owned
17:05:47 <strcat> company email for stuff for the company
17:05:47 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "fuck that guy"> Agreed
17:06:06 <strcat> notice ALL the work in the OS was all my personal email with ZERO attributions to the company because it was not involved
17:06:18 <strcat> my personal work on my open source project
17:06:24 <strcat> company was not paying me to do that work
17:06:29 <strcat> was not compensated for any of that
17:06:51 <strcat> madaidan[m]: they did some super fucked up stuff falsifying accounting records retroactively
17:07:01 <strcat> they went back and falsely claimed I'd gotten shareholder advances
17:07:04 <strcat> for years
17:07:08 <strcat> when I NEVER fucking agreed to that
17:07:12 <strcat> and it is not how I filed my taxes
17:07:23 <strcat> so they move this money I already paid taxes on to 2018 and then claim it's this salary I never got
17:07:26 <strcat> I never had a salary
17:07:37 <strcat> never had any agreed upon salary and never had an employment agreement
17:07:39 <strcat> was not an employee
17:07:46 <strcat> madaidan[m]: they did this to claim government grants
17:07:50 <strcat> fraudulently
17:07:55 <strcat> retroactive changes to accounting
17:08:04 <strcat> madaidan[m]: also falsely claiming I did the work as an employee
17:08:10 <strcat> madaidan[m]: this is how James rolls
17:08:36 <strcat> madaidan[m]: his 'business' experience is that he was a drug dealer, that's a fact, not libel, all this can be confirmed by many people
17:08:44 <strcat> LITERALLY a drug dealer
17:08:53 <strcat> the shit you find out about people over time
17:10:07 <strcat> madaidan[m]: honestly going to refreshing dealing with this BS via a court where they shouldn't be able to keep bullshitting / lying
17:10:14 <strcat> to be refreshing*
17:10:18 <strcat> tired of this nonsense
17:12:27 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "madaidan.: honestly going to ref"> I hoped copperhead gets fucked
17:12:36 <Zenithium[m]> I think you will be a lot more convincing considering you have actual compelling evidence lol
17:12:51 <madaidan[m]> It's crazy how people actually like James
17:13:03 <madaidan[m]> He's such a dick
17:14:04 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: any people that were around since early on
17:14:09 <strcat> can be witnesses to so many aspects of it
17:14:25 <Zenithium[m]> Dunno how they can even claim you just "worked for them" when you own 50% and you were the only one working on the project even before CopperheadOS was a thing (AndroidHardening)
17:14:25 <strcat> they're so fucking stupid thinking they can get away with all this BS lying
17:14:39 <strcat> I want to raise a ton of money and sue all of them
17:14:47 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: I started it in 2014
17:14:52 <strcat> Copperhead incorporated late 2015
17:15:06 <strcat> and it was an open source project
17:15:10 <strcat> attributions only to me
17:15:20 <strcat> never changed, all the commits were always attributed to me via my personal email
17:15:24 <strcat> can look for yourself
17:15:47 <strcat> I explicitly own the copyright over it, it was agreed upon with the 2 people I started the company with
17:15:56 <strcat> that I would own and control my open source work
17:16:02 <strcat> and the company would do proprietary forks as needed
17:16:12 <strcat> and could not dictate anything to me about the open source work
17:16:26 <strcat> this was EXPLICITLY agreed upon - not in writing, but it was still explicit
17:16:40 <strcat> the ONLY agreements in writing are incorporation and dividing up the shares
17:16:44 <strcat> no NDA
17:16:49 <strcat> no contracts
17:16:52 <strcat> no employment agreement
17:16:54 <strcat> no salary
17:17:04 <strcat> no copyright assignment / no CLA / no licensing grant to them
17:19:09 <Zenithium[m]> "Judge, the proof is in the commits!" :)
17:19:26 <Zenithium[m]> I don't even know what James' defense is going to cook up
17:19:32 <Zenithium[m]> How they plan to do this
17:19:48 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: well initially it will be me defending but we can file counter-claims
17:20:00 <strcat> and I don't see why I shouldn't sue James as an individual too
17:20:13 <strcat> limited only by the money that can be raised really
17:20:13 <Zenithium[m]> Yeah
17:20:35 <strcat> if people are going to financially support a legal battle I am perfectly happy to waste tens of thousands of dollars dealing with this asshole, at this point
17:20:48 <strcat> has stolen so much from me and fucked me over so badly
17:21:59 <Zenithium[m]> I don't know if it's even worth it honestly, CopperheadOS is going to wither by itself with no actual work being done
17:22:33 <Zenithium[m]> But slandering you is definitely a problem, clearing stuff up in court would maybe help with public image
17:22:52 <madaidan[m]> <Zenithium[m] "I don't know if it's even worth "> I doubt it. Just look at the recent twitter thread. People still eat up copperhead's lies.
17:23:15 <madaidan[m]> Infosec is full of people doing no real work and lying.
17:23:34 <strcat> yeah and those are not non-technical people
17:23:42 <madaidan[m]> The best way to handle this is legally imo.
17:23:43 <strcat> some of them are probably developers
17:23:52 <strcat> madaidan[m]: going to take a lot of money, time and energy
17:23:55 <strcat> madaidan[m]: it's happening
17:24:52 <strcat> madaidan[m]: ideally James would just get arrested and convicted for his criminal behavior
17:25:20 <strcat> maybe they'll get him for one of those sketchy companies he works with
17:25:25 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "madaidan.: ideally James would j"> That would be amazing
17:25:44 <strcat> they arrested everyone in a Copperhead business partner
17:25:45 <strcat> MPC
17:25:52 <strcat> MPC secure
17:26:11 <strcat> and also this cartel guy in vancouver who james was setting up a business deal with
17:26:11 <madaidan[m]> Gonna be hard to spread lies from a prison
17:26:21 <strcat> madaidan[m]: https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/wjwbmm/inside-the-phone-company-secretly-run-by-drug-traffickers
17:26:30 <strcat> > At one point, a version of MPC's phones also used code from an open-source, security-focused Android fork called CopperheadOS, three sources said.
17:26:35 <strcat> madaidan[m]: but that's not all they got an official license
17:26:41 <strcat> they were a business partner
17:27:24 <strcat> madaidan[m]: and these are not the only sketchy companies
17:27:34 <strcat> madaidan[m]: I was fighting with James about a lot of this stuff internally for years
17:28:03 <strcat> madaidan[m]: he pretty much always wanted it to be closed source, with DRM / tracking, no product for individuals just businesses
17:28:09 <strcat> sketchy resellers tied to criminals
17:28:13 <strcat> that's his idea of a business model
17:28:24 <strcat> and also selling out users to US military contractors
17:29:03 <danvittegleo[m]> it's crazy to me how sketchy all of the secure phone companies are
17:29:07 <Zenithium[m]> Well he was a drug dealer, not a bright fella for sure when it comes to business
17:29:30 <strcat> madaidan[m]: he was against open source from the start but it was a condition of me being involved at all - and that I would own/control the open source project, with the company making proprietary forks internally
17:30:04 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: he tries to portray himself as a business person but he's anything but that
17:30:10 <strcat> he's just a mask he's trying to wear badly
17:30:58 <strcat> his background is lead singer of some shitty band, drug dealer, who gets in physical fights with people
17:31:08 <strcat> what business background / success can be point to
17:31:21 <madaidan[m]> Lmao what's his band name
17:31:23 <strcat> hosting insecure web / email servers for people, badly?
17:31:31 <strcat> madaidan[m]: dunno what it was
17:32:51 <strcat> madaidan[m]: I love how near the end he was still pretending to be a 'friend' and claiming he was my friend / that he cared about me and claiming he didn't want to do what he was doing
17:32:53 <strcat> some real bullshit
17:33:11 <strcat> madaidan[m]: still lying about that BS after involving the company lawyer that he brainwashed
17:33:20 <strcat> and starting to screw me over and lie about everything
17:33:29 <strcat> retroactively rewriting history, accounting, etc.
17:33:35 <strcat> madaidan[m]: you know what's hilarious
17:33:57 <strcat> madaidan[m]: they're so fucking incompetent they accidentally got the company registered as Coppperhead Limited instead of Copperhead Limited
17:34:00 <strcat> ^ not even a joke
17:34:12 <strcat> madaidan[m]: as part of their BS they want to force me to approve changing the name
17:34:15 <strcat> nope
17:34:43 <strcat> ot
17:34:47 <Zenithium[m]> Hahahah that's golden
17:34:55 <strcat> it's actually pathetic how fucking incompetent and terrible that company was and still is
17:35:07 <strcat> total joke
17:35:50 <strcat> the only reason it was a trustworthy OS is because I didn't like James / the company fuck anything up in the project by keeping it as a separate thing outside company control / ownership
17:35:56 <strcat> only thing that could be fucked up was the business
17:35:58 <strcat> and fucked up it was
17:36:16 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "madaidan.: they're so fucking in"> Lol
17:36:16 <strcat> madaidan[m]: he does succeed at doing enough scamming to keep things limping along indefinitely
17:36:32 <strcat> that's why I get so frustrated with ppl supporting them
17:36:38 <madaidan[m]> Gotta love the http version of their new site too
17:36:40 <strcat> if they trick even 5 people into buying super expensive phones
17:36:45 <strcat> with 0 costs basically
17:37:03 <strcat> cause they don't actually do anything when it comes to actual privacy/security work
17:37:13 <strcat> it's just some bs marketing, stealing my legacy work
17:46:04 <madaidan[m]> Does anyone have any info on the Ubuntu touch sandboxing? I can't find the policies anywhere.
18:00:25 <antranigv> question: how do people do OTP updates? or I have to do it always with adb?
18:00:36 <antranigv> also: doesn't that mean anyone can get into my files with adb?
18:02:58 <cx2[m]> Updates are pushed over the air. You do not need to manually sideloade updates (adb) to your phone.
18:08:37 <cx2[m]> To check what verison you are on: Go to Settings -> scroll the the bottom and tap "About Phone".
18:08:38 <cx2[m]> Go to Settings -> System -> Advanced -> System Update Settings.
18:09:13 <rutxonboard[m]> > Does anyone have any info on the Ubuntu touch sandboxing? I can't find the policies anywhere.
18:09:13 <rutxonboard[m]> If you have to ask, it's probably not there or not any good
18:09:46 <strcat> antranigv: you shouldn't enable adb in the OS for production usage but even if you do it doesn't just trust anything you attach, it has a key whitelist system
18:09:58 <strcat> antranigv: and you don't need adb enabled in the OS to sideload updates
18:10:09 <strcat> but the only reason to sideload an update is if the device is never given internet access
18:10:21 <strcat> or if you want to do something like reusing 1 update package download across 10 devices
18:10:44 <strcat> antranigv: read https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates and https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
18:12:39 <rutxonboard[m]> The official site is so good
18:13:47 <antranigv> so OTP it is
18:13:47 * madaidan[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/KJLdFWTtOhaxEfLDeKVrCOkk >
18:14:13 <antranigv> okay one more question: whenever I reboot, the bootloader says "this device has another opetating system" or something similar, that's okay, right?
18:14:15 <madaidan[m]> The docs are non-existent other than "apps are run in an AppArmor security sandbox"
18:15:05 <Zenithium[m]> <madaidan[m] "The docs are non-existent other "> Just read the code sar, it's open sores
18:24:31 <madaidan[m]> <Zenithium[m] "Just read the code sar, it's ope"> It really helps that the code is nowhere to be found
18:31:48 <mxnorvak[m]> so in the process of migrating from LOS to stock rom and removing stock and google apps from my xiaomi device by pm uninstall until i can get a pixel 3a, i found out that the miui has a setting in which you can select different countries for different regions , by doing that it automatically installs new apps and so the app count at first ( including system apps ) were 254 and now after going through all the countries
18:31:48 <mxnorvak[m]> it is 274, just wow, mostly bloatware and normally uninstallable, but now im wondering if i should be worried about these apps
18:32:27 <mxnorvak[m]> my understanding is that the apk is there and by switching the region it just gets installed
18:34:53 <mxnorvak[m]> going through the privacy policy of this miui scared the shit outa me tho, they explicitly state that they collect everything and you also have an option to opt out but idk if that'd make a change
18:35:20 <mxnorvak[m]> i dont even know if these debloating and degoogling would tho any good
18:35:39 <mxnorvak[m]> wish i could just get a 3a rn
18:36:03 <mxnorvak[m]>  * i dont even know if these debloating and degoogling would do any good
18:36:30 <mxnorvak[m]>  * i dont even know if these debloating and degoogling would do any good in terms of the data xoami collects

18:46:30 <dextr[m]> hmm opencam keeps crashing and makes aweful photos.. only thing I changed was using the v2 api.. any ideas?
18:46:50 * dextr[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20200421_204035_HDR.jpg (1159KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/vFuWbkZZHQqYuUtuskPjDWRF >
18:49:40 <cx2[m]> Well first, it doesn't look too terrible. Second, are you using the manual settings on opencam?
18:50:10 <Zenithium[m]> strcat: besides the obvious options for crowdfunding like GoFundMe Kickstarter and Patreon, you could look into LiberaPay and Open Collective as many open source projects use them
18:51:01 <cx2[m]> Also, I could be mistaken, but i'm fairly certain HDR is buggy on GOS.
18:51:05 <Zenithium[m]> I would not go for Patreon as they are known for kicking off people they don't like off of the platform
19:04:07 <dextr[m]> > Well first, it doesn't look too terrible. Second, are you using the manual settings on opencam?
19:04:08 <dextr[m]> all on auto ;) ah good to know - I'll try again without HDR - thank you!
19:04:08 <dextr[m]> colors on the dark bottom are very different than I am used to @cx2:matrix.org
19:05:42 <cx2[m]> Yeah I would play with those settings a bit... I would also pair it with the snapseed app. You can do some pretty great post production work with snapseed
19:08:49 <dextr[m]> hmm interesting - is it still working on GOS? I mean the big G bought the app afaik
19:09:31 <cx2[m]> yeah they did... and yes it absolutely does. I just toggle off all permissions.
19:10:10 <cx2[m]> Havn't used it extensively since I installed GOS...but I have played with it a fair bit. no hangups yet
19:15:56 <dextr[m]> good to know thanks! :D
19:27:01 <cx2[m]> Has anyone notice that Aurora Droid is tending to update quicker?
19:27:09 <cx2[m]> Thoughts on Aurora Droid?
19:33:35 <nickcalyx[m]> Isn't it just a front end to fdroid
19:36:13 <madaidan[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Isn't it just a front end to fdr"> Yes
19:36:54 <cx2[m]> that's what I was thinking as well.... but it's definitely wanting to update apps sooner.
19:37:57 <cx2[m]> If only a front end, it's definitely a nicer look
19:54:51 <nickcalyx[m]> So then its probably just because fdroid is updating more
19:55:34 <nickcalyx[m]> Calyx gave them build infrastructure recently for building the packages
19:57:06 <cx2[m]> Well I made that assessment because I opened both to update, in this case, Joplin Notes.
19:57:25 <cx2[m]> nevermind.... different repos.
21:20:15 <kohntree[m]> In what ways would GrapheneOS and users be effected by EARN IT

21:59:53 <dazinism> dextr: you read https://grapheneos.org/usage#camera ?
22:01:05 <dazinism> Also the HDR setting in open camera provides their own, not great version of HDR
22:03:12 <kohntree[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "kohntree: https://www.schneier.c"> I feel like it is going to be used for more than messaging though
22:16:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <kohntree[m] "I feel like it is going to be us"> They're trying to add a method of access (backdoor) to encryption of services based in the US.
22:17:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Will that be pushed further with the next bill, if this somehow goes through? Undoubtedly. Does it impact Graphene right now? No. Should we be fighting against it/telling our friends/family not to support politicians banning math/basic security? Yes.
22:18:43 <cx2[m]> Good thing there's Signal / Wickr if this does come through.
22:55:13 <cx2[m]> Can you only pay with paypal on swappa??
23:19:46 <hitchhooker[m]> kohntree I don't think project has shit to do with US laws
23:21:35 <hitchhooker[m]> github is US company so maybe they start to offer backdoor as a service
23:21:40 <hitchhooker[m]> :p
23:53:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > Good thing there's Signal / Wickr if this does come through.
23:53:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Why, what's wrong with Riot?
23:59:26 <cx2[m]> I don't know if RIots data is encryped at rest, is it?
23:59:35 <cx2[m]> Signal and Wickr are
23:59:54 <cx2[m]> well the data in each I should say
