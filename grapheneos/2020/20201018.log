00:17:05 <anon_reee> I'm considering just drilling a hole into it to destroy it. but this will void the warranty
00:21:18 <j0cye56[m]> anon_reee: I think you'll have a better chance if you just open it and unplug, if that's possible. Or hell, if you're as drastic as drilling it, you might also just use a syringe to insert a drop of superglue into that mic. But why are you doing this?
00:22:46 <anon_reee> j0cye56[m]: because I don't trust Android at all and don't want a device in my home potentially spying on me
00:23:03 <anon_reee> superglue might work
00:23:39 <j0cye56[m]> anon_reee: What phone model is it (though I think we might get in trouble for OT [off-topic] with this)
00:24:02 <anon_reee> it's a tablet. don't know the model, some shitty Android one
00:24:07 <anon_reee> custom made for the device I'm using
00:24:27 * Resynth[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/vZOLsUSkhLwdOlgHkiuGIEvd/message.txt >
00:24:37 <anon_reee> using Android oreo too, which is also a security vulnerability
00:24:52 <Resynth[m]>  * Oh RIP
00:24:53 <Resynth[m]> So my 2 XL on Graphene isn't getting any more updates?
00:24:53 <Resynth[m]> Am I stuck with shit A11 forever?
00:25:25 <louipc> yea
00:25:59 <anon_reee> damn I need to get a new Pixel then lol
00:26:15 <anon_reee> but I don't want to. I don't even like smart phones
00:26:19 <louipc> yea get a pixel 5 and become device maintainer ;)
00:26:33 <anon_reee> I just use it because it's necessary for some things
00:26:34 <louipc> lol why are u here
00:26:48 <anon_reee> Signal, music when I'm out, phone calls etc
00:27:51 <anon_reee> just realised the battery can be removed from the device. I can do this when I'm not using it
00:28:03 <louipc> i guess signal requires a smartphone
00:28:13 <louipc> what device
00:28:17 <j0cye56[m]> anon_reee: Use a mp3 player for music and change your usage habity for signal and use it on a laptop then? Just get a dumb phone for calls.
00:28:17 <j0cye56[m]> The absolute number one factor why I want to use a smartphone is convenience.
00:29:02 <j0cye56[m]> https://ctrl.alt.coop/en/post/signal-without-a-smartphone/
00:29:20 <louipc> but then you will never have secure calls either
00:30:16 <anon_reee> oh nice. might try that thanks
00:30:27 <anon_reee> no calling? yeah that's a big deal I use it for this
00:32:17 <anon_reee> lol maybe I'll just bring a laptop around with me in my backpack and a wireless 4G modem when I need internet to check maps or something
00:32:38 <anon_reee> since I installed Graphene I've been using my phone way less, this would reduce it even more
00:33:43 <louipc> whats the point then.. just use a smartphone
00:33:54 <louipc> whats your secure os for laptop
00:34:10 <anon_reee> currently using Ubuntu but going to switch to Qubes soon
00:34:39 <anon_reee> yeah it's just a random idea
00:35:32 <j0cye56[m]> anon_reee: Don't say "lol" about that, I considered it.
00:36:25 <anon_reee> or just put your phone in a faraday bag until you need it maybe
00:39:57 <anon_reee> to confirm, does signal-cli work with voice/video calls? if so I'm going to use it
00:40:33 <louipc> dont think so
00:41:12 <louipc> i can use signal-desktop to leave a voice message only, not call. basically same as  sharing an audio file
00:41:27 <louipc> and there are other limitations
00:42:21 <louipc> but its nice just for (rich) text chat
00:43:00 <anon_reee> the new version lets you take calls
00:43:03 <anon_reee> they added it recently
00:43:19 <anon_reee> so I'm guessing signal-cli shouldn't have any issues if your device has a mic/camera?
00:44:55 <louipc> oh shiny new version
00:46:24 <louipc> but you can only chat with people that have signal, not the rest of your contacts
00:47:31 <louipc> unless there would be some feature to route messages through the phone...
00:47:33 <anon_reee> yeah, that doesn't bother me. I've coerced all my friends into switching, and anyone who doesn't I don't care to talk to them lmao
00:47:42 <louipc> which would be kinda neat
00:48:02 <louipc> goodjob
00:48:26 <anon_reee> also does anyone know if deleting your data from old accounts actually deletes it? such as from Google, or whatever. I'm wondering if it's worth the effort
00:49:57 <louipc> anon_reee: have you joined #grapheneos-offtopic yet?
00:50:04 <anon_reee> oh, sorry I haven't, I will
00:50:11 <louipc> kool
02:54:18 <Biv[m]> > basically, you don't want to see that
02:54:18 <Biv[m]> by the way I saw this earlier. Some have to have a carrier app to unlock
02:54:48 <Biv[m]> <joltman[m] "image.png"> in reference to this
02:55:12 <Biv[m]> god dammit. basically some phones need a carrier unlock app but are still unlockable
02:55:46 <Biv[m]> mine was like that. I downloaded some T-Mobile app and it checked eligibility and sent the unlock request, boom
02:59:32 <Biv[m]> so don't necessarily pack up your phone and send it back until you've tried to get the carrier to unlock it
02:59:50 <Biv[m]> although beware I've had at least one dumbass seller try to keep me from returning a phone
03:01:48 <Biv[m]> but I ended up getting a mint 3a for like $200
03:33:37 <joltman[m]> Carriers may carrier unlock phones for you, but I haven't heard many people have luck getting carriers to help them unlock the bootloader.
04:23:06 <Biv[m]> <joltman[m] "Carriers may carrier unlock phon"> it's an automated app
04:23:10 <Biv[m]> for T-Mobile anyways
04:23:27 <Biv[m]> I've also seen Motorola do the unlocking for you
04:23:45 <Biv[m]> they have a site that checks whether your phone is eligible from the carriers then gives you the code
04:42:24 <M8942w[m]> hi i'm trying to install GrapheneOS and somethings not working. i followed the youtube channel the hated one's guide up to clicking on flash-all. it brought up the black window but then it disappeared.

05:16:30 <renlord> can you run in cmdprompt and then show the logs?
05:24:18 <M8942w[m]> it is on a different device. i used the command prompt to unlock boot but flash-all brought up a different cmdprompt that was blank then disappeared
05:27:06 <M8942w[m]> should i come back on the pc doing this so i can copy the earlier command prompt that i did up to this?
05:31:43 <renlord> yes

14:56:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then we'll do a beta build
14:56:16 <ey_caramba[m]> I figured out that this was work in progress, but I was hoping to get a rough approximation.
14:57:02 <ey_caramba[m]> So I can get it in the next week or so?
14:57:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> <ey_caramba[m] "I figured out that this was work"> We've been having upstream bugs and I've had some issues
14:57:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> So the 4a bringup was a little slow

14:59:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipc "are you gonna be maintainer for "> Ask strcat
15:00:14 <louipc> ey_caramba[m]: i don't think theres any deadline
15:00:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mostly I'll be doing the initial bringup
15:01:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then a maintainer has to maintain it

15:01:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember that where I live pixels are pretty expensive

15:07:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'll still be listed as experimental for a while even if no new bugs are seen
15:07:59 <ey_caramba[m]> I can help testing.
15:10:07 <ey_caramba[m]> How can I help you with testing most efficiently?
15:11:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> [ey_caramba](https://matrix.to/#/@ey_caramba:matrix.org) ask your maintainer
15:11:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> [aeonsolution](https://matrix.to/#/@aeonsolution:matrix.org) will most likely be the maintainer
15:14:23 <j0cye56[m]> So, this phone doesn't have a carrier-lock: https://www.real.de/product/337533696/    ... but will I be able to unlock the bootloader no problems, right?
15:14:56 <ey_caramba[m]> Why are the phones in India so expensive?
15:15:21 <aeonsolution[m]> ey_caramba: if you want to help test, you should get familiar with building the development branch. https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch
15:15:50 <aeonsolution[m]> this is step 0 and is the advice i also give to those that want to contribute

15:16:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> You have to supply a build

15:20:14 <louipc> and that is the great power of git
15:20:33 <aeonsolution[m]> its problematic to rely on one person to supply builds
15:20:58 <aeonsolution[m]> when everyone can build on their own and collaborate via git
15:21:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "its problematic to rely on one p"> You are the maintainer. Figure test builds out if you want feedback from testers
15:21:14 <louipc> not all testers would be able to do builds tho
15:21:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> No tester is going to build and test for you
15:21:36 <louipc> actually relatively few of them

15:21:46 <louipc> a couple might but yea it will be rare
15:21:49 <aeonsolution[m]> its not for me tho
15:22:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> They may be developers if it is white box testing of some sort
15:22:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> But mostly all testers you will get will do blackbox testing

15:22:42 <louipc> its fine to ask them to build, but it shouldnt be a requirement
15:23:16 <ey_caramba[m]> Thanks you are amazing.
15:23:35 <j0cye56[m]> ey_caramba: I don't know either but I'm reading up on it now that you asked: https://archive.is/N19ub
15:23:35 <louipc> redu321[m]: sorry i dunno
15:23:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipc "its fine to ask them to build, b"> No it isn't
15:24:29 <louipc> anupritaisno1[m]: oh why not
15:24:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> It just adds "additional weight" that aeon was maybe trying to get rid of
15:24:39 <aeonsolution[m]> lol
15:24:43 <aeonsolution[m]> ok armchair
15:24:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> What if the tester takes a shortcut while building?
15:24:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> What if the tester doesn't follow the instructions correctly?
15:25:05 <louipc> hm what shortcut
15:25:07 <louipc> it helps test the build process too :p
15:25:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or messes up elsewhere?
15:25:34 <aeonsolution[m]> following the instructions on https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch is pretty straight forward
15:25:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipc "hm what shortcut"> There are many
15:25:45 <louipc> but yea in that case youre not testing the build itself, but the build process and the instructions
15:25:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like just flashing the images and forgetting to flash a few
15:25:59 <aeonsolution[m]> it also builds the group knowledge
15:25:59 <louipc> so it depends on what your goals are
15:26:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or not signing it correctly
15:26:11 <aeonsolution[m]> because just relying on you is not practical or pragmatic
15:26:22 <louipc> if your goal is to test a particular build, then you should only offer that image to test
15:26:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Forgetting to run android-prepare-vendor
15:26:33 <louipc> and NOT have anyone do the builds
15:26:37 <aeonsolution[m]> you dont even help with apv!
15:26:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "you dont even help with apv!"> You what?
15:27:10 <louipc> i dont help with anything but the irc :p
15:27:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> As the pixel 4 maintainer I've already finished all my tasks for pixel 4 on apv
15:27:41 <redu321[m]> i get anybody else who got stuck when trying to add fastboot to PATH?
15:27:56 <aeonsolution[m]> you help with apv pixel 4 and 4xl but you dont help with apv
15:28:10 <louipc> redu321[m]: well it didnt say 'unknown command'.. so something else seems wrong
15:28:23 <aeonsolution[m]> its an important distinction and its just for GrapheneOS
15:28:38 <aeonsolution[m]> like if you are going to armchair critic
15:28:46 <aeonsolution[m]> please be honest
15:29:21 <louipc> ok i think he's just trying to suggest that you offer the build to testers
15:29:30 <louipc> to make it easier for them to do testing
15:29:42 <aeonsolution[m]> we are talking about something else now
15:30:06 <aeonsolution[m]> its not about the testing anymore, its about him no offering help just critics in the most unhelpful way
15:30:29 <aeonsolution[m]>  * its not about the testing anymore, its about him not offering help just critics in the most unhelpful way
15:30:46 <louipc> he was talking about a tester that might not do a proper build
15:31:02 <louipc> and then have fake problems in the build because of that
15:31:27 <louipc> which would confuse the testing and issue tracking
15:32:02 <redu321[m]> did you all installed graphene thru powershell ot thru cmd?
15:32:15 <aeonsolution[m]> help the channel learn to do development builds is how we build up everyone's knowledge and support skills to triage the project
15:32:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> [redu321](https://matrix.to/#/@redu321:matrix.org) pm me if you'd like remote support
15:32:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "help the channel learn to do dev"> No
15:32:48 <louipc> aeonsolution[m]: i agree, but not everyone has that capacity or desire
15:33:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> It just increases the amount of support questions
15:33:22 <louipc> aeonsolution[m]: everyone has their own role right
15:33:30 <louipc> that they are most comfortable with
15:33:56 <louipc> and hopefully they can take on more roles and more contributions but it wont help to force it on them
15:34:07 <redu321[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "[redu321](https://matrix.to/#/@r"> can you send me a pm? I am new here
15:34:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> [louipc](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_louipc:matrix.org) so let's say you are a user
15:34:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I tell you to build the OS
15:34:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will you do it or will you just walk out the door?
15:35:07 <aeonsolution[m]> i didnt say users, i specifically said testers and developers
15:35:10 <louipc> like if i filed a bug report, then u told me to build it?
15:35:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is the maintainer's responsibility to prepare the software that will be tested
15:35:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> These are blackbox testers
15:35:40 <louipc> i would be like. dang.. sorry i got other things to do
15:35:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> They are not supposed to be concerned about implementation
15:35:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipc "like if i filed a bug report, th"> Yeah
15:36:03 <louipc> testers shouldnt need to be builders
15:36:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's pretty stupid
15:36:54 <aeonsolution[m]> lol
15:37:23 <aeonsolution[m]> my comment is just read what i said, if that is your interpretation then i dont know what to tell you
15:37:42 <louipc> but yea from a bug tracking standpoint i think it makes sense to stick to one build
15:37:53 <louipc> multiple build can mean multiple issues
15:38:20 <aeonsolution[m]> we are talking about bringing up devices not bugs
15:38:35 <aeonsolution[m]> thats why its a development build
15:38:57 <aeonsolution[m]> the whole conversation was about the Pixel 4a
15:39:08 <louipc> but you need to resolve issues in the build to bring it up right?
15:39:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Are you serious?
15:39:13 <echotunnelriver[> Wouldn't it be possible to have builds premade but suggest to people that think they are experienced and explicitly want to learn to make their own builds? Kind of works for what both of you are trying to do. You'll get more testers with the premade ones and then also potentially get some more advanced testers that will learn from optionally building their own? Speaking purely as an unbiased person here.
15:39:33 <louipc> echotunnelriver[: depends on the objective
15:39:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> [aeonsolution](https://matrix.to/#/@aeonsolution:matrix.org) no are you serious?
15:39:51 <louipc> if we are trying to train up developers then everyone should do their own builds
15:40:03 <louipc> if we are trying to bring up a device we should stick to one build
15:40:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> So you are going to send out builds you haven't tested yourself to testers?
15:40:30 <echotunnelriver[> <louipc "echotunnelriver: depends on the "> I see. I don't know enough about the topic to speak on it beyond what I just said. :P
15:40:32 <aeonsolution[m]> why are you trolling now
15:40:46 <aeonsolution[m]> when did i say that
15:41:10 <louipc> i think the problem is conflicting objectives here
15:42:01 <louipc> maybe we should take a break from the convo..
15:43:14 <redu321[m]> did people here used cmd or powershell to install graphene?
15:43:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> [redu321](https://matrix.to/#/@redu321:matrix.org) powershell
15:43:36 <aeonsolution[m]> use powershell, its recommended on the instructions
15:43:36 <louipc> redu321[m]: people here use bash usually.. i think
15:43:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipc "redu321: people here use bash us"> Lel

16:58:45 <j0cye56[m]> To get back on topic: I've decided for the 3a XL,  but I really don't know where to get one that is Carrier-Unlocked AND OEM-Unlockable. I have considered this: https://www.real.de/product/337533696/
16:58:45 <j0cye56[m]> But I am not sure about this "totoshop" that has been selling there for just 3 months. The Fuzhuohan528546⊙hc mail address isn't very confidence-inspiring either. The only secure way is to buy directly from Google, right?

17:03:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Really you're on your own
17:03:28 <j0cye56[m]> Okay, that's unfortunate. If all ties break then I might end up with a device that is literally not unlockable, right?
17:04:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> <j0cye56[m] "anupritaisno1: Sorry, I don't ge"> Glassrom tried to get wide device support
17:04:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> But apparently hardened ROMs have too many issues the moment you go away from pixel
17:05:19 <j0cye56[m]> Due to the stringency with which the hardware/firmware is implemented, right?
17:05:31 <j0cye56[m]> (Or lack thereof)
17:05:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <j0cye56[m] "Due to the stringency with which"> Other than oneplus, I'm surprised if a device even boots
17:06:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Most won't
17:07:06 <j0cye56[m]> Yeah, that's why I wanted to make sure. Maybe I can find user reviews from people that bought with the same intention as I did, but this is a serious issue that there is no way to really tell if you can run it.
17:07:21 <j0cye56[m]> Even on compatible-listed devices.

19:07:42 <madaidan[m]> Sus
19:08:06 <webweb> suspicious
19:08:15 <LinusSexTips[m]> Just tried now, doesnt seem to work, no
19:08:35 <webweb> curious. is it the gsf dependency perhaps?
19:09:23 <webweb> i’m downloading through aurora store onto a pixel 3a
19:09:32 <webweb> how about you?
19:18:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> [webweb](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_webweb:matrix.org) it won't work

19:24:51 <webweb> alright so it is not the fault of the among us devs
19:24:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unity does something weird with memory
19:25:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hardened malloc catches that
19:25:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> And aborts the program
19:25:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unity needs to fix it

20:54:22 <redu321[m]> Is there a option to factory reset the phone after typing your password of the phone multiple times wrong?
20:55:53 <dazinism> There is if you have a managed device.
20:56:36 <dazinism> Someone could expose the settings so they were available without that
20:57:04 <dazinism> Like the recent feature to logout of secondary user profiles
21:27:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> <redu321[m] "Is there a option to factory res"> Not needed
21:28:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is very hard to brute force even a simple password
21:29:27 <blacklight447[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It is very hard to brute force e"> As long as they do not beat the titan M right?
21:30:52 <redu321[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It is very hard to brute force e"> The phones of Encrochat were also possible to hack in to with physical acces because the chip was not secure i read in a article.

22:09:52 <lev[m]> there were good deals on pixel 4xl's on amazon, I believe clearing stock before the pixel 5 came out, so I got one... the page made it sound like these were ostensibly the google version, carrier agnostic, new in box
22:10:09 <lev[m]> I am gettin `FAILED (remote: 'Changing slot with snapshot applied may cancel the update.')`
22:10:15 <lev[m]> I am guessing that means this is a verizon variant?
22:11:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <lev[m] "I am gettin `FAILED (remote: 'Ch"> Seems legit
22:12:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Where are you getting the error?
22:12:25 <lev[m]> when `Setting current slot to 'b' `
22:12:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmmmm
22:12:48 <lev[m]> I vaguely remember there being talk of some bug with these devices that caused an issue like this?
22:12:58 <lev[m]> but I can't find where I read that
22:13:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's basically saying there was a system update in process
22:13:25 <lev[m]> oh... I updated it as much as possible
22:13:29 <lev[m]> and restarted
22:13:34 <lev[m]> but I can try that again?
22:13:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot reboot fastboot and switch slot inside fastbootd
22:15:41 <lev[m]> I restarted the bootloader, and it says the same thing
22:15:48 <lev[m]> ```╰─$ fastboot set_active b

22:18:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lev](https://matrix.to/#/@kdlev:matrix.org) so anyway
22:19:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> What phone did this happen on
22:19:20 <lev[m]> I am in fastbootd, am I meant to still do `fastboot set_active b` ?
22:19:23 <lev[m]> it's a pixel 4 xl
22:19:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
22:20:01 <lev[m]> ah now it says "snapshop update"

22:20:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even in fastbootd?
22:21:06 <lev[m]> yeah, I think?  the phone says fastbootd, and I ran `fastboot set_active b` in the terminal of the machine the phone is connected to
22:21:18 <lev[m]> or am I meant to intereact with fastbootd via the phone itself
22:23:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lev](https://matrix.to/#/@kdlev:matrix.org) just boot normally once
22:23:44 <lev[m]> kk
22:24:02 <lev[m]> I am guessing relocking the bootloader isn't necessary?
22:24:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or if that doesn't work there's other ways to get it to work
22:24:43 <lev[m]> but this isn't the behavior you'd expect from a verizon variant?
22:25:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> <lev[m] "but this isn't the behavior you'"> No you probably just interrupted a system update
22:25:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> So do what I'm telling you to do rn
22:25:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Boot the system fully once
22:25:38 <lev[m]> that is good news, I felt my heart sink lol
22:25:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then try again
22:26:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay well in case that doesn't work
22:26:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lev](https://matrix.to/#/@kdlev:matrix.org) you should be booted up by now
22:27:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Shut it down and go back to the bootloader

22:27:56 <lev[m]> I dunno for good measure
22:28:16 <lev[m]> anyway I am there

22:29:02 <lev[m]> same error
22:29:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lev](https://matrix.to/#/@kdlev:matrix.org) OK so do this
22:29:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Extract the zip that says image-coral whatever the fuck

22:33:27 <lev[m]> okay, happy that time
22:33:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Now run the flash command?
22:34:31 <lev[m]> flashing the avb_custom_key?  that worked fine, or do you mean the whole thing again
22:35:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> So it flashed?
22:35:12 <lev[m]> yep
22:35:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Now download this file https://releases.grapheneos.org/coral-ota_update-2020.10.06.02.zip
22:35:52 <lev[m]> okay, is downloaded and unzipped
22:36:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot reboot fastboot
22:36:55 <lev[m]> okay, rebooted and into fastbootd
22:38:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Use the volume buttons and go to enter recovery
22:38:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then go to apply update from adb

22:39:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> adb sideload coral-ota_update-2020.10.06.02.zip
22:39:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh yeah you don't need to extract that zip
22:39:27 <lev[m]> its going
22:39:29 <lev[m]> yeah heh, oh ell
22:39:32 <lev[m]>  * yeah heh, oh well
22:42:17 <lev[m]> okay, success
22:42:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Now go to wipe user data
22:42:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> And wipe
22:43:07 <lev[m]> done
22:43:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW did your titan m throw some weird errors?
22:43:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like failed to send spi message
22:43:55 <lev[m]> yeah there was a bunch of "cant send spi message, try again"
22:43:59 <lev[m]> btu then it said data wipe complete
22:44:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah I have those too
22:44:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway reboot to system now
22:46:20 <lev[m]> "android system: there is an internal problem with your device, contact your manufacturer for details"
22:46:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Probably some kind of bootloader mismatch
22:47:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Did you boot grapheneos?
22:47:26 <lev[m]> no, it's the normal google setup wizard
22:50:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lev](https://matrix.to/#/@kdlev:matrix.org) try switching slot in bootloader?
22:53:02 <lev[m]> oh it let me switch to b now
22:56:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lev](https://matrix.to/#/@kdlev:matrix.org) so do one thing
22:57:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Try to sideload it again
22:57:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> That should overwrite the google stock ROM
22:57:31 <lev[m]> kk tying
22:57:37 <lev[m]>  * kk trying
23:01:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> So [critic](https://matrix.to/#/@critic:matrix.org) you're up now?
23:01:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> We can start a subset of the testing right away, in like an hour
23:04:16 <lev[m]> hmmm so I think this somehow failed
23:04:27 <lev[m]> changed the slot, did the sideload, looked like it was fine
23:04:50 <lev[m]> wiped userdata, tried to boot, and it failed (just restarted instantly) and I'm back to the google setup wizard
23:06:58 <lev[m]> oh no, there was a failure with the sideload:
23:06:58 <lev[m]> `serving: 'coral-ota_update-2020.10.06.02.zip'  (~94%)    adb: failed to read command: Success`
23:07:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lev](https://matrix.to/#/@kdlev:matrix.org) BTW you must reboot after changing slots
23:07:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise it doesn't work
23:07:25 <lev[m]> I did I believe
23:07:42 <lev[m]> I'll try it again
23:08:24 <lev[m]> I want it to be "b" right?
23:08:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> > <@kdlev:matrix.org> oh no, there was a failure with the sideload:
23:08:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> > `serving: 'coral-ota_update-2020.10.06.02.zip'  (~94%)    adb: failed to read command: Success`
23:08:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is fine, not an error
23:08:48 <lev[m]> that's what I thoguht at first, but it differed from the success state last time
23:08:58 <lev[m]> but yeah, I want slot "b" ?
23:09:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> <lev[m] "but yeah, I want slot "b" ?"> No
23:10:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lev](https://matrix.to/#/@kdlev:matrix.org) if it allowed you to switch slot
23:10:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe the flash script works now
23:10:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> So try that again
23:10:33 <lev[m]> kk
23:11:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> What the fuck
23:11:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> git needs 11 GB of ram to rebase sunfish
23:11:38 <lev[m]> it's making it further now I think
23:12:05 <louipc> ouch
23:12:17 <lev[m]> I have no context to know how outrageous or not that is
23:12:47 <lev[m]> but ram is pretty cheap these days, 32gb was like $120 for high freq low cas latency
23:12:51 <lev[m]>  * but ram is pretty cheap these days, 32gb was like $120 for high freq, low cas latency
23:15:59 <lev[m]> eureka!  it did work
23:16:22 <lev[m]> that was moderately stressful, I was convinced I got sold a verizon model and wasted money I'd never get back
23:23:43 <lev[m]> all looking good, thanks a million anupritaisno1 !
23:29:03 <seashield[m]> lev: He's great, he helped me out too.
23:33:16 <madaidan[m]> He called me a coomer :(
23:33:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lev](https://matrix.to/#/@kdlev:matrix.org) remember to lock your bootloader
23:33:45 <lev[m]> yep, I did so
23:34:14 <lev[m]> restoring from backup was impressive too, there's still configuration items I need to go and fix, but it definitely did the bulk of the work
23:40:50 <LogsOnVar[m]> Does anyone knows if I can install and run microG core on GrapheneOS?
23:40:50 <LogsOnVar[m]> Sorry is this is an awful question, but I'm a newbie on this.
23:40:59 <LogsOnVar[m]> if**
23:42:38 <jacksen> High to all.
23:43:13 <jacksen> Just wish to ask does #grapheneos  allow running of accessibility services such as talkback which is a screen reader.
23:44:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> [jacksen](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_jacksen:matrix.org) yes
23:45:03 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/kWAPgPDOYxLfvBqLbRlgWcwT/message.txt >
23:48:03 <jacksen> Is this check disabled due to other librarys  from accessibility services messing with things?
23:48:16 <jacksen> Meaning the signiture spoofing
23:51:50 <jacksen> and is the signature spoofing permission important for me to have? will it be a security wrisk if i do not have this
23:53:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically most apps won't work at all
23:53:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> But if you just want microg for something like google camera
23:53:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> It will work

23:57:43 <LogsOnVar[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "But if you just want microg for "> Tbh I just wanted to use it for GMaps, nothing more.
23:59:12 <LinusSexTips[m]> follow the instructions on the website
23:59:25 <LinusSexTips[m]> you need to use powershell to run the script
23:59:52 <LogsOnVar[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Basically most apps won't work a"> Do you know if Google Maps work?  That's the only Google Service I really depend on for now
