00:41:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Lia[m] "gotta flatten them all"> Flat is justice
00:42:58 <jayell[m]> also,you or anyone. i need to know what channel i could find help with .vcf files. when i first moved contacts from old phone to copperhead years ago i exported 1200 contacts but when i clicked the .vcf file on copperhead pixel2 i only ended up with 921. no output at all, no errors just alot less contacts. whole blocks of the alphabet were missing. i erroneously clicked it again and got same quantity. only shows one
00:42:58 <jayell[m]> "frank smith' but when i go edit that contact it shows two choices. so i think they are all in there twice. i need a tool to edit and remove these duplicates that i have. of course over last several years i have modified many of them. then i would like to merge the older, more complete (at least then!)  .vcf from older phone. any ideas?
00:45:06 <TheJollyRoger> Hi jayell[m], I'm unfortunately not aware of any better app than the contacts app in graphene, but if you need to, you can simply open them in a text editor, just you have to be extremely careful not to break the formatting or you will break the file.
00:45:15 <TheJollyRoger> Someone else is going to have to chime in here for me, sadly. :(
00:47:34 <jayell[m]> i believe its just a form of xml, is that correct?
00:49:03 <TheJollyRoger> I think it is plain text, but there are form fields to fill out.
00:49:53 <cicadasolver[m]> jayell: there are some good apps that do that
00:50:00 <cicadasolver[m]> but this is off-topic

04:06:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hi anonymous821[m] I don't have that issue on Blueline (Pixel 3) or Flame (Pixel 4). Searching for a contact brings up their name, then tapping on the name or the icon or profile picture brings up their contact card.

04:10:58 <TheJollyRoger> Same. I'm on stable for Blueline, and Beta for Flame. But these are different devices so stick around and let's see if anyone else experiences this. I'll see if there are any settings that can be changed.

05:16:54 <furlongsperfortn> surely a dumb mistake
05:17:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy furlongsperfortn , it looks like the files are not in the right place. You'll need to have all three files in the same directory, and have that directory be your working directory, in order for signify to work.
05:18:10 <madd_hatter[m]> Ok think I understand.   When you get a search query return it has an icon and then name etc.  If you click on icon you get the card but click on actual name or the txt you go to active call

05:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> furlongsperfortn: There should be three files, you'll need. The first one is factory.pub. That's the public key. The second one, is the file that ends in .sig and has the name of the factory release image that you downloaded. It's the digital signature file. The third one is the factory image itself, the zip file.
05:22:29 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need those three. Signify will verify the factory image using the digital signature using the factory.pub file.
05:23:19 <TheJollyRoger> If the contents of factory.pub match what's been posted on GrapheneOS.org's social media (Twitter page, official reddit account, Github page), you've got a pretty good chance that you got the right one!
05:23:51 <TheJollyRoger> anonymous821[m]: I haven't fooled around with the dialer or contact apps much, but I don't think it's a bug...?
05:23:57 <furlongsperfortn> <TheJollyRoger "furlongsperfortnight: There shou"> great thank you for that clarification Jolly Roger. if i may inquire further... where do i get the factory.pub file since my package manager didn't ?
05:24:07 <furlongsperfortn> *didn't install it
05:24:15 <furlongsperfortn> an its not on the release page
05:24:22 <furlongsperfortn> ahhhh its on the github
05:25:49 <furlongsperfortn> or is it... 🤦‍♂️...investigating further
05:26:09 <TheJollyRoger> furlongsperfortn: There are several locations where the lead developer has mirrored the genuine, real release key. Obviously, the easiest and most convenient location is on the GrapheneOS installation page, here https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-factory-images where it shows you the content of factory.pub.
05:26:37 <TheJollyRoger> The other places you can find it would be on Daniel Micay's twitter page, at https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS and I think the tweet is pinned somewhere.
05:26:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, you can also find it at the Github!
05:26:49 <TheJollyRoger> The last place it's posted should be at the Reddit.
05:27:36 <TheJollyRoger> It's posted multiple places so that hopefully, in the event of a disaster, the more places it's posted in, the harder it would be for a bad actor to manipulate all of the pages.
05:30:15 <furlongsperfortn> <TheJollyRoger "The other places you can find it"> huzza it has been verified (with the one posted in the install documentation)
05:30:25 <TheJollyRoger> Fantastic!
05:30:38 <furlongsperfortn> <TheJollyRoger "Fantastic!"> i actually couldn't find it on the github lol
05:30:43 <furlongsperfortn> thank you so much

05:32:51 <madd_hatter[m]> Does anyone know where we are at in dev with enacting 2 factor lockscreen/scrnlk?
05:32:51 <madd_hatter[m]> I never will be a fan of any biometric or something physical unless it also requires something known.  I am no fan of short convenient something you know(4-6 digit pin etc) without a failed attempt counter that then requires proper high entropy password after limit is reached.
05:32:51 <madd_hatter[m]> Honestly  I thought ASOP would have done this by now.  Set a high entropy password.  Then have the option to set a quick unlock pin to authenticate to the lockscrn.  Be able to config failed attempt counter from 1-10
05:34:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hi madd_hatter[m] at this moment we don't have an ETA on that feature. It's open for anyone else to create and submit the code, help is wanted.
05:36:44 <madd_hatter[m]> I wish I was a coder but I was a network engineer and enterprise infrastructure and dev
05:37:13 <madd_hatter[m]> I would be willing to fund it getting done to a point.
05:37:14 <renlord> Don't you write code for things like that?
05:39:29 <madd_hatter[m]> Scripts etc but not actual coding.   Its one of my regrets I really need to address.  I did a very small trival amount on the qubesos project but iit was what I would consider very basic
05:40:08 <renlord> What even is the difference.
05:40:49 <renlord> The latter is probably easier than scripting.
05:45:30 <madd_hatter[m]> You are correct basically, all scripting languages are programming languages.  I guess its more theory.  I guess really it would cone down compiled vs not.
05:45:30 <madd_hatter[m]> I just never looked deep into whats needed for Android, to be honest.
05:45:30 <madd_hatter[m]> What language is preferable to use?
05:47:22 <renlord> For the feature you're requesting, java.
05:57:50 <madd_hatter[m]> Ok then guess I will start reading up and practice.  Guess I will setup my sdk on another laptop to work off.
05:58:11 <madd_hatter[m]> I certainly have the time.
05:58:18 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo! Go madd_hatter[m] go!

09:31:19 <dar_gomml[m]> just follow the guide step by step

09:49:49 <nfpdex[m]> it worked now, yes seems that was it

10:40:50 <nfpdex[m]> it is easy.
10:40:52 <nscnt> nfpdex[m]: Have you tried another USB port?
10:40:55 <nfpdex[m]> the guide is good.
10:41:04 <nfpdex[m]> yes, tried all the ports
10:41:13 <nfpdex[m]> "fastboot devices" does not print anything
10:41:25 <nfpdex[m]> And I have tried different cables
10:41:35 <nfpdex[m]> I bought a new, high quality one too.
10:42:05 <nfpdex[m]> When the phone is on, the laptop can see and access it immediately.
10:42:13 <nfpdex[m]> but now in fastboot mode, nothing.
10:42:23 <nscnt> You've unlocked the bootloader?
10:42:35 <nfpdex[m]> yes
10:42:46 <nfpdex[m]> yesterday on another device I unlocked the bootloader
10:42:49 <nfpdex[m]> and could not lock it back up
10:42:57 <nfpdex[m]> with the help of people here.
10:43:06 <nfpdex[m]> they said, try another laptop with proper usb 3 ports etc.
10:43:21 <nfpdex[m]> and now I am here and it doesnt find the device. :(
10:44:11 <nscnt> nfpdex[m]: If you were able to unlock the bootloader, I don't really know what's the issue. I mean... It were able to recognize the device.
10:44:45 <nfpdex[m]> yes it was on the other laptop yesterday. but on usb 2 only. usb 3 did not recognize it.
10:44:57 <nfpdex[m]> and on usb 2 the flashing could be initiated. but that did not work
10:45:09 <nfpdex[m]> on usb 3 it could not recognize it
10:45:17 <nfpdex[m]> and on this newer laptop here it does not recognize it on any port.
10:48:21 <nfpdex[m]> so now ideas what I can do next?
10:48:25 <nfpdex[m]> *no
10:48:35 <nscnt> No. I don't know how I could support you any further, I'm sorry.
10:51:31 <nscnt> This would be just a really wild guess: I noticed that drivers often just get installed when a device is first connected to the Windows computer. Maybe -- if the phone is already in the bootloader first time connecting it -- Windows isn't able to recognize is as a device at all so no drivers. I'm really unsure, tho.
10:52:56 <nscnt> That would bring the to the conclusion that you should boot up your phone regularly and connect it once to the PC. IF my premise is even right in the first place
10:54:53 <nfpdex[m]> when I connect it this way, at least the laptop recognize it as a pixel 3
10:54:55 <nfpdex[m]> and I can copy stuff on it
10:55:08 <nfpdex[m]> it does not show anything related to installing drivers or something
10:55:42 <damienrg[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/58mp7o/pixel_xl_wont_connect_to_windows_10_pc/
10:56:08 <nscnt> nfpdex[m]: Then it should be fine I guess. The "installing driver" may be just for a quick second anyway.

11:05:30 <nfpdex[m]> ?
11:11:34 <damienrg[m]> yes use `adb devices`. For sure it works when you are in recovery, I do not remember if it does work in fastboot mode.
11:11:51 <nfpdex[m]> but it need to be in fastboot mode to flash it
11:11:54 <nfpdex[m]> right?
11:13:26 <damienrg[m]> yes
11:16:49 <nfpdex[m]> google protect is on. does this say anything?
11:24:07 <damienrg[m]> when I boot the phone normally I can do: adb devices (my device is listed)
11:24:08 <damienrg[m]> Then I can do: `adb reboot bootloader`
11:24:08 <damienrg[m]> And then: fastboot devices
11:24:59 <nfpdex[m]> with boot normally you mean you type adb devices in your shell while the phone is already in android?
11:25:11 <damienrg[m]> <nfpdex[m] "with boot normally you mean you "> yes
11:25:31 <nfpdex[m]> I try it. I found another security update now. Maybe this helps.

15:54:48 <cenapatop689[m]> Hmm ... what should I do
15:56:04 <Golli[m]> From a first glance, it looks like they're trying to make a mobile system like Qubes OS.
15:56:49 <cenapatop689[m]> A bit
16:49:35 <nscnt> cenapatop689[m]: To keep it somewhat ontopic: You may use different profiles to isolate apps. Every profile has it's own space for storage. It's recommended to give apps as few privileges as possible. Having an app as an Device Admin (what Shelter is) is rather much privileged.
16:53:39 <nscnt> That app is not included with GrapheneOS which brings us to offtopic, by the way. You're already in there anyway.
16:54:42 <malicoye[m]> How much faster (if any) is 4a against 3? My 3 nags me. Daily tasks frequently take longer than I wanted them to be
16:55:10 <malicoye[m]> Especially if I take my wife's iphone for few minutes
16:56:12 <nscnt> malicoye[m]: If I remember correctly from a user: A lot faster.
16:57:38 <nscnt> malicoye[m]: I have an Pixel 3a. Thus mine should be slower than yours. It's fine in my opinion. Have you tried disabling animations? It gives a 'faster' feeling.
16:59:24 <bantamanjyo[m]> <malicoye[m] "How much faster (if any) is 4a a"> I just upgraded from the 3 to 4a. I'd say the speed is comparable. It seems to take a little longer to install software but I can live with that. The upside for me is the better screen and the battery life. I've gone from charging every night to every other night with my use.
17:03:13 <malicoye[m]> <bantamanjyo[m] "I just upgraded from the 3 to 4a"> I have 3XL. So, speed is about the same ? No improvements?
17:06:15 <bantamanjyo[m]> <malicoye[m] "I have 3XL. So, speed is about t"> I'm only really going on feel. It doesn't feel appreciably speedier in my opinion. Maybe some benchmarks out there could corroborate.
17:11:50 <malicoye[m]> Ok. Thanks. Deal breaker for me
17:35:42 <nfpdex[m]> Hey. How do I know that I have the latest version?
18:10:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hi nfpdex[m], the easiest way to check if you have the latest release of GrapheneOS is to compare your build number (To find it, go to Settings -> About Phone -> Build Number) and compare it to what's on GrapheneOS.org's releases.
18:12:49 <TheJollyRoger> It should look something like "RP1A.201105.002.2020.11.05.18" - it should follow that same formatting. The update client that's built into the operating system on your phone will occasionally ping GrapheneOS.org and look for newer versions, but you can choose to only download them when you're on WiFi by setting your update client to only permit "Unmetered" Networks for download.
18:13:53 <TheJollyRoger> This is so you don't end up doing what I did once and blowing a big chunk of your phone data allotment in a single night when a new release is up.
18:15:04 <TheJollyRoger> The update client will just let you know when a new version has been loaded. All you need to do then is just reboot your phone once.
18:16:01 <TheJollyRoger> Aside from that it's all automatic and operates transparently.
18:17:00 <malicoye[m]> OS updates on GrapheneOS is something even big Trillion dollar wales should have a look at
18:17:27 <malicoye[m]> It's seamless
18:23:08 <TheJollyRoger> Indeed!
19:57:13 <dmctrl[m]> Is there a list of UK carriers that are supported for GrapheneOS?
20:01:55 <dmctrl[m]> My guess would be that all carriers that are supported by stock Android are supported by GrapheneOS, but I just want to confirm
20:02:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hi dmctrl[m], GrapheneOS will support any carrier that does not require privileged management drivers to be installed on the phone and that your phone supports the frequencies for.
20:03:15 <jay55> how can i root graphene os ?
20:03:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hello jay55, rooting will never be supported on GrapheneOS.
20:04:09 <TheJollyRoger> You are on your own for that; if you wish to have a rooted GrapheneOS build, you will need to fork the entire project and create your own.
20:04:35 <jay55> what about calyxos ?
20:05:14 <TheJollyRoger> dmctrl[m]: so the long story short, if it works on an off-the-shelf phone purchased from google, there's a very good chance it will work with GrapheneOS
20:05:37 <TheJollyRoger> jay55: I can't offer you any advice or insights into other non-GrapheneOS operating systems here, unfortunately.
20:05:47 <jay21> did you respond i disconeected ?
20:06:23 <TheJollyRoger> Hello jay21, yeah, I'll repost. I can't offer you any advice or insights into other non GrapheneOS operating systems here, unfortunately. If you like though I do have a bit of a shpiel on rooting.
20:06:48 <TheJollyRoger> The short version is: "Don't." The long version is: "DOOOOOOOOONNNNNNN'T!!!!"
20:07:37 <TheJollyRoger> If you are determined to do root, you will need to fork the code and do your own self-signed builds, and take responsibility into your own hands, but you'll be on your own for this.
20:08:10 <jay21> whats wrong with routing ?
20:08:11 <TheJollyRoger> App-accessible root increases the attack surface and also is mutually exclusive with security measures such as verified boot and OTA updates.
20:08:45 <jay21> okay
20:09:26 <TheJollyRoger> Under normal circumstances, should your phone be compromised at the root level, the verified boot should revert any harmful or malicious changes upon restarting the phone;
20:09:44 <TheJollyRoger> remember, each installation of GrapheneOS is signed, verified, and bitwise identical for that specific device.
20:10:06 <TheJollyRoger> Furthermore, the builds are reproducible.
20:11:21 <TheJollyRoger> However, if you decide to do app-accessible root, any compromise essentially becomes persistent. Hypothetically, this could be done via clickjacking through the accessibility services.
20:13:31 <TheJollyRoger> So what's what's wrong with rooting is that GrapheneOS and the regular Android implements a very multilayered "defense in depth" strategy that not only tries to implement multiple levels of containment, sandboxing, and isolation, verification, and even tries to undo the damage post-compromise in a transparent fashion, and rooting essentially destroys that.
20:14:08 <TheJollyRoger> Even if you were to find a way to root the phone via an exploit, any changes you make to the system image will be undone upon the next reboot.
20:15:34 <jay21> cant even get out of fast book with that magisk
20:18:58 <TheJollyRoger> jay21: I hope this helps. Once again, if you'd like to customize GrapheneOS, you should learn to patch and compile the operating system, and do self-signed builds. However, you're no longer running GrapheneOS at that point.
20:19:20 <TheJollyRoger> I have some basic notes on this if you would like to see them.
20:19:41 <TheJollyRoger> And there are tutorials on building GrapheneOS available on the site.
20:23:40 <TheJollyRoger> If you have a function that requires privileges beyond what's normal for an Android app, the correct way to do it is to write a privileged extension which can then provide the functionality while following the principle of least privilege which may then communicate with the app, not to give the app what essentially amounts to domain over the entire phone and having to turn off verified boot and
20:23:42 <TheJollyRoger> OTA updates because of it.
20:24:42 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, my knowledge ends there.
20:27:34 <TheJollyRoger> So I can't tell you how you would go about incorporating a privileged extension into the operating system. That would likely need to be written from scratch and patched into the operating system prior to compiling.
20:28:03 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, you'll be maintaining a fork at that point, and taking on all that responsibility yourself.
20:28:59 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not a developer so I can't be more exact, but I am going to say: if you do that, that's a full-time job in and of itself.
20:29:15 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to do it with comparable security to a production quality operating system.
20:29:28 <TheJollyRoger> And that's assuming your privileged extension and the app it communicates with it is already done.
20:41:52 * yzrhjocizuwkjlqo sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/kQJvwTaTrxXvgdSzChKSwqWv/message.txt >
20:42:16 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> I'm just an ordinary guy caring about security and not some kind of target. So doesn't need something extreme.
20:42:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hello yzrhjocizuwkjlqo, it's something a matter of perspective and what your priorities are.
20:43:55 <TheJollyRoger> If you were recommending a phone to your 80-year-old grandma who's never used a computer in her life except to fill out punchcards for her tax returns, then by all means I'd probably recommend her an iPhone, because I would not trust my grandparents to understand how to search for, verify, and sideload apps on their phone and keep them up to date.
20:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> (At the present time, that is, until we get a first-party app store)
20:45:03 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "Hello yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf, it's s"> I know nothing is ever considered fully secure. But would you say that "stock Android" like on a pixel is considered secure and private if configured properly? (Disable privacy invasive stuff on Google account etc) or is GrapheneOS the only way to go besides iPhones?
20:46:12 <TheJollyRoger> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: I will understandably be biased here and take my words with a grain of salt, but yes. It is possible to set up the factory operating system on a Pixel to be fairly privacy-respecting. Much of the data that Google is collecting is not done without you opting into it, and much of it is capable of being switched off.
20:46:51 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS aims to build on this -- GrapheneOS is much more than "Android without Google". The point of GrapheneOS is to greatly improve the security (and in doing so, the privacy) characteristics of the Android Open Source Project.
20:47:00 <TheJollyRoger> This includes deep and drastic changes across the entire software stack.
20:47:12 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "This includes deep and drastic c"> Like hardened malloc etc?
20:47:16 <TheJollyRoger> for instance, the memory allocator in GrapheneOS has been rewritten from the ground up to -- yes.
20:47:54 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> But is iOS considered more secure than using stock android like on a Pixel?
20:48:10 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Just since I often see in here it-s Graphene->iOS->Stock Android
20:48:13 <TheJollyRoger> One of the parts of the design philosophy at GrapheneOS is that software on its own cannot be trusted, and we should be willing to let go of backwards compatibility for the sake of mitigating exploits.
20:48:31 <TheJollyRoger> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: Yep, well don't forget, we're also going to be understandably biased here ;).
20:48:57 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: Yep, well do"> But why biased towards iOS? 🥴
20:49:13 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Considered to stock I mean
20:49:40 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> I know you guys made a wiki or something long time ago. Is it to be found anywhere?
20:49:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I'll have to ping dazinism.
20:50:04 <TheJollyRoger> Hey dazinism uh... do you have the link handy? I lost my bookmarks collection, uh... again >_<
20:51:36 <TheJollyRoger> Apple tends to be very attentive with the way they handle information. A bit back they started revisiting the way they collect error reports and crash data because they realized that even "anonymous" bug reports were capable of de-anonymizing the users based heuristics and took steps to not only reduce the amount of data collected, but also introduce enough randomosity into the reports to do
20:51:38 <TheJollyRoger> so, and they've been forcing Google to up their game by starting to do things like forcing app developers to disclose what they collect.
20:52:07 <TheJollyRoger> *enough randomosity into the reports to reduce the likelihood of deanonymizing or tracing their users,
20:53:06 <TheJollyRoger> The last I had heard of it from Daniel Micay, the Pixels and the iPhones are both extremely close to each other in terms of being resistant to being penetrated, and it's a very, VERY complex and nuanced subject, one that entire university PHD thesises could be written on, but they're comparable.
20:53:27 <TheJollyRoger> I suppose a lot of people here like them because a lot of people here are understandably mistrustful of Google or immediately jump to the conclusion that Google is the enemy.
20:53:40 <TheJollyRoger> So really, it will depend on who you ask and this crowd tends to trend a certain way.
20:55:20 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Yeah, my problem is not that I see Google as the enemy. But their business model is still ads and while they might not care that a few people opt out, they will work towards non-privacy features if enough people do so.
20:55:20 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> They don't put the privacy stuff in there because of good will or business
20:55:58 <TheJollyRoger> Company stuff and corporate politics I'd prefer not to get into at this moment in time.
20:56:11 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> I don't want to start any myths so i'm asking out of pure curiosity. I don't want to spread FUD based on non proof.  But...
20:56:11 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Is there anything that show there might be backdoors in either Android or iOS? Is it ever researched and disproven? Impossible to prove? Or
20:57:16 <TheJollyRoger> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: the big thing with respect to security is that we can never prove something is secure, only prove that it's insecure, and what keeps something secure, are people actively working on finding holes and patching them as quickly as possible in the hopes that they can stay ahead of people who are learning to break in for the wrong reasons.
20:57:55 <TheJollyRoger> As for it being researched and disproven, that's what GrapheneOS is here for; GrapheneOS started as a project to do research on and improve the security characteristics of the Android Open Source Project, shortly around 2014.
20:58:12 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> I see. Thanks for your insight
20:58:35 <TheJollyRoger> Eventually it became clear that more drastic design decisions that ran contrary to the goals of the Android Open Source Project would need to be made, and that slowly morphed into the GrapheneOS you see and know today.
20:58:48 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
20:59:58 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Do you think GrapheneOS will get it harder and harder over time, by Google moving more and more into Play Services and not possible to pass safetynet as it's not implemented?
21:00:29 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> I just mean, I know it holds me back that some of my apps don't work, that I need in my day to day life and I can't see this get better
21:00:30 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to backdoors, the one thing I say about that is that the term "backdoor" is a boogeyman term thrown around by privacy neckbeards to scare people. In practice, real backdoors don't actually look like `function.call{im_the_nsa_let_me_in}` but instead tend to look like small and "innocent" mistakes which can often be used in conjunction with other small and similarly "innocent"
21:00:32 <TheJollyRoger> mistakes.
21:00:50 <TheJollyRoger> Often to the point where a backdoor won't look like a backdoor anymore, but instead, look like a bug.
21:01:04 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> I mean sure, the standard like mail etc work and lots of other stuff work. But sensitive stuff like wallet, banking, driver licens, government ID is blocked in my country
21:01:39 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "With respect to backdoors, the o"> Yeah, I read about the underhanded C contest, where you put in backdoors that look like legitimate code
21:01:49 <TheJollyRoger> The NSA learned a hard lesson from 2006: if you abuse public trust, people won't give you the chance to do so a second time. So people screaming about "backdoors" on subreddits like r/privacy are really talking >15 years out of date.
21:01:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
21:02:20 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo "Yeah, I read about the underhand"> But well, known exploits is still in some software today
21:02:53 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "Often to the point where a backd"> But does that change anything really? I mean, it's still there
21:02:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. Unfortunately, there's not always enough manpower and people submitting code.
21:03:49 <TheJollyRoger> It doesn't. In a nutshell, what I'm saying is, take a pragmatic view on things and realize that no system is perfect, and you'll have to know when something's above your threat model.
21:04:00 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "The NSA learned a hard lesson fr"> Yeah, I remember Daniel talked about this shortly. He couldn't see why backdoors was needed anymore, as there were thousands of bugs in modern software like OS, Browsers etc and if you got the best hackers and unlimited money, you will get in.
21:04:04 <TheJollyRoger> Because if you threat model for your deepest, darkest, most desperate fantasies, you will never be satisfied, nor will you ever meet your threat model.
21:04:37 <TheJollyRoger> And likely, threat modelling for your deepest, darkest, most desperate attack fantasies will only lead to you playing "alone in the dark."
21:05:15 <TheJollyRoger> For some people, that's what they want, but I prefer to have a cellphone and be able to lead a relatively normal life.
21:05:16 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "Because if you threat model for "> Yeah I see. I'm trying to find an in between r/privacy and the casual person not caring at all. Basing my decisions on facts instead of fear mongering
21:05:47 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, and it sounds like you've definitely going about this the right way!
21:06:39 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "Arr, and it sounds like you've d"> I guess you know the drill i'm talking about like "LINUX IS SECURE. WINDOWS IS BACKDOORED". I don't want to go there. But if you just read r/privacy, it's an easy route
21:06:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(
21:07:02 <nfpdex[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Because if you threat model for "> I would say, stuff like your deepest, darkest, most desperate fantasies just shouldnt be on any machine anyway.
21:07:42 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> TheJollyRoger: will you ping me, when dazinism answers, if he don't ping me?
21:08:01 <TheJollyRoger> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: sure.
21:08:47 <TheJollyRoger> nfpdex[m]: heh, well, I mean "deepest, darkest, most desperate fantasies" as in like, the way many privacy know-it-alls try to threat model for being attacked by the CIA, when really, they just don't know how to prioritize.
21:09:07 <TheJollyRoger> Or when people try to pretend that they're Indiana Jones.
21:09:20 <TheJollyRoger> Or think they're in a movie.
21:10:00 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "nfpdex: heh, well, I mean "deepe"> I think some people also want to feel a little too important. Like, those Agencies is focusing on threats to the whole  country and not caring about some random person using encrypted mail. Not even if you stole a car once..
21:10:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yes!
21:10:14 <TheJollyRoger> Aw man, I totally agree!
21:13:17 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> A side I really like is https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/index.html from madaidan.
21:13:17 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> He is trying to spread the myth from the facts, while giving actual advice with sources and not spreading FUD like WINDOWS IS BACKDOORED
21:13:25 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
21:13:39 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo>  * A website I really like is https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/index.html from madaidan.
21:13:39 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> He is trying to spread the myth from the facts, while giving actual advice with sources and not spreading FUD like WINDOWS IS BACKDOORED
21:14:17 <nfpdex[m]> I think my reason for doing this is more like a principle. I do not really have a specific "threat model", although I only learned about this here and I am thankful for that, because its quite useful. But I just want to use secure software/hardware and do not use anti-privacy stuff because I consider it wrong ethical. Its this sort of: "I dont give a fuck that corps use me and my data because I cannot do anything anyway
21:14:17 <nfpdex[m]> about it or I am not interesting anyway blabla". So for me its not about keeping myself safe, but just supporting the things that should be a standard really.
21:14:30 <TheJollyRoger> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: same here! He's good!
21:14:58 <TheJollyRoger> nfpdex[m]: Also agreed!
21:15:47 <TheJollyRoger> The way I've kinda seen it, computers are at this point an extension of our own minds, and social lives. Having agency in our own minds and social circles is akin to freedom of speech, freedom of movement, and freedom of association, which are foundational in democratic process.
21:16:26 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <nfpdex[m] "I think my reason for doing this"> Yeah, I agree. It's kinda out of principle. For me it's also against the mass surveillance. Like sure, go for my data. But you need to target me specifically instead of asking Facebook for all my messages
21:16:58 <TheJollyRoger> Without going too much into politics there, even if we stay out of the political side of things, even without bad governments, there are definitely still going to be bad people out there to protect against!
21:17:01 <nfpdex[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The way I've kinda seen it, comp">  Did you just read permanent record? :P
21:17:23 <TheJollyRoger> nfpdex[m]: I haven't. But I wouldn't be surprised if that line mirrors what's in it.
21:17:58 <snoodledoodle[m]> There's also the fact that you pay hundreds if not thousands for a pocket pc(name before iPhone) you have no control over. Surveillance happens regardless of OS as it's wireless
21:18:52 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "Without going too much into poli"> Sure, I just meant. Lots of privacy invasive stuff is still pretty secure like Android while opted in and Facebook etc. For real, most people won't be hacked by using Google/Facebook services. But their privacy might take a hit (even if they don't know)
21:19:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(
21:20:02 <nfpdex[m]> <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo "Yeah, I agree. It's kinda out of"> Yes. I just dont like the attitude of many people who basically either ignore these problems or just give up. And most of the time their reason is like: I do not do it, because everyone else is also not doing it. Like "I do not use signal, i do not delete whatsapp, because no one has signal, everyone has whatsapp." But when they just would be a little, little less
21:20:03 <nfpdex[m]> lazy and would at least use signal ADDITONALLY, and if everyone would do that, they could overcome whatsapp really fast. And its just an example. They same would be possible with all kinds of things, if people were just a little bit less lazy and a bit more open to change something.
21:20:49 <nfpdex[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nfpdex: I haven't. But I wouldn'"> yes. It was a very good read. And it made me even more conscious of these problems.
21:20:54 <snoodledoodle[m]> Education is power. Civilizations work on enlightenment or mass slavery of the populous like rome
21:21:02 <TheJollyRoger> Hey guys, I think I'll continue this in the -offtopic channel, actually.
21:21:06 <snoodledoodle[m]> Most people don't know about spyware as schools don't teach them and won't
21:21:36 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <nfpdex[m] "Yes. I just dont like the attitu"> I agree. I'm sometimes stunned by how hard/lazy some people are. Like seriously, Signal takes under 30 seconds to set up and you're ready to go
21:22:07 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "Hey guys, I think I'll continue "> Channel still not shown at top. Can you link?
21:22:12 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. Just a sec.
21:22:20 <snoodledoodle[m]> Tor could of fixed all the issues a long time ago so they made low intelligence people believe it is only for criminal activity
21:22:31 <snoodledoodle[m]> Google and Facebook die if everyone uses tor
21:22:40 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <snoodledoodle[m] "Tor could of fixed all the issue"> Dance like not one is watching. Encrypt like everyone is
21:23:20 <TheJollyRoger> For matrix users, could you try #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ?
21:23:43 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <snoodledoodle[m] "Tor could of fixed all the issue"> The thing about encryption is, that it saves people that actually need it from oppressive governments. But if nobody else use it, they look suspect
21:23:47 <TheJollyRoger> the easiest way is `/join #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org`
21:23:47 <snoodledoodle[m]> Your modem also runs Linux and your arm processor is controlled by another core that has the real ring0 . x86_64 is like that too
21:23:54 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "the easiest way is `/join #graph"> It worked thanks
21:23:59 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
21:24:06 <snoodledoodle[m]> You have 3 operating systems on a grapheneos phone
21:24:31 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Going on off topic channel
21:25:04 <TheJollyRoger> Hey snoodledoodle[m], could I refer you to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org for the moment? Since we're starting to diverge to a different topic, although any GrapheneOS-specific chatter I'm really happy to have here.
21:25:59 <nfpdex[m]> <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo "Dance like not one is watching. "> where is this quote from?
21:26:15 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm trying to keep Signal-To-Noise Ratio relatively high here, so in case someone comes in needing help installing or asking a GrapheneOS-specific question, they can search for it in our channel logs relatively easily.)
21:26:36 <snoodledoodle[m]> Encryption is fake, they have quantum computers that can superposition well over 256bits aes uses
21:27:05 <snoodledoodle[m]> You need a quantum computer or the government or corporations can hack it easily
21:27:15 <snoodledoodle[m]> Or a quantum pcie card
21:27:33 <TheJollyRoger> snoodledoodle[m]: are you being sarcastic? Since I have a hard time tellingover text.
21:27:42 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <nfpdex[m] "where is this quote from?"> Amazon’s Werner Vogels I think. But well not anymore off topic on here :p
21:27:44 <snoodledoodle[m]> No
21:28:01 <snoodledoodle[m]> Quantum computers only give you the right answer. It can either compute it or not
21:28:43 <snoodledoodle[m]> If you have 2048qubits then you can download most peoples bank login
21:28:51 <nfpdex[m]> <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo "The thing about encryption is, t"> It confuses me therefore that some security people advise against the use of tor because they say, if you use it you are on the watchlist. Isn't this the main reason that everyone should, so that the use of tor is no indication anymore?
21:29:25 <snoodledoodle[m]> You're on the watchlist by being here if you didn't use tor on a vpn outside of five eyes
21:29:41 <TheJollyRoger> snoodledoodle[m]: at this moment quantum computers aren't powerful enough to break conventional public keys of strengths that are considered safe today, and secondly, AES256 is considered safe against Grover's Alorithm and is "Quantum Safe."
21:29:53 <TheJollyRoger> So I'd ask you please not perpetuate that myth here.
21:29:59 <TheJollyRoger> Because it really doesn't help anybody.
21:30:01 <snoodledoodle[m]> That's because it's a weapon. You could cripple another nation if you have it
21:30:07 <snoodledoodle[m]> So why would you come out saying it's possible
21:30:40 <snoodledoodle[m]> Cicada 3301 is what you do if you want to be secure
21:30:56 <snoodledoodle[m]> Liber Primus can't be broken by tractional methods
21:31:04 <snoodledoodle[m]> Traditional*
21:31:44 <snoodledoodle[m]> It isn't that encryption doesn't work, its that you have a cheap processor vs a entity that has multi billion dollar computers
21:31:52 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <nfpdex[m] "It confuses me therefore that so"> Lets move off-topic channel.
21:31:59 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks yzrhjocizuwkjlqo
21:32:48 <snoodledoodle[m]> Why can't we use SHA-1 and why does the USA government control world hashing and tell you what is safe?
21:33:03 <snoodledoodle[m]> SHA-1 was destroyed by advancements in GPU
21:33:25 <TheJollyRoger> snoodledoodle[m]: The math behind existing the AES cipher with keys of 256-bit strength is solid and at this moment is still held to be quantum safe for the immediate future.
21:34:16 <snoodledoodle[m]> Cost wise or computer science wise. Sha-2 can be broken now if you have a lot of money
21:34:17 <TheJollyRoger> If ever the algorithms begin to crumble, we'll switch and cryptographers are already working on doing so in anticipation of future needs, but going chicken little and saying "the sky is falling" really doesn't help anyone.
21:34:22 <r0tt0r[m]> new update works great, nice new features, will do further testing and shout if i find some issues, great work @all involved
21:34:37 <snoodledoodle[m]> Sha-1 stopped being used because it only cost 50k USD to break it
21:34:48 <TheJollyRoger> snoodledoodle[m]: if it was, bitcoin would become worthless. I'm going to ask you to knock it off.
21:35:18 <TheJollyRoger> Spreading panic doesn't help anyone, especially when people are expecting this channel to have usable information.
21:35:23 <TheJollyRoger> So. Could you, please?
21:36:56 <nfpdex[m]> I have seen that there is a new update. But how do I know that my phone is updated yet?
21:38:06 <TheJollyRoger> If traditional cryptography was broken, such as SHA-2, and ECC, all bitcoin, blockchains, and such, would immediately be destroyed. There are billions on the line for it, as a reward for breaking cryptography, and all of it's as of yet, unclaimed. So, please, let's not cry out that the sky is falling.
21:38:22 <TheJollyRoger> nfpdex[m]: as before, go to System -> About Phone -> Build Number.
21:38:35 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry,
21:38:46 <TheJollyRoger> nfpdex[m]: could you go to Settings -> About Phone -> Build Number?
21:38:48 <TheJollyRoger> That should tell you.
21:39:56 <nfpdex[m]> the build number is 2020.11.05.18
21:39:59 <nfpdex[m]> so not the new one I guess
21:40:07 <nfpdex[m]> therefore I wonder. Shouldn't it update on the fly?
21:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> Give it some time, it may not have checked yet or the new images may not be on the update server just yet.
21:40:56 <nfpdex[m]> when such a new update comes, it comes for every supported pixel device?
21:42:14 <TheJollyRoger> It *usually* does (unless your phone is marked "EOL", or "Obsolete" so bear that in mind!), but what's likely happening is that your phone just hasn't detected it yet, or the new images may not be posted on the backend yet.
21:43:16 <TheJollyRoger> Check your phone tomorrow. I usually just let my phone update at night.
21:52:41 <snoodledoodle[m]> > If traditional cryptography was broken, such as SHA-2, and ECC, all bitcoin, blockchains, and such, would immediately be destroyed. There are billions on the line for it, as a reward for breaking cryptography, and all of it's as of yet, unclaimed. So, please, let's not cry out that the sky is falling.
21:52:42 <snoodledoodle[m]> SHA-2 is broken if you never seeded it with a quantum entropy source and tour attacker doesn't have billions or trillions of dollars. Generate random numbers on your phone and PC if you don't believe me
21:52:53 <snoodledoodle[m]> It has to be random to be secure as the spec says
21:53:08 <r0tt0r[m]> <nfpdex[m] "so not the new one I guess"> im on beta channel so might be you get it a bit later
21:53:38 <snoodledoodle[m]> * > If traditional cryptography was broken, such as SHA-2, and ECC, all bitcoin, blockchains, and such, would immediately be destroyed.

21:54:43 <snoodledoodle[m]> There's a x86_64 OS called temples designed around the broken randomness and encryption where the developer had a father in the military and had multiple degrees in electrical and computer sciences
21:54:50 <TheJollyRoger> snoodledoodle[m], final warning.
21:54:59 <snoodledoodle[m]> * There's a x86_64 OS called templeOS designed around the broken randomness and encryption where the developer had a father in the military and had multiple degrees in electrical and computer sciences
21:55:37 <TheJollyRoger> Knock it off.
21:59:36 <TheJollyRoger> You don't know what SHA-2 is. You don't seed it with a "quantum entropy source" no, a hash function is deterministic, mathematical proof of uniqueness of input data.
22:00:11 <TheJollyRoger> So, please cease-and-desist.
22:02:43 <snoodledoodle[m]> What you do is open up the .C file and see it accesses the POSIX /dev/random to work
22:05:04 <snoodledoodle[m]> How can you encrypt anything without random numbers. You need a instruction, syscall, or file of random data like /dev/random or /dev/urandom
22:06:00 <TheJollyRoger> Someone remind me in three days to unset that.
22:44:51 <TheJollyRoger> I told him privately he'd be welcome back in three days, but not before then.

23:46:55 <fred`> is it normal that there are many apps which 'arent backupable' by seedvault?
23:49:53 <TheJollyRoger> Hi fred`, yes it is. Many apps will set a "Please do not back up!" flag.
23:50:13 <fred`> :(
23:50:23 <TheJollyRoger> Seedvault will respect this flag and will usually try to back up the .apk, but won't back up its associated private application data.
23:51:36 <fred`> my only experiences with 'full backup of apps' before graphene was titatium with root-axs
23:52:37 <fred`> but you answer reads like, that seedfault might 'just take no care' about that flag and would be able to bkp it? theres no limitation by grapeheneOS itself?
23:53:17 <fred`> *but your
23:54:04 <TheJollyRoger> fred`: well, I'm not an expert on this but if I recall right, doing so would be akin to punching a hole in a central tenement of the Android security model, which sets mandatory access controls enforced by the kernel itself that no app on the phone should see inside another app's private data store unless that app explicitly allows for it.
23:54:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than I can comment on that.
23:54:35 <TheJollyRoger> Since I'm pretty shaky on this.
23:54:51 <fred`> i see - so that might be the reason for 'ordinary' backupsoft on android to rely on root-axs
23:55:28 <TheJollyRoger> I think so.
23:55:33 <fred`> thx
