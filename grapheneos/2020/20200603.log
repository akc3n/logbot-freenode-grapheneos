00:03:48 <cn3m[m]> All good things must come to an end..
00:14:53 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you use fail2ban with all those pesky script kiddies?
00:14:59 <renlord> for email
00:15:13 <renlord> i get 1K+ SASL failed logins on a daily basiss
00:15:39 <strcat[m]> no
00:15:41 <strcat[m]> I don't care
00:15:59 <strcat[m]> my password is some randomly generated 32 byte string
00:16:05 <strcat[m]> if they want to waste their time
00:16:07 <strcat[m]> they can go ahead
00:16:18 <renlord> well mine is a 24byte string
00:16:20 <strcat[m]> renlord: fail2ban just opens you up to DoS
00:16:34 <renlord> fair enough
00:16:54 <strcat[m]> and adds more attack surface
00:16:57 <strcat[m]> I don't see the point
00:17:03 <renlord> they make logs hard to read
00:17:15 <strcat[m]> some script parsing logs
00:17:19 <JTL> ^
00:17:26 <strcat[m]> renlord: only listen on ipv6 not ipv4
00:17:27 <strcat[m]> there you can
00:17:32 <strcat[m]>  * there you go
00:17:40 <renlord> my ipv6 from home is not even reliable.
00:17:59 <JTL> ditto :/
00:18:04 <strcat[m]> renlord: use some weird port and only listen on ipv6 if it's about logs
00:18:08 <strcat[m]> like if you only use ipv6
00:18:23 <strcat[m]> they only crawl the machine after finding the domain or MX record elsewhere
00:18:34 <strcat[m]> and I think generally ppl just do a full crawl of all ipv4 addresses lol
00:18:47 <renlord> that's 4 billion ip addresses
00:18:58 <strcat[m]> renlord: yeah you can port scan that decently fast
00:19:16 <strcat[m]> renlord: I don't think it's worth adding any complexity for obscurity to clean up logs
00:19:18 <strcat[m]> counterproductive
00:19:19 <renlord> doesnt taht violate ISP TOS?
00:19:33 <strcat[m]> renlord: also consider just not exposing the service at all and rather using it via ssh
00:19:48 <JTL> renlord: what about TOS?
00:20:04 <strcat[m]> renlord: you don't need to expose submissions + imaps really
00:20:13 <strcat[m]> just listen on localhost and do forward over ssh if you really want
00:20:15 <renlord> most isps would have a clause saying that you cannot port scan from your residential service
00:20:19 <magntcf[m]> Do pixel phones need to get they bootloaders unlocked too ?
00:20:23 <JTL> My ISP hasn't noticed
00:20:33 <strcat[m]> magntcf: there's an install guide at https://grapheneos.org/install
00:20:37 <JTL> Although they do get a bit snarky in case of abuse reports
00:20:50 <strcat[m]> magntcf: installing GrapheneOS involves unlocking, flashing and then locking again
00:20:59 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is used with a locked bootloader + verified boot enabled, like the stock OS
00:21:24 <JTL> renlord: No need to portscan from a home connection when you could get a server somewhere with better bandwidth to boot
00:21:26 <JTL> lol
00:27:28 <cn3m[m]> I love that I already have June 5th patch
00:32:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> @headgas
00:32:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> You on telegram?
00:32:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well you are
00:32:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway just go there
00:33:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll be sending stuff there
00:33:59 <headgas[m]> I don't even have it installed didnt really use it
01:32:57 <cn3m[m]> <headgas[m] "I don't even have it installed d"> Well hurry up and save the Pixel 4 haha
01:41:40 <renlord> so some laptops ship with TPM
01:41:46 <renlord> can they be used for attestation?
01:55:20 <headgas[m]> Save the pixel 4? What do you mean
01:55:41 <strcat[m]> renlord: not realistically, and it needs to be something like a secured core one
01:55:57 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's not realistic to make something like Auditor due to how it works
02:03:51 <cn3m[m]> <headgas[m] "Save the pixel 4? What do you me"> Go to telegram and test builds
02:06:31 <headgas[m]> This is my only phone
02:11:49 <renlord> strcat[m]: it looks like the secured core PCs need to be ordered separately from the web store?
02:11:54 <renlord> have to talk to a person
02:11:55 <renlord> wtf
02:13:30 <cn3m[m]> PTIO chat is shilling Antivirus...
02:14:02 <JTL> cn3m[m]: It's not 2005 anymore kek
02:14:39 <renlord> so it seems like the vendor actually ships the device to microsoft and they have to bend over backwards to verify the firmware is all correct before they install the secured core stuff?
02:14:53 <cn3m[m]> I know I said Windows Defender and they said fileless downloads...
02:15:00 <renlord> or they have a more rigorous process setup on the vendor side to do this?
02:15:16 <renlord> no black friday sale discount for window secured core PC :(
02:16:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> Windows secured core?
02:19:38 <overheadscallop[> <hypokeimenon[m] "Windows secured core?"> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows10-secured-core-computers

02:23:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> Do they run Windows 10 S?
02:24:31 <renlord> no
02:24:40 <renlord> they can
02:24:45 <renlord> but you dont have
02:24:47 <renlord> but you dont have to
02:24:57 <cn3m[m]> hypokeimenon: are you seeing this?
02:25:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> Troll
02:26:24 <cn3m[m]> Haha maybe, but there were two
02:26:36 <hypokeimenon[m]> <renlord "they can"> iirc you cannot install or upgrade to 10 S right? only move from it. So they'd have to be running 10S out of the box rather than it being an option
02:27:50 <renlord> i suppose, im unfamiliar with win10s
02:28:08 <cn3m[m]> I don't want to be forced into an account on anything. I know macOS isn't perfect, but I'd get that if I didn't use regular W10 Enterprise
02:28:39 <cn3m[m]> I can live with an appleID since you can fake everything and they just don't care
02:28:50 <cn3m[m]> And they don't collect shit
02:28:56 <cn3m[m]> macOS still doesn't have that crap thankfully
02:48:55 <cn3m[m]> He has arrived
02:50:10 <cn3m[m]> Sup galyoninion
02:53:00 <hypokeimenon[m]> Is he some sort of qubes master
02:55:39 <cn3m[m]> He's a guy on the subreddit
03:01:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW @headgas
03:01:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> How else do you want to receive builds?
03:03:25 <headgas[m]> I don't. This is my daily driver I would need a another phone to be playing around with
03:04:02 <headgas[m]> I finally got calyxos and all set up
03:10:55 <cn3m[m]> Ooops
03:11:08 <cn3m[m]> headgas: even though you have seedvault?
03:14:24 <headgas[m]> Whats seedvault
03:14:55 <overheadscallop[> anupritaisno1: Just ordered a pixel 4, it should be arriving next week. I'm ok with flashing test builds if you still need volunteers at that time
03:15:14 <overheadscallop[> <headgas[m] "Whats seedvault"> it's a back up app https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android
03:15:22 <cn3m[m]> headgas: the Calyx/Graphene backup system
03:15:45 <headgas[m]> When I was using my nexus five running Ubuntu touch I would have totally been down to try to help
03:15:59 <headgas[m]> Ah ok
03:16:58 <cn3m[m]> Go back to that? Haha
03:17:06 <headgas[m]> I don't want to risk having issues with my daily driver. Im supporting calyxinstitute so im not just being a user
03:17:09 <cn3m[m]> Jk
03:17:27 <headgas[m]> I messed up the Sim card reader I think
03:18:17 <headgas[m]> So its a paper weight now hah
03:18:29 <renlord> seemlessupdate has hung on me
03:18:30 <renlord> :(

03:19:09 <aeonsolution[m]> Hey everyone, does anyone know how the patches directory in Vanadium works?
03:19:16 <cn3m[m]> I want a Nexus 5
03:19:29 <headgas[m]> Someone maybe could fix it I dunno. Is there anything else I can use it for?
03:20:10 <nickcalyx[m]> Nexus 6p was my favorite,  such nice build quality
03:20:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Plug in a keyboard and make it a secure home machine/tether/hotspot connected only
03:20:45 <nickcalyx[m]> 5x was kind of platic crap
03:21:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> nickcalyx: +1, couldn't break them, and boy did my lifestyle try.
03:21:34 <headgas[m]> Secure home machine?
03:23:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <headgas[m] "Secure home machine?"> Sure. Banking, messaging, home "phone" via Riot, whatever
03:25:09 <headgas[m]> Why would I do that over this phone and my laptop?
03:32:08 <renlord> strcat[m]: is the dex checksums not matching a concern?
03:32:15 <renlord> for particular apk packages
03:37:27 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <headgas[m] "Why would I do that over this ph"> And not your laptop? Desktop Linux security model is quite ass compared to Graphene/AOSP
03:37:51 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Sure. Banking, messaging, home ""> Home security would be another on my list
03:40:01 <headgas[m]> But we are talking about Ubuntu touch on nexus 5. Not my pixel
03:41:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Thought your Pixel 4 with CalyxOS was your only phone. Sorry! Feeling like a dumbass, now.
03:43:42 <headgas[m]> Lol. Cus I think I messed up the Sim card reader on the nexus 5
05:02:13 <sel[m]1> <cn3m[m] "I want a Nexus 5"> I hav
05:34:51 <cyredanthem[m]> Anyone tried Android 11 yet?
06:06:04 <cn3m[m]> It's not even in beta
06:44:37 <Guest49> Hi
06:46:19 <Guest49> Question: does installing GrapheneOS on a Pixel phone deliver any significant performance boost over stock Android?
06:49:21 <renlord[m]> Stock Google Android is not really performant per sah
06:49:26 <renlord[m]> With all the bells and whistles.
06:49:38 <renlord[m]> And everything compared to aosp adds overhead.
06:49:50 <Guest19> True...
06:50:25 <Guest19> So it would be much faster without all the Google stuff then?
06:52:46 <Guest19> Currently an iPhone user thinking about switching... that's why I'm asking...
06:53:33 <renlord> probably not, there is a very slight performance hit with the added security hardening
06:53:48 <Guest19> Ah I see
06:53:55 <renlord> there are some numbers done on hardened malloc, mostly extra memory overhead
06:54:09 <renlord> but no actual user-experience degradation
06:54:16 <renlord> i.e. you should be indifferent
06:54:25 <Guest19> gotcha
06:56:18 <Guest19> I currently have an Xs, most sites say the Pixel 3a and 3 are significantly slower than the Xs, so I was just curious if Graphene would have an effect on it (I'll prob install Graphene anyway because I'm switching from iOS due to privacy)
06:56:34 <Guest19> if i do get a Pixel
06:56:56 <renlord> they probably dont know what they are talking about
06:57:06 <renlord> if you think about it, it makes little to no sense at all
06:57:26 <cn3m[m]> iPhone 7 is roughly where the 3a is benchmark wise
06:57:29 <cn3m[m]> However Pixel 3 is really fast
06:57:46 <cn3m[m]> iPhones are only about a year or two ahead on performance tops
06:58:01 <Guest19> I see...
06:58:03 <renlord> your app user experience is mostly determined by how the app is being authored mostly (assuming not running games)
06:58:05 <cn3m[m]> An XS is the same age as a Pixel 3 it shouldn't be that much slower
06:58:31 <cn3m[m]> * An XS is a little older a Pixel 3 it shouldn't be that much slower
06:58:42 <Guest19> Makes sense... and yeah I don't usually game on my phone
06:58:51 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS runs great imo
06:58:52 <cn3m[m]> The battery life is insane
06:58:59 <renlord> if you dont game, there should be zero different
06:59:02 <renlord> *difference
06:59:14 <renlord> the foreground activity should run slick.
06:59:23 <Guest19> Sweet
06:59:32 <renlord> minute delay during loading due to hardened malloc minor performance hit.
06:59:40 <renlord> *very very small delay
06:59:49 <renlord> in the order of milliseconds
06:59:56 <cn3m[m]> XS is the better phone there's no debate, but if you like GrapheneOS better(which I do for a phone technically) that could be worth it
07:00:11 <renlord> debatable whether XS is the better phone
07:00:18 <JTL> No fingerprint reader :p
07:00:34 <cn3m[m]> 3 or 3a?
07:00:39 <Guest19> ^
07:01:00 <renlord> also no HW-accelerated computational photography on iphone XS
07:01:16 <Guest19> This is all fairly new to me, I wouldn't have known before...
07:01:21 <renlord> even the camera colour temperature is different
07:01:25 <cn3m[m]> <JTL "No fingerprint reader :p"> I haven't used the fingerprint since moving to Pixel 3a
07:01:31 <renlord> so yes, different products altogether.
07:01:36 <renlord> go to a store and try both.
07:01:46 <Guest19> Sure
07:01:49 <magntcf[m]> cn3m: I'm sorry to interrupt you , but do people prefer to use OS like grapheneos on pixels to be anonymous on the internet or what exactly ?
07:02:08 <cn3m[m]> magntcf: very complex subject
07:02:14 <Guest19> Thx guys
07:02:18 <JTL> cn3m[m]: Just saying I think the fingerprint reader is better than the face unlock being pushed by Apple and others
07:02:23 <JTL> You don't have to use it
07:02:30 <cn3m[m]> But technically yeah it's probably your best bet?
07:02:40 <Guest19> Yeah I like the fingerprint too
07:02:49 <cn3m[m]> It's very complicated
07:02:50 <magntcf[m]> Can i hit you on pm ?
07:03:13 <cn3m[m]> Sure
07:03:13 <Guest19> I got the Xs before I got into privacy, and I had a 5s before that so I pretty much got it to use for a long time lol
07:03:32 <cn3m[m]> I have faceid which I also haven't used on my iPad Pro
07:03:33 <Guest19> And now here I am looking at the Pixels
07:03:38 <renlord> magntcf[m]: i suggest you ask here, other people might have similar questions
07:04:01 <cn3m[m]> The 5s is still getting updates which is awesome
07:04:10 <renlord> Guest19: the project is aimed at hardening security and focuses on doing things **correctly**
07:04:14 <Guest19> Yeah I didn't expect that tbh
07:04:18 <cn3m[m]> I mean if he wants to share threat model that's the only reason I assumed he wanted a dm
07:04:26 <renlord> you dont have privacy without good security.
07:04:32 <Guest19> True
07:04:32 <cn3m[m]> If that's not an issue here's much better
07:04:51 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "you dont have privacy without go"> This
07:04:56 <renlord> even achieving privacy and anonymity itself is a complicated subject matter.
07:05:08 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has a lot of privacy tricks that are greatly underrated
07:05:12 <renlord> it goes beyond having a secure OS, there's some opsec involved also.
07:05:18 <magntcf[m]> I don't want to get you off topic
07:05:35 <renlord> you dont want to stick out as a sore thumb, if you do too much, you **will** stick out like sore thumb
07:05:39 <cn3m[m]> magntcf: anonymity isn't exactly off topic
07:05:41 <renlord> and attract unwanted scrutiny
07:05:45 <Guest19> It seems to be mainly about being smart... but it just boils down to controlling the information about you that you "give" to companies and sites and stuff like that
07:06:10 <cn3m[m]> Desktop is the best way to blend in, GrapheneOS and iOS have different leaks when browsing anonymously
07:06:12 <cn3m[m]> They have to be addressed based on threat models
07:06:29 <cn3m[m]> Desktop is much more likely to be hacked
07:06:31 <renlord> grapheneos's footprint is very similar to stock android
07:06:31 <cn3m[m]> You can also use Whonix
07:06:51 <renlord> there's nothing that we do that makes us scream as a custom android OS.
07:07:00 <renlord> and this is good.
07:07:06 <Guest19> Yeah, security is a big part but you can still give up privacy despite good security, they must be both paid attention to by the user
07:07:07 <renlord> we can blend in with better security.
07:07:28 <Guest19> For example, an easy way to expose yourself on Tor is signing in to Facebook or something
07:07:40 <Guest19> Tor is secure, but you must be smart about privacy
07:07:46 <cn3m[m]> iOS wins with JavaScript off and GrapheneOS with it on. iOS since the WebRTC and Android has some screen size fingerprinting, but that only matters against insanely advanced adversaries
07:08:14 <cn3m[m]> I think overall I would use Tor on GrapeneOS over iOS, but I would also use a VPN for the security issues
07:08:18 <renlord> cn3m[m]: its not winning
07:08:18 <magntcf[m]> Do you mean by privacy tricks , that you can trick all social apps and browsers and other apps to get 0% of your personal info like location and other things ?
07:08:26 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS I can't type
07:08:31 <renlord> with JS off, it is just weird
07:08:37 <renlord> most of the modern web is broken
07:08:56 <cn3m[m]> Since with no VPN a hacked Tor will deanonymize you
07:09:11 <Guest19> Yeah probably
07:09:20 <cn3m[m]> renlord: yeah I'm getting to that
07:09:29 <Guest19> I heard somewhere that a VPN actually makes Tor even more insecure?
07:09:39 <cn3m[m]> So essentially it's complicated, but Whonix, GrapheneOS, iOS, anything else imo
07:10:18 <cn3m[m]> <Guest19 "I heard somewhere that a VPN act"> Connecting to a VPN through Tor is bad. A VPN to connect to Tor is fine
07:10:24 <cn3m[m]> In this case it's important imo
07:10:28 <Guest19> Ohh
07:10:32 <Guest19> Gotcha
07:11:25 <cn3m[m]> iOS WebRTC leak with JS on really screws anonymity purposes
07:12:12 <cn3m[m]> For me I almost never use JS on Tor can't remember the last time
07:12:15 <cn3m[m]> On my phone that is
07:12:31 <Guest19> Idk... I think if configured properly iOS can be secure, but we can look at the Graphene, Lineage, etc source code for "peace of mind" if you will
07:12:41 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is also confirmed to have better WiFi privacy
07:12:52 <Guest19> That's why they are considered better for security and privacy
07:12:59 <magntcf[m]> > GrapheneOS is also confirmed to have better WiFi privacy
07:13:00 <magntcf[m]> Explain that
07:13:13 <Guest19> No WiFi scanning or something?
07:13:14 <cn3m[m]> Guest19: no one is checking 50 million lines of code or the half of iOS that's open source
07:13:15 <cn3m[m]> Imo it isn't a major factor
07:13:24 <Guest19> True
07:13:44 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/FFnTMBZjehGpTCbMMKhQsBCv >
07:13:45 <cn3m[m]> Google is the only one that said they fixed it
07:14:25 <cn3m[m]> Apple didn't say it, but I couldn't find any new reports that they didn't(which would be a little surprising)
07:14:44 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS overall is the superior package, but I'd use a VPN
07:15:01 <cn3m[m]> Since the Tor Browser security is truly awful on Android
07:15:14 <headgas[m]> Is it really?
07:15:16 <cn3m[m]> The chance of a leaked ip from that is worth considering if you are looking at such hardened devices
07:15:24 <headgas[m]> Tor browser came stock with Calyxos
07:15:29 <cn3m[m]> <headgas[m] "Is it really?"> Yeah it's genuinely terrible
07:15:34 <headgas[m]> That and chromium
07:15:47 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS does have different goals
07:16:07 <magntcf[m]> cn3m: you one of the best to explain things
07:16:16 <Guest19> Wait, so (just so I understand correctly)... I'm currently on iOS, I use Firefox, as many open source apps as I can, and I have telemetry completely off, is it worth switching off of that or would it be better to stick with it for now...?
07:16:21 <headgas[m]> He is good
07:16:42 <headgas[m]> I heard FF wasn't secure
07:16:47 <cn3m[m]> Guest19: depends the main weaknesses of GrapheneOS right now is the terrible store situation
07:16:50 <renlord> Guest19: you better off just using safari lol
07:16:54 <cn3m[m]> Apps in general
07:16:54 <headgas[m]> Shouldnt you just use safari?
07:16:55 <paintedman[m]> anupritaisno1: I can help with testing on Pixel 4 xl
07:17:02 <cn3m[m]> headgas: doesn't matter on iOS
07:17:13 <headgas[m]> cool
07:17:20 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is really good though
07:17:37 <renlord> safari has sane defaults.
07:17:40 <cn3m[m]> In every other way
07:17:51 <cn3m[m]> So even though the app situation is deeply screwed up
07:17:53 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is really good so I consider them comparable
07:18:03 <renlord> i dont think the app situation is that bad
07:18:07 <headgas[m]> I'm happy being on android
07:18:20 <headgas[m]> De-googled for life
07:18:25 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS with the Play Store for example would be amazing for security
07:18:36 <headgas[m]> Not Aurora?
07:18:48 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "i dont think the app situation i"> I mean name one store without Janus
07:19:00 <Guest19> Yeah, it's just that I gotta consider like if paying for an entirely new phone is worth it if iOS is pretty much alright with privacy and stuff
07:19:06 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 is making headway on permissionz
07:19:39 <cn3m[m]> <Guest19 "Yeah, it's just that I gotta con"> Depends on your threat model
07:19:45 <renlord> what's Janus?
07:20:16 <Guest19> Threat model?
07:20:16 <renlord> you can download an apk and then install it on the phone?
07:20:31 <renlord> just more manual
07:20:34 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "what's Janus?"> The v1 signing vulnerability in Android F-Droid and Aurora won't fix
07:20:58 <furofuro_01[m]> Well, has Janus vulnerability something to do with broken apks that cannot be installed on phone?
07:21:17 <cn3m[m]> It can load malicious code on a presigned app
07:21:29 <cn3m[m]> You have to get v2 apks which I think apkpure has
07:21:46 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "It can load malicious code on a "> Is there a way to check for this
07:22:30 <cn3m[m]> <furofuro_01[m] "Is there a way to check for this"> Don't install an app update anywhere beside from F-Droid and make sure nothing has unknown sources beside it
07:22:32 <cn3m[m]> Trust F-Droid to keep their servers safe
07:22:41 <cn3m[m]> And the supply chain
07:22:42 <cn3m[m]> That's my current solution
07:23:11 <furofuro_01[m]> Is Aurora store affected by this?
07:23:11 <headgas[m]> What about updates from Aurora?
07:23:52 <cn3m[m]> Of course a vulnerability in F-Droid could make it get hijacked and try to update maliciously, but you would have bigger issues. I don't know how to fake that right now I haven't tried though
07:24:05 <cn3m[m]> Aurora has a bug so it does fallback v1 iirc
07:24:35 <Guest19> So... forgive me but I think I am suffering from a brain fart lol, remind me what a threat model would be...?
07:24:37 <cn3m[m]> I think Aurora is still vulnerable to Janus I thought it was not, but
07:25:12 <radixed9[m]> <Guest19 "So... forgive me but I think I a"> Threat model is what are you trying to prepare for? Hackers and advertisers for me
07:25:28 <Guest19> Ohh right
07:26:26 <Guest19> Yeah advertising, telemetry, hackers too but I mean I don't do stupid things on the internet, always patch my systems, and I don't think I'd be an intended target of anyhting so...
07:26:31 <radixed9[m]> radixed9: I believe you are right about Aurora Store and Janus
07:26:57 <cn3m[m]> <Guest19 "Yeah advertising, telemetry, hac"> That's going to be fine on either platform tbh
07:27:12 <Guest19> Gotcha
07:27:28 <Guest19> thx
07:27:41 <renlord> how is it an aurora problem?
07:28:59 <radixed9[m]> <renlord "how is it an aurora problem?"> The Janus vulnerability was a little complicated how it worked. I can't recall off the top of my head, but play store apks doesn't automatically fix it
07:29:32 <cn3m[m]> <Guest19 "Gotcha"> I'd recommend GrapheneOS all things being equal
07:29:46 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "how is it an aurora problem?"> I'll try to find more info on that
07:29:58 <Guest19> Yeah I'll definitely still consider it
07:30:20 <renlord> we can setup package manager to reject v1 signature schemes
07:30:24 <renlord> i dont know if we do it
07:30:29 <renlord> or if it'll break many applications
07:30:44 <radixed9[m]> renlord: You really want to break F-Droid?
07:30:47 <renlord> afaik, aurora just calls into package manager to do pkg signature verification
07:30:52 <Guest19> But at least I know iOS is not as bad as most peopel make it seem privacy wise
07:30:56 <radixed9[m]> I am for it personally
07:30:57 <renlord> i dgaf about fdroid
07:31:05 <renlord> i dont even use fdroid
07:31:08 <Guest19> They literally compare it to stock android and say they're the same
07:31:27 <renlord> i stopped using fdroid
07:31:31 <renlord> it doesnt even work properly
07:31:35 <radixed9[m]> <Guest19 "But at least I know iOS is not a"> it is very poorly misrepresented. It is good I have all my family on iOS
07:31:41 <renlord> none of the app stores work properly
07:31:43 <Guest19> Same
07:34:03 <radixed9[m]> I wouldn't personally pick iOS over GrapheneOS. I do feel comfortable changing a few settings and giving it to my family
07:34:14 <Guest19> Right...
07:34:18 <renlord> ok with grapheneos, v2 is enforced with rollback protection
07:35:06 <Guest19> I'm debating between staying or switching so it's pretty much a debate of how much more privacy am I getting and is $200-400 worth that privacy
07:35:19 <radixed9[m]> Does anyone have a Janus POC?
07:36:16 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "ok with grapheneos, v2 is enforc"> Really? Huh
07:36:22 <renlord> yes
07:37:38 <cn3m[m]> I can't find any issues about F-Droid switching
07:37:54 <cn3m[m]> <radixed9[m] "Does anyone have a Janus POC?"> That's a good idea
07:38:48 <Guest19> Welp, I gotta go now, see ya
07:39:00 <cn3m[m]> https://github.com/V-E-O/PoC/blob/master/CVE-2017-13156/README.md
07:39:03 <Guest19> Thx again for the help and answers
07:39:24 <radixed9[m]> Guest19 (IRC): take care. That is a tough call
07:40:15 <cn3m[m]> APKMirror has a POC I am testing
07:40:29 <cn3m[m]> I'll see if GrapheneOS is immune
07:41:03 <renlord> if you already installed an app with v2 sig, it wont update to the janus-vuln app with v1 sig
07:41:12 <renlord> i dont know if you try to install with v1 sig
07:41:32 <renlord> maybe we can just reject v1 sigs altogether if people think its an issue
07:41:54 <radixed9[m]> <renlord "i dont know if you try to instal"> I think you can install with a v1 sign
07:42:17 <renlord> if we didnt change anything in package manager, yes we should be able to install with v1 sig
07:42:51 <renlord> i dont have number on app ecosystem i.e. how many % have upgraded to v2 vs how many requires v1
07:43:11 <renlord> if 90% of apps just use v2, there's probably a good case to be made to just reject v1 sigs altogether
07:43:17 <renlord> thank you for raising the Janus issue
07:43:31 <renlord> if you want, you can add it to the os issue tracker
07:43:43 <radixed9[m]> It is possible that Google patched v1 without breaking it. I haven't heard this was the case either way
07:43:48 <radixed9[m]> I am looking now
07:44:58 <radixed9[m]> cn3m: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/9dced1626219d47c75a9d37156ed7baeef8f6403
07:45:03 <radixed9[m]> it looks fixed
07:45:09 <radixed9[m]> at least on patched devices
07:45:28 <radixed9[m]> I don't think GrapheneOS is vulnerable. I do still think Aurora Store is vulnerable
07:45:32 <radixed9[m]> renlord: thoughts?
07:46:58 <renlord> why'd aurora store be vulnerable?
07:47:06 <renlord> it calls into android's package manager no?
07:47:37 <renlord> aurora might list stupid apps, but the OS should block the installation
07:47:55 <renlord> or specifically package manager
07:48:33 <radixed9[m]> I don't think the package manager unpatched would handle it if it came from another source
07:48:52 <radixed9[m]> Aurora pulls from Google that fixed it on the backend. F-Droid only has a partial backend fix
07:48:54 <renlord> our package manager is directly from aosp
07:49:42 <radixed9[m]> I don't think this applies to GrapheneOS directly
07:50:22 <renlord> its in our tree
07:54:31 <radixed9[m]> Apparently this isn't the only Android installer bug lately
07:56:52 <cn3m[m]> anupritaisno1 you also researched Janus thoughts?
07:58:29 <radixed9[m]> I don't think v1 is a security risk. However, both stores could be taking steps to protect their users who are running older patch levels
08:01:16 <cn3m[m]> The POC I found is down
08:03:01 <cn3m[m]> I don't know why F-Droid isn't using v2 at all. It's important for their users which aren't always on the latest version. Though it looks like GrapheneOS is safe. renlord I'm sorry I got that one so wrong. Thanks helping me figure that one out
08:05:05 <radixed9[m]> I don't think devs would have let that still work on patched Android or GrapheneOS especially when the Play Store is all moved over. It is a valid criticism of F-Droid however
08:11:02 <radixed9[m]> cn3m: I am sending an email to apkmirror to see if I can get my hands on their POC that is down.
08:18:12 <radixed9[m]> send

08:56:31 <dazinism> The Fdroid app can be annoying / buggy and has an old target SDK. Also they've got old abandoned apps available. Still, as far as is known, they do manage to avoid offering malware
08:56:53 <dazinism> Heres a study
08:56:56 <dazinism> https://nsl.cs.waseda.ac.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/submitted_wama2017.pdf
08:58:43 <dazinism> I not sure exactly why, but I've heard it said that the way their app store is set up the use of v1 sigs isnt a problem
09:00:15 <dazinism> <radixed9[m] " * sent"> I however suspect that the advice of cn3m , not to update apps you got from the Fdroid repo with an apk from somewhere else is probably a good one.
09:02:44 <dazinism> Theres this https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Security_Model/ but I havent had a good look at it all
09:03:43 <dazinism> Truth is that there isnt currently a great source to use for apps. Why a GrapheneOS app store is planned
09:04:00 <travankor_> someone can fork f-droid and fix the problems/wrong api?

09:05:56 <travankor_> thx for wiki
09:06:09 <travankor_> ^^ i was looking for this info
09:06:29 <dazinism> Theres Aurora Droid (made by the same dev as Aurora Store) which may be a better option
09:09:09 <dazinism> travankor: the problem with the v1 sigs is due to the way the Fdroid repo build server works. No doubt it could be fixed.
09:10:37 <renlord> they need to fix their build process

09:10:44 <renlord> there's nothing we can do about it

09:38:27 <cn3m[m]> There are some great contributors right now, but there's room for more. It's mostly Daniel(more than full time) and renlord(part time)
09:38:55 <cn3m[m]> Donations are most effective on GitHub where they are doing donation matching
09:39:22 <bigtree[m]> <cn3m[m] "GrapheneOS needs devs more than "> for sure but with money easier to hire devs
09:41:04 <renlord> bigtree[m]: pls read the logs on this matter.
09:46:03 <joshman[m]> headgas drop-down terminal is built-in feature in Manjaro. You prolly can sideload it on any distro
10:08:44 <xabi[m]> Manjaro is really bad with system time, it works their own way

10:17:29 <cn3m[m]> Full scoped apps is the dream at some point
10:18:15 <blacklight447[m]> What, you mean the auto revoke option?
10:18:20 <blacklight447[m]> Ah
10:18:27 <cn3m[m]> The limiting apps being able to see each other could be good
10:19:03 <cn3m[m]> It also lays the foundation for fully scoped apps(essentially how iOS works)
10:19:25 <cn3m[m]> Imagine being able to control that as an on or off

10:23:46 <cn3m[m]> blacklight447: auto revoking will mean people don't trust what behaves like spyware (bouncer)

10:32:05 <blacklight447[m]> <cn3m[m] "The limiting apps being able to "> Is the ability to discover apps done from a simple api?
10:32:25 <blacklight447[m]> In that case, blocking access to it shouldn't be that hard right?
10:32:47 <dazinism> blacklight447: its a feature GrapheneOS wants
10:32:48 <cn3m[m]> blacklight447: it's super easy and it's in a single hidden permission
10:33:05 <cn3m[m]> It's going to be in Android 11 at least partially
10:33:42 <dazinism> ... scoped apps that is
10:33:47 <cn3m[m]> The long term goal is no app communication when scoped
10:34:19 <cn3m[m]> That's going to have to be GrapheneOS doing it. That's one area I just can't see Google trying to compete on privacy
10:35:34 <blacklight447[m]> I mean we already have an edge over stock android: we can block access to sensors
10:36:08 <cn3m[m]> <blacklight447[m] "I mean we already have an edge o"> Yeah only us and Samsung have that
10:37:17 <cn3m[m]> We are the only ones with a firewall, but with a few caveats we need full scoped apps for that to be complete
10:38:19 <cn3m[m]> We could also do some really wacky stuff with scoped apps like pick contacts/file that will show up in the scope
10:38:58 <dazinism> blacklight447 why Android11 blocking access to the app list doesnt help so much
10:38:58 <dazinism> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/fpc2av/apps_are_meant_to_be_able_to_enumerate_other_apps/
10:39:51 <cn3m[m]> They got bad press and this got hacked on
10:40:13 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 app list management is pretty meh from skimming the docs
10:40:57 <cn3m[m]> We could go full bittium and have a powerful profile system, but I think Apple's method is far more appealing
10:43:13 <cn3m[m]> For security my top wishlist for GrapheneOS would be a system app updater, and building as much of the vendor image from source. Privacy wise scoped apps, fix VPN leak, and better background data controls.
10:45:03 <cn3m[m]> Oh and the no dynamic native code execution
10:45:17 <cn3m[m]> For security

11:22:58 <furofuro_01[m]> Something unrelated, I noticed stock android has no multiple user/profiles. Is it normal for android 9/10?

13:08:22 <dazinism> hard_taffy: not sure exactly how that menu gets populated. Thinking its probably something that'll need changing in Vanadium.
13:12:43 <dazinism> The Neolinker app makes it so you get a choice to use Google search or Via Searx at Neocities

18:35:44 <stuux[m]> should i just delete vendor/android-prepare-vendor?
18:36:07 <stuux[m]> I know JollyRoger asked this question like 4 days before
18:36:16 <stuux[m]> but i could not find any solution in the logs
18:36:31 <stuux[m]> JollyRoger: did you manage to solve the problem?
18:38:14 <stuux[m]> unfortunately i had to resize my /tmp and reboot my machine so the script was interrupted
18:39:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hi hi stuux[m]!
18:39:14 <TheJollyRoger> There is a clumsy workaround I took, let me pull it up for you.
18:39:28 <TheJollyRoger> What I did was I simply downloaded the files through a browser and then pointed android-prepare-vendor to them, by doing...
18:39:36 <TheJollyRoger> uh, sorry, one sec. Recalling command history now...
18:41:22 <TheJollyRoger> stuux[m]:  I did something like vendor/android-prepare-vendor/execute-all.sh -d -blueline -b QQ2A.200501.001.B2 -o vendor/android-prepare-vendor -i [path-to-factory-image].zip -o [path-to-ota-image].zip
18:42:19 <stuux[m]> TheJollyRoger: thanks, i will try it out
18:42:26 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
18:42:35 <TheJollyRoger> I'll add that to my knowledge base...
18:45:21 <TheJollyRoger> Oh whoops.
18:45:23 <TheJollyRoger> One sec.
18:45:37 <TheJollyRoger> -o [path-to-ota-image].zip should be -O with a capital O.
18:49:20 <stuux[m]> TheJollyRoger: just found another workaround
18:49:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah?
18:49:47 <stuux[m]> yeah just one sec
18:50:50 <stuux[m]> just delete vendor/android-prepare-vendor/DEVICE-NAME/ the files which begin with your build id/number
18:51:17 <TheJollyRoger> oh. Oh hey, cool! Alright, give me a second and I'll write that down...
18:51:44 <stuux[m]> for example for sargo just delete in vendor/android-prepare/vendor/sargo/qq2a.200501.001.b2

19:40:57 <cx2[m]> Well sure. But it’s like taking a step backward in things I thought I understood. I went away from using device admin apps like shelter / Island in favor of using separate “Users”
19:40:57 <cx2[m]> Now it turns out separate Users are also not the best idea in the world.
19:40:57 <cx2[m]> Is the same true for the Guest User? Because it apparently can’t be disabled / deleted

19:49:55 <cn3m[m]> Upstream
19:50:15 <difiewe[m]> Can you explain in one sentence?
19:51:04 <strcat[m]> cn3m: the underlying frameworks code supports setting a global VPN rather than per-profile
19:51:09 <strcat[m]> which would sidestep the problem
19:51:13 <strcat[m]> but it isn't exposed via the Settings UI
19:51:23 <strcat[m]> I am not sure that it's a bug
19:52:02 <strcat[m]> blocking all connections applies to more than the profile that's currently running
19:52:17 <cn3m[m]> I didn't know that
19:52:17 <cn3m[m]> Interesting
19:54:41 <cn3m[m]> I don't think the current issues are intentional
19:56:29 <difiewe[m]> <difiewe[m] "Okay, I try to ask in a differen"> last question for today
19:56:52 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't enable Bluetooth by default
19:57:24 <strcat[m]> if you want to know about Bluetooth privacy you need to read about it
19:57:29 <strcat[m]> it is complicated
19:57:30 <difiewe[m]> I can turn it on in the settings right?
19:57:56 <strcat[m]> your question doesn't have a yes or no answer it depends on how you're using Bluetooth and what it's paired with
19:58:08 <difiewe[m]> Ah okay
19:58:12 <strcat[m]> the answer is 'no' by default because GrapheneOS doesn't enable Bluetooth by default
19:58:21 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth has MAC randomization as part of the spec
19:58:23 <strcat[m]> that's not the issue
19:58:26 <strcat[m]> MAC randomization != anonymity
19:58:33 <strcat[m]> big mistake to assume that for Wi-Fi too
19:59:01 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy read that
19:59:03 <difiewe[m]> Please explain. There is also my hostname
19:59:09 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
19:59:39 <strcat[m]> now consider what happens if you carry around an access point rather than a client
19:59:49 <strcat[m]> or you carry around both, connected to each other
19:59:54 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth does try to provide privacy
20:00:11 <strcat[m]> you are free to read about how Bluetooth does that
20:00:27 <strcat[m]> there is no point asking the question here over and over when it is not related to GrapheneOS and is complex
20:00:42 <cn3m[m]> <difiewe[m] "Please explain. There is also my"> WiFi Privacy covers what you are talking about in logic so you will be able to research yourself
20:00:44 <strcat[m]> nothing about it is tied to GrapheneOS
20:01:07 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth provides privacy as part of the spec, it can't really be changed by GrapheneOS in any way
20:01:13 <strcat[m]> it is not a perfect system
20:01:16 <strcat[m]> you can read about why
20:01:21 <difiewe[m]> Thought GrapheneOS does some of this stuff for me
20:01:34 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth already provides privacy as part of the spec
20:01:42 <joshman[m]> What's global and per-user VPN? I have main profile active. Shall I reconsider my VPN from an app to a built-in solution?
20:02:25 <strcat[m]> josh.man: it's not really tied to that
20:02:58 <strcat[m]> difiewe: what is there that you think GrapheneOS could do to make Bluetooth privacy better? it is not clear that anything could be done to make it better than what the spec already provides
20:03:07 <strcat[m]> unlike Wi-Fi, privacy is standard in the Bluetooth LE spec
20:03:19 <strcat[m]> but because you are carrying around bluetooth headphones paired to a phone
20:03:26 <strcat[m]> or w/e it is you're doing
20:03:27 <cn3m[m]> <joshman[m] "What's global and per-user VPN? "> Global is not user exposed read #213
20:03:35 <strcat[m]> that is inherently harder to make private
20:03:47 <strcat[m]> so my suggestion is to read about Bluetooth privacy and how it works
20:03:55 <strcat[m]> because none of this is specific to GrapheneOS, or Android
20:04:00 <strcat[m]> it's a standard spec
20:04:54 <strcat[m]> with Wi-Fi you are not generally carrying around an AP and a client connected to the AP - you wouldn't have privacy if you were, cause you are using the same MAC address as long as you're connected to that AP
20:05:02 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth attempts to provide privacy in that case
20:05:03 <difiewe[m]> I think I got it. GrapheneOS disables BT by default (best privacy) and supports the BT privacy spec, but my headphone can compromise my privacy?
20:05:04 <strcat[m]> get it?
20:05:12 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth has a harder problem to solve
20:05:15 <nickcalyx[m]> I just always have my Bluetooth off because I don't like it in general. I 'suffer' in that I have  to use a USB to headphone Jack adapter and wired headphones
20:05:21 <strcat[m]> MAC randomization does not solve the problem
20:05:26 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth has MAC randomization as part of the spec
20:05:35 <strcat[m]> and it rotates it while paired to devices too
20:05:41 <strcat[m]> my suggestion again is to read about Bluetooth privacy
20:06:14 <strcat[m]> it has more privacy than Wi-Fi if you were using both the same way\
20:06:19 <strcat[m]>  * it has more privacy than Wi-Fi if you were using both the same way
20:06:23 <strcat[m]> but that is not really how people use Wi-Fi
20:06:26 <joshman[m]> <cn3m[m] "Global is not user exposed read "> Glad I never liked multi user experience. VPN on GOS worked flawlessly for me ever since compared to iPhone
20:06:51 <strcat[m]> keep in mind that the block all connection toggle is only for app-based VPNs
20:06:57 <strcat[m]> and is only needed when the app dies, etc.
20:07:12 <strcat[m]> built-in VPN support doesn't need that because it doesn't have those issues
20:07:38 <strcat[m]> and I think it might be worked around by valldrac's changes

20:23:18 <difiewe[m]> Okay guys I got it. I try to learn, but before I can find the good resources you have to start with stupid questions...
20:23:38 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth has a harder problem to solve than Wi-Fi

20:23:46 <cx2[m]> <difiewe[m] "Okay guys I got it. I try to lea"> You’re questions aren’t stupid.
20:23:57 <cn3m[m]> I read it all and keep tabs on it all, none of it is really out of date or anything. If it is I'll recommend the issue closed
20:24:26 <strcat[m]> if you are only using Bluetooth like Wi-Fi and removing pairings then the privacy is comparable to Wi-Fi privacy
20:24:28 <difiewe[m]> <strcat[m] "unless you are comparing to carr"> better or worse?
20:24:53 <strcat[m]> carrying around a Wi-Fi that you remain connected to would be way worse than Bluetooth privacy
20:24:59 <cn3m[m]> <difiewe[m] "Okay guys I got it. I try to lea"> You have all the resources you need to learn. They are decent questions, but we only have one full time dev. His time is valuable
20:25:01 <strcat[m]> the whole point is that Bluetooth tries to solve additional privacy issues
20:25:03 <strcat[m]> Wi-Fi does not
20:25:15 <strcat[m]> if you carry around a Wi-FI AP then that has a consistent MAC address
20:25:27 <strcat[m]> and if your client remains connected to it, it has the same MAC address while it remains connected
20:25:32 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth tries to address this kind of thing
20:25:35 <difiewe[m]> Hold on is strcat the dev?

20:30:39 <strcat[m]> bluetooth privacy also depends on the devices you are paired with
20:30:48 <strcat[m]> so don't use old / insecure bluetooth devices
20:30:55 <strcat[m]> and update their firmware
20:31:23 <strcat[m]> my recommendation is to use USB-C digital audio headphones
20:31:45 <strcat[m]> lossless audio + avoid the attack surface of bluetooth - which includes the headphones being compromised
20:31:57 <strcat[m]> do ppl realize that headphones get firmware updates
20:32:05 <strcat[m]> and you need to apply them manually
20:32:30 <strcat[m]> (well, ideally they get updates, many manufacturers don't care or abandon them quickly)
20:33:26 <difiewe[m]> I never heard anyone update their headphones.
20:33:47 <difiewe[m]> But in a logical way it makes totally sence.
20:35:06 <strcat[m]> difiewe: read all of https://duo.com/decipher/understanding-bluetooth-security
20:35:11 <strcat[m]> if you want to understand the basics

20:35:33 <yolotrolo[m]> usb c headphones are so great as you can have noise cancelling without battery, i can't live without noise cancelling 😁
20:35:36 <strcat[m]> it's a high level overview
20:35:40 <strcat[m]> easy to read and understand
20:36:20 <strcat[m]> just note Pixels only support digital USB C audio
20:37:02 <strcat[m]> so you need to use either USB-C headphones with a DAC, or attach a DAC and then attach analog headphones to that
20:37:23 <strcat[m]> the included dongle in the box is a DAC, not just a cable
20:37:33 <difiewe[m]> <strcat[m] "so you need to use either USB-C "> for noise canceling?
20:37:36 <strcat[m]> USB-C analog audio exists but Pixels don't support it
20:37:41 <strcat[m]> difiewe: no, in general
20:37:48 <strcat[m]> nothing to do with noise cancelling
20:38:03 <strcat[m]> yolotrolo: was just saying that they like USB-C headphones because they can power noise cancellation, etc. via USB power
20:38:06 <difiewe[m]> > <@strcat:matrix.org> so you need to use either USB-C headphones with a DAC, or attach a DAC and then attach analog headphones to that
20:38:06 <difiewe[m]>  * for noise cancelling?
20:38:08 <strcat[m]> and they don't need a battery
20:38:29 <difiewe[m]> <strcat[m] "and they don't need a battery"> ha
20:38:32 <difiewe[m]> > <@strcat:matrix.org> and they don't need a battery
20:38:32 <difiewe[m]>  * ah
20:39:06 <nickcalyx[m]> <strcat[m] "USB-C analog audio exists but Pi"> yes I have that on the Mi A2 .. their usb->headphone dongle is an analog one without a d/a converter
20:39:44 <analog[m]> I see.
20:43:11 <difiewe[m]> BT's privacy seems to complicated (and I read this stuff today/tomorrow) but Wifi privacy can done with MAC spoofing?
20:44:51 <cn3m[m]> <difiewe[m] "BT's privacy seems to complicate"> On Pixels specifically yes
20:45:06 <cn3m[m]> They are known to have good WiFi spoofing
20:45:52 <difiewe[m]> because the fully randomized mac or because something different? What makes spoofing a good spoofing?
20:47:44 <cn3m[m]> <difiewe[m] "because the fully randomized mac"> They leak other data
20:47:57 <cn3m[m]> There's a good study from a while ago
20:48:10 <difiewe[m]> They? Google Pixels?
20:48:39 <difiewe[m]> <cn3m[m] "There's a good study from a whil"> can you provide me the link/name pls
20:48:39 <cn3m[m]> Other devices can straight up leak your real Mac address along with the fake one
20:49:02 <cn3m[m]> <difiewe[m] "They? Google Pixels?"> Sure they used to along with everything else
20:49:04 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 2 and later are good (not sure on Pixel 1)
20:52:11 <difiewe[m]> But to be clear Wifi only leaks MAC (good randomized or not)?
20:52:22 <difiewe[m]> and hostname I think, right?
20:53:10 <cn3m[m]> difiewe: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02874v1
20:54:07 <difiewe[m]> That covers all possible leaks?
20:57:41 <cn3m[m]> All known leaks
21:00:02 <difiewe[m]> Thank you very much. For the next few days, I'll read. So no more stress with stupid questions xD
21:00:03 <difiewe[m]> buy
21:00:21 <difiewe[m]>  * bye
21:01:57 <cn3m[m]> difiewe: it's less stress and more that Daniel puts a lot of time in making sure if there's something someone wants to know related to the project they can find it
21:02:01 <cn3m[m]> Which in turn is stressful since it's already been covered
21:18:03 <yolotrolo[m]> not sure if he bookmarked any links, he left, he will not be able to read history 🤔
21:21:47 <cn3m[m]> Note about WiFi privacy I forgot
21:28:16 <yolotrolo[m]> yea the study date is 6 months before android 8  which introduced wifi mac randomization for scanning, so not sure what is about, maybe some manufacturers included a custom solution before it
21:29:45 <yolotrolo[m]>  * yea the study date is 6 months before the release of android 8  which introduced wifi mac randomization for scanning, so not sure what is about, maybe some manufacturers included a custom solution before it
21:31:09 <yolotrolo[m]>  * yea the study date is 6 months before the release of android 8  which introduced wifi mac randomization for probing networks, so not sure what is about, maybe some manufacturers included a custom solution before it
21:32:35 <dazinism> https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/changes-to-device-identifiers-in.html
21:32:36 <cn3m[m]> yolotrolo: it's a hardware issue
21:33:07 <dazinism> The Nexus 5x got it as it used the same hardware
21:33:42 <cn3m[m]> Android 8 just added more features to a broken system
21:34:00 <dazinism> The 6p had broadcom (I think it was?) WiFi which couldnt do the anonymisation
21:36:05 <yolotrolo[m]> i guess it is improved since
22:15:52 <xabi[m]> Is the randomization the same as linux cli? "Macchanger -r"
22:21:12 <cx2[m]> Few years ago, ran this command.... Bricked that connection haha
22:21:28 <cx2[m]> It was public WiFi
22:28:16 <strcat[m]> xabi: no, MAC randomization alone doesn't work
22:28:29 <strcat[m]> xabi: strongly suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
22:35:38 <aeonsolution[m]> hey everyone, if anyone needs help setting up the development branch, message me; i'll try to meet you where you're at
