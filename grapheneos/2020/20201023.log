00:32:25 <spathionema[m]> yo
00:33:43 <redibc[m]> What countries are you guys ftom
00:34:29 <spathionema[m]> North Korea
00:34:41 <spathionema[m]> wbu
00:34:48 <louipc> North America
00:34:51 <redibc[m]> Luckily graphene exists or they would have probably killed you by now
00:34:55 <redibc[m]> The United states
00:35:33 <redibc[m]> I hate the nsa!
00:35:43 <louipc> You can't kill me if I'm already dead. hah
00:36:26 <redibc[m]> I am going to order the pixel 3 tonight hopefully I will have graphene soon
00:36:30 <spathionema[m]> They can't kill me if I'm dead insideðŸ˜¬
00:37:05 <spathionema[m]> I bought a Pixel 4a after forgetting that the official build was only out for the 4 and 4XL
00:37:20 <spathionema[m]> I don't know what I'm going to do
00:37:25 <spathionema[m]> I might j sell it and buy a 3a
00:38:08 <redibc[m]> They said the 4 is better but I'm not that into phones. I just like privacy and security computers are still the best
00:38:27 <louipc> pixel 4a is coming "soon" so depends if you can wait or not
00:38:45 <redibc[m]> But the world is turning into a massive authoritarian surveillance state so we have to protect ourselves
00:39:17 <spathionema[m]> louipc: how "soon"??
00:39:24 <redibc[m]> All the easily manipulated brain washed slaves are on the or smart phones 24 7 telling google and facebook every thought they have and they're even talking to iot
00:39:29 <louipc> spathionema[m]: idunno
00:39:32 <joltman[m]> spathionema: I did the same thing, but immediately cancelled the order when I remembered. Got the 3XL instead.
00:39:48 <spathionema[m]> > But the world is turning into a massive authoritarian surveillance state so we have to protect ourselves
00:39:48 <spathionema[m]> always has been
00:40:03 <louipc> so turn the cameras around
00:40:21 <louipc> surveille the surveilleurs
00:40:26 <redibc[m]> You are right they want to covertly control all the slaves
00:40:26 <lev[m]> if I understand correctly, the newer hardware will have better features, and better security
00:40:34 <lev[m]> and definitely will be supported for longer
00:40:45 <louipc> anyway "offtopic"
00:40:53 <lev[m]> work on the 4a is ongoing, it's probably worth holding out imo
00:40:59 <lev[m]> but to each their own
00:41:26 <louipc> i think a beta build for 4a was available? anupritaisno1[m] ?
00:41:44 <joltman[m]> I was just impatient and playing it safe and I really want to move to 5/5XL sometime in the future.
00:42:02 <lev[m]> I don't think there is a 5xl?
00:42:18 <joltman[m]> No not yet and no support soon for 5 even
00:42:30 <lev[m]> but yeah I was excited by the 5, but it has a weaker processer than the 4, and it sounds like they backed the crappier 5G tech
00:42:36 <lev[m]> and I have no interest in 5G
00:42:48 <lev[m]> so I just went from 3xl -> 4xl
00:43:21 <joltman[m]> But rather than risk it with the 4a without support, I figured I'd go with 3XL until there is support for 5 or an eventual 5XL...however long that takes.
00:43:46 <lev[m]> I don't think there are plans at all for 5xl hardware
00:43:48 <lev[m]> but maybe I am wrong
00:44:11 <lev[m]> 5 is like a compromise, it's bigger than a 4 smaller than a 4xl
00:44:18 <joltman[m]> They released XL for all previous versions of the pixel, so I'm hoping the trend continues with 5.
00:44:43 <joltman[m]> If not, the 5 is fine.
00:44:52 <lev[m]> the pixels apparently never sell that well, and the cheaper "a" models sell the best
00:45:30 <joltman[m]> The a models are significantly cheaper, so not surprising.
00:46:25 <lev[m]> yeah its a great value
00:46:44 <lev[m]> but in the "XL" price range, that type of customer probably wants the craziest hardware
00:46:51 <lev[m]> and the pixels never offer that
00:47:07 <lev[m]> makes sense business-wise to collapse the xl and plain lines into a "medium" version
00:47:12 <webb[m]> I feel like the A series will cannibalise the 5
00:47:26 <webb[m]> The a series is competitive with it
00:47:56 <joltman[m]> Yeah, it wouldn't make sense to ever have a 5a. The regular 5 is already an a-style.
00:47:57 <webb[m]> The screen alone would probably be a reason for people to chose a 4a XL over a 5
00:48:16 <lev[m]> I'm really impressed with the 4xl, the bigger cpu and 90hz display are big quality of life improvements imo
00:48:24 <joltman[m]> At least in terms of CPU
00:54:22 <redibc[m]> Does anyone here use voip only? What do you guys use. I haven't been around phones for a bit
00:55:11 <lev[m]> off topic, but if you are in canada or the US, this is a neat project: https://jmp.chat/
00:55:22 <lev[m]> the aosp dialer has native SIP support
00:55:52 <redibc[m]> This looks good. I read about sudo and signal but it doesn't look like sudo works anymore
00:57:33 <redibc[m]> I'm trying to never give out my phones number and instead use multiple VoIP numbers
01:17:32 * DC[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201022-181158_1.png (69KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LmsmHPEecntbLVeBDeDYfJIL/Screenshot_20201022-181158_1.png >
01:17:33 <DC[m]> Is there a way to make the visual voice mail work? This is the Graphene dialer app.
01:37:46 <BalooRJ> DC: If there is a way I have not figured it out
02:13:01 <louipcm> I thought that depends on the cell service provider
02:49:08 <alekspinelski[m]> D~C: Same problem here, with 3 XL
03:44:41 <strcat[m]> D~C: alekspinelski: BalooRJ: works on carriers where it follows the standard approach, you aren't providing info like carrier
03:45:17 <strcat[m]> if you want help you have to provide relevant information, always provide the device model and for an issue involving carriers also the carrier (and be specific about the carrier, there are different variants)
03:47:00 <renlord> what carrier information is required by the dialer app?
03:47:37 <strcat[m]> I'm saying that they aren't providing the information needing to troubleshoot here
03:48:06 <strcat[m]> can't ask for help about a carrier issue without saying the device model + carrier
03:57:48 <renlord> cant the user just look up if their carrier supports visual voicemail themselves?
03:57:55 <renlord> how is it even a grapheneos issue
04:12:44 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you know what is the proper name for the problem if dkim keys get leaked and adversaries use leaked keys to forge dkim signatures to mount phishing attacks?
04:13:31 <renlord> and if there is an established protocol for announcing revoked dkim keys correctly? like expired pgp subkeys
04:29:26 <strcat[m]> renlord: you just change the DNS records
04:29:49 <strcat[m]> renlord: the keys that are valid are the ones currently referenced by the DNS records
04:29:57 <strcat[m]> if you rotate the keys, the old keys are no longer valid
04:30:17 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure if it's possible to have multiple valid keys at the same time, it might be, I've never needed that
04:33:39 <renlord> what if someone decided to dispute the authenticity of an email past the received date and the dkim key was revoked
04:33:52 <strcat[m]> you would need records of the DNS entries
04:34:09 <renlord> and if dns entries are faked?
04:34:26 <strcat[m]> if there's DNSSEC then you could prove they were real if you had a full snapshot of the records including DNSSEC records
04:34:28 <renlord> not everyone enforces dnssecd :(
04:34:32 <strcat[m]> everything needed to verify it
04:34:52 <strcat[m]> renlord: well otherwise you'd need a third party archive of DNS records or something along those lines
04:35:06 <strcat[m]> alternatively, other examples of emails from the time period to show that the provider was using those keys
04:35:28 <strcat[m]> there is no equivalent to 'certificate transparency' for DNS leaving a record of changes to DNS
04:35:43 <strcat[m]> you simply can't prove stuff related to it without having a full archive with everything needed to verify DNSSEC
04:36:18 <renlord> so would you say it'd be good practice and useful to keep a record of all dnssec entries if i needed to prove dkim key rotation records?
04:36:41 <strcat[m]> you would need to take a full snapshot of what's needed to verify the DKIM records
04:36:51 <strcat[m]> I don't really see why you would need to prove this
04:37:26 <strcat[m]> DKIM is only meant to provide verification of message origin between email servers
04:37:51 <strcat[m]> it only verifies the server, not the identity of people using it
04:38:08 <strcat[m]> and it's not meant to be long-term, just like a TLS certificate is not meant to be long-term
04:38:16 <strcat[m]> I don't really understand why you'd need to do this
04:38:31 <renlord> oh right, thats a good point
04:38:46 <strcat[m]> renlord: also if the key is compromised the person who compromised it can sign anything with it including backdated emails
04:38:55 <strcat[m]> and you mentioned rotating it due to a compromise
04:39:22 <strcat[m]> all that it proves is that the email was signed by someone who has had that DKIM key at any point in time
04:39:33 <strcat[m]> and the DKIM keys is for verifying the server origin
04:39:36 <strcat[m]> based on DNS records
04:39:53 <renlord> im just thinking of a scenario where someone is trying to claim email authenticity when they cite that an email was appropriately signed with a dkim key
04:40:12 <renlord> but as you have pointed out its stretching the application of DKIM
04:40:26 <strcat[m]> it shows that the server genuinely sent the email if it can be proven that the server used that DKIM key at the time and the key was not compromised at any point in time
04:41:12 <strcat[m]> renlord: many servers don't prevent users from sending emails as other users on that server and sign all the messages they send
04:41:14 <strcat[m]> renlord: so, be careful what conclusions you draw from it
04:41:37 <strcat[m]> renlord: DKIM is for verifying server origin, it doesn't imply that the server isn't willing to send emails (which it will sign) from users pretending to be others, etc.
04:42:01 <strcat[m]> renlord: try sending an email from your own email server with an arbitrary FROM header (set to a domain the server will sign for)
04:42:04 <strcat[m]> you probably can
04:42:24 <renlord> i think i have postfix rules that reject that
04:42:27 <strcat[m]> for example if your account is fooâŠ™bc try sending an email as spoofedâŠ™bc instead
04:42:39 <strcat[m]> renlord: yeah but what I'm saying is DKIM in no way implies that the server does that
04:43:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: all that DKIM does is the server signs emails it sends, that's it, it doesn't prove that a user sent an email without the assumption that the server prevents users from sending emails as others, the server was not compromised, and the user's account was not compromised
04:43:50 <strcat[m]> renlord: so sure with something like Gmail you can use DKIM to provide a high level of confidence that Gmail sent an email and thus that a user sent that email
04:44:03 <strcat[m]> it is not hard proof, it's a high level of confidence
04:44:15 <strcat[m]> and that confidence goes way down when talking about random email servers people host
04:44:31 <strcat[m]> if you can't prove that was ever a DKIM key they used, it doesn't show anything
04:45:09 <strcat[m]> and if the key was ever compromised, then the attacker could use it to sign emails with any date (past, future, present)
04:45:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) BTW, pm
04:45:26 <strcat[m]> so lets say an attacker gets the key today, they can backdate emails signed with it in 2014
04:45:47 <strcat[m]> so if you know the key is compromised, verifying it only verifies that either the server or the people who compromised it signed that
04:50:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "so lets say an attacker gets the"> What about future dating emails
04:52:14 <strcat[m]> sure, why not?
04:52:20 <strcat[m]> said that above already
04:53:42 <someanon[m]> so a key compromise would make authentication completely useless?
04:54:13 <strcat[m]> that is true in general
04:55:02 <strcat[m]> if you want to make it impossible to ever compromise a key used to sign things in the past, destroy all copies of the key
04:55:21 <strcat[m]> when switching to new keys it's valuable to wipe the old ones
04:55:36 <strcat[m]> after doing the rotation
05:01:57 <DC[m]> <strcat[m] "if you want help you have to pro"> Sorry.
05:20:56 <renlord> somenerd[m]: more like you cannot infer authentication from dkim at all
05:21:16 <renlord> besides if the originating email server was authenticated to send the email
05:21:33 <renlord> but cant infer user authentication on the email
05:22:27 <somenerd[m]> ok thanks
05:23:17 <somenerd[m]> so, the server is authenticated, but user authentication is a problem.
05:23:19 <somenerd[m]>  * so, the server is authenticated, but user authentication is a problem.(if I understood correctly)
06:54:55 <somenerd[m]>  * ok thanks for the explanation
08:52:22 <M26o66y[m]> I have a dumb question... Do I need to install Bromite Webview when I install Bromite on GrapheneOS?
08:53:51 <strcat[m]> you can't use the Bromite WebView on GrapheneOS
08:53:59 <strcat[m]> you always use the Vanadium WebView
08:54:20 <strcat[m]> WebView implementations have to be built into the OS
08:54:34 <M26o66y[m]> Thanks, I just was not sure.
09:18:22 <roqstr> hey, i am probably not the first one to ask but: how is the status on pixel 5 support for grapheneOS? is it likely to be supported, can somebody make an assumption when? I am about to  buy a new phone and am struggling to decide between 4a and 5. thanks!
09:23:28 <zfnmxt> roqstr: The tl;dr I see on here all the time is that there are no guarantees, Pixel 5 will only get support if someone steps up to maintain it, and if you want GrapheneOS you should buy a phone on which it's supported.
09:25:39 <roqstr> alright, thanks! 4a gonna be my choice then!
10:11:59 <strcat[m]> 4a is not supported yet, still stuff left to do
10:12:00 <strcat[m]> it's being worked on slowly
10:14:34 <redibc[m]> Do you guys know any other privacy discussion places? I'm always trying to learn more. I am going to go with the pixel 3a
10:15:39 <strcat[m]> I'd strongly recommend Pixel 4, or wait a bit for 4a support
10:15:50 <redibc[m]> I also want to learn more a out the dangers of using a stock a droid phone. What is known that Google is constantly collecting about you. Do you think they store everything even if you used tor or a VPN?
10:16:01 <nscnt> redibc[m]: #grapheneos-offtopic
10:16:15 <strcat[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic for that
10:16:25 <redibc[m]> The pixel 3a is just a lot cheaper. I just wanted to test this out
10:17:22 <redibc[m]> I'm thinking of ditching phones. In the future. They seem to invasive
10:19:58 <somenerd[m]> The roadmap on the website seems cool.
10:28:56 <lelmister101[m]> Is the microkernel a currently existing one (ex: MINIX) or will it be custom developed?

11:15:27 <dragonfly826[m]> Hey everyone, please don't murder me over this question but, if I install WhatsApp on graphene, how much of a security hole have I made?
11:16:28 <dragonfly826[m]> Or does graphene able to isolate it in such a way  that its harmless to have it?
11:16:52 <dragonfly826[m]> Please please answer open mindedly
11:18:18 <Lalu-sys[m]> <dragonfly826[m] "Hey everyone, please don't murde"> You can install it on a seperate user profile (:
11:18:57 <louipc> unless it has some zeroday rootkit then it's no security hole
11:19:37 <dragonfly826[m]> Even if WhatsApp is I'm some form spyware?
11:19:41 <lopiolk> Its a Privacy Problem, not a security problem per se
11:20:05 <lopiolk> graphen doesent make whatsapp more privacy friendly
11:20:25 <dragonfly826[m]> Sorry that's not what I mean
11:20:59 <dragonfly826[m]> I'm referring to those common attacks that exploit WhatsApp
11:21:07 <nscnt> Go to #grapheneos-offtopic for further discussion of WhatsApp, though
11:21:11 <dragonfly826[m]> And eventually the whole device by extension
11:22:04 <dragonfly826[m]> > Go to #grapheneos-offtopic for further discussion of WhatsApp, though
11:22:04 <dragonfly826[m]> Okay thank  you
11:24:01 <alex-resist_> I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it's much more difficult attacking a GrapheneOS phone via WhatsApp than an unpatched 3-4 years old stock phone. GrapheneOS raises the costs considerably, which is what counts
11:37:10 <somenerd[m]> How far is GrapheneOS on the roadmap( on grapheneos.org)? Is there still a lot of hardening/development left?
12:08:57 <nscnt> somenerd[m]: There's a lot to do. To get a feel for the operating system related issues, take a look at https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
12:09:28 <somenerd[m]> yeah there are a lot of bugs tbh
12:09:42 <somenerd[m]>  * yeah there are quite a few bugs tbh
12:11:05 <somenerd[m]> There's a lot to do then...
12:11:15 <somenerd[m]> Thanks for the answer!

12:53:18 <dragonfly826[m]> <alex-resist_ "I wouldn't say it's impossible, "> Ah thanks! That's a pretty satisfying answer :)
12:55:50 <dragonfly826[m]> On another note, to what extent does using a separate user profile on graphene protect you from vulnerable/malicious/intrusive apps?
12:57:12 <dragonfly826[m]> From say assessing your local data on your main profile and even taking over your phone in some manner?
15:00:36 <dragonfly826[m]> * From say reaching your local data on your main profile and even taking over your phone in some manner?
15:08:30 <uchihaitachi[m]> If I denied network permission for an app, Is it possible to be bypassed?
15:09:04 <somenerd[m]> I think IPC will cause problems
15:09:24 <somenerd[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/android.html#firewalls
15:09:29 <somenerd[m]> check this part
15:10:02 <uchihaitachi[m]> Thanks!
15:10:55 <somenerd[m]> welcome
15:19:36 <Floria[m]> <somenerd[m] "I think IPC will cause problems"> It's quite a by-design issue
15:19:49 <somenerd[m]> yeah
15:20:08 <Floria[m]> Intents tend to not have permission gated on it, and if they do, it's not handled that well.
15:21:06 <somenerd[m]> It's an AOSP problem right?
15:22:52 <strcat[m]> no, the OS has checks for the INTERNET permission
15:23:02 <strcat[m]> it's an issue with apps developed externally
15:23:55 <Floria[m]> On some apps, at least. Maybe it'll take some overhaul in intent system at worst or at best have a finer-grained checking of permissions to start an activity (but upstream is moving away from it, such as scoped storage)
15:24:00 <strcat[m]> it doesn't just apply to this, an app can screw up handling of trust that you grant it in general
15:24:24 <somenerd[m]> > no, the OS has checks for the INTERNET permission
15:24:24 <somenerd[m]> so any app with that permission disabled can't send intents?
15:25:33 <strcat[m]> that's not what I said
15:25:52 <strcat[m]> I said that the OS has checks for the INTERNET permission
15:26:05 <strcat[m]> IPC APIs that can be used to access the network have checks for the permission
15:26:34 <strcat[m]> if you grant access to something to an app, whether it's by granting a permission, granting access to a specific file, entering sensitive data into it yourself, etc.
15:26:37 <strcat[m]> you trust the app with that
15:26:48 <strcat[m]> it's up to that app to be secure
15:27:14 <strcat[m]> and if it provides functionality to other apps, it's up to that app to perform the proper security checks for those APIs
15:27:36 <somenerd[m]> Thanks for the clarification!
15:27:46 <strcat[m]> this is not something specific to any particular permission or other form of granted access
15:28:00 <uchihaitachi[m]> In the default permissions, I found many apps have unnecessary permissions, like: camera, messaging and others have network permissions. I had to disable it
15:29:06 <strcat[m]> if you grant an app access to something, you trust it with that, including trusting it to be secure so that something else can't abuse it to gain access to what you granted it
15:30:10 <Floria[m]> Oh that last statement was a little inaccurate.
15:30:12 <strcat[m]> uchihaitachi: I'm not aware of any system apps with unnecessary network permission
15:30:54 <strcat[m]> uchihaitachi: Network and Sensors are toggles added by GrapheneOS, Network is based on an AOSP permission so apps declare if they need it - perhaps some declare it unnecessarily, but we're not aware of cases within the base OS
15:31:20 <strcat[m]> access to miscellaneous sensors is not something apps declare they need, so it has to be assumed that every app needs it
15:32:21 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to thoroughly identify every app in the base OS needing misc sensors access and then add a special case where it's not automatically added for system apps as it has to be for installed apps
15:32:46 <strcat[m]> but nothing like that can be done for installed apps, it has to be assumed they require it, since there isn't an existing permission they declare
15:33:01 <strcat[m]> and of course apps don't have code to dynamically request our added runtime permissions
15:33:19 <strcat[m]> that is why they are enabled by default, unlike standard runtime permissions
15:33:36 <strcat[m]> apps aren't written for GrapheneOS, they're written for Android
15:33:58 <strcat[m]> they don't know how to request GrapheneOS specific runtime permissions
15:34:57 <uchihaitachi[m]> Thanks for the explanation!
15:36:07 <somenerd[m]> Thanks for clarifying!
