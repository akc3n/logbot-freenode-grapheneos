00:23:18 <eveningbeetle[m]> Get the adb and fastboot from google website
00:24:47 <eveningbeetle[m]> There was a video made by techlore on this. Try that.
00:25:39 <eveningbeetle[m]> Lol.
00:25:54 <nickcalyx[m]> The.techlore video gave bad.instructionsbthatbfrustrated many people
00:26:08 <nickcalyx[m]> Instructions that
00:27:31 <nitrophilious[m]> Hi! Can anyone recommend an app to securely wipe free space on Android?
00:28:32 <aeonsolution[m]> Don't use techlores videos, they are not official instructions and lead people to downloading old sdks

00:36:06 <eveningbeetle[m]> https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
00:36:41 <nikitalita[m]1> The only official way that grapheneos recommends installing this thing is to follow the written instructions exactly; don't try and install the dependencies from other sources, use the ones it points to
00:37:10 <nikitalita[m]1> otherwise you get stuff like what happened above
00:37:18 <aeonsolution[m]> this is the link you need to use grapheneos.org/install
00:38:33 <aeonsolution[m]> here is the advise i gave someone last night https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200822#c4837988
00:40:53 <nikitalita[m]1> the videos are trying to help, but the installation instructions are updated relatively often and they become out of date, so they end up confusing more people then they help
00:41:55 <JTL> ^
00:52:32 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: Arch is the best /s ðŸ˜‰
00:54:05 <nikitalita[m]1> seems that way
02:44:39 <bson989[m]> Is anyone having issues with speech to texts not working?
02:44:52 <bson989[m]> Maybe it's just a setting I don't have turned on
02:46:47 <eveningbeetle[m]> <bson989[m] "Is anyone having issues with spe"> This doesnt work on graphene os.
02:49:02 <bson989[m]> IC. Probably for good reason?
02:49:44 <bson989[m]> I'm assuming because it connects to the server every time you talk
02:55:07 <strcat[m]> what server?
02:55:24 <strcat[m]> Google apps and services aren't included in AOSP
02:55:53 <strcat[m]> speech to text and text to speech work fine with working providers for them installed
03:06:45 <spoonhoarder82[m> Has anyone else had the screen flicker issue on the p4 or p4xl btw?

04:17:28 <spoonhoarder82[m> Damn, for me it is any dar screen when under 60% brightness now :(.
04:19:12 <dmatrixs[m]> Oh wait. Testing now. You're right xD
04:38:19 <theultron[m]> How is Vanadium vs Bromite in terms of security for a non Graphene ROM?
04:39:11 <JTL> Vanadium isn't intended to run on third party operating systems, and is not distributed as such
04:39:20 <JTL> As for the latter question I'd be curious too
04:42:36 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> For the former
04:42:45 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> It has the same package name as Chrome so....
04:43:06 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> org.chromium.chrome
04:43:29 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Oh nvm
04:43:37 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> That was embarassing
04:43:46 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * It has the same package name as Chromium?
04:44:48 <theultron[m]> Here are the prebuilt apks: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_external_vanadium/tree/10/prebuilt/arm64
05:00:59 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/wpWsrVaclgdzSmGoLFZLoizB/message.txt >
05:04:14 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium has more hardening applied to the apk
05:04:48 <cn3m[m]> some of this is connected to the OS so read carefully
05:05:38 <theultron[m]> Okay. I will have to compare as not all patches are related to security in both. Some are for general functionality.
05:08:39 <cn3m[m]> ^
05:15:44 <aeonsolution[m]> *cough, *cough
05:15:54 <aeonsolution[m]> Vanadium also has a hardened webview
06:46:07 <kickstart> hi
06:46:25 <kickstart> if you don't mind i will ask some learning questiongs
06:47:17 <aussiekez[m]> Ask away
06:48:47 <kickstart> 1. do Graphene protect against device identification when using 4G , know from yesterday it change the MAC adress for Wifi and Bluetooth
06:49:30 <pyxel3aXL[m]> It uses LTE only mode
06:49:42 <drkw1z4rd> hey so i just got Graphene installed on my phone and it says No Sim Card
06:49:56 <pyxel3aXL[m]> To protect against fake cell tower attacks.
06:49:57 <drkw1z4rd> Pixel 3a XL
06:50:04 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Over 4G.
06:50:13 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Grats drk. Were twins.
06:50:24 <drkw1z4rd> oh..goodie
06:50:26 <kickstart> pyxel3aXL[m] can you please dummy it for me
06:51:01 <drkw1z4rd> soo any fix or am i donezo
06:51:08 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Good to see more people adopting this OS and hopefully with these people also come more contributions and donations to keep it running
06:51:55 <kickstart> drkw1z4rd not a tech guy , but have you tried the usual shut the phone off , take sim out clean it and but it back in
06:51:59 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Well is it an Esim?
06:52:05 <drkw1z4rd> oh god
06:52:09 <drkw1z4rd> it might be an esim
06:52:14 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Graphine doesn't support Esims
06:52:21 <drkw1z4rd> F*
06:52:35 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Not quiet yet. :(
06:53:22 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Chuck another sim in and see if you get any Carrier details
06:54:36 <kickstart> so back to my learning curve
06:55:01 <kickstart> even if i use LTE websites will not be able to identify my device
06:56:03 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Use the built in browser and browsers will not be able to identify your device. Weather you're on WiFi or mobile data I believe
06:56:23 <pyxel3aXL[m]> * Use the built in browser and websites will not be able to identify your device. Weather you're on WiFi or mobile data I believe
06:56:37 <kickstart> ok that's great to know
06:57:14 <kickstart> oh i have just fast off topic question
06:57:24 <kickstart> what books can read to learn more
06:57:32 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Don't download any apps with unessacary trackers ðŸ™„  and you have a pretty secure phone if you just leave settings standard
06:57:41 <kickstart> or watch videos about what
06:58:26 <pyxel3aXL[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq
06:59:03 <kickstart> i was thinking more about security and privacy in general not just graphene
07:08:55 <kickstart> that FAQ is amazing
07:11:49 <kickstart> i guess i have to start using vpn
07:13:29 <kickstart> is it really normal mobille os the mic is open when the screen is off , or this is just a a myth
07:14:07 <xmwv[m]> depends a lot
07:17:05 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Set your private dsn to 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com
07:20:10 <kickstart> i'm using now dns.adguard.com
07:34:24 <drkw1z4rd> so im reading up a bit and since my carrier is Google Fi, even if i get a physical sim, am i still going to have problems?
07:49:44 <kickstart> what is the recommended VPN
07:49:54 <kickstart> and is there something for free
07:50:07 <kickstart> sorry i ask a lot
07:52:08 <cn3m[m]> https://www.privacytools.io/providers/vpn/ this is off topic kickstart:
07:52:37 <kickstart> sorry
07:52:45 <cn3m[m]> np
09:08:11 <frenchieisverige> Hi, if I understood correctly, I can skip the signify step under windows 10
10:30:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> frenchieisverige: no you can't
10:31:46 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Because there is no signify on Windows(
10:31:55 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Because there is no signify on Windows?
10:38:44 <nikitalita[m]1> Do you want to get owned? Because that's how you get owned
10:50:13 <Autopsy[m]> <frenchieisverige "Hi, if I understood correctly, I"> You following techlore, eh?
11:03:59 <nikitalita[m]1> so, uhm, is anyone going to ask him to take that video down?
11:04:03 <nikitalita[m]1> all the recent comments on that video are just people saying that they're having errors
11:06:06 <cn3m[m]> I talked to him about it
11:06:20 <cn3m[m]> he was quite cool about the subject and linked the hated one's video in the comments
11:06:30 <cn3m[m]> he is considering redoing it(possibly)
11:07:06 <cn3m[m]> we will see
11:25:16 <Autopsy[m]> If he is considering redoing it, maybe see if he will get it cleared with the community first?
11:25:50 <cn3m[m]> I will stay in touch
11:26:25 <Autopsy[m]> Adding it to the ever expanding list of stuff you have to deal with xoxox
12:20:26 <bson989[m]> <cn3m[m] "he is considering redoing it(pos"> Maybe he could consider doing one on Linux. Also it would be nice to see a video on getting a signature.
12:23:30 <nikitalita[m]1> the main problem is that the installation instructions get updated relatively often simply due to the nature of grapheneos and AOSP development; any single video is going to go out of date and become counter-productive
12:24:23 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Wait...
12:24:45 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Isn't like the platform-tools part always change
12:25:08 <nikitalita[m]1> he's updating the links when new versions come out, yeah
12:26:46 <nikitalita[m]1> It also doesn't help when the videos skip steps either, like apparently it did for signify on Windows part. I mean, come on man, this entire thing is about security and you're blowing it at the first step
12:31:43 <bson989[m]> <nikitalita[m]1 "the main problem is that the ins"> Agreed
12:32:02 <bson989[m]> <nikitalita[m]1 "It also doesn't help when the vi"> Absolutely
12:35:28 <bson989[m]>  I believe there are more people out there like me that read the install guide over and over and still don't really understand it. Imagine I told you to change the throw out bearings on your engine and gave you a guude on how to do it. There's a chance you could do it and maybe do it right but there's an even better chance you're probably going to screw something up in the process.

12:37:20 <frenchieisverige> <anupritaisno1[m] "frenchieisverige: no you can't "> But there is no signify on windows...
12:37:45 <nikitalita[m]1> I'm not discouting the idea of videos altogether; some people just learn differently
12:38:11 <frenchieisverige> <Autopsy[m] "You following techlore, eh?"> No, official doc from grapheneos.
12:38:56 <bson989[m]> I do think a good amount of effort was put into the guide. I just think they are expecting most people that do this have a good understanding of rooting or phones in general. I think there are a lot of people (think grandparents) who don't know anything about phones but are smart enough to know they don't want anything to do with Apple or Google.
12:39:12 <nikitalita[m]1> but if you're providing a video on how to install this, it better be accurate and it better be quickly updated along with the official instructions; it's counter-productive and irresponsible to do otherwise
12:41:15 <nikitalita[m]1> daniel suggested that maybe a series of videos, each covering the significant portions, might be good, because then they could updated individually without having to redo the others. He's still not endorsing any unofficial installation instructions yet, though
14:41:28 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> I think my second account has joined /s
14:46:26 <dazinism> Apparently theres a way to automate the creation of a 'video' of the on phone parts using, I think, an emulator.
14:46:53 <dazinism> so they could be automatically recreated with any relevant changes to the OS
14:47:24 <dazinism> guess theres plenty of other stuff that could use attention, before anyone spent time of that though
14:47:32 <dazinism> *on that
18:56:35 <kickstart> may i ask what is silence app if it's useful for graphenehttps://silence.im/
18:57:12 <kickstart> and also can i ask to add a feature to decrease animation it's in samsung phones and make the phone feels much much faster
19:00:53 <kickstart> i think i found it in accessibility
19:00:57 <kickstart> remove animation
19:02:47 <aeonsolution[m]> kickstart: doesnt get maintained anymore, its just gets translations https://git.silence.dev/Silence/Silence-Android/-/commits/master/
19:04:09 <aeonsolution[m]> kickstart: please read this https://grapheneos.org/faq
19:04:19 <kickstart> will do
19:05:19 <kickstart> sorry in advance i feel i started a silly topic but i promise i have the best intention
19:06:22 <aeonsolution[m]> The project doesn't make recommendations on what encryption messaging software to use, it used to endorse Signal. You can look at the logs for if you want to find out more. For most people, Signal is the good choice.
19:09:36 <kickstart> yeah i thought i used signal for internet messages and this of sms
19:09:55 <kickstart> any way i will go read 1st
19:10:13 <kickstart> =D
19:10:32 <kickstart> thank you for the idea of  reading the logs for info
23:56:23 <lev[m]> > and also can i ask to add a feature to decrease animation it's in samsung phones and make the phone feels much much faster
23:56:24 <lev[m]> this is in the dev options, you can reduce or disable various types of animations
