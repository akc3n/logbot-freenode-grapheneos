00:06:09 <cn3m[m]> <BalooRJ "basically you can get 4 years ou"> 3 years of updates guarenteed
00:08:59 <BalooRJ> The Pixel did get four years of updates though
00:09:17 <BalooRJ> I do hate the planned obscelence of the phone market though
00:09:35 <BalooRJ> they're already powerful enough that they can last for much longer than 4 years I think, but that doesn't sell devices
00:26:02 <internetshogun[m> <mxnorvak[m] "Nice rules, i can't access the l"> I can get to it by long pressing the channel name in your list of channels. It'll bring you to the section where you select what kind of notifications you can get (noisy, mentions only), and press the icon. Kind of ass backwards. This is on Element
00:26:27 <internetshogun[m> It has accessible links, at least on Graphene
00:55:38 <mxnorvak[m]> <internetshogun[m "I can get to it by long pressing"> I made a mistake
00:56:33 <mxnorvak[m]> Didn't know when you select the room name , the description part is actually scrollable
00:56:58 <mxnorvak[m]> And by scrolling down the link is accessible
00:57:00 <mxnorvak[m]> My bad
00:57:22 <internetshogun[m> yeah or you can just press the icon as I learned in the chat as I learned just now. My life is a lie
00:58:14 <mxnorvak[m]> which icon?
00:59:42 <internetshogun[m> The actual logo for the channel you are in
01:01:00 <mxnorvak[m]> For me in Riot it just opens the logo image
01:01:43 <internetshogun[m> Yeah, mentioned I was on Element. Riot has been replaced by it now iirc
01:03:48 <mxnorvak[m]> Yea different apps
01:09:13 <zozu[m]> Now that the pixel 4a is out, and graphene for the pixel 4 although experiment, is available, can we expect to see graphene running on a pixel 4a soon? Say, within the scope of the next two months?
01:09:46 <zozu[m]> Or would it be naive of me to have such hopes?
01:17:38 <LinusSexTips[m]> Well seeing as the 4a isn't out yet, I'd say pretty naive
01:17:52 <refragable[m]> Little has changed, the project still needs more help. New devices will not get GrapheneOS without device maintainers and more development team members.
01:19:59 <marlow11[m]> I just hope my pixel 2 hangs in there a while longer. Wish I had the skills/time to actually contribute in a meaningful way to the project. Maybe in the future when I get my studies out of the way :-/
01:20:26 <marlow11[m]> Didn't realise the pixel 4 had no fingerprint scanner and was instead relying on face scanner. That shits me.
01:41:27 <aeonsolution[m]> There is a lot of work that goes into making GrapheneOS work as regragable says. We don't have device maintainers and enough developers. If people want the Pixel 4a to get support, you need should pitch in on getting that support or donating money to the project <https://grapheneos.org/donate>.
01:54:09 <renlord> does the pixel 4a come with PVC?
02:00:06 <JTL> >
02:00:09 <JTL> Brace yourselves: Google’s Pixel 4A is finally, probably coming Monday
02:00:16 <JTL> I thought it was the HL3 of phones...
03:55:44 <renlord> strcat[m]: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/AttestationServer/pull/52
04:02:09 <JTL> renlord: for performance or just UI aesthetics?
04:02:12 <bonerdose[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "There is a lot of work that goes"> I wish I could donate more but all I can afford  right now is 5$/month, this project deserves way more time and effort and unfortunately I know absolute zero about programming
04:02:36 <JTL> bonerdose[m]: I was in a similar boat 10-15 years ago. We all start somewhere.
04:02:39 <JTL> Cheers
04:03:48 <bonerdose[m]> <JTL "bonerdose: I was in a similar bo"> Thanks bro, maybe now would be a good time to start learning
04:04:32 <JTL> The best time was yesterday, second best time is now :)
04:05:12 <nickcalyx[m]> $5 a month adds up
04:05:21 <JTL> Unfortuntaly I find to work on an advanced project like this requires some understanding of computer science concepts as opoosed to just programming per se...
04:05:32 <JTL> I hope you get there someday
04:08:39 <bonerdose[m]> True
04:08:49 <bonerdose[m]> It does seem extremely complicated
05:14:07 <strcat[m]> renlord: it might need to be configurable
05:14:08 <strcat[m]> or paginated
05:21:12 <renlord> JTL: both
05:21:20 <JTL> Assumed as much
05:21:26 <renlord> with my query now, it takes a while to get a response
05:21:32 <renlord> and the scroll bar is too long
05:40:25 <Knull[m]> what do you guys use/suggest for streaming music?
05:40:56 <crixtnn[m]> hi there. I did a factory reset on 3a xl and when I try to install fdroid on a secondary user I get the error "App was not installed."
05:59:37 <TheJollyRoger> crixtnn[m]: you may be trying to install an outdated .apk. If you have F droid installed as the primary user, and it's upgraded to a later version, you need to install the same version on your second user account. Make sure that it's the same in both profiles. F-droid updated itself recently, so that's something to watch for.
06:16:25 <crixtnn[m]> thanks. that was the problem. had it with other apps as well. the  apk to be installed needs to be the same version as the one installed on other users. reinstalled it on all users and it worked.
06:22:16 <renlord> fdroid is really bad
06:22:24 <renlord> i really strongly advise people to not use it
06:22:37 <renlord> every app i get from fdroid is outdated
06:22:43 <renlord> uses old android api
06:22:59 <JTL> Eventually I hope we have own "app store" with own our repository with much better quality control
06:23:21 <renlord> as an example -- password store, the fdroid version is so old, it cant even update to the current release that is distributed on github/play store
06:23:29 <JTL> blah
06:23:42 <renlord> the fdroid version does not even use the correct APIs to password fill
06:23:54 <renlord> and asks that you enable accessbility which is actually a terrible thing to do
06:24:13 <renlord> the new one is vastly superior and actually works properly
06:24:17 <renlord> and uses scoped storage
06:24:18 <JTL> I assume that's because it was built for a much older version of Android?
06:24:21 <JTL> Otherwise I agree
06:24:24 <renlord> JTL: yes
06:24:36 <renlord> and fdroid does not ship this new version
06:24:37 <renlord> zzz
06:24:41 <renlord> why? no fkin idea.
06:24:49 <renlord> this was just a few months ago
06:34:13 <renlord> JTL: even if we have our own appstore, the number of application that are maintained inside it will be minimal, prolly vanadium, pdfviewer and auditor only
06:37:26 <JTL> Agreed
06:42:42 <pixelusus> renlord https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/1834
06:42:58 <lovesausage[m]> <cn3m[m] "you mean like XPrivacyLua?"> Yea something like that (without xposed), lineage has a built in function for feeding false data to apps. Privacy manager or something similar
06:43:30 <bonerdose[m]> Why doesn't AOSP contain a way to truly sandbox apps
06:43:54 <pixelusus> what do u mean bonerdose[m]
06:44:21 <pixelusus> truly sandbox?
06:44:43 <bonerdose[m]> Like a true sandbox and not just a work profile
06:45:11 <pixelusus> but each apps are sanboxed already
06:46:52 <TheJollyRoger> bonerdose[m], AOSP sandboxes each app individually already to its own specific user account, and unless you grant it permission to the shared storage, it only sees within its own home directory. If it wants to communicate with another app, those apps need to be written to communicate with it. The permissions are enforced via the mandatory access control policies in the kernel.
06:48:00 <strcat[m]> bonerdose: apps are all sandboxed
06:48:07 <strcat[m]> an app cannot be not sandboxed
08:22:49 <ruddo[m]> <pixelusus "renlord https://gitlab.com/fdroi"> I suffered the exact same bug.
08:28:54 <pixelusus> renlord the app is up to date: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.msfjarvis.aps/
08:29:11 <pixelusus> Version 1.9.2 (10920) Added on 2020-07-0
08:29:16 <pixelusus> 7
08:29:29 <renlord> ok, i've uninstalled fdroid
08:29:46 <pixelusus> it have been up to date since a while, the package name changed a while ago
08:38:04 <norbert[17> The old version of Password Store was archived a while ago, but the renaming was quite confusing...
08:38:04 <norbert[17> https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/7028
08:38:43 <norbert[17> Still waiting for 1.10.x to get included into F-Droid...
08:39:53 <norbert[17>  * Still waiting for 1.10.x to get included into F-Droid though...
09:36:18 <BlackWinnerYoshi> For some reason, I cannot take photos using Open Camera or Simple Camera, but the default camera included in GrapheneOS works (Pixel 3a XL, version 2020.07.06.20 stable). Why is that?
09:37:57 <pixelusus> i haven't tried open camera since a while do it now open in portrait mode or still open in landscape while using the phone in portrait mode? it was really painful
09:39:23 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <pixelusus "i haven't tried open camera sinc"> ?
09:40:36 <pixelusus> i guess they fixed it finnaly
09:43:35 <g65434-2[m]> you can still use gcam
09:44:36 <bonerdose[m]> 1. Get the latest Google camera apk
09:44:37 <bonerdose[m]> 2. Install microG services core from f-droid and deny network permission.
09:44:37 <bonerdose[m]> 3. Install Gcam apk and deny internet permission
09:44:57 <bonerdose[m]> Now you have a way better camera app and no telemetry!

10:25:11 <alzxjm[m]> Black Winner Yoshi: I used `adb pull` to get a Pixel camera from a stock install. You could try APKMirror, maybe.
10:26:44 <bonerdose[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "> <@bonerdose:matrix.org> 1. Get"> Aptoide has the latest apk, but its the least secure.  I recommend apkpure even though its out of date if you don't trust aptoide.
10:27:19 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <alzxjm[m] "Black Winner Yoshi: I used `adb "> Well, I don't have the stock install anymore... And I want to have Google Camera up-to-date
10:27:41 <bonerdose[m]> Okay aptoide has the latest version
10:28:04 <za_warudo-vilfp8> why not apkmirror?
10:28:26 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "why not apkmirror?"> You have to update manually
10:28:39 <bonerdose[m]> Exactly
10:28:47 <za_warudo-vilfp8> there's mda5, sha1, sha256 signatures you can check there thru Classyshark3xodus
10:29:04 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Welp, ok, I don't trust it but go on
10:29:55 <alzxjm[m]> Black Winner Yoshi: Subscribe to an RSS feed for your app. Not a big deal to quickly download an APK and update.
10:30:01 <alzxjm[m]> https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/camera/feed/
10:30:35 <bonerdose[m]> How is apkpure any less safe than apkmirror
10:31:17 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It's the aptoide I'm quite uncomfortable with
10:31:34 <bonerdose[m]> Yes that's understandable
10:31:50 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * It's the aptoide I'm quite uncomfortable with (thanks to recent breaches)
10:32:23 <bonerdose[m]> You take a bigger risk but aptoide has paid apps, usually has the newest updates, and their app is open source
10:33:36 <BlackWinnerYoshi> Actually, what RSS app should I use?
10:33:40 <BlackWinnerYoshi> For getting Google Camera updates
10:33:59 <bonerdose[m]> The most up to date one on f droid
10:34:37 <bonerdose[m]> Or you could just use apkpure
10:34:47 <bonerdose[m]> And not need an rss
10:36:07 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <bonerdose[m] "Or you could just use apkpure"> But APKPure has an out of date version
10:38:48 <bonerdose[m]> Okay so that leaves 2 options:
10:38:48 <bonerdose[m]> 1. Use aptoide and not need an RSS but less secure.
10:38:48 <bonerdose[m]> 2. Use an RSS feed for updates on gcam in apkmirror
10:39:26 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Don't use ttrss
10:39:30 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Requires google play services
10:40:07 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It kinda boggles me that it's even on fdroid
10:40:22 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It can't even function on gms/gsf-less phones
10:41:14 <bonerdose[m]> Antennapod and essential, qksms, many more are GSF dependant
10:41:38 <bonerdose[m]> * Antennapod and essential, qksms, many more are GSF dependant and on f droid
10:43:16 <alzxjm[m]> Yeah but Antennapod works fine without GSF. That dependency might only be there for Chromecast (in Play Store version) but IDK.
10:43:31 <BlackWinnerYoshi> I decided to use Feeder as the RSS app
10:43:38 <alzxjm[m]> My favorite RSS readers are Newsblur (for insane features) or Miniflux.
10:43:46 <alzxjm[m]> I think you have to self-host Miniflux though.
10:44:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't use aptoide
10:44:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Try aurora store
10:45:05 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <anupritaisno1[m] "Try aurora store"> I haven't found Google Camera on Aurora Store, though. Unless you know where is it.
10:45:11 <za_warudo-vilfp8> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/
10:45:22 <za_warudo-vilfp8> This works
10:45:37 <za_warudo-vilfp8> If you need rss
10:47:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "I haven't found Google Camera on"> Look at apkpure
10:48:08 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It's outdated they said
10:52:19 <bonerdose[m]> Apkmirror is the safest latest version
10:55:18 <bonerdose[m]> Aptoide: latest and unsafe
10:55:18 <bonerdose[m]> Apkpure: Safe but out of date
10:55:18 <bonerdose[m]> Apkmirror: safe and up-to-date but no auto update
11:09:22 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Nvm, it doesnt
11:09:29 <za_warudo-vilfp8> work on apkmirror
11:14:14 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Nvm, it doesnt (the rss app i gave)
11:16:35 <BlackWinnerYoshi> Looks like Google Camera works
11:18:26 <BlackWinnerYoshi> Although, I still wonder why the other camera apps don't work
11:20:06 <strcat[m]> bonerdose: use aurora store
11:22:52 <bonerdose[m]> Google camera doesn't show up for most people on Aurora
11:26:42 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Tried spoofing on lower api, doesn't work
11:28:39 <pixelusus> just open it in aurora
11:28:42 <pixelusus> from browser
11:30:33 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Welp, it works
11:32:02 <za_warudo-vilfp8> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera&hl=en_US
11:35:32 <cdesai> That doesn't show the latest version here atleast
11:35:55 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "https://play.google.com/store/ap"> This shows the "Uninstall" and "Install" buttons at the same time, lol
11:36:07 <BlackWinnerYoshi> * This shows the "Uninstall" and "Install" buttons at the same time, lol
11:36:07 <BlackWinnerYoshi> Although, the latest version of GCam works on Android 11 only, so I had to install an older version anyway
11:36:07 <BlackWinnerYoshi> Also, can you remove the `&hl=` thing next time?
11:37:20 <BlackWinnerYoshi> Well, anyway, I'll just use GCam for now
11:39:52 <SchismXL[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Well, anyway, I'll just use GCam"> https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/google-camera-mods/gcam-google-pixel-1-2-3-t3875663 can also use a modded GCam.

11:43:13 <SchismXL[m]> Yeah, for sure. Just giving options.
13:42:50 <g65434-2[m]> you can always use that something something ultra secret repo
13:47:02 <YumekoJabamiIRL[> Is Saleh a bot that's bugging out? Keeps joining and leaving the room like 20 times a day
13:54:38 <faxing[m]> Does it reduce privacy or security or anything like that in any way if I use Google Camera?
13:55:28 <faxing[m]> (Only giving it needed to function permissions and blocking network access of course)
13:56:32 <dazinism> Its probably pretty safe. Google got a load of resources to throw at it.
13:57:16 <faxing[m]> But I mean it is Google, it wouldn't reduce privacy or anything?
13:57:36 <dazinism> Not sure what it uses the network permission for, but denying that makes it not an issue
13:58:13 <dazinism> There was a vulnerability patched last year.
13:59:06 <dazinism> Any app could get gcam to take photos/videos
13:59:07 <greenink[m]> Is this the right place to ask for a lil help with the install?
13:59:10 <dazinism> If it had storage permission, it had access to those photos
13:59:49 <dazinism> greenink: yes, whats the problem
14:01:42 <greenink[m]> Nice, I got as far as the flash all bit for a pixel 3a but nothing happened. I was wondering if I should try locking the oem again so I could follow the guide from the start again.
14:02:07 <dazinism> My brother installed aptoide on my nephews nvidia tablet
14:02:23 <dazinism> Actually nvidia set top box
14:02:50 <dazinism> The aptoide app was making connections to facebook
14:03:21 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <greenink[m] "Nice, I got as far as the flash "> Ever checked `fastboot device` before flashing?
14:03:26 <cdesai> I don't use anything apart from aurora and apkmirror for grabbing play store apps.
14:03:34 <dazinism> greenink: no, wont need to lock the device
14:03:54 <dazinism> Just need to follow the instructions on the website carefully
14:04:21 <greenink[m]> But just ignore the oem unlocking bit because I already did it?
14:04:48 <dazinism> Yeah, ignore that
14:05:04 <dazinism> Its likely a problem with setting PATH
14:05:05 <greenink[m]> Aight I’ll give it a shot, thanks
14:05:14 <dazinism> Or a dodgy lead or usb port
14:05:30 <dazinism> Try a different lead or port if you can
14:05:34 <greenink[m]> Was using techlores guide for it because this is defo not my area of expertise
14:06:06 <dazinism> greenink: lots of people run into issues following that.... follow the instructions on the website
14:06:25 <greenink[m]> 👍 cheers
14:06:52 <dazinism> greenink: where did you get your fastboot / android tools?
14:06:52 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Good luck
14:07:07 <dazinism> You may have the wrong version and need to remove that
14:08:24 <greenink[m]> From the link he recommended. I’ll give it another go following only the sites instructions and I’ll let ya know if I haven’t messed it up 😅
14:10:14 <dazinism> greenink: think you may have to uninstall that, if its not the same link as the GrapheneOS website gives
14:10:25 <dazinism> *think you will
14:10:40 <greenink[m]> Got it, thanks
15:10:12 <BalooRJ> Does anyone know if there is a way to restore plain text SMS messages in GrapheneOS? I used Silence for a time but switched to the default Messaging AOSP app
15:10:53 <BalooRJ> trying to see if I can use these plain text backups of text I have from Silence into the Messaging app. Even when I look in backup I don't see an option to even back up text messages, curious if this is possible at all
15:17:23 <nik[m]1> Google just announced the Pixel 4a, are there any plans to support it?
15:22:20 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <BalooRJ "trying to see if I can use these"> Can Silence even restore a Silence SMS backup? I guess this is the only way. Or search F-Droid for other SMS apps, maybe they have the option
15:23:00 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <nik[m]1 "Google just announced the Pixel "> Probably yes, but the GrapheneOS devs need to actually have the device to be able to test it
15:25:29 <BalooRJ> BlackWinnerYoshi: Silence can both export and import SMS texts received through the app in both encrypted and plaintext form
15:26:00 <BalooRJ> but Silence is not compatible with KDEConnect, so I've been attempting to find a FLOSS SMS app that I can import the backup into. The default app can't, neither can the Simple SMS Messaging app that was recently released
15:26:31 <BalooRJ> if anyone knows of a FLOSS app that you can import plain text xml SMS backups into and is compatible with KDEConnect, I would be very grateful
15:28:39 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <BalooRJ "if anyone knows of a FLOSS app t"> I think someone would need to make one
15:29:06 <BalooRJ> KDEConnect is compatible with quite a few messaging apps according to the devs, so I think it's just a matter of me finding one with an import option
15:29:14 <BalooRJ> unless no SMS apps can import old texts from plaintext
15:40:13 <BalooRJ> so it looks like it is the restore feature that doesn't have a native setting in Android

15:47:54 <dazinism> crabman: yeah, they are pretty much the same. Think the only difference may be that the apk download version can self update.
15:51:07 <crabman[m]1> dazinism: Thanks.  I can't find a way to force Signal to check for updates.  I am now curious why self update is not being prompted, but Auroa is prompting one for Signal.
15:55:21 <crabman[m]1> greenink: I used Techlore instructions with minimal issues.  Against the recommendations here, I edited the script file as recommended by Techlore and all went well.
15:58:52 <BalooRJ> You can flag apps in Aurora so that youre not pulling updates from different repositories
15:59:04 <BalooRJ> and that Aurora only updates that apps you got directly from the Aurora store

16:04:00 <crabman[m]1> @za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a:privacytools.io: Thanks
16:04:46 <crabman[m]1> <BalooRJ "You can flag apps in Aurora so t"> Thanks, I will look into the Auroa settings a little more.
16:07:22 <BalooRJ> It's a little complex the last I looked at it, but as long as you don't just hit update all when youre using Aurora
16:07:38 <BalooRJ> You'll be able to parse out what you've installed from Aurora specifically and just update those apps
16:08:26 <dazinism> Yeah the Signal self updates happen later than the Play store. Also doesnt happen with every update (I guess/hope any with security fixes do happen)
16:09:25 <g65434-2[m]> hmm i feel it's kinda pointless to use standalone apk when you use fdroid with rfc repo ..
16:09:40 <g65434-2[m]> maybe i think wrongly tho
16:12:20 <crabman[m]1> <g65434-2[m] "maybe i think wrongly tho"> rfc repo?  I am not familiar
16:20:03 <g65434-2[m]> yeah, it's included within aurora droid
16:20:07 <g65434-2[m]> or you can get it from fdroid site
16:39:56 <crabman[m]1> g65434-2: I looked at https://forum.f-droid.org/t/known-repositories/721 but don't see a "rfc repo"

16:44:05 <g65434-2[m]> you're welcome
16:51:37 <crabman[m]1> g65434-2: So it does not work unless signed?
16:52:46 <crabman[m]1> Can the key be generated from a PC or must it be generated from the phone
16:53:16 <crabman[m]1> And it is unclear to me where to paste the key
16:54:19 <faxing[m]> Yikes the Pixel 3a seems better than the 4a
16:54:27 <faxing[m]> How did they even do that
16:54:30 <ruddo[m]> why?
16:54:37 <ruddo[m]> I mean what's the difference that makes it seem better?
16:55:25 <g65434-2[m]> <crabman[m]1 "g65434-2: So it does not work un"> wdym ?
16:56:45 <faxing[m]> The 3a has more colors, is essentially the same speed, has a larger screen (on the XL), etc
16:57:08 <faxing[m]> also no punchhole notch that gets in the way on the 3a
16:57:17 <faxing[m]> I dunno the 4a just seems like the same thing but worse imo
16:57:22 <faxing[m]> Personal preference though
16:57:46 <mxnorvak[m]> You're getting many details wrong
16:57:52 <ruddo[m]> the 4a is faster.
16:57:56 <ruddo[m]> it has more RAM
16:57:59 <camoufrage[m]> Moderate bezels like the 3a's help me get to the screen better
16:58:03 <ruddo[m]> it has 128 GB memory
16:58:10 <ruddo[m]> it has a larger screen-to-phone ratio
16:58:16 <ruddo[m]> it has a more powerful battery
16:58:20 <ruddo[m]> it charegs at 18 watts
16:58:39 <ruddo[m]> the cameras appear to be the same
16:58:47 <ruddo[m]> 4a weighs less
16:58:48 <mxnorvak[m]> Its screen is bigger while the phone is smaller
16:58:49 <ruddo[m]> and it's in black which I am okay with.
16:59:02 <ruddo[m]> looks like an improvement for sure
16:59:14 <camoufrage[m]> 3a charges at 18w too iirc
16:59:23 <mxnorvak[m]> UFS 2.1 as well
16:59:33 <ruddo[m]> the 4a XL literally has a larger display.
16:59:56 <camoufrage[m]> The faster storage is probably the biggest IMO. emmc is so trash
16:59:56 <ruddo[m]> supports 2 sims, one nano sim and another esim
17:00:05 <ruddo[m]> has an audio jack just like the 3a XL
17:00:14 <crabman[m]1> g65434-2: Sorry, I just realized I was looking at the wrong repository
17:00:35 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <ruddo[m] "the 4a XL literally has a larger"> 4a XL?
17:01:02 <mxnorvak[m]> Apparently it's usb type c port is 3.1 so maybe hdmi support
17:01:03 <ruddo[m]> Yes 4a XL has a larger display than 3a XL.
17:01:13 <faxing[m]> Again, all personal preference like I said
17:01:16 <camoufrage[m]> there is no 4a XL
17:01:21 <mxnorvak[m]> <ruddo[m] "Yes 4a XL has a larger display t"> 4a XL isn't even out yet
17:01:22 <ruddo[m]> It's all incremental improvements tho, I can't find anything about the cool Pixel 4 camera in the Pixel 4a
17:01:41 <camoufrage[m]> most rumors point to the XL being canned
17:01:41 <ruddo[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "4a XL isn't even out yet"> specs are up tho https://www.gadgetsnow.com/compare-mobile-phones/Google-Pixel-3A-XL-vs-Google-Pixel-4A-XL
17:01:46 <faxing[m]> for me literally none of those things matter - so for me, the 4a is worse than the 3a, to each their own, though
17:02:31 <mxnorvak[m]> Alright , these were literally all of the phones spec so idk what matters
17:03:15 <camoufrage[m]> 5 XL, canned. 4a XL, canned. My assumption is the a models take the place of a non-XL size while the "normal" 5 will just be an XL
17:03:16 <faxing[m]> I care that it charges quickly, is fast enough, I don't like intrusions on the display (notches or punch holes), I like OLED, a headphone jack, and thats about it
17:03:21 <faxing[m]> I see where some of the changes could be good for some people
17:03:38 <faxing[m]> but for me it just doesnt make any difference and some of the things make it worse for me
17:03:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> <ruddo[m] "the 4a XL literally has a larger"> There's a 4a XL?
17:03:44 <ruddo[m]> headphone jack is important to me
17:03:48 <ruddo[m]> why I got the a series
17:04:21 <mxnorvak[m]> <faxing[m] "I care that it charges quickly, "> I don't like the punch hole either
17:04:35 <camoufrage[m]> there is no 4a XL, people who have gotten the 4a's specs right for months say they aren't doing an XL anymore
17:04:44 <faxing[m]> Glad I'm not the only one lol
17:05:45 <mxnorvak[m]> <ruddo[m] "specs are up tho https://www.gad"> this is unofficial but also not true then?
17:06:19 <ruddo[m]> idk
17:06:35 <ruddo[m]> The solution will be an actual phone manufacturer that makes free as in freedom phones.
17:06:52 <faxing[m]> fairphone?
17:07:04 <za_warudo-vilfp8> 4a is clearly an improvement to 3a except for punchhole
17:07:30 <za_warudo-vilfp8> sort of dealbreaker since it's hard to cover the camera
17:07:53 <mxnorvak[m]> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "sort of dealbreaker since it's h"> Yea I've been wondering how that could be done
17:08:43 <camoufrage[m]> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "sort of dealbreaker since it's h"> Any suggestions on covering the 3a front camera with a screen protector on?
17:08:55 <alzxjm[m]> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "sort of dealbreaker since it's h"> Do you not trust GrapheneOS to prevent unauthorized camera use?
17:09:03 <camoufrage[m]> Gives very little room to put anything
17:09:38 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <alzxjm[m] "Do you not trust GrapheneOS to p"> It's more of the other apps I install
17:09:43 <za_warudo-vilfp8> They're untrusted
17:09:54 <ruddo[m]> don't give them camera permission
17:09:59 <ruddo[m]> or take the camera out completely.
17:10:06 <alzxjm[m]> Yeah but GrapheneOS handles permissions, not the apps.
17:10:18 <ruddo[m]> (I do agree that it would be good to have a way to physically cover the camera, and a notch makes that almost impossible.)
17:10:26 <alzxjm[m]> If you don't trust GrapheneOS to handle permissions like sensors, what do you trust?
17:10:38 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Some of them, isolated on profiles, have to double sure that they won't get anything on camera though normally, it shouldn't be bypassed thanks to SELinux
17:11:23 <za_warudo-vilfp8> I get your point though. I just prefer it covered
17:11:40 <za_warudo-vilfp8> in case I accidentally give an app permission to camera
17:11:45 <dazinism> Can blacklist apps in Aurora Store if you dont want Aurora to notify/try to update
17:12:05 <alzxjm[m]> I shouldn't be so quick to call you out. I run Chrome OS on a Pixelbook and I have my webcam covered 😅
17:12:32 <za_warudo-vilfp8> By the way, I use sticker that has slider that likes covers it.

17:14:23 <za_warudo-vilfp8> I don't mind to be honest, just avoiding human mistakes. I would have desoldered the mic, but I don't have the skills to do so lol
17:14:48 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <alzxjm[m] "I have [these](https://duckduckg"> Yeah like that
17:15:14 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Though I trust the GrapheneOS' SELinux, I try to make sure that even a human mistake will not leak that much
17:15:47 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Thus, the additional hardware removal for small opsec points. Not that worth for typical usage

18:54:58 <bonerdose[m]> Something like you pay .40 for every dollar
19:01:16 <bonerdose[m]> Another anonymous method is to buy monero and exchange it for free on xmr.to (through tor) for bitcoin.
19:17:11 <charuto> <r357[m] "Same situation here, would love "> look into instant exchanges like morphtoken and changenow that dont require any personal info
19:17:30 <charuto> alternatively you have decentralised exchanges like bisq
19:18:53 <charuto> but as bonerdose mentioned, monero is basically the only decent privacy coin in the space, bitcoin isn't really anonymous nowadays
19:19:19 <ruddo[m]> Wasabi Wallet will anonymize your BTC with CoinJoin.
19:19:39 <ruddo[m]> But yeah Monero is meant to have higher privacy.

22:11:01 <kejsixi[m]> SchismXL: thank you! I have read all of what's linked in the reddit post yesterday, but not https://security.googleblog.com/2018/10/building-titan-better-security-through.html They write ...Titan M performs several security sensitive functions, including:
22:11:01 <kejsixi[m]> Ensuring that even Google can't unlock a phone or install firmware updates without the owner's cooperation with Insider Attack Resistance (link). i have not found anything (5 min search) about how i do NOT cooperate with google's IAR and potential unlock or firmware updates. I'm interested in the firmware, they write they will open source it, but nothing happened yet. im also interessted in other firmware in the phone
22:11:01 <kejsixi[m]> , how do we know there's no backdoor of any kind?I believe one thing is for sure the TitanM has no acces to the ram/SOC etc. But we can't really know that right?
22:12:01 <kejsixi[m]> SchismXL: BTW im currently researching all the functions of the chipsets on the device https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Google+Pixel+3a+Teardown/123256
22:14:32 <SchismXL[m]> "...even Google can't unlock a phone or install firmware updates without the owner's cooperation..." Basically means that if your device is switched off or before first unlock (maybe afterwards, too), they cannot do anything to the device. Period. They need your "permission" in the form of passcode and/or biometrics.
22:14:43 <SchismXL[m]> Anyone correct me if I'm wrong!
22:15:37 <SchismXL[m]> The rest of the answers to your questions are out of my scope, I'm afraid, kejsixi
22:16:03 <kejsixi[m]> hm. which would be stored on the titanM chip itself, or? :D thx
22:16:27 <kejsixi[m]> im pretty annoyed about the whole spying and surveilence s going on, im on a blackberry os 7. only sms calls...
22:17:25 <kejsixi[m]> in the grapheneos faq the firmware(not just titanM) is praised a lot, but we basically dont know anything about it. am i correct?
22:17:32 <SchismXL[m]> <kejsixi[m] "hm. which would be stored on the"> Someone else may be along later today or tomorrow to answer these in more detail, of they have time. But yeah, biometrics and such will be on the Titan M chip.
22:18:18 <kejsixi[m]> alright sounds plausible to me. im trying to connect dots. e-sim would be stored there too i guess
22:18:24 <kejsixi[m]> ty
22:26:24 <bocyemofo[m]> Is it worth getting a 3a still? I'm assuming there will be an experimental 4a build in a month or so, but I don't know how stable that would be.
22:28:13 <bocyemofo[m]> If anyone is using the 4, how experimental is "experimental"?

22:44:07 <j-james[m]> ham5urg: android 10 since last october iirc
22:44:14 <bocyemofo[m]> And how does the Titan chip fit into that? Is your concern that google might use the Titan to collect data?
22:44:48 <kejsixi[m]> yes sounds like an IME/VPRO to me

22:49:41 <bocyemofo[m]> Well Google's adverse goal is transparently data collection - it's probably not impossible to have a backdoor in one of these chips, but they would be fundamentally compromising the security of their hardware - there are much easier ways to collect data on the vast majority of users.
22:50:38 <bocyemofo[m]> Government adversaries are far more likely to be involved in such trickery than Google, it would seem.
22:50:52 <kejsixi[m]> yeah, but what i have gathered and linked to it so far, is that it is the backdoor
22:51:51 <bocyemofo[m]> <kejsixi[m] "yeah, but what i have gathered a"> Google don't need a backdoor to collect data - for practically every android phone they have all the data they want.
22:51:52 <kejsixi[m]> well if oyu see it like that, true, but this is silicon valley, they basically are a own government. I look at it from different angles
22:52:12 <kejsixi[m]> i know how those people think and act beyond the tech stuff
22:53:12 <bocyemofo[m]> This would be an incredibly expensive operation, and would have tremendous cost to Google if it were ever discovered - and would only provide data on a virtually non-existent segment of their market.
22:53:32 <bocyemofo[m]> I just don't see such an attack being economically viable.
22:54:18 <bocyemofo[m]> Of course, that only applies when you are considering profit as a motivation - but I treat Google as being motivated by profit and not some darker purpose.
22:54:40 <kejsixi[m]> sure is viable, economy is in its core land and resources, further ownership
22:54:59 <kejsixi[m]> yep
22:55:11 <bocyemofo[m]> <kejsixi[m] "sure is viable, economy is in it"> I'm not sure I follow you.
22:55:29 <kejsixi[m]> i asumed youre thinking economy = money
22:56:42 <kejsixi[m]> googles resource is data mined from people
22:57:23 <Antoine-Frdric[m> Yes it's viable, just stupid. If such a backdoor existed, it wouldn't be used against you.
22:58:18 <kejsixi[m]> how do you know that ? i believe YOU would not use it against me.
22:58:21 <bocyemofo[m]> <kejsixi[m] "i asumed youre thinking economy "> In this case data = money. A Titan backdoor would only provide data on Pixel phones (Android as a whole is much larger, of course), and would also not provide any extra data except in the (incredibly rare) case of a de-googled custom ROM.
22:58:27 <Antoine-Frdric[m> Maybe there's a backdoor into Titan M, maybe not. Anyway, you're not worth a zero-day.

23:22:03 <kejsixi[m]> wreck: chekc yourself
23:22:18 <wreck[m]> before i wreck myself?
23:22:34 <bocyemofo[m]> I'm inclined to agree - Translating words to any language doesn't seem a reliable way to make decisions about security. But if that is your choice, then avoid phones altogether.
23:22:43 <kejsixi[m]> wreck: why do they choose such names? for fun, accident? all of it, yeah.
23:22:56 <kejsixi[m]> i am not translating it is etymology
23:23:00 <kejsixi[m]> phonetics
23:23:04 <kejsixi[m]> science
23:23:15 <camoufrage[m]> well, presumably the Zucc didn't choose his name
23:23:35 <wreck[m]> nor did ba'als gates or mel-linda
23:23:41 <kejsixi[m]> im avoiding phones yes
23:23:54 <kejsixi[m]> bill and baal and bull and bell are all phoneticaly identical
23:24:17 <kejsixi[m]> thats how dialects form, thats how you trace back language or decode ancient languages too
23:24:38 <bocyemofo[m]> <kejsixi[m] "i am not translating it is etymo"> etymology doesn't have any scientific link to security - are there bad things with good etymology and vice versa?
23:24:40 <kejsixi[m]> the meaning stays the same its true meaning no connonative or dicitonary defined denonnative meanings
23:24:43 <wreck[m]> qualcomm is more likely a combination of "quality" and "communication"
23:24:49 <komsiassa[m]> kejsixi: the world is flat btw
23:24:59 <komsiassa[m]> Oh and was 9/11 an insider job?
23:24:59 <kejsixi[m]> komsiassa: no
23:25:08 <komsiassa[m]> U know 5g is dangerous?
23:25:09 <camoufrage[m]> His names William Gates
23:25:20 <kejsixi[m]> sukiyakiwestern: i know that
23:25:39 <wreck[m]> and alphabet is literally the term for a collection of letters, are you saying alphabets are evil because they have a word for alphabets in hebrew? that doesn't even make sense.
23:26:18 <kejsixi[m]> bocyemofo: nope, but in the name is delcared what it really is for. you can see it as a form of mockery
23:26:30 <komsiassa[m]> Seriously, why should they choose those names to show "their real meaning - according to you"
23:26:38 <komsiassa[m]> Why not choose something to hide it then.
23:26:44 <komsiassa[m]> You need to talk to someone
23:26:49 <kejsixi[m]> wreck: yes but the word is hebrew origin
23:27:08 <komsiassa[m]> You also think Bill Gates is big pharma?
23:27:21 <bocyemofo[m]> <kejsixi[m] "wreck: yes but the word is hebre"> If I write something in Hebrew does that make it true?
23:27:21 <kejsixi[m]> wreck: alphabet in hebrew does not mean a collection of letters that resemble phonems and are used by your vocal cords to make sounds
23:27:53 <wreck[m]> kejsixi: your name is KEJ, a russian airport, SIX, which is "sex" in latin, and I, as in eye, as in third eye. so clearly your a russian KGB agent who's a sexual deviant and believes in astral projection.
23:28:32 <kejsixi[m]> komsiassa: look up high court judges in the us, and check what their names mean ; )
23:28:44 <kejsixi[m]> wreck: you said that
23:29:09 <komsiassa[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias
23:29:10 <komsiassa[m]> Read that
23:29:15 <kejsixi[m]> your techy guys, dont you have any associative thinking? variables? x+1=2 what is x?
23:29:36 <LinusSexTips[m]> H
23:29:41 <kejsixi[m]> correlative thining*
23:29:42 <komsiassa[m]> Seriously, this is turning into r/privacy
23:29:44 <bocyemofo[m]> I think we have left the topic of conversation of this room - I suggest we move to #grapheneos-offtopic or return to GrapheneOS
23:30:02 <kejsixi[m]> youre going over the top
23:30:09 <bocyemofo[m]> <komsiassa[m] "Seriously, this is turning into "> That's pretty harsh to r/privacy
23:30:15 <wreck[m]> i'm walking away from this conversation right now, i can't believe someone would be that stupid. i'll be back when saner people are in here.
23:30:39 <kejsixi[m]> what i told you is those people use certain names and symbols to show who they are, in their mind they told you who they are, youre just too stupid to see it.
23:30:43 <komsiassa[m]> Im here wreck
23:31:08 <wreck[m]> thanks komsiassa
23:31:18 <komsiassa[m]> I always wondered if those paranoid people existed before the internet
23:31:25 <komsiassa[m]> Or the internet just gave them a voice
23:31:41 <kejsixi[m]> like eagles on flags depict: authority, rulership, predators, can see more from above, can see far away etc.
23:31:42 <wreck[m]> they did, they just didn't have a megaphone to find other people just as dumb as them and spread their gospel
23:32:01 <komsiassa[m]> You see what you want to see. You could conclude anything you want by your logic.
23:32:05 <wreck[m]> oh! i forgot about the ignore feature, i'm going to use that right now. thanks, matrix!
23:32:18 <kejsixi[m]> you have a lot of assumptions, i can make a nother identity, and be your best friend. child...
23:32:40 <kejsixi[m]> nonono i have perception, but i can see whats true and align my perception with what is true
23:32:44 <komsiassa[m]> Like you could hide your paranoia
23:32:46 <kejsixi[m]> dont lecture me. boy ; )
23:32:59 <kejsixi[m]> wreck yourself, cya
23:33:11 <kejsixi[m]> no argument, go away. by by, boy.
23:33:45 <komsiassa[m]> Go to r/privacy. You will find like-minded people
23:33:58 <kejsixi[m]> grapheneos is about privacy
23:34:21 <komsiassa[m]> You're paranoia. Read the rules. It exactly states that types like you isnt allowed
23:34:30 <komsiassa[m]> It's toxic for our society though. Cause more and more  people believe in it. We need better education
23:34:49 <komsiassa[m]> https://jollyrogers.ca/public/grapheneos-channel-rules.txt
23:34:51 <komsiassa[m]> Here are the rules
23:34:55 <wreck[m]> don't feed the trolls komsiassa . use the ignore. you're just talking to yourself on my end.
23:35:14 <komsiassa[m]> Well we're actually on-topic about GrapheneOS now
23:35:28 <komsiassa[m]> He thinks it's the right place, cause grapheneOS is about privacy
23:36:23 <kejsixi[m]> really ? D) Fantasizing about hypothetical worst-case scenarios like backdoors, nationstate adversaries, intelligence agencies, and their capabilities, or "GrapheneOS versus Three Letter Agency" speculation. It's unfortunate but this type of discussion just ends up being GrapheneOS versus your imagination. Code has limits, your imagination doesn't, and it's not useful to try to threat model against an adversary whose
23:36:23 <kejsixi[m]> capabilities are hypothetical and unlimited.
23:37:00 <kejsixi[m]> ends up being grapheneos versus your imagination. you are telling me that you create a OS for privacy and security and you DONT know anything about such things you hav eno knowledg eof that at all? what are you creating this os for then?
23:37:18 <kejsixi[m]> hm? paranoid. haha.
23:37:51 <komsiassa[m]> There is no "you". strcat is the lead developer, but it got a couple of contributors
23:38:35 <kejsixi[m]> what are you talking about..?
23:38:41 <komsiassa[m]> People use GrapheneOS for different reasons. Some are paranoid, other just find it interesting. Others are against mass surveillance and such
23:38:50 <komsiassa[m]> That it's a community project
23:38:57 <komsiassa[m]> Its not a single developer
23:39:11 <komsiassa[m]> You're free to go write code to the project
23:39:36 <kejsixi[m]> let me get this straight again. the os is made for privacy and security. but no one knows about the firmware. and discussions about "hypothetical worst-case scenarios like..." are not allowed? whats the goal with the os
23:39:38 <kejsixi[m]> ego?
23:40:00 <komsiassa[m]> Well my goal is that I find it interesting
23:40:04 <alzxjm[m]> What is going on in here
23:40:07 <komsiassa[m]> Other live in a supressing country
23:40:11 <kejsixi[m]> good, i fit into all of those categories except paranoid. fuckhead. no one attacked you
23:40:15 <kejsixi[m]> you and this other fucker attacked me
23:40:20 <kejsixi[m]> both ignroed fuck yourselfs. boys
23:40:35 <komsiassa[m]> Some are against mass surveillance and want to get targeted (make it harder and more expensive to get their info) to give up their info
23:41:05 <alzxjm[m]> Hey I get to try out the Ignore button on this guy.
23:41:18 <komsiassa[m]> Which of us :p
23:41:24 <wreck[m]> it works great alzxjm
23:41:41 <bonerdose[m]> I'm gonna say the N word
23:41:51 <kejsixi[m]> if you had some confidence youd just do it and not declare it to others, kidna sounds like you need some attention
23:41:55 * cdesai is ready to kick
23:42:03 <cdesai> kejsixi[m]: consider this a warning, please stay on topic
23:42:38 <kejsixi[m]> good
23:43:09 <cdesai> applies to everyone, let's try and keep things civil
23:43:49 <kejsixi[m]> im in content.
23:44:40 <kejsixi[m]> im sorry, i have asked, as i think very good questions, thats all i wanted. i got angry at the end, i appologize.
23:44:58 <strcat[m]> you make up a bunch of bullshit and spread FUD
23:45:19 <strcat[m]> and weird anti-semitic shit
23:45:19 <kejsixi[m]> ok you can fuck off then im leaving
23:45:20 <kejsixi[m]> as shole
23:45:21 <kejsixi[m]> i
23:45:24 <strcat[m]> if you want to go read the firmware code, go read it, dunno what your problem is
23:45:29 <strcat[m]> it's available
23:45:30 <kejsixi[m]> liitle boys ego
23:45:32 <bonerdose[m]> I had a veggie delight with Italian bread and provolone today it was very good
23:45:34 <kejsixi[m]> fuck you
23:45:49 <bonerdose[m]> I just felt like sharing my sand which damn
23:48:31 <bonerdose[m]> So anyways does graphene have the capability to prevent cold-boot attacks?
23:48:36 <strcat[m]> that's some fucking weird shit
23:48:46 <strcat[m]> that guy talking about demons and shit
23:48:55 <strcat[m]> fucking moron
23:48:59 <bonerdose[m]> Schizo tendencies will do that
23:49:07 <komsiassa[m]> It's sad a lot privacy oriented people turn into that
23:49:17 <bonerdose[m]> It is a rabbit hole
23:49:23 <komsiassa[m]> Like we "normal" privacy oriented people just look like freaks
23:49:35 <komsiassa[m]> A bit like vegans
23:49:44 <bonerdose[m]> I got called a tin-foil hatter because I deleted my Facebook lmao
23:49:49 <komsiassa[m]> There are a lot of normal ones, but the extreme ones makes the rest look like freaks
23:50:01 <bonerdose[m]> I feel that's true for anything
23:50:05 <alex-resist> Why do you not kick folks sooner? The last two hours or so were a horrible read. Really off-putting
23:50:22 <komsiassa[m]> Well  I deleted mine too and I can perfectly and logically argue for it. Not like he did. That was insane
23:51:30 <bonerdose[m]> People call Daniel Micay a schizo on 4chan solely because of his elaborate responses on reddit
23:52:55 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: because I don't sit in the channel 24/7
23:53:12 <wreck[m]> well clearly we need to remedy that
23:53:56 <komsiassa[m]> <wreck[m] "well clearly we need to remedy t"> The thing on 4chan? Seriously, i'm not sure you can change the mind of those people
23:54:08 <komsiassa[m]> Just like r/privacy. It's too late. We need to educate sooner
23:54:16 <alex-resist> strcat[m]: are you the only one who can kick?
23:54:28 <komsiassa[m]> Those people research a lot. The problem is that they arent picky about their sources
23:54:49 <wreck[m]> is there a list somewhere of the features that have successfully been pushed upstream to AOSP from the graphene project? i know they don't always look the same, but it would be nice to see what features have been incorporated into the broader android ecosystem
23:55:24 <wreck[m]> <komsiassa[m] "The thing on 4chan? Seriously, i"> i was referring to strcat doing nothing but sitting in this channel 24/7
23:55:39 <komsiassa[m]> <wreck[m] "i was referring to strcat doing "> Nevermind me then
23:55:56 <komsiassa[m]> <wreck[m] "is there a list somewhere of the"> Yes there is. Looking for it. Found it once. Not sure where
23:57:17 <strcat[m]> don't maintain a list like that anymore
23:57:40 <strcat[m]> there is only the legacy one from years ago that has been ripped off with others taking credit for my work
23:57:52 <strcat[m]> relabelling my old docs / blog posts
23:57:57 <strcat[m]> and falsely taking credit for my work and the code that I own
23:58:19 <strcat[m]> i.e. james donaldson #1 scammer in the mobile security space
23:58:47 <strcat[m]> stole > $100k worth of bitcoin which he uses to bribe ppl to support him
23:58:57 <strcat[m]> and fund bogus legal attacks on the project
23:59:00 <strcat[m]> and assorted fraud
