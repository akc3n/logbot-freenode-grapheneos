00:02:55 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: it would take too lon"> Ah, I didn't think of LTO. That makes a lot of sense.
00:05:17 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it wouldn't really help much anyway
00:05:24 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: there is upstream work on fine-grained ASLR to do stuff like that
00:05:34 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really offer much
00:06:17 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Should you use Orbot in VPN mode?
00:06:28 <strcat[m]> yes
00:06:43 <strcat[m]> using it by having apps route traffic through it is error prone, those apps can screw it up and have leaks
00:07:02 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Don't choose any apps, right?
00:07:05 <strcat[m]> better to have the OS feature force all their traffic through it via always-on VPN + block connections not via VPN
00:07:11 <strcat[m]> dxrwzy9y: yes just do the whole user profile
00:07:15 <strcat[m]> don't do only specific apps
00:07:29 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Okay
00:07:39 <strcat[m]> the OS routes all OS and app traffic through it other than the low-level OS networking for connecting to a network and letting the VPN app do stuff
00:07:45 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Standard settings, right?
00:08:00 <strcat[m]> just enable always-on VPN + block connections not through VPN
00:08:04 <strcat[m]> in the VPN settings in the OS
00:08:05 <strcat[m]> that's it
00:08:07 <strcat[m]> don't change anything else
00:08:24 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Okay
00:08:49 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: there is upstream wor"> Knowing upstream, it's probably going to take a few years to land.
00:46:58 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Do widgets connect to the internet when you're not interacting with them?
00:49:35 <Lightsword> hi, I'm trying to recover data off of a pixel 3a xl(bonito) that's failing to boot, I built an eng build using "choosecombo release aosp_bonito eng" but doesn't seem to be enabled during boot
00:50:15 <Lightsword> any idea how I can get adb working so I can debug the boot failure?
00:52:46 <rny> Lightsword: you need to use the signed release from releases.grapheneos.org if you have installed daniel's keys
00:53:00 <Lightsword> rny, no keys installed and unlocked
00:53:10 <rny> Lightsword: then what data is there to recover?
00:53:24 <Lightsword> rny, the userdata partition
00:53:39 <rny> were you using stock previously?
00:54:05 <rny> the stock google OS
00:55:22 <rny> reflash that and use adb to do whatever backup it is that you need, then follow the directions on grapheneos.org, installing new keys into avb wipes the device.
00:56:01 <Lightsword> rny, I can't get stock to boot to recover data either
00:56:19 <Lightsword> I can get adb in recovery but that's about it so far
00:56:26 <Lightsword> but can't seem to mount data...
00:56:39 <rny> Lightsword: of course not, the filesystem is encrypted lol
00:57:01 <rny> it needs to boot successfully into the OS
00:57:16 <Lightsword> rny, yeah, that's what I figured, is there any way to force enable adb during boot with grapheneos?
00:58:24 <rny> Lightsword: unfortunately no
00:58:30 <Lightsword> I followed the "Faster builds for development use only" option for the build
00:58:47 <rny> Lightsword: otherwise an adversary would be able to compromise everyone else's pixel
00:59:10 <rny> if you figured it out, google will pay you $1M+
00:59:11 <Lightsword> rny, even with a fully unlocked bootloader and no keys installed in avb?
00:59:41 <Lightsword> I thought that's what eng images were for
00:59:49 <rny> Lightsword: no i dont think so, it'll just wipe userdata everytime there's changes
01:00:22 <Lightsword> rny, how do you create development images for debugging early boot issues usually?
01:00:32 <rny> Lightsword: userdebug builds
01:00:50 <Lightsword> so "choosecombo userdebug aosp_bonito eng"?
01:01:22 <Lightsword> or "choosecombo release aosp_bonito userdebug"?
01:01:45 <rny> Lightsword: 2nd
01:03:22 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Do widgets connect to the intern"> Do they?
01:04:08 <rny> Lightsword: question here is if you've acrued the userdata while the phone's bootloader was unlocked?
01:04:20 <Lightsword> rny, yes
01:04:34 <Lightsword> has not been wiped since boot failure
01:04:46 <Lightsword> and was already unlocked with no keys installed
01:07:10 <Dylanger[m]> ðŸ˜‘
01:17:44 <Lightsword> rny, what img files are necessary to flash for a userdebug build?
01:18:19 <rny> fastboot flashall
01:19:16 <Lightsword> rny with the files in the $OUT folder?
01:24:17 <rny> choosecombo sets up your env so fastboot knows where to find the img files to flash
01:25:29 <Lightsword> rny, ah, I'm flashing on a different system than I compile on, but ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT seemed to set it up at least
01:26:02 <rny> then run choosecombo on the system you're flashing on too
01:26:10 <rny> so its sets up the environment too
01:29:18 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Is it a security or privacy issue if I use AirPods on GrapheneOS?
01:30:12 <cyborgninjaneer[> Having Bluetooth on in public is a privacy issue unless GrapheneOS has patched it. It usually doesn't change MAC often enough
01:30:17 <rny> dxrwzy9y[m]: it is a security/privacy issue once you toggle on bluetooth lol
01:30:57 <dxrwzy9y[m]> So it's better to use wired headphones in public while Bluetooth is okay in private?
01:31:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> I think there have been some pretty serious Bluetooth based exploits too, but again I don't know how much GrapheneOS has mitigated them.
01:31:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> Bluetooth has a longer range than you think, but what's the chance of some rando driving around the neighborhood hacking people's phones via Bluetooth?
01:32:30 <cyborgninjaneer[> On the other hand, lots of places use Bluetooth beacons in public places to track smartphone users as they move around.
01:32:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> So, you do the math.
01:33:32 <rny> dxrwzy9y[m]: if you're asking if bluetooth usage increases your exposure to security/privacy risks -- yes.
01:33:50 <cyborgninjaneer[> ^ that's the general answer
01:33:54 <rny> if you're asking if bluetooth usage will harm your security/privacy -- the short answer is unlikely.
01:34:18 <rny> a lot of work has gone into improving security and privacy within the aosp codebase alone
01:35:47 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Okay
01:36:06 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Are there any good earbuds you'd recommend?
01:36:26 <rny> ask in the offtopic channel
01:36:36 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you're trying to play spy-vs-spy and be as close to a ghost as you can, use only WiFi with full MAC  randomization. For general use, turn off Bluetooth when you put the earbuds away so you're not walking around with it enabled for no reason.
01:37:00 <rny> the earbuds would likely give away your privacy, not so much the phone's bluetooth
01:37:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> You should not have BT enabled if you aren't using it.
01:37:25 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Yeah of course I always disable whatever I'm not using at the moment.
01:38:19 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <rny "the earbuds would likely give aw"> Bluetooth is encrypted, right? Others can't intercept what I'm listening, right?
01:38:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's encrypted, but the security isn't great.
01:39:27 <rny> the microcontrollers in the bt devices cant keep up lol
01:39:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> Try to use up to date hardware if that's a concern. I think at the moment that would be BT 5.1
01:40:15 <cyborgninjaneer[> Short answer is "Yes, but don't trust it."
01:40:54 <cyborgninjaneer[> For example, I never enter passwords on a Bluetooth keyboard
01:42:27 <cyborgninjaneer[> As far as some weirdo listening in on your phone calls or music, it's possible but unlikely someone would go to the trouble.
01:43:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> There's not a lot of motive for a criminal or law enforcement to do that to the average person.
01:52:16 <vudu> Hi, i have a question about grapheneos manager, my device is being controlled by a third party
01:52:41 <vudu> Is it possible that the person who is managing my device can see my location and media?
01:52:56 <vudu> I am using google pixel 4
02:04:34 <brenneke[m]> <vudu "Hi, i have a question about grap"> What is graphenos manager?
02:05:12 <vudu> Device manager, but i think the person who is managing the devices called it grapheneos manager.
02:05:37 <louipc> your company provided phone?
02:07:30 <vudu> Yes, but i have my concerns since i have no idea if someone who is managing my phone has acces 2 my location and media and etc, is that possible?
02:11:32 <brenneke[m]> Does it show GrapheneOS screen when it boots?
02:11:46 <vudu> Yes
02:11:55 <louipc> hmm i'm not sure what features your device manager has
02:12:22 <louipc> but google has some feature for android you can track your phone's location
02:13:06 <brenneke[m]> Can you access Location settings?
02:13:23 <vudu> And media and my confersations? Would that be possible with the right features? Or is graphene protecting against that kind of managaers
02:14:10 <vudu> Where can i find location settings so i can look?
02:14:27 <brenneke[m]> In Settings.
02:14:38 <vudu> Ow fount it, no i cant acces it, i can see they are off and i cannot change it
02:15:15 <brenneke[m]> What is off?
02:15:57 <vudu> Location is off in settings, and i cannot change it to ON
02:16:33 <vudu> There are more setting that i cannot change because the device manager is managing it
02:16:48 <brenneke[m]> What kind of company do you work for?
02:17:38 <LostScreen> Hey there, could use some help as I just cracked my screen on my pixel 3a with graphene os on it. Although I already know the answer, I thought I'd ask. With a cracked screen is there any possibility to connect to it trough a computer terminal and extract files? Mind you IÂ´ve set it to not autoconnect usb, I must manually go inte settings and
02:17:39 <LostScreen> enable what IÂ´d like to do with the usb connection..
02:20:20 <LostScreen> #ImFu**edRight #NeedToReplaceScreen #FML
02:21:01 <brenneke[m]> What's with the hashtags?
02:23:26 <LostScreen> Just me being frustrated, realizing there's no way to access those files before I replace the screen. Fed up with myself and just havinga bad day. There's no way to access those files right?
02:32:58 <brenneke[m]> Dunno.....did you try?
02:37:07 <louipc> vudu: i guess any app that has access to media could read the media and send to the company
02:39:17 <vudu> Well i m not worriedd about the alls, but the manager has acces, when i look in system that grapheneos manager has alles acceses, media files, phone, sensors network etc no acces is denied
02:39:57 <louipc> and you can't disable it i guess
02:40:15 <vudu> No i cant
02:40:30 <louipc> it would be interesting to hear more info about this manager though if you can find out anything
02:41:11 <vudu> It look the same as device manager in android, same pictogram, only the name is grapheneos manager
02:41:32 <vudu> Strange that no ons here knows about it since there are some developers here
02:42:40 <vudu> The whole privacy point of graphene is lost when being manager i guess
02:43:07 <vudu> The problem ks i cant wipe the phone also, also that feature is disabled
02:43:10 <louipc> wonder why they call it 'grapheneos manager' though
02:43:22 <louipc> seems like a trademark issue
02:44:01 <vudu> I couldnt find anything about it on google also
02:44:30 <louipc> vudu: yes because the company owns the phone, so I guess they have the rights to control it
02:44:44 <louipc> but it still has enhanced security features compared to normal android
02:45:50 <louipc> so leave the phone at work in a locked drawer and enjoy your off time
02:45:53 <louipc> :D
02:47:13 <vudu> Whahaha lol , or i can just reset the phone , i googled and fount out if i press power button with volume down i can go to fastboot mode and than recovery
02:47:53 <vudu> But i dont know if i will get in trouble if i do that lol
02:47:54 <louipc> hmm maybe heh
02:50:47 <brenneke[m]> Considered getting your own phone?
02:51:35 <vudu> I got my own phone, butt still i am interested in the possibility of the manager
02:52:08 <vudu> I have both phone with me always and would not like to share my location
02:53:10 <brenneke[m]> What kind of company you work for that uses GOS?
02:54:03 <vudu> A company that likes 2 spy on they employees
02:54:45 <louipc> if you try to disable/modify stuff then the device may not work properly until you restore it. that happened to me at one company
02:54:50 <louipc> fun to try it though
02:55:38 <vudu> Yeah i am consitering to boot to recovery mode and clear all data
02:55:50 <vudu> See if the manager will be deleted,
02:56:29 <strcat[m]> there is no 'GrapheneOS manager'
02:56:39 <strcat[m]> also how is it that I just mentioned the possibility of a device manager being developed to someone
02:56:46 <strcat[m]> and now we have a user claiming to have a device with it?
02:57:08 <louipc> coincidence?
02:57:24 <vudu> Well i really have a device with grapheneos manager
02:57:43 <vudu> I am not making this up
02:57:47 <strcat> there is no GrapheneOS manager
02:57:54 <louipc> if you can share any info, even in private that would be helpful
02:57:55 <strcat> we don't make a device manager
02:58:08 <louipc> yea i said it sounds like a trademark issue
02:58:14 <strcat> ^
02:58:18 <strcat> if this really exists
02:58:24 <strcat> here's the problem: we don't make a GrapheneOS manager
02:58:25 <vudu> Wel someone did, because i have a device with grapheneos manager installed on it
02:58:39 <strcat> I just mentioned the possibility of us theoretically being able to develop a device manager
02:58:56 <strcat> vudu: it sounds like you have a phone from one the companies selling GrapheneOS devices that is not partnered with us
02:58:59 <strcat> and they just use our OS
02:59:04 <strcat> but we don't have a device manager
02:59:14 <strcat> vudu: is this your personal property (the phone) or a company device?
02:59:18 <strcat> where did you get this phone?
02:59:31 <louipc> i wonder if its even an official grapheneos build
02:59:42 <strcat> ^
03:00:03 <vudu> In the netherlands
03:00:10 <strcat> where did you get the phone
03:00:13 <louipc> :p
03:00:15 <strcat> did you buy it?
03:00:21 <strcat> who did you buy it from?
03:00:24 <strcat> where did you get it?
03:00:40 <louipc> vudu: u can say in private if you wish
03:00:44 <rny> and how much did you pay
03:01:08 <rny> maybe the official site should list partner vendors
03:01:15 <rny> so users know who to buy from
03:01:36 <rny> strcat: ^
03:01:43 <louipc> if there were any? :p
03:02:00 <rny> apparently the overpriced australian one has contacted daniel
03:03:07 <rny> $2k for grapheneos phone :P
03:03:23 <louipc> nice
03:03:33 <joehandcockandja> Dear god
03:03:51 <strcat> lets not worry about this right now
03:04:07 <strcat> GrapheneOS is available from https://grapheneos.org/releases / https://github.com/GrapheneOS for free
03:04:39 <vudu> I am aware of that
03:04:41 <rny> i assume they run a 24/7 helpdesk too
03:05:25 <strcat> vudu: it sounds like this is a company's phone
03:05:33 <strcat> bought from a company selling devices with a GrapheneOS (not us)
03:05:40 <strcat> not your phone
03:05:55 <strcat> and they have a device manager installed on it using our name
03:06:03 <strcat> but again we didn't make that
03:06:14 <strcat> I'd love it if we had an open source GrapheneOS device manager
03:06:17 <strcat> but we don't
03:06:24 <strcat> we don't make something like that atm
03:06:32 <vudu> Okey i understand
03:06:51 <strcat> vudu: you can provide me with more information in private
03:11:13 <strcat> spoiler: they did not provide more information
03:11:23 <strcat> going to just hope that was a troll
03:12:05 <Linus[m]1> irc guy so may have just logged off for the night
03:12:15 <strcat> nah
03:31:00 <somenerd[m]> > going to just hope that was a troll
03:31:00 <somenerd[m]> complex troll then
03:31:08 <somenerd[m]> "grapheneos manager"
03:35:07 <joehandcockandja> I thought Daniel was the grapheneOS manager
03:35:13 <joehandcockandja> Haha
03:49:20 <strcat[m]> somenerd: I think it was real and it's some company selling phones with an app called that - certainly not ours
03:50:09 <somenerd[m]> how do people find these?
03:50:12 <somenerd[m]> I'm confused
03:50:20 <somenerd[m]> when I search GrapheneOS
03:50:32 <somenerd[m]> the first site is the official one
03:50:54 <somenerd[m]> and then wikipedia and GitHub
03:51:41 <louipc> the nederland seller is on linkedin
03:52:00 <louipc> using grapheneos name with modified logo
03:52:14 <somenerd[m]> ohhhh
03:52:26 <louipc> website links to official site tho
03:52:38 <louipc> so its kinda messed up
03:53:02 <somenerd[m]> yeah
03:53:03 <brenneke[m]> Try to buy?
03:53:30 <louipc> guess i could email to ask about the 'grapheneos manager'
03:54:06 <somenerd[m]> probably some sorta DRM?
03:54:09 <brenneke[m]> Sure, ask about features.....but guy might be here already.
03:54:45 <joehandcockandja> Send a link to the linkedin
03:55:11 <louipc> https://www.linkedin.com/company/grapheneos/
03:55:28 <louipc> treat this delicately
03:55:57 <joehandcockandja> Yikes
04:21:28 <purist96> Hey everyone. Any word on whether Graphene is be resistant to SignalFrame tracking? https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-step-in-government-data-tracking-is-the-internet-of-things-11606478401
04:29:05 <louipc> unless you can get details about exactly what they are doing its hard to say
04:29:33 <louipc> but reduced attack surface and extra hardening will increase resistance for sure
04:29:42 <louipc> generally speaking
04:36:45 <purist96> The article isn't very specific. Generally speaking, it looks like SignalFrame scans peripheral MAC addresses and adds that info to the database in addition to on-device tracking. This apparently goes beyond wifi triangulation to mapping bluetooth and any other wireless device nearby. I'm just not sure a) how it gets on your phone in the first
04:36:46 <purist96> place, and b) whether a graphene device would be visible or not to a standard android "infected" with SignalFrame's tracker.
04:38:24 <louipc> sounds like they're targeting IOT stuff which are notoriously insecure/bad
04:38:30 <louipc> low hanging fruit
04:41:44 <purist96> I guess that's comforting. If anyone has more access or info I would love to hear how Graphene performs in relation to SignalFrame.
04:42:51 <louipc> but if you open a portal into your home/life via a bad app not much can help you there
05:19:28 <user36288978[m]> Anyone who has setup a pixel 4a with graphene is it pretty straight forward because it seems simple I'm just worried about bricking my phone in the process if I mess up.
05:20:40 <cyborgninjaneer[> There aren't a lot of good options for tracking a GrapheneOS phone. I don't think SignalFlame is relevant as it would probably infect a device (I'm guessing) through Google Play Services as it would be easy to make a deal with Google.
05:21:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> But that's just my impression from reading a vague article. Just reboot your device often like you should anyway if you're mildly paranoid.

15:30:17 <alzxjm> https://github.com/standardnotes/mobile
15:30:20 <alzxjm> latest version
15:30:30 <alzxjm> not sure when the behavior started, but seems recent
15:34:28 <signalarch[m]> I use it. It has so many bugs. I've seen that one before, I think before I was using graphene though, so I'm not much help.
15:35:41 <alzxjm> it doesn't seem like a grapheneos problem, but it only happens on my phone (not the desktop apps or webapps)
15:35:45 <alzxjm> so wanted to start there
15:36:10 <organicpumpkin[m> Looks like they did a major upgrade to 3.5 recently (the fdroid version is still 3.0.17 for me).
15:36:10 <organicpumpkin[m> Their upgrade did cause issues like "Migration to 3.5 from older versions of the app might have failed for some users because of Keychain data missing"
15:37:22 <alzxjm> my phone has been on v3.5 for a while
15:37:34 <alzxjm> it has been uninstalled and reinstalled a bunch of times, too
15:37:45 <organicpumpkin[m> My older version works fine. BUT, haven't tried on GrapheneOS yet. You will need help from someone else on the GrapheneOS front.
15:37:46 <organicpumpkin[m> From my end I will use the 3.5 for me and see if that reproduces an issue.
15:38:19 <alzxjm> gonna submit an issue on their end, too
15:38:39 <organicpumpkin[m> <alzxjm "gonna submit an issue on their e"> I was just going to suggest that
15:47:20 <alzxjm> the Standard Notes issue is not replicating currently
15:47:33 <alzxjm> might also be coinciding with GrapheneOS updates
15:47:34 <alzxjm> not sure
16:03:50 <userman23[m]> I am trying to use my wifi hotspot on my phone.  When my client connects, it can not connect to the internet.  On my phone, it is able to resolve websites.  On the client, I can ping the gateway, but can't get beyond that it seems.  Ie, I can't ping 1.1.1.1 or 9.9.9.9.  I tried the sim on my s9, and it worked.  I put it back into my 3a, and it still doesn't work.
16:20:10 <Golli[m]2> Working fine on my 4 XL.
16:37:51 <strcat> there is someone misrepresenting themselves as a co-founder of GrapheneOS in the Netherlands
16:38:19 <strcat> they've been repeatedly asked to stop doing that, and we've tried in the nicest way possible to remain on good terms with them while having them not misrepresenting their involvement in the project
16:39:11 <strcat> they had our permission to sell phones with GrapheneOS, but unfortunately they have substantially misrepresented their involvement in the project and appear to be misusing the project's brand for software that was not created by GrapheneOS
16:39:42 <strcat> they recently cut off contact with me after I tried to get them to start turning over more accounts / domains they created in the name of the project
16:39:58 <strcat> so, be aware of that, there are other people pulling similar things too
16:40:22 <strcat> there are a bunch of companies selling GrapheneOS phones and some of them may be misrepresenting their involvement in the product and presenting themselves as officially partnered, etc. when they are not
16:41:21 <strcat> some of you that were here yesterday may remember that someone came here asking about a "GrapheneOS manager" app and I believe that it is something this person created in the name of the project without permission
16:41:46 <strcat> very unfortunate that it comes to this because they did provide some help to the project but they seem unable to understand the boundaries and continue misuing the brand and misrepresenting their involvement
16:42:06 <strcat> I am not yet going to be talking about them by name, but just be aware that there are no other co-founders
16:42:40 <strcat> qubits: is it a coincidence that you just joined?
16:42:59 <qubits> why?
16:43:16 <qubits> what happend?
16:45:40 <strcat> qubits: yesterday you asked questions about device managers which were followed by someone else joining and talking about a "GrapheneOS manager" which is NOT something that GrapheneOS has created
16:45:41 <entry1[m]> Good to know Daniel. Are there any companies selling your phones that give you a well deserved portion of their revenues? It would be nice other than directly donating for non-tech saavy individuals to help out the actual driver of the project rather than just retailers.
16:45:47 <strcat> and it appears that someone has created an app misusing the name
16:46:12 <strcat> entry1[m]: we need to deal with people misusing the name of the project, etc. as a priority right now
16:46:45 <louipc> i thought that was vudu that asked about grapheneos manager
16:46:56 <strcat> louipc: yes but it was right after qubits asked questions on the same topic
16:47:01 <strcat> and to be clear
16:47:03 <louipc> ok
16:47:11 <strcat> there is no such thing as a GrapheneOS device manager app, we do not have a "GrapheneOS manager"
16:47:34 <strcat> we are trying to resolve issues of companies overstepping their bounds and pretending to be more involved with GrapheneOS than they are
16:47:48 <strcat> unfortunately, Copperhead are not the only ones doing things to harm the project
16:47:53 <strcat> they are by far the worst
16:48:09 <entry1[m]> Other than your OS releases, the only other apps are Vanadium, Auditor, and PDF reader correct?
16:48:12 <strcat> but there are other scammers, and the worst part is a lot of them seem to appear helpful and willing to address problems, etc.
16:48:24 <strcat> entry1[m]: all of our apps are on our GrapheneOS GitHub account
16:48:31 <strcat> we have NO proprietary variants of the OS and NO proprietary apps
16:49:08 <strcat> there is no GrapheneOS co-founder in the netherlands, there is someone who had permission to sell devices and misrepresented their involvement repeatedly and who has now reached the end of my tolerance for their BS
16:49:28 <strcat> people need to be skeptical of those claiming involvement with the project
16:49:44 <strcat> contactâŠ™go <- send an email there if someone claims to be involved
16:51:07 <strcat[m]> everything official is on our site: Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, etc.
16:57:13 <qubits> Oh just readed
16:57:31 <qubits> Actually i would like to have authenitc grapheneos manager
16:58:32 <qubits> Wich devices is that user selling in Netherlands?
16:59:11 <strcat[m]> qubits: please don't worry about the details yet
16:59:15 <strcat[m]> the issue is someone misrepresenting themselves as a co-founder of the project
16:59:15 <entry1[m]> <qubits "Wich devices is that user sellin"> I don't think he wants to bring attention to it, but just set the record straight that there is no association
16:59:39 <qubits> I m from Netherlands also thats the reason i m interested
16:59:46 <strcat[m]> our licensing permits selling phones with GrapheneOS as long as those companies give appropriate attribution and do not impersonate us, etc.
17:00:00 <qubits> Okay i understood
17:00:11 <strcat[m]> qubits: yes and you should know that I am suspicious about the messages you posted yesterday and the potential that you were tied somehow to that vudu user who came later
17:00:29 <strcat[m]> qubits: I'm not saying you did anything wrong
17:00:40 <qubits> Dont be suspicious, cinfindence can happen
17:01:06 <qubits> I m still searching for some manager
17:01:09 <strcat[m]> yes but are you aware of vendors claiming to represent GrapheneOS in the Netherlands? and did it have something to do with you joining the channel?
17:01:37 <qubits> I heard about such story, thats the reason i came here
17:01:47 <qubits> To hear what is official statemant
17:02:20 <qubits> Somone tried to sell me also , claiming he is the one of the owners of Grapheneos
17:02:44 <qubits> But he didnt like that smart haha
17:02:59 <qubits> he didnt look that smart
17:03:25 <qubits> Anyway i m searching for some solution to manage grapheneos nothing more
17:03:37 <qubits> To restrict some functions and applications that i dont need
17:17:38 <alex-resist> I found this: https://www.linkedin.com/company/grapheneos
17:18:07 <alex-resist> strcat
17:18:34 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: please discuss it in PMs if you want to
17:18:36 <th0mcat> I'm tweeting @linkedinhelp right now, strcat .  Hopefully they can expedite the process.
17:18:39 <strcat[m]> I was very careful with what I said and didn't link to stuff for a reason
17:18:59 <alex-resist> strcat PM with you? Or someone else?
17:19:11 <alex-resist> Oh shit, I'm sorry
17:22:22 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I don't want to call this person out by name because they did have permission to sell phones and did provide help to the project and I would not be making this public if they had not recently stopped responding to me
17:22:34 <strcat[m]> I was working things out with them and then contact was strangely cut off when it appeared to be going fine
17:23:18 <alex-resist> I see, I just wanted to contribute to the research but I was naive
17:23:46 <alex-resist> Again, apologies
17:34:11 <organicpumpkin[m> strcat Do you not have good legal help for things like this? Maybe a nonprofit that supports free software?
17:34:11 <organicpumpkin[m> I just feel so much empathy for you.
17:36:05 <alex-resist> FSFE might be interested
17:37:21 <ayaen_t[m]> any trusted online source for apks ? I mean i see apkpure apkmirror but am not so sure about using apks from there eventhough i read their faq and the measure they take to make sure the apks they host  are legit
17:38:13 <organicpumpkin[m> <alex-resist "FSFE might be interested"> And you may potentially know about legal non profits that help activists and their support networks alex-resist ? They could be an option too.
17:38:42 <organicpumpkin[m> Although this is all assumptions for us. I have a feeling strcat may already have help.
17:39:16 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I don't want help from organizations that have spread misinformation and harmed us in the past
17:41:35 <organicpumpkin[m> But do you need help with the legal stuff? I can do research around potential non profits or legal teams that work with organisations like yours and send you my findings.
17:41:59 <organicpumpkin[m> strcat
17:43:42 <zyxt128[m]> @strcat Wut? FSF backed CopperheadOS instead of you? I knew that the visit of Richard Stallman in MS will bring a curse upon FSF...
17:44:14 <zyxt128[m]>  * @strcat Wut? FSF backed CopperheadOS instead of you? I knew that the visit of Richard Stallman in MS would bring a curse upon FSF...
17:44:57 <strcat[m]> zyxt128: I never said that
17:45:04 <strcat[m]> please stop making up things based on assumptions
17:45:19 <strcat[m]> you'll be banned from the channel
17:45:29 <strcat[m]> I may ban you from the channel for that kind of stupidity anyway
17:45:55 <strcat[m]> look, the project is being attacked by scammers, etc. and I am not going to tolerate people causing problems with more misinformation
17:46:15 <strcat[m]> do not put words in mouth, do not claim that I have said things that I have not
17:46:23 <strcat[m]> I will have to assume you are a sockpuppet attempting to harm the project
17:46:27 <strcat[m]> final warning for the channel as a whole
17:46:52 <zyxt128[m]> Chill out man, you are starting to see enemies everywhere
17:46:55 <strcat[m]> OrganicPumpkin: I have a good lawyer, I need funding for legal fees, not a legal team
17:46:57 <zyxt128[m]> just joking
17:47:08 <strcat[m]> I don't see any joke
17:47:19 <zyxt128[m]> ok fuck off then I'm signing out
17:47:31 <alex-resist> The joke was fairly stupid because FSFE is a completely different organization
17:47:44 <strcat[m]> I don't see how it's a joke
17:48:47 <strcat[m]> implying I said something I didn't and then making a "joke" based on that is not going to be interpreted as a joke
17:49:18 <strcat[m]> there are sockpuppet accounts in this channel attempting to undermine the project, if you do things that are inappropriate and harmful, it will be assumed that that's what is happening
17:49:53 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat[m] "OrganicPumpkin: I have a good la"> Understood. Let me see how I can leverage my networks for more donations.
17:51:35 <CryptGoat[m]> Hey there!
17:52:20 <elchupacabra420[> Hello!
17:53:26 <CryptGoat[m]> I'm moving from a OnePlus 3T powered by LineageOS 17.1 to a Pixel 4a and I'm pretty excited to switch to GrapheneOS. Anything I should look out for that's not in the official documentation?
17:54:35 <alex-resist> The official documentation is pretty good, it just takes a while for people to understand that :)
17:56:13 <CryptGoat[m]> I understand that I have to apply updates via F-Droid manually, correctus?
17:58:41 <louipcm> kindof, but fdroid is not recommended
17:58:54 <CryptGoat[m]> Yes, I heard that F-Droid kind of clashes with the security model. What's the recommended way to get apps and keep them updated?
18:00:50 <alex-resist> Some people prefer Aurora Store but I personally don't
18:01:32 <CryptGoat[m]> eh. no way I'm going to use Aurora as my primary source for apps.
18:02:27 <organicpumpkin[m> <alex-resist "Some people prefer Aurora Store "> Wouldn't the current ideal solution be direct apks from github etc when available, best if they have a hash/signature to check?
18:02:50 <alex-resist> That's the third option, but then there is no mechanism for convenient updates
18:03:17 <alex-resist> An ideal solution doesn't exist, that's why Graphene doesn't come with a store preinstalled
18:03:45 <organicpumpkin[m> <CryptGoat[m] "Yes, I heard that F-Droid kind o"> I use custom repositories for fdroid whenever available (newpipe, bromite, tutanota etc) for the latest versions. Else github apks.
18:04:07 <CryptGoat[m]> I see.
18:04:45 <organicpumpkin[m> <alex-resist "That's the third option, but the"> For some apps there is. E.g. newpipe let's you know immediately when a new update is available and you just tap, download, install.
18:05:17 <organicpumpkin[m> But I get your point, you are right of course.
18:07:32 <CryptGoat[m]> Yup, I know :) Is there a site or document where the F-Droid security problem is being discussed? i would like to further understand the problem so I can decide how to proceed. Coming from LineageOS without GApps I like my apps to be as free as possible and there some apps that have proprietary libraries removed or replace.
18:07:52 <CryptGoat[m]>  * Yup, I know :) Is there a site or document where the F-Droid security problem is being discussed? i would like to further understand the problem so I can decide how to proceed.

18:08:37 <alex-resist> Ideally GrapheneOS users would install only a handful of apps anyway, to reduce attack surface. Maybe a small number of apps could be managed manually. But then again, who does that in practice. Personally I use F-Droid + Newpipe + Wire from other sources, but then again I don't use proprietary apps (e.g. from Aurora) anyway. I'm looking forward to the Graphene store, that will be a cool thing to have.
18:09:37 <CryptGoat[m]> I dont see how apkpure can be trusted if you are unable to verify the APKs
18:09:45 <organicpumpkin[m> <CryptGoat[m] "Yup, I know :) Is there a site o"> Search for "fdroid" or "f-droid" on this group as well as the grapheneos-offtopic group. You will find some understanding here, we have discussed it.
18:10:06 <CryptGoat[m]> Will do OrganicPumpkin
18:12:05 <ayaen_t[m]> i only need termux which does not seem to keep any apks in its releases section on github
18:13:34 <randomhydrosol[m> Fdroid is OT
18:13:41 <randomhydrosol[m> Also we don't really recommend it
18:14:11 <CryptGoat[m]> Roger roger. Sorry, I'm still ne.
18:14:17 <CryptGoat[m]>  * Roger roger. Sorry, I'm still new.
18:14:29 <ayaen_t[m]> No thats what i dont want to usw f-droid
18:14:33 <entry1[m]> <CryptGoat[m] "I'm moving from a OnePlus 3T pow"> Nice. Follow the directions directly and do not try to follow any of the tutorials on YouTube. They are terrible and can cause you to download incorrect versions of what you need. If you are using Windows, everything can be done reading the instructions on the site and using PowerShell.
18:15:11 <CryptGoat[m]> entry1: That was the plan. But I'm good with Linux ðŸ˜‡
18:16:45 <entry1[m]> Perfect. Yeah everyone here is extremely helpful to guide you if you run into any issues. Just follow the instructions step by step and read them all prior to conceptually understand what you're doing. You can also search within this room if someone ran into the same issue as you
18:19:02 <strcat[m]> I need to get in touch with the matrix.org administrators
18:19:08 <strcat[m]> help me with that please
18:19:40 <strcat[m]> I do not need advice or suggestions, I need help getting in touch with the admins, thanks.

18:39:47 <strcat> qubits: I'm the only founder and owner of GrapheneOS (Daniel Micay)
18:40:13 <strcat> the project has also existed long before it adopted the name GrapheneOS in 2018
18:40:31 <strcat> qubits: I'm still concerned about your presence here and your motivations
18:41:42 <ryley-coyote[m]> <strcat "qubits: I'm still concerned abou"> Oh shit!
19:03:15 <qubits> strcat nothing to be concerd about
19:03:21 <qubits> Are you the founder?
19:03:31 <qubits> I sent you email from my company
19:03:43 <qubits> You can check it
19:03:48 <qubits> You dindt answerd
19:06:28 <qubits> I have intention to use GrapheneOS but i need some adaptions, if possible
19:06:43 <strcat[m]> qubits: I don't see an email from you
19:06:44 <strcat[m]> where did you send an email
19:06:49 <qubits> Just looking for more security
19:06:51 <strcat[m]> contactâŠ™go is the proper way to contact the project
19:07:00 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/contact
19:07:03 <qubits> i sent you moment
19:07:46 <strcat[m]> I received an email with the subject "cooperation" without details that looks like spam
19:07:47 <strcat[m]> today
19:07:49 <strcat[m]> do you mean that?

19:15:16 <qubits> You have all my personal information in the email, company name, phone number address
19:15:43 <qubits> Like i said i m just searching for more security and this project sounds interesting for me
19:15:43 <strcat[m]> nope don't see it
19:15:53 <qubits> I will send again the same email
19:15:58 <strcat[m]> maybe you sent the email from a broken email provider
19:16:05 <strcat[m]> I have fairly strict configuration rejecting invalid mails
19:16:21 <strcat[m]> send it from one of the major providers instead of your own server that might be misconfigured
19:16:23 <strcat[m]> that might be what happened
19:16:35 <qubits> Sent again
19:16:38 <qubits> Just sent
19:16:44 <strcat[m]> we reject SPF, DKIM, and DMARC failures
19:16:54 <strcat[m]> including "soft" failures
19:16:55 <qubits> I use own email server
19:17:02 <strcat[m]> yeah so it's probably configured wrong
19:17:10 <qubits> Haha could be
19:17:39 <qubits> I will send from gmail
19:22:07 <qubits> Just sent from gmail
19:22:23 <strcat[m]> yeah I got that
19:22:29 <strcat[m]> I'd guess you have invalid SPF, DKIM or DMARC configuration
19:22:52 <qubits> COuld be i will ask web designer to check
19:23:18 <strcat[m]> qubits: send an email to check-authâŠ™vpc
19:23:31 <qubits> From my own server?
19:23:47 <strcat[m]> qubits: yes send a mail there from your own server
19:23:54 <strcat[m]> qubits: and use https://internet.nl/test-mail/ on your domain to test it
19:23:57 <strcat[m]> it's not properly set up
19:24:01 <qubits> I understood already sent, thanks for that
19:26:33 <qubits> Reachable via modern internet address (IPv6) Passed :All domain names signed (DNSSEC) Failed :Not all authenticity marks against email phishing (DMARC, DKIM and SPF) Passed :Mail server connection sufficiently secured (STARTTLS and DANE)
19:26:37 <qubits> true
19:27:12 <qubits> Your DMARC policy is not sufficiently strict.
19:27:20 <qubits> This is the issue
19:34:52 <strcat> qubits: I think something is actually invalid
19:34:58 <strcat> I can check what
19:35:41 <strcat> qubits: can you PM me your email address for your own server or send it in an email
19:36:17 <strcat> qubits: ah nvm
19:36:21 <strcat> I just got your email from your own domain
19:36:40 <qubits> oh great
19:36:42 <strcat> qubits: you don't have secure email set up (no encryption, no authenticated encryption - depends on having TLS at all though, no anti-spoofing)
19:36:49 <strcat> but it was just slow and I missed the first one
19:38:13 <qubits> Okay i will need to fix that
19:38:21 <qubits> Thanks for let me know
19:45:48 <userman23[m]> I am trying to use my wifi hotspot on my phone.  When my client connects, it can not connect to the internet.  On my phone, it is able to resolve websites.  On the client, I can ping the gateway, but can't get beyond that it seems.  Ie, I can't ping 1.1.1.1 or 9.9.9.9.  I tried the sim on my s9, and it worked.  I put it back into my 3a, and it still doesn't work.
19:46:21 <strcat[m]> userman23: may be an APN configuration issue
19:46:36 <strcat[m]> userman23: can you try using Wi-Fi hotspot to provide internet based on another Wi-Fi network?
19:46:42 <strcat[m]> phone connected to Wi-Fi and serving it to another phone
19:47:59 <userman23[m]> strcat: you mean connect to wifi, then stand up hotspot, have client connect, and see if that works?
19:48:36 <strcat[m]> yes
19:48:40 <userman23[m]> ok
19:48:46 <strcat[m]> connect the phone to wifi, then make a hotspot
19:48:51 <strcat[m]> connect to that hotspot from something else
19:48:57 <strcat[m]> to see if this is tied to cellular tethering specifically
19:49:15 <strcat[m]> because some carriers try to block it unless you provision it with their app etc
19:49:21 <strcat[m]> and we don't have those carrier apps, etc.
19:49:29 <strcat[m]> userman23: the carrier you're using is quite relevant
19:49:38 <userman23[m]> huh, strange, it's working now
19:49:41 <userman23[m]> I don't understand why
19:49:41 <strcat[m]> but first confirm it's a carrier issue with my wifi suggestion
19:49:48 <strcat[m]> userman23: it's working with wifi?
19:49:49 <strcat[m]> or with your carrier
19:49:58 <strcat[m]> tethering to mobile is different due to carrier nonsense
19:49:59 <userman23[m]> with wifi
19:50:04 <userman23[m]> same client I was using before
19:50:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> Since Termux runs within the Android Application sandbox, I expect it to be relatively safe. Are there any potential threats to my device I should be aware of before tinkering with Termux?
19:50:10 <strcat[m]> userman23: yeah so try again with carrier now
19:50:29 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer:  not latest API level
19:50:42 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: runs app data as code instead of packaging things via apks, etc.
19:50:51 <strcat[m]> but a lot of programs like bash also run app data as code with interpreters anyway
19:51:07 <userman23[m]> strcat: it doesn't load now.
19:51:11 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: so if it was compromised an attacker can store code that runs persistently in app data
19:51:17 <strcat[m]> userman23: yeah so it sounds like it's a carrier provisioning issue
19:51:25 <strcat[m]> we disable that but we might need more changes for some carriers
19:51:37 <userman23[m]> what does that mean?
19:52:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> So in other words, a compromise "should" remain inside the sandbox unless specifically designed to escape the Android app sandbox, right?
19:53:34 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm well aware the app itself could be compromised if I did something stupid inside it.
19:54:16 <userman23[m]> and any way to get it to work with carrier?  it works on carrier on my s9
19:54:33 <cyborgninjaneer[> Okay, the main thing I don't completely understand is what you said about the API level. That's the Android API level, right?
19:58:47 <cyborgninjaneer[> <strcat[m] "cyborgninjaneer: so if it was co"> This is probably the main threat to be aware of though. Thank you.
19:59:25 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: apps targeting newer API levels have a stronger app sandbox
19:59:46 <strcat[m]> we show a warning on first launch for apps with API level < 28
19:59:49 <strcat[m]> current is 30
20:00:17 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's not showing a warning.
20:00:33 <strcat[m]> only on first launch
20:00:53 <cyborgninjaneer[> I don't think it did. I'm going to reinstall and see.
20:01:18 <strcat[m]> ah they use 28
20:01:19 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/gradle.properties#L19
20:01:54 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: they were migrating to using apks to ship packages
20:02:00 <strcat[m]> but the work stalled
20:02:03 <strcat[m]> unclear what is going to happen now
20:02:12 <strcat[m]> they may just stop publishing on Play Store and never update API level again
20:02:25 <strcat[m]> since F-Droid doesn't enforce a minimum
20:03:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> I see. Would you recommend using something else for a Linux VM?
20:07:16 <strcat[m]> I mean it's not a VM
20:07:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> Well, not that Termux is a VM.
20:07:19 <strcat[m]> it's just normal native binaries
20:11:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> I was thinking about trying to get qemu to run on it.
20:50:48 <userman23[m]> strcat: and any way to get it to work with carrier?  it works on carrier on my s9
20:51:06 <strcat[m]> userman23: contribute to getting it working
20:51:14 <strcat[m]> or mess with APNs and see if you can fix it that way
20:51:20 <strcat[m]> can't help you beyond that advice
20:51:34 <userman23[m]> apn = access point network?
20:51:45 <strcat[m]> we're working on improving carrier support further but the changes may cause regressions
20:51:48 <strcat[m]> so we are reluctant to ship a bunch of changes
20:51:51 <strcat[m]> userman23: yes
21:14:45 <argil[m]> What's the status of microg?
21:16:14 <strcat[m]> no news
21:16:25 <strcat[m]> information is available on our twitter account and site about our future plans
21:16:27 <strcat[m]> it is not going to be rushed
21:16:56 <strcat[m]> @room I need help getting in touch with LinkedIn support / abuse handling to get a fake profile for GrapheneOS either turned over to me and removed
21:17:05 <strcat[m]> @room This is urgent, I actually need help with this ASAP
21:17:16 <strcat[m]>  * @room I need help getting in touch with LinkedIn support / abuse handling to get a fake profile for GrapheneOS either turned over to me or removed
21:17:27 <argil[m]> Gotcha.
21:18:05 <strcat[m]> ideally turned over to me, not removed, since people followed it thinking we made it...
21:18:21 <AppAraat[m]> Wish I could help. I don't even have LinkedIn.
21:19:00 <analtenderloin[m> I guess we could all collectively submit a ticket to support with the same subject line
21:19:20 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of people in the channel, I need some of them to help
21:19:32 <strcat[m]> people always ask how to help, here is how
21:19:32 <AppAraat[m]> strcat: try making a HN thread, post here and I'll upvote it (along with many others here, I'm sure)
21:19:38 <strcat[m]> no
21:19:44 <strcat[m]> I do not want to draw attention to the fake profile
21:19:52 <strcat[m]> I'm asking for help, not suggestions / advice on what I should do
21:20:01 <strcat[m]> I'm asking for people to help me get in touch with LinkedIn support / abuse handling
21:20:12 <strcat[m]> someone may know someone there, and if you don't, you can try contacting them
21:20:34 <strcat[m]> I do not want people to post their assumptions or speculation on it or to draw more attention to misinformation
21:20:53 <strcat[m]> I'm asking for help with getting it removed
21:23:13 <strcat[m]> or better, turned over to us
21:25:42 <aeolism> Good evening all
21:26:37 <analtenderloin[m> Sounds like all of us contacting support with the same reason in the subject line will get their attention faster
21:29:29 <Knull[m]> <analtenderloin[m "Sounds like all of us contacting"> got an email to use? their site's built-in help is garbage
21:32:02 <analtenderloin[m> https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/61664/reporting-fake-profiles?lang=en
21:32:10 <analtenderloin[m> This could be useful
21:39:12 <CryptGoat[m]> Quick question: I just read this bit in the install guide  "To make sure that the device can be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and
21:39:12 <CryptGoat[m]> bootloader unlocking." Well looks like my Pixel 4a had some carrier crap preinstalled (couldnt tell by looking at the box). I did a factory rest and it is all gone. I am able to enable bootloader unlocking in the developer options. Should I be fine going forward?

21:44:27 <strcat[m]> Knull: Case #:
21:44:27 <strcat[m]> 201215-008935
21:44:29 <strcat[m]> this is the case number
21:44:32 <strcat[m]> for what I filed
21:44:37 <strcat[m]> so people could ask them to prioritize that
21:50:12 <TheJollyRoger> CryptGoat[m]: turn on USB debugging, plug your phone in, and in adb run: `adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid`
21:50:28 <TheJollyRoger> If it returns ANY value except 000000, return that handset, because you got ripped off.
21:51:08 <TheJollyRoger> If that carrier id value is 0000001 or something like that, you have two options:
21:51:14 <TheJollyRoger> A) Return the handset and get a refund.
21:52:02 <TheJollyRoger> B) Be content with never unlocking the bootloader.
21:52:11 <TheJollyRoger> That's it.
21:54:24 <CryptGoat[m]> 00000000 yeeeeees!
21:54:37 <TheJollyRoger> CryptGoat[m]: excellent!
21:54:38 <CryptGoat[m]> thank you TheJollyRoger
21:54:53 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome! You should be clear to continue with the installation!
21:56:35 <TheJollyRoger> CryptGoat[m]: it goes without saying, but for emphasis, if you have anything on that phone you don't want to lose (photos, videos, 2FA token seeds), copy them off right now. Unlocking the bootloader will change the encryption keys in your phone. Everything you've saved to it will be permanently lost.
21:57:03 <CryptGoat[m]> it's fresh phone so I'm good :) but thanks for the warning
21:57:07 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
22:13:41 <codebam> <strcat[m] "@room This is urgent, I actually"> someone slandered me on linkedin once. expect a delay of 2 days minimum when you open a support ticket
22:18:55 <strcat[m]> in this case the problem is someone that was supposedly helping us out making inaccurate claims and then delaying fixing them + now not responding to communications anymore
22:19:12 <strcat[m]> so we were not dealing with this with the appropriate severity because they have helped with some things
22:20:03 <strcat[m]> but they are misrepresenting their role in the project as larger than it is and have not complied with my requests to remove that from their profile and to stop saying it to others
22:20:28 <strcat[m]> they partially updated their profile a while ago after delaying and then delayed finishing what I asked
22:20:43 <strcat[m]> after a certain point I just can't keep assuming good faith
22:20:52 <strcat[m]> especially when they stopped responding to me recently
22:22:07 <strcat[m]> LinkedIn apparently just lets people claim whatever they want as the default
22:22:22 <louipc> basically
22:22:23 <strcat[m]> there was no verification of the page for the project
23:19:00 <zornell> hi there, can anyone here help me with a question? i was wondering if it is possible to get whatsapp running on grapheneos.
23:20:01 <louipc> i think it was possible
23:20:33 <strcat[m]> zornell: yes, works fine
23:20:39 <louipc> with this note "No notifications unless the app is running in the background"
23:20:48 <strcat[m]> need to enable the background connection setting and grant it a battery optimization exception for that
23:20:59 <strcat[m]> works fine though
23:21:06 <strcat[m]> not the most efficient implementation of push but works
23:21:42 <zornell> okay. i have installed it today and it does not work. It tells me that it needs the Google Play Services which are not supported on my device
23:22:19 <zornell> but i will check for the background connection setting
23:22:55 <strcat[m]> zornell: sounds like you installed it from Play instead of the standalone one
23:23:05 <strcat[m]> they may have alternate releases nowadays
23:23:58 <zornell> i tried two versions. one from the aurora store ( i guess its the same apk you would get from google play) and i downloaded the apk from the whatsapp website
23:24:06 <zornell> both behave the same
23:26:23 <strcat[m]> uninstall it
23:26:26 <strcat[m]> install it from the WhatsApp site
23:28:38 <zornell> okay. i'll try again. Thank you so far
23:35:42 <zornell> i'm afraid it does not work. But just to be on the same page. You mean the download from here https://www.whatsapp.com/android/ right?
23:41:22 <louipc> looks like it
23:42:40 <zornell> could it be possible that it is not working anymore this way?
23:47:33 <louipc> still need google play?
23:47:40 <zornell> yes
23:47:49 <zornell> its exactly the same
23:48:45 <louipc> hmm maybe they changed something. I'd encourage you to join #grapheneos-offtopic for further apps discussion tho
23:50:44 <zornell> nevermind i just found out, how to get it running. I deinstalled fakestore from microg. Now t works
23:50:52 <zornell> Thank you for your help!
23:51:56 <louipc> wo wuts that
23:54:22 <zornell> I guess whatsapp checks for the store signature and fails if it is wrong, but work anyways when no play store is there.
