00:38:43 <anonhat[m]> And they say Linus is an asshole...
00:39:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mate ngl you pretty much are the asshole here
00:49:35 <anonhat[m]> All I'm saying is that taking the openbsd approach to user questions is abrasive and self destructive. If you disagree, have fun trying to gain traction with a larger audience.
00:50:31 <louipc> worked for linus i guess, but he became a sweetheart afterall
00:51:54 <madaidan[m]> <anonhat[m] "You seriously deleted my message"> What do you think happens when you break the rules?
00:52:10 <louipc> btw messages arent deleted on IRC. :)
00:53:48 <anonhat[m]> What rule did I break? Is it against the rules to disagree with how a question is handled?
00:58:13 <Dylanger[m]> They're also not redacted for anyone running a home server
00:58:26 <Dylanger[m]> Redactions kind of don't really do anything
00:59:00 <renlord[m]> message deletion is part of moderation
01:00:40 <anonhat[m]> Moderation doesn't include deleting politely worded messages simply because they disagree with you.
01:01:38 <renlord[m]> whether the message is polite or not is completely orthogonal to it being deleted or not

01:01:42 <Dylanger[m]> To be fair, he was only asking why
01:02:03 <renlord[m]> you can author an abrasive message and if it does not break the rules, it wont be deleted.
01:02:08 <louipc> eh just use a realâ„¢ client then you dont need to worry about deletion
01:02:24 <Dylanger[m]> (My client doesn't respect redactions)
01:02:29 <louipc> nice
01:04:53 <anonhat[m]> His only issue was that I was "Promoting breaking the rules" by criticizing the policy of telling anyone who hasn't read the documentation cover to cover to fuck off. It's elitist, insulting, and counterproductive.
01:05:28 <louipc> alright settle down please
01:05:33 <renlord[m]> anyone who doesnt read the documentation cover to cover should rtfm
01:05:41 <renlord[m]> instead of wasting other people's time here
01:05:59 <renlord[m]> the asker is actually insulting everyone else in here
01:06:15 <louipc> anonhat[m]: thats what is asked in this channel. if you disagree you may chat elsewhere. no hard feelings ok
01:07:13 <louipc> maybe #grapheneos-offtopic would be more suitable. it has a looser format
01:07:18 <renlord[m]> the author has taken the time out specifically to write documentation, how do you think the author feels if the work has been neglected?
01:07:45 <renlord[m]> instead has to spend more time repeating answers again and again
01:08:55 <louipc> if you at least read the rules you would have seen #grapheneos-offtopic mentioned
01:09:09 <louipc> and that may have helped alleviate some of this conflict
01:09:38 <louipc> anonhat[m]: does that seem reasonable?
01:10:03 <renlord[m]> maybe also read irc etiquette
01:10:27 <madaidan[m]> imagine unironically using irc
01:10:42 <louipc> renlord[m]: lol not more reading
01:10:58 <louipc> madaidan[m]: you mean using irc to avoid reading?

01:21:41 <renlord> maybe factoids and !next
01:21:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> I want a bot that takes everything I say
01:21:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> And sends it to /dev/null
01:22:28 <renlord> anupritaisno1[m]: you can pipe stdin to /dev/null?
01:22:44 <louipc> or stdout
01:22:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> I think yes
01:23:00 <louipc> but then all we get is stderr

19:34:25 <hero1n[m]> Hi all
19:34:25 <hero1n[m]> Is there a guide somewhere on how I can contribute to the project from a development perspective?
19:34:25 <hero1n[m]> Some kind of a roadmap, feature requests small bags to fix?
19:36:16 <jpds> hero1n[m]: There's https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
19:49:01 <peertopeer12[m]> The project is also really looking for maintainers for devices, if you are up for that
19:49:29 <peertopeer12[m]> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os#Device_Maintaining
19:59:20 <alcastronic[m]> Hey there, been here some time ago already.
20:00:31 <alcastronic[m]> I thought some time about giving a short presentation baout GrapheneOS in the "lightning talk"  factor. Those are often held at CCC event's like the this years RC3 (remote congress).
20:01:21 <alcastronic[m]> So would this be considered a good thing for this project?
20:03:27 <alcastronic[m]> The Idea is to make a short presentation mostly about the features and how I use it personally. But since I'm not much involved I thought ask if this is ok,  before.
20:18:00 <marcin> hi everyone, this has probably been answered elsewhere but I can't find it
20:18:29 <marcin> I'm wondering is there's a timeline for how long the project intends to support the Pixel 3/3a
20:19:03 <marcin> I'm looking to buy a new phone and I don't know if there's a point in splashing out on a Pixel 4
20:23:43 <strcat[m]> marcin: Pixel 4, 4 XL and 4a are the only devices that are recommended
20:23:44 <strcat[m]> get a Pixel 4a
20:24:02 <strcat[m]> don't buy a past generation device to save money - you'll get at least a year less support
20:24:52 <marcin> ok, thanks
20:24:57 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a has almost 3 years of guaranteed vendor support (unknown when it will be end-of-life, as with the others)
20:25:14 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3 has about a year
20:25:25 <strcat[m]>  * Pixel 3 has about a year of guaranteed vendor support
20:28:48 <marcin> fair, you're right, pixel 4a makes much more sense
20:53:29 <ruski[m]> <strcat[m] "Pixel 4a has almost 3 years of g"> does the vendor support mean anything when you're not using the google-riddled stock OS?
20:53:51 <strcat[m]> yes
20:53:55 <strcat[m]> read the FAQ information on device support
20:57:01 <ruski[m]> ok thanks makes sense
