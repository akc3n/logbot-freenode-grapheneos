00:01:39 <dazinism> Yeah, its a factory reset from bootloader. Cant remember exact key combination
01:41:07 <aeonsolution[m]> the new version is broken right now
01:41:18 <aeonsolution[m]> we are trying to figure out the issue
01:41:40 <aeonsolution[m]> https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1106115
01:41:49 <aeonsolution[m]> you could use the included prebuilts
01:41:53 <aeonsolution[m]> for Vanadium
01:41:59 <aeonsolution[m]> which are still valid
01:42:09 <aeonsolution[m]> or build the previous version of Vanadium
01:43:24 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/d6087e612aabc40a6084993c5c2902e6f725ec3b/args.gn
01:43:46 <aeonsolution[m]> you would have to start all over from step 1 because gclient doesn't work backwards
01:44:32 <aeonsolution[m]> or i should more accurately say, i don't know how to get glcient to not complain when i try to go to a previous version
01:45:24 <aeonsolution[m]> this is the bug grindlefang <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1106115>
01:45:44 <aeonsolution[m]> oh
01:45:53 <aeonsolution[m]> let me look at your error
01:46:07 <aeonsolution[m]> what step is that happening on
01:46:44 <aeonsolution[m]> the error I'm referring to happens when you run the `../generate_release.sh` command
01:46:57 <aeonsolution[m]> oh
01:47:05 <aeonsolution[m]> you need to be using python2
01:47:54 <aeonsolution[m]> let me get you my workaround

01:53:26 <aeonsolution[m]> grindlefang: I go based on the step, there is an error there that points it out, i just don't remember what exactly it is, but for most likely its not using python2 to when you run ninja that causes the problem
01:53:44 <aeonsolution[m]>  * grindlefang: I go based on the step, there is an error there that points it out, i just don't remember what exactly it is, but most likely its not using python2 to when you run ninja that causes the problem
01:54:08 <aeonsolution[m]> np
01:54:31 <aeonsolution[m]> it wont work if you don't use python2, that build step hasn't been migrated yet
01:54:59 <aeonsolution[m]> ?
01:55:21 <aeonsolution[m]> you built GrapheneOS with your own Vanadium apks
01:55:28 <aeonsolution[m]> using python3?
01:56:05 <aeonsolution[m]> oh
01:56:09 <aeonsolution[m]> lol so funny story
01:56:20 <aeonsolution[m]> everything before that requires python3
02:00:10 <aeonsolution[m]> thats why using the virtual environment at the ninja step is convenient
02:00:33 <aeonsolution[m]> you dont have to mess with symlinks and bash path wizardy
02:01:25 <aeonsolution[m]> so this is what we are stuck with until ninja gets migrated to use python3
02:03:34 <aeonsolution[m]> hopefully you can find an equivalent for deb/ubuntu
02:11:14 <aeonsolution[m]> my virtual environment is set to Python 2.7.18
02:11:30 <aeonsolution[m]> but i wonder if something else broke on the way to that step
02:11:44 <aeonsolution[m]> because you were using Python2
02:12:04 <aeonsolution[m]> the ninja step is the only step that needs Python2
02:13:11 <aeonsolution[m]> you didn't get any warnings for using python2 from gclient?
02:17:10 <aeonsolution[m]> you can always use the old prebuilts or your previous built apks to build GrapheneOS
02:17:17 <aeonsolution[m]> in the meantime
02:18:01 <aeonsolution[m]> also would encourage you to look into the python2 virtual environment

06:12:45 <f8sai[m]> That opt-out doesn't work on Google Android?
06:12:55 <f8sai[m]> <f8sai[m] "That opt-out doesn't work on Goo"> or at least ineffective
06:12:57 <cn3m[m]> that is talking about something different

06:14:02 <f8sai[m]> well, alright
06:14:25 <cn3m[m]> Firebase
06:14:33 <cn3m[m]> that is a little different issue
06:15:28 <cn3m[m]> this is very similar to the people complaining if they search a location on Maps Google knows they were likely there when they have location data off
06:15:53 <cn3m[m]> the stuff they are targeting Google with are pretty stupid there are a lot better things
06:17:22 <f8sai[m]> <cn3m[m] "Firebase "> Oh nvm, just read it again, and yeah, it was about firebase
06:19:12 <cn3m[m]> No company could function if what Google was doing in these recent lawsuits were wrong
06:19:37 <cn3m[m]> You can't say Google is collecting your location if you search your location with their service
06:22:20 <cn3m[m]> You can't say they are tracking your browsing if you opt into another service powered by Google that is not supposed to be linked to a Google account
06:23:02 <cn3m[m]> DuckDuckGo records search terms. They don't store it with an account. Drawing a clear line is the tricky point
06:23:27 <f8sai[m]> <cn3m[m] "DuckDuckGo records search terms."> Agreed

06:25:08 <cn3m[m]> f8sai [GNU/GPL v3]: now an anti-trust against Google and Firebase could be interesting
06:25:34 <cn3m[m]> one thing that holds Android back as a platform privacy wise is that Google can't have a major leg up with ad tracking
06:26:15 <cn3m[m]> Apple used to have iAd which were supposed to be a safe and private alternative to the crappy ads you get. It died in a few short years since it got in the way of them protecting privacy.
06:27:37 <cn3m[m]> If they strengthen privacy protections it doesn't effect their ads(since they are already compliant), but it could be played as a hostile move to competition in the ad space
07:28:31 <jalb> Well, if there's no problem, it's created to share about GOS. XMPP non-official channel to users talking Spanish language: usuarios_grapheneos⊙sso
09:58:11 <pikey[m]> a while back someone in here posted a link to a reddit post they made about connection issues on Graphene via VPN. I can't find the link or remember who the user was. If that user reads this, I would love to know if you solved it. My issues (virtually identical) are ongoing. Yesterday on four separate occasions I lost half an hour trying to get a connection via Signal, K9 Mail, Auditor and Newpipe, meanwhile Vanadium and
09:58:11 <pikey[m]> DDG browser could connect fine. thanks
10:07:41 <brenneke[m]> <pikey[m] "a while back someone in here pos"> Did you try a different server from your VPN provider?
10:15:42 <pikey[m]> OH yes, tried it all! I tried every remote port they offer, and tons of different servers. It's more complex than that. I have used the same VPN provider for eons, never had this issue, and never had it on my iphone or even my last pixel 3a running graphene. Only since getting this Pixel 3, which I don't think is relevent but worth mentioning. Racking my brains!
10:30:17 <brenneke[m]> And all works when off VPN?
10:43:51 <pikey[m]> yep, good point i forgot to mention. when it happens, after trying different ports, connections etc (which I dont even bother with now as its happened so many times I know that won't help), i then go to settings, turn off "always on VPN" and "block connections outside VPN", then turn off VPN and hey presto, all the queued up signal messages and emails send in seconds, auditor/attestation submits my data for verification
10:43:51 <pikey[m]> etc, all good. Then i turn those settings and VPN back on, and it's all fine for a while, until it craps out again
10:44:53 <SchismXL[m]> You tried to reinstall GOS, @pikey:matrix.org? Doing that fixed my issues with WiFi memory issues
10:45:24 <SchismXL[m]> That's the only other thing to suggest. It's been ongoing for you for a while now :(
10:54:49 <pikey[m]> <SchismXL[m] "That's the only other thing to s"> Hadn't thought of that, and don't really want to!! I would have to learn how to back it all up and start again, and it was a struggle for me last time installing GOS!! I may consider that though, just waiting for one last attempt at support from PIA and my email provider in case they have any suggestions but i can't see that working out as it doesn't seem related to either
10:54:49 <pikey[m]> service. Also I used AirVPN and uninstalled PIA (thinking it was PIA's fault) but it did the same on AirVPN too. So yes, your suggestion sounds like a logical next step, if only it didn't scare the shit out of me :D
10:55:19 <brenneke[m]> Try a different VPN provider, because you used them for eons means nothing.
10:55:19 <brenneke[m]> Windscribe has free accounts and they are good. They have an online debugging tool that will show what is being blocked and allowed.
10:58:16 <alzxjm[m]> Mozilla's VPN just came out. Uses Wireguard on Mullvsd servers. Only $5/mo. Really good so far!
10:58:30 <brenneke[m]> "It's more complex that."
10:58:30 <brenneke[m]> I don't think you can say how complex the problem is until you know what it is.
10:59:47 <brenneke[m]> Using Wireguard app on GOS with Windscribe, works flawlessly.
11:01:01 <brenneke[m]> Auto connects, stays connected when switching from wifi to mobile, everything works.

12:49:18 <question12> From the second profile?
12:49:20 <theultron[m]> Settings -> System -> Advanced -> Multiple users
12:49:25 <question12> Cause i use themn both regularly
12:50:53 <theultron[m]> I am not sure if User Profile support notification from second profile to show in first profile.
12:51:27 <theultron[m]> You can create an user profile and test.
12:54:18 <theultron[m]> cn3m: MIUI allows the user to have dual apps in a single profile or get notifications from second profile in the first profile or vice versa. I am not sure if AOSP supports the same. Do you think these features add risk?
12:56:42 <question12> Theres no way to clone an app
12:56:45 <question12> On same iser profile?
12:56:55 <question12> I used app cloner year ago on my android device
12:56:59 <question12> Could make 10 copies of the apps

14:27:04 <renlord> i also dont remember where it was aligned before!

14:28:05 <renlord> reverting all?
14:28:35 <renlord> or just the secondary stack stuff?

14:29:22 <strcat[m]> and see
14:31:14 <renlord> did i do something wrong with rounding up?
14:32:51 <strcat[m]> it could be an issue in one of the other changes too
14:32:53 <strcat[m]> I don't know
14:34:25 <renlord> this will take awhile

15:02:22 <strcat[m]> renlord: I just don't understand what we did wrong
15:02:28 <strcat[m]> it looks very similar to how it worked before
15:02:32 <strcat[m]> don't see why it'd be broken now
15:02:44 <strcat[m]> renlord: maybe it gets misaligned in a way that we try to mprotect the wrong region
15:02:46 <strcat[m]> how exactly does the test fail again?

16:00:33 <petersuc> Cant message u because no registered user
16:01:05 <theultron[m]> This may not be the right place but I have a question regarding data recovery on Android. What are the sophisticated ways to recover deleted data on Android?
16:01:14 <petersuc> cellebrite ufed
16:01:17 <petersuc> if you have the money
16:01:29 <petersuc> you know the password
16:01:30 <petersuc> of the device?
16:01:35 <theultron[m]> I have written a tasker task to delete everything important in case I have to hand over my phone to authority.
16:01:37 <petersuc> Then there are enough data recovery
16:01:39 <petersuc> methods
16:01:52 <petersuc> You should over write the data
16:01:59 <petersuc> Or else it can still be
16:02:04 <petersuc> recovered

18:34:45 <joshman[m]> <petersuc "It takes 4 minutes to load my 15"> That's why FDE sucks big-time
19:00:32 <tencarsb[m]> Hi there, is there such feature or wouldn't it be nice: you have two pins. One two unlock the phone and one to erase it?!
19:05:15 <charuto> properly erasing all  the data would take a lot of time i imagine, not that useful in real world situations
19:05:17 <joshman[m]> "tencarsb" (https://matrix.to/#/@tencarsb:matrix.org) erasing won't evade data recovery. You need to overwrite storage space, which is time consuming
19:05:26 <dazinism> tencarsb: there is no such feature
19:05:42 <charuto> you'd probably be better off physically destroying it or something along those lines
19:05:52 <dazinism> josh.man: can just throw away the profile encryption keya
19:06:04 <dazinism> Keys
19:06:08 <charuto> and even then, data recovery would probably be possible
19:07:36 <joshman[m]> It's overwrite or destroy. The rest is useless features giving false perception of security
19:07:47 <dazinism> All the data is encrypted, without the keys, which are stored in Titan, the data is as good as random
19:08:15 <dazinism> Also can't reliably overwrite flash storage
19:09:19 <joshman[m]> As time passes new devices get created. Titan is ok today. How about tomorrow?
19:10:26 <dazinism> Nothing is completely secure
19:11:03 <dazinism> But as far as android phones go, Titan is state of the art
19:12:36 <cn3m[m]> Titan is general is practically equivalent to the Secure Enclave too. In general state of the art is a fair term
19:12:47 <dazinism> Dont recall seeing anyone recovering data from a deleted profile on an android phobe
19:13:42 <dazinism> Would be much harder on a phone with strongbox
19:13:45 <cn3m[m]> of course with the FBE
19:13:45 <cn3m[m]> it is brilliant
19:14:17 <joshman[m]> How does it compare to Samsung's  Secure Element?Not to start discussing Samsung. Strictly security chip
19:14:35 <dazinism> Think Titan is better

19:15:01 <joshman[m]> Nope
19:15:36 <joshman[m]> Secure Element. It was announced in latest S20. It was meant to be far superior than Knox

19:17:37 <cn3m[m]> There is very little information on it
19:17:43 <cn3m[m]> Apple and Google share a lot on their security chips
19:18:29 <cn3m[m]> Apple has had an impeccable 7 year run, Google has an impeccable 2 year run(more if you count previous iterations)

19:18:53 <dazinism> Heard from Daniel and others that Samsung coding and architecture is often not so great
19:19:02 <cn3m[m]> It is not
19:19:18 <cn3m[m]> they add a bunch of stuff to Google and Qulacomm standards

19:21:00 <cn3m[m]> spaceinfinite: I dunno but all those claims are almost entirely bogus I agreed with one
19:21:12 <tencarsb[m]> OK, not to erase the storage, but how about destroy the key...
19:21:48 <spaceinfinite[m]> <cn3m[m] "spaceinfinite: I dunno but all t"> Was joking obvs you cant keep arguing people whenever they seek attention
19:21:56 <cn3m[m]> the key is destroyed when you remove a profile
19:21:57 <cn3m[m]> the profile is encrypted with a generated key on the fly
19:21:58 <cn3m[m]> that key is encrypted with your log ins
19:22:12 <cn3m[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "Was joking obvs you cant keep ar"> yeah, he has harassed me a lot I am done with the guy
19:22:20 <dazinism> tencarsb: it could be done. Someone would need to step up and write the code
19:22:36 <spaceinfinite[m]> Cos i dont see another reason for him to go on about it since everything has been asked and answered already
19:23:14 <cn3m[m]> yeah that myth about the mail vulnerability speaks volumes
19:23:33 <cn3m[m]> if Apple is confident enough to say something is not exploitable they believe it and no one proved them wrong
19:23:39 <cn3m[m]> the guy is a fake
19:23:46 <cn3m[m]> the Chrome stuff is somehow even worse
19:25:33 <dazinism> tencarsb: theres already a feature to delete the keys after x wrong password/pin entries
19:25:53 <dazinism> Although its not easily available for use
19:26:10 <dazinism> Its part of MDM stuff
19:27:47 <tencarsb[m]> Thanks alot, I got to go. Good Night.

19:54:18 <xnat834[m]> Hi everyone. https://grapheneos.org/faq is a great read. I didn't even know about the changes to HWIDs and how apps can no longer access them in Android 10. Seems like a very good change for privacy.
19:56:49 <cn3m[m]> xnat834: the usage guide is wonderful too
19:59:13 <xnat834[m]> There is a part (https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking) where I'd like to find more sources on. I thought the code running on the baseband is not open-source and Android can only ask it to do something. Or have there been reverse-engineering projects for the modems in Pixel phones? Or maybe a data transmission test with a cellular femtocell or what they are called.

20:12:37 <mrmanpants[m]> ok thanks
20:13:54 <mrmanpants[m]> do you guys recommend using one of the built in protocols instead of openvpn or something else?
20:14:46 <mrmanpants[m]> i.e. i want to have a VPN setup to connect to my home network, i can figure out how to setup anything, what would you recommend?
20:16:05 <dazinism> Think all the built in protocols are a bit old and not so good
20:16:50 <dazinism> As far as I know wireguard is best
20:16:56 <dazinism> Think theres an official app
20:20:45 <SEL[m]1> Yep there is
20:20:49 <SEL[m]1> There's also a modified wireguard app that supposedly offers more features (?)
21:02:29 <cn3m[m]> <bt700[m] "hey guys;; I was told to join he"> ah yeah sprint has proprietary bits. They are the only ones I know of that have issues

21:24:00 <grindlefang[m]> You can try yourself and see if you're up to the challenge
21:53:32 <aeonsolution[m]> bt700: if you have an account with sprint, make sure the device is on their network before you try installing GrapheneOS
21:54:45 <aeonsolution[m]> it may or may not work, but with the phone unlocked you have options to use a pre paid service sim
22:16:02 <renlord> strcat[m]: yes, mprotect for the static TLS region failed
22:16:16 <renlord> because the addr to static TLS was not page aligned

22:21:16 <renlord> strcat[m]: reverted the 3 commits they passed
22:23:33 <renlord> i think its to do with how I calculated the address for static TLS
22:23:56 <renlord> upstream calculates it by substracting from the top, but I add from base to where it should be
22:24:06 <renlord> if you do a diff HEAD HEAD~3
22:24:13 <renlord> you can see how the approaches are different
22:26:28 <renlord>  i assume if they do it that way, when they did the mprotect, the len argument was not page aligned.
22:50:12 <dazinism> bt700: the sprint stuff thats required, but not included is pretty nasty.

23:11:12 <pikey[m]> do i smell a troll?
23:12:49 <pikey[m]> you nailed it. counter-intuitive is the watch word
23:13:45 <cn3m[m]> Google phones are the only phones that support fully degoogling without sacrificing security
23:13:52 <pikey[m]> its the most hardware secure device, Titan chip etc, Graphene is only being developed for phones which are capable ofbeing secure enough to satisfy the devs. thats my understanding, i am no dev so forgive me if i am wrong. but i "got over" the Google badge once it was intelligently explained to me exactly why the Pixel was chosen
23:14:51 <cn3m[m]> The on time monthly updates for a reasonable time, and fully support custom os verified boot are extremely rare
23:15:10 <pikey[m]> <DickFaggotson[m] "or, if you invert that line of t"> that fear is irrational. i had the very same fear. it was put to bed through explanation. if i could explain it to you i would, but i can say with confidence you needn't worry at all. Your device was built by google (hardware) but built by graphene (sw), taking advantage of all the good bits of this very secure device, but doing away with all the bad bits.
23:15:11 <cn3m[m]> by far the most private Android device
23:15:29 <jneplokh> The fact that it is a Google phone is an advantage, they are far more secure than any other Android. They are pretty much the only ones who take it seriously.
23:15:30 <jneplokh> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
23:15:51 <cn3m[m]> Of all companies to support with your money for making an android phone Google is the best
23:15:58 <cn3m[m]> none of them care about your privacy
23:16:04 <cn3m[m]> but Google at least cares about your security
23:16:11 <jneplokh> Google has excellent security
23:16:26 <cn3m[m]> if you are going to fund anyone fund Google since they at least improve things
23:16:43 <cn3m[m]> anyone else is going to make you give up security to get privacy(which means less privacy)
23:17:04 <cn3m[m]> <DickFaggotson[m] "hah, no! "> If you buy Samsung you won't have security or privacy
23:17:18 <pikey[m]> <DickFaggotson[m] "lol, would never expect the tigh"> i think you're confusing security with privacy. Google wants you to have VERY high security, as it's a great marketing point. what they do NOT (in my opinion) want you to have, is any privacy from THEM. Graphene takes care of that little chestnut, ad you get best of both worlds.
23:17:25 <cn3m[m]> If you buy Google you get Security and Openess(which you can use to get privacy)

23:19:12 <pikey[m]> using Lineage and claiming you're concerned about security, well ... nuff said i think. you haave your answers, if you choose to accept em. laters, good luck whatever you decide.
23:19:19 <cn3m[m]> Google is way more responsible with your data than most OEMs. Incredibly low bar...

23:20:39 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: I really wish people would stop saying Lineage falsifies patch levels
23:20:46 <pikey[m]> <DickFaggotson[m] "nah, I'm merely barely technolog"> if that's true (as it is for me) then stop making claims about things you don't understand and just ask people in here. virtually everyone who posts will know 1000 times more about security than I (or doubtless you) will ever know. So listen, it's good info, and better than whatever else you have been hearing if you're using lineage. Final point - you won't get a more
23:20:46 <pikey[m]> secure and private device than a Graphene Pixel run carefully following advice and guidance in here and on GOS website. Maybe iphone close second. take your pick, but ditch the lineage! gotta run, cheers
23:20:47 <Icy-Sprite^[m]> Yo what the heck, Riot is now Element
23:20:57 <Icy-Sprite^[m]> I haven't signed in for a moment and now everything is changed ahhhhhhhhh
23:21:09 <cdesai> they apply the aosp security patches monthly on time, even on older branches - something that you don't see anywhere else. any branch that gets updates from google is patched - 9.0, 8.0, 7.0 - I can go on and on
23:21:09 <cn3m[m]> <cdesai "cn3m: I really wish people would"> Google sets out a standard and Lineage uses that bulletin without doing what is laid out.
23:21:20 <cdesai> there's a separate vendor patch level
23:21:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "Lineage is actively falsifying s"> Bullshit
23:21:26 <cn3m[m]> It is false advertising
23:21:41 <cn3m[m]> The Google Security Bulletin includes vendor
23:21:45 <cdesai> it's not, really. there's a vendor patch level right underneath
23:21:46 <cn3m[m]> they need to add an AOSP patch level
23:21:49 <cn3m[m]> change that
23:21:51 <JTL> https://i.imgur.com/bbw3nVP.png
23:22:00 <JTL> (not my screenshot mind you)
23:22:01 <cn3m[m]> not the Android patch level that should be matched to stock
23:22:12 <cn3m[m]> add another patch level to fix the dishonesty
23:22:39 <cn3m[m]> they give people insecure devices and use Google labeling to give them a false sense of security
23:22:46 <cdesai> there's no dishonesty, they just merge AOSP and retain the level - and have worked to add another level to see what it really is
23:23:06 <cdesai> not everybody can afford to just buy a new device or stop using their old one when the vendor stops giving update
23:23:19 <cn3m[m]> They don't meet the Android security bulletin they portray it is very simple
23:23:28 <cn3m[m]> they need to change the way they show it to stop being dishonest
23:23:32 <cn3m[m]> it is wrong
23:23:37 <cdesai> at this point lineage has a better track record of security updates than most OEMs, given that even Google's Pixel 1 is stuck at Dec 2019, whereas with lineage it'd atleast have the latest aosp patches
23:24:02 <cn3m[m]> Since Stock OEMs are not faking security bulletins to inflate that
23:24:12 <cn3m[m]> they just need to change how they communicate it
23:24:16 <cdesai> there have been instances of that as well
23:24:31 <cn3m[m]> <cdesai "there have been instances of tha"> that was fake the researcher admitted he was wrong
23:24:44 <cn3m[m]> that app he made hardly works either
23:24:59 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: did you even see that screenshot?
23:25:21 <cn3m[m]> Android security patch level is the official one
23:25:34 <cn3m[m]> the vendor patch level should be called android security patch level
23:25:47 <cn3m[m]> and the android security patch level should be named aosp patch level
23:25:49 <cn3m[m]> to communicate it
23:25:53 <cdesai> then go and propose that, and say that - instead of calling them dishonest.
23:26:06 <cdesai> because I'm tired of reading this
23:26:32 <cn3m[m]> cdesai: they have already been told that serveral times
23:26:43 <cn3m[m]> but I will reach out to them again
23:27:00 <cn3m[m]> it is almost certainly intentional
23:27:21 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: and honestly, if naming is the only issue you can come up with - that's a pretty small thing
23:27:27 <cdesai> it's not, it's just keeping what aosp has
23:27:32 <cdesai> since it differs device to device
23:27:43 <cdesai> vendor security patch level was added to stop this confusion
23:27:52 <cdesai> and again, it's just semantics
23:27:58 <Icy-Sprite^[m]> Guys what's the new Privacytools room???
23:28:30 <cn3m[m]> cdesai: I will contact them and give them a more detailed proposal
23:28:40 <cn3m[m]> <Icy-Sprite^[m] "Guys what's the new Privacytools"> it was just an upgraded room

23:28:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: they should add boot security patch too
23:29:03 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: see, that's much better.
23:29:03 <cdesai> Also full disclosure I'm a lineage dev myself, if you hadn't noticed the flair
23:29:30 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: yeah I was going to propose that at some point, but since most devices don't have firmware shipped with the builds it'd be hard to set
23:29:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Time to claim glassrom has august 5 2020 patch in kernel
23:29:32 <cn3m[m]> I can't see the flair on this side and no problem
23:30:18 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: https://www.xda-developers.com/lineageos-trust-centralized-interface-security-privacy/
23:30:38 <cn3m[m]> yes, I have lineage on two devices around here
23:30:48 <cn3m[m]> I have seen the Trust center
23:30:51 <cn3m[m]> it is improved
23:31:04 <cn3m[m]> since using clearly the wrong labeling
23:31:30 <cn3m[m]> Google wouldn't consider that a full Android update what they are doing
23:31:37 <cn3m[m]> most people don't know what a vendor image is
23:42:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: build glassrom then
23:42:39 <madaidan[m]1> glassrom
23:45:04 <madaidan[m]1> Don't assume arbitrary things without evidence then
23:46:26 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "cn3m: build glassrom then "> for those lineage phones? Not a bad idea
