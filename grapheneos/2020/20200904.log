02:11:13 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> And not even 50% halfway there
02:43:11 <owlthebird[m]> <owlthebird[m] "Oh okay, I will give that a try."> That worked. Thank you
02:43:34 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, your machine is resource constrained but you'll be able to build it out
02:43:37 <aeonsolution[m]> just needs time
02:43:59 <owlthebird[m]> <andresbs[m] "If you have the killswitch enabl"> Thanks that solved it.
03:10:57 <andresbs[m]> <owlthebird[m] "Thanks that solved it."> No problem
07:07:43 <theultron[m]> I see GOS uses f2fs for /data partition for some devices. Have any body done performance comparison with ext4?
07:12:47 <theultron[m]> renlord
10:23:15 <hitchhooker[m]> does grapheneos save some crash logs for apps that get killed by hmalloc?
10:23:39 <cn3m[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "does grapheneos save some crash "> to my knowledge no
10:23:50 <cn3m[m]> last time I helped debugging one I had to logcat with my PC
10:24:51 <hitchhooker[m]> need android sdk for that, right?
10:36:05 <hitchhooker[m]> so there is no way natively getting logs, but i need to emulate gos on android studio and get logs there if i understood right?
10:43:18 <cn3m[m]> hitchhooker: I use adb and logcat
10:43:19 <cn3m[m]> on my phone
10:48:36 <hitchhooker[m]> Ah great, will try it that way then. community i live in wont have 4g reach when its cloudy which makes everything a bit painful. I guess should look into getting proper receiver
11:04:40 <cdesai> You could ask them to take a bug report
11:05:03 <cdesai> Settings -> system -> Developer options -> take bug report.
11:05:17 <cdesai> There was a key combo too but I'm not sure if that's still a thing
11:07:51 <cdesai> Try both volume buttons + power at the same time
11:07:57 <cdesai> So press all 3 buttons at the same time
11:08:18 <cdesai> That captures a bug report on the device which can be shared later
11:08:38 <cn3m[m]> does that need dev options on?
11:13:37 <cdesai> Good question, don't think so, its handled at a lower level
11:14:23 <cn3m[m]> cdesai: thanks that does sound like a better solution.
11:14:32 <cn3m[m]> I didn't think of that
11:14:58 <cdesai> Even I take a bug report right after I see some bug and then email myself to check later
11:15:32 <cdesai> Far easier than dropping everything and looking at logs right then. Not to mention bug report includes a lot more
16:53:48 <Bluebird7> With Android 10 it was no longer possible to have the camera running in the background. The same is true for GrapheneOS? Any thoughts about changing that?
16:57:59 <Ultron[m]> <Bluebird7 "With Android 10 it was no longer"> I think a foreground service can keep the camera running in background. I am not sure though. What do you plan to do?

16:58:12 <Ultron[m]>  * I think a foreground service can keep the camera running. I am not sure though. What do you plan to do?
17:03:18 <Bluebird7> I'm just wondering that GrapheneOS's take is on this. Because I guess antitheft/ anti evil maid apps no longer work? Could GrapheneOS change this feature if they wanted to?
17:04:47 <cn3m[m]> <Bluebird7 "I'm just wondering that Graphene"> anti theft is a terrible idea, it has been offered in the past and it does nothing to stop crime, it does cause thousands of dollars in damage e
17:05:36 <cn3m[m]> <Bluebird7 "With Android 10 it was no longer"> GrapheneOS is not going to make data collection easier
17:10:10 <Bluebird7> If it is the owner of the device that's in the possession of the data, isn't that ok? An anti-evil-maid app is quite useful
17:13:52 <cn3m[m]> define what you expect this app to do
17:14:00 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <cn3m[m] "GrapheneOS is not going to make "> Under the assumption there is no foreground service permission granted?
17:14:47 <cn3m[m]> <d64qoc8432li8p9o "Under the assumption there is no"> easier than AOSP* He asked if GrapheneOS would allow a background recording option
17:16:44 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Well I mean in an app in general
17:16:59 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Is it possible given the camera permission?
17:17:08 <cn3m[m]> rephrase?
17:17:41 <Bluebird7> I guess Haven is considered an anti-evil-maid app. https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.havenapp.main/
17:18:01 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Something like can the camera run with foreground service permission at background
17:18:26 <cn3m[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuInUW77CPo yeah watch this to learn more
17:18:32 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Or can it access clipboard using that same permission
17:18:39 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> thanks
17:19:21 <cn3m[m]> you can only access the clipboard in one of two cases
17:19:29 <cn3m[m]> the app is focused or the app is your keyboard
17:20:11 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <cn3m[m] "the app is focused or the app is"> But there is no focus mode in GrapheneOS?
17:22:04 <cn3m[m]> <d64qoc8432li8p9o "But there is no focus mode in Gr"> what?
17:22:42 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Like I searched the settings?
17:23:07 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> What is "focus" there, the current app running on screen?
17:24:05 <newyearnewphil[m> hey guys, sorry to bother. how do i get to the offtopic chat?
17:26:01 <cn3m[m]> <d64qoc8432li8p9o "What is "focus" there, the curre"> focused means the app is filling the screen it is active
17:27:16 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <cn3m[m] "focused means the app is filling"> Nice
18:19:55 <blueuser[m]> do apps have to target a certain sdk version for that? the clipboard thing
18:22:46 <blueuser[m]> when i copy a link in slide and bromite runnng in backgroung, bromite is reading the clipboard
19:03:23 <blueuser[m]> and sometimes ttrss as well but not each time, not sure why. maybe grapheneOS is different from lineageos 17.1 that i am using?
19:03:51 * blueuser[m] uploaded a video: ttrsscopy.mp4 (1238KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/PdALnowNziBkpHkBDdXhGVug/ttrsscopy.mp4 >
19:05:52 <blueuser[m]> but the grapheneos faq say that gos just use the android 10 implementation?
19:08:09 <blueuser[m]> or it's just my few months old lineageos which is broken
19:08:50 <blueuser[m]>  * or maybe it's just my few months old lineageos which is broken
19:19:15 <blueuser[m]> or probably that the app try to read it but in fact it can't read it and the os return an empty value

21:55:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> elem22: do I bang my head against the wall or yours
21:55:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> I advise you to read the chat log
21:56:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> And the FAQ and the usage guide
21:56:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Every single of your questions has been answered before
21:56:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> And none of this behavior will be changed
21:57:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Literally somebody will come with the same set of questions every other day and either me, cn3m or strcat will go into a futile battle with whoever brings up these same questions again and again
21:58:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just FYI. These are actual developers and often time is wasted explaining the same thing over and over again instead of development. elem22 read the usage guide and the irc chat log
21:59:07 <cn3m[m]> > AOSP dialler app is querying phone numbers against online database leaking contacts most probably to google.
21:59:07 <cn3m[m]> Let me check this
21:59:08 <cn3m[m]> > w/o root no way to install afwall to block system services
21:59:08 <cn3m[m]> The builtin GrapheneOS firewall is far far stronger than AFWall+ which is known to be broken and unfixable
21:59:08 <cn3m[m]> > In general it would be great having native root option in graphene for those who require it.
21:59:08 <cn3m[m]> Would completely break the security model. What would the point of GrapheneOS even existing be?
21:59:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> See? Happened again
21:59:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Same questions over and over again answered by developers instead of them working on the project

22:07:31 <dazinism> Think there is(was?) a feature that used a 3rd party service to look up where the call was coming from, would announce the area when it started ringing
22:07:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Afaik I've never heard of such a feature
22:08:19 <dazinism> Let me check an old phone I think may have it....
22:09:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> It really never was there
22:10:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW dazinism cn3m how's your weekend going
22:10:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Was a little off last week, hopefully I finish R bringup by Monday
22:12:24 <dazinism> I'm good thanks.  That sounds gReat
22:13:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well hardening changes are a little tough
22:13:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Makes you really appreciate how much effort strcat does all by himself every new version
22:14:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well the plan is like this
22:14:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Have a working kernel and android-prepare-vendor ready
22:14:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Port any change that requires a state change
22:14:51 <dazinism> R lands with Mondays update I guess?
22:14:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then we do a beta release and port the hardening over
22:15:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Eh hopefully
22:15:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> That means I gotta be faster
22:15:49 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "BTW dazinism cn3m how's your wee"> I am not feeling well, but I am happy. How about you?
22:15:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can only work on this at weekends already
22:16:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "I am not feeling well, but I am "> Yeah wasn't so well last week
22:16:19 <dazinism> Imagine it'll take a bit longer than normal to get the GrapheneOS update out.
22:16:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Now I'm good
22:16:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> dazinism: god I hope not
22:17:12 <dazinism> I meant compared to a normal monthly update
22:17:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW aeonsolution has been a huge help when I was sick and did a significant amount of work on pixel 3
22:17:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> For R
22:18:39 <dazinism> Yeah, nice one aeonsolution great to have you plugging away at stuff, of course you too anu
22:18:40 <cn3m[m]> aeon is awesome
22:20:19 <sandroteem[m]> Hi, anybody here that can help me with the Auditor app? Can I proof, that GrapheneOS is running on an "untrusted" (not flashed by myself) device?
22:23:30 <jpds> sandroteem[m]: Yes, either with a separate device or via attestation.app
22:28:41 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: pretty sure dialler> phone number lookup> reverse lookup was (is?) on by default in LineageOS
22:30:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> dazinism: Google isn't the default
22:32:34 <dazinism> sandroteem: Auditor guarantee for the auditee is strongest with a given auditor device (which could be the attestation.app remote server) after first pairing,
22:34:05 <dazinism> Yeah you right Anu, think its maybe some service based in Austria?
22:37:27 <dazinism> sandroteem: think it still gives a reasonable guarantee with first audit, but much stronger after that.
