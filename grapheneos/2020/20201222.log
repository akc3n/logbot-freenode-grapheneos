00:18:04 <b1101> does anyone have projectfi working with graphene?
00:27:50 <hazel[m]> hi hello. I have a bit of a moral dillema...
00:28:25 <hazel[m]> so I got a WearOS watch (Fossil Gen 5) for Hannukah as a gift from my parents. I'm historically not a fan of smartwatches but I have been using it because I feel it'd be rude not to
00:28:51 <hazel[m]> I'm currently on a Pixel 2 running stock, and I'm getting a 4a soonish. my initial reasoning for getting the 4a is because of Graphene.
00:29:16 <hazel[m]> is there some workaround to get WearOS working w/ a GrapheneOS device, despite the obvious almost contradiction?
00:29:45 <hazel[m]> and if not, what's the best thing I can do to preserve privacy on the 4a while still keeping the WearOS device functional?
00:30:45 <louipc> its just blutooth isn't it?
00:31:34 <hazel[m]> you need the WearOS app to pair to the device. I paired to a Pixel 2 with the Google app disabled -- it said I needed to enable the Google app. furthermore, I'm pretty sure the wearable framework would be something with Google Play Services.
00:32:42 <hazel[m]> it looks like microG has `play-services-wearable` but I haven't heard any success stories.
00:32:52 <louipc> sounds like google-heavy
00:33:06 <hazel[m]> ditto. hence the contradiction.
00:33:22 <hazel[m]> it's more out of the obligation that I'm expected to use this thing because it's a gift...
00:33:42 <louipc> well you can still wear the watch as a fashion piece at least :P
00:34:01 <louipc> if you worried about not offending
00:34:17 <hazel[m]> lol
00:37:23 <hazel[m]> "The Fossil Q Explorist HR 2400 smartwach will pair with the phone (Moto G7 with LineageOS 17.1) over blueooth as often as not; but will not complete setup." from microG reddit
00:37:52 <hazel[m]> what I'm probably going to do is give it a shot in the dark and see if it works lol
00:38:00 <hazel[m]> 4a comes here tomorrow
00:40:08 <hazel[m]> apparently no bluetooth support according to gmscore github. damn
01:13:14 <b1101> putting my fi sim back into my phone, and making sure fi activates with it, then will flash graphene. hopefully it works
01:23:30 <dazinism> b1101: Google Fi doesnt work for everyone. But for some its OK
01:23:39 <dazinism> https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=Google+fi&ch=grapheneos&w=a
01:25:55 <b1101> interesting. I made a backup of everything, will see if it works. I can always flash lineage back easily
01:26:15 <b1101> will just have to go through it; which I will do if I have to.
01:29:57 <hazel[m]> what I think I'm gonna do is keep stock on my Pixel 2, keep that paired to Wear OS, and then use the 4a for everything; for the sole purposes of updating the watch lol
01:47:03 <dxrwzy9y[m]> How do I not get harassed by Google's Recaptcha crap in the Newpipe app on GrapheneOS when using Orbot?
01:48:28 <b1101> well. phone calls work
01:56:01 <mulbr[m]> Got graphene running on 4a. Install pretty smooth with linux mint
02:05:57 <b1101> so far so good. mms worked
02:07:31 <b1101> can't disable default messaging app :/
02:26:27 <pacman37[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "How do I not get harassed by Goo"> There's no solution AFAIK
02:29:11 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Can I at least stop it from loading that spyware website?
02:31:20 <PeterEaston> dxrwzy9y[m]: Yes, you certainly can. The easiest way would be to go to Google and either find a way to convince or coerce them to change their abuse detection mechanisms.
02:33:37 <b1101> and mss works for me
02:33:42 <b1101> mms
02:33:58 <b1101> is there an app that will download apks from playstore
02:34:33 <TheJollyRoger> b1101: yes, there is, Aurora will allow you to do that. Note that Aurora from time to time is a bit unreliable.

02:47:21 <b1101> any way to have the calendar show holidays and such?
03:02:16 <pacman37[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Can I at least stop it from load"> Sorry, What spyware website?
03:19:08 <dwkr[m]> <blk "Does graphene support wi-fi call"> I haven't had any issues w Wifi Calling on Mint on 4a
03:23:11 <dwkr[m]> <b1101 "currently on projectfi. consider"> My batter life is way better than running stock OS.
03:25:35 <dwkr[m]> The calendar included with Graphene is just a placeholder and doesn't function for scheduling or any of that stuff. Two popular alternatives are Simple Calendar and Etar which both can be downloaded from the FDroid app marketplace.
03:26:02 <b1101> dwkr[m]: been on lineageos since I got my pixel 3.
03:26:26 <b1101> ya, I got etar, but it doesn't show holidays for some reason. I know it did on lineage, but I think that was because of the google account
03:26:59 <dwkr[m]> I had issues importing to eTar so ended up with Simple Calendar
03:34:35 <b1101> sweet
03:36:07 <b1101> so far the only app I really needed for google services was ebay
03:36:22 <b1101> *needed google services to work that is
03:37:15 <abumubarak[m]> FYI my GrapheneOS on 3a XL worked flawlessly on Verizon. Just swapped the SIM card. That's was all
03:39:26 <Liakde[m]> <abumubarak[m] "FYI my GrapheneOS on 3a XL worke"> Not including voicemail, I assume?
04:00:13 <hazel[m]> anyone have any experience with graphene on ting? i'm pretty sure i'm on their verizon network.
04:03:14 <mulbr[m]> Offtopic, try offtopic channel. But yes, ting works fine
04:54:34 <b1101> does graphene not enable full usbc xfer speed? copying my music back, and it's going slow
04:56:53 <ephemeralang[m]> Does anyone have any idea why the adblocking capability in bromite would go away after clearing storage / cache? I turned adblocking on in the settings
05:07:47 <creature2[m]> Question: am I making a mistake installing a couple dozen fdroid apps on grapheneos? I read about that increasing the available attack surface for bad actors. Not that I am a valuable target for that. Just asking to learn.
05:10:39 <creature2[m]> <ephemeralang[m] "Does anyone have any idea why th"> ephemeralang: my first troubleshooting idea is to visit sites to get info loaded again into the storage/cache, and then check if this has an effect of restoring adblock capability.
05:14:08 <creature2[m]> Devs: I love grapheneos like crazy, so thank you deeply for all your time and effort. Believe me, boatloads of people appreciate it very much, but simply aren't speaking up.
05:19:24 <ayaen_t[m]> creature2:  having a couple dozen apps is not the issue in and of itself its just that app developers   do not take security and privacy as seriously as the OS developers here do .
05:22:29 <ayaen_t[m]> but then ofcourse there are many who do follow the best practices
05:22:29 <ayaen_t[m]> and as long as you know what app you are using how active the developers are and how they approach android security and privacy and take an informed decision in these regards you are good to go!
05:27:04 <ayaen_t[m]> creature2: but as you said earlier about attack surface increase , software is naturally buggy and so it boils down to what you trust to what extent
05:31:50 <ayaen_t[m]> creature2: and in case you are compelled for some social,work etc.  reason to use certain apps then you can always install them in separate profiles which provides some level of isolation between app data ofcourse the number of profiles that can be simultaneously used is quiet limited
05:38:06 <b1101> transfer speed is definitely slower than it was on lineage. Anyone know why?
05:51:30 <dwkr[m]> I have no clue. I recently moved gigs worth of flac files via USB to my GOS phone and it was very fast.
05:52:20 <dwkr[m]> Have you restarted your phone since installing GOS? I've seen that help with certain issues.
06:18:54 <organicpumpkin[m> <b1101 "transfer speed is definitely slo"> Are you sure you are not just connecting to a USB 2.0 port on the other end? That would make it slow.
06:23:35 <b1101> organicpumpkin[m: no. I do think an app was partially responsible, as it got better, but still not what it was previously. I would get above 100mb/s
06:24:08 <b1101> I'm pretty much set. everything copied over, and functioning
07:03:17 <ayaen_t[m]> hey guys is there any place where the hardening measures taken on grapheneOS have been documeneted extensively ?
07:06:50 <b1101> prolly not the answer you're looking for, but the features page has a good amount of info.
07:09:36 <ayaen_t[m]> yes b1101  it sure does have a good amount of infornation , but just that i wanted to read further
07:09:36 <Liakde[m]> Also in github.com/grapheneos
07:09:37 <Liakde[m]> Especially the hardened_malloc, libc part
07:10:35 <ayaen_t[m]> i  guess im being stupid as i should have looked it up myself , atleast tried , thanks Lia (kde)
07:20:26 <b1101> curious what my battery life will be for the next few days. even with lineageos I would install the pico gapps, and have very few applications.
07:28:00 <hazel[m]> does microG function on GrapheneOS? if so, it's just installing everything in the F-Droid repo, right?
07:31:55 <ayaen_t[m]> hey hazel  why dont you go over this https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services  and see in case it answers your question ?
07:32:18 <ayaen_t[m]> or have you already been through this ?
07:32:20 <hazel[m]> oh I read that
07:32:48 <hazel[m]> I'm asking if it's possible to do it anyway, despite not being loaded with the firmware
07:35:36 <ayaen_t[m]> some people have tried it with varying degrees of success. i personally never felt the need for it.
07:35:36 <ayaen_t[m]> but microg in a manner of speaking plays the role of  google play services and so has nothing to do with the fdroid repo
07:35:53 <hazel[m]> I'm aware of the apparent paradox of rooting Graphene and putting it in /system/app or w/e...
07:35:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> hazel: we have unofficial builds
07:36:16 <hazel[m]> where...?
07:36:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not yet
07:36:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> But there will be soon
07:36:39 <hazel[m]> understandable have a nice day
07:36:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> We install microg as a user app
07:36:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> And the system checks the signature
07:36:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> If it matches the signature is automatically granted
07:37:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> * If the signature of the app matches ours then the signature is automatically spoofed
07:37:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> We do not let the app decide the signature to spoof
07:38:14 <fipsidipsi[m]> hi! i'm thinking about buying a pixel so i can use graphene. can anyone tell me if the vanadium browser supports bookmark sync of any kind? i'm currently using firefox everywhere but read that it's less secure than the built in vanadium
07:38:53 <hazel[m]> that's clever
07:39:36 <hazel[m]> I'd use Calyx for the sake of microG but something about it is *extremely offputting* to me and I don't know why
07:45:13 <keepitcool[m]> anxiety from googl'es shadow?
07:45:19 <keepitcool[m]>  * anxiety from google's shadow?
07:45:43 <Liakde[m]> Not only that
07:45:55 <hazel[m]> bundling a free VPN service with the OS is what bothers me the most...
07:46:02 <hazel[m]> but whatever offtopic etc
07:46:14 <Liakde[m]> microG still send notifs still send the unencrypted notification metadata to Google servers
07:46:47 <Liakde[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
07:47:00 <hazel[m]> tyvm
07:50:34 <b1101> I installed ff through the aurora store, as chrome based browsers don't support addons I install ublock origin and darkreader
07:54:47 <fipsidipsi[m]> do you know how much of a security risk ff really is? is it safer just by using grapheneos or is it like subverting everything graphene is providing? ok everything seems hardly fair, it still covers a lot of ground
07:56:17 <Liakde[m]> Just sent in offtopic about a shorthand pros and cons of microG
08:37:52 <rny> whats ff
08:37:58 <rny> firefox?
08:39:54 <flabbergasted[m]> yes
08:42:12 <rny> fipsidipsi[m]: https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html
08:51:33 <b1101> :(
08:58:12 <ayaen_t[m]> why sad b1101 ?
08:58:32 <ayaen_t[m]> madaidan made me cry too.
08:58:46 <ayaen_t[m]> but then i saw light.
08:59:42 <b1101> firefox + ublock origin + darkreader is really good.
09:00:04 <fipsidipsi[m]> thank you for the link! that's sad stuff.. mozilla is undeniably an important player in the fight for a free and private internet.. now having a reason like this to not use ff is making me a little pessimistic for the future
09:00:13 <b1101> but apparently really bad for security reasons. and no addons on any chrome based browsers
09:00:40 <b1101> mozilla sold out.
09:00:45 <fipsidipsi[m]> non extensibility of vanadium is a bummer
09:00:52 <ayaen_t[m]> yes i agree on that ib1101  somehow imagine just getting ublock to work
09:01:57 <somenerd[m]> on ff?
09:02:02 <somenerd[m]> or on Vanadium?
09:03:17 <fipsidipsi[m]> b1101: sold out meaning having signed the google deal again?
09:03:40 <b1101> ya, and adding more bloat into the browser
09:04:04 <ynhof[m]> Idk if its any more private, but are you aware of fennec on f-droid?
09:04:15 <ayaen_t[m]> but i tell myself what ive read somewhere in relation to content blocking :
09:04:15 <ayaen_t[m]> enumerating badness is not a viable security approach
09:04:15 <ayaen_t[m]> or something to that effect
09:04:20 <b1101> I've been using palemoon for a bit now, may just be a while for it to get multithreading
09:04:30 <b1101> on linux that is
09:04:37 <ayaen_t[m]> somenerd:  vanadium i meant
09:04:51 <somenerd[m]> ohh, then here's some good news
09:05:25 <somenerd[m]> it was something about a DNS based blacklist built into GrapheneOS
09:05:57 <somenerd[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/184
09:06:36 <somenerd[m]> possible implementation though
09:06:44 <fipsidipsi[m]> how do you guys do adblocking? graphene is non-rooted right? i used to have adaway installed on cyanogen but i really don't want to have root anymore
09:06:48 <b1101> and fennec still has tracking :(
09:07:02 <somenerd[m]> (not guaranteed)
09:07:28 <somenerd[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/184#issuecomment-738950900
09:07:34 <b1101> I installed blokada, but that's not enough as I still got ads in vanadium
09:08:04 <somenerd[m]>  * (not guaranteed though)
09:08:59 <fipsidipsi[m]> b1101: is it vpn based? i have used netguard to great effect, there was a slight hit on battery but not bad
09:09:13 <b1101> yes
09:09:31 * ayaen_t[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/sNUKLiHMMvAyOVffitKArHao/message.txt >
09:10:14 <somenerd[m]> yeah
09:11:02 <fipsidipsi[m]> ad netguard, you have to do something for it to also do adblocking: https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md
09:11:37 <ayaen_t[m]> makes sense. but still something like ublock would be lovely to have . ofcourse i always forget that i am only asking and am not aware of the complexities of implementation and the implications it woukd have
09:19:44 <b1101> darkreader is another addon I really like. makes any site dark. because white sites need to be destroyed
09:22:17 <ayaen_t[m]> you could toggle the force dark flag in chrome://flags but that in turn ends up destroying dark sites !
09:22:45 <rny> fipsidipsi[m]: free and private internet? what are you talking about
09:23:06 <rny> what does an internet browser have anything to do
09:23:32 <somenerd[m]> I believe they're talking about the chromium monopoly
09:23:40 <somenerd[m]> and with it, the control that google gets
09:24:25 <rny> while chromium is predominantly maintained by google, its downstream maintainers can apply whatever customizations they so please.
09:25:02 <ayaen_t[m]> yes somenerd  i read , rather binged on that topic quiet some time ago on reddit how firefox ia dying , sniff sniff but now i just shrug and use chromium/vanadium/bromite
09:25:19 <rny> bad software should just go to the graveyard
09:25:48 <ayaen_t[m]> rny:  do we have anything dor standing ovation in element app?
09:25:57 <fipsidipsi[m]> i meant something like having a seat at the table when it comes to defining web standards and providing users with real alternatives.. ff is a completely different implementation of a browser with no relationship to chromium at all
09:26:29 <somenerd[m]> this conversation is getting a bit offtopic
09:26:38 <fipsidipsi[m]> yeah ok
09:26:39 <somenerd[m]> best to move to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ?

18:30:58 <qubits> I just bought google pixel 4a new, and plan to put grapheneOS on it. I would appreciate if someone could guide me in this. I have macOS Big Sur. As soon as I connect the phone with USB cable, which program should I open to continue and what should I prepare in advance
18:47:19 <dwkr[m]> qubits are you following the official install guide?

18:55:49 <Gui_Do> they only have to copy and past commands in a terminal
18:56:14 <Linus[m]1> <Fuse[m] "Anyone know if an update messged"> Still works for me on 3aXL
18:56:26 <Gui_Do> how much more easier could it be?
18:56:28 <Gui_Do> OMG
18:56:36 <Fuse[m]> Okay then the last drop messed mine up :)
18:56:45 <Gui_Do> only analphabetics on board?
18:58:50 <nscnt> Please be nice anyway
18:59:09 <Gui_Do> i'm surely nice
19:00:39 <Gui_Do> but every day, every hour the same questions by non reading people. I gave my phone my 12 years old daughter and said: do what there is written...
19:00:56 <Gui_Do> after that I had a graphene phone
19:01:02 <CaptainBlackton> <Gui_Do>, were you referring to my question? I actually came here AFTER reading the step-by-step instruction that nscnt posted there, but that instruction talks about udev rules for Ubuntu, but I don't know what I need to do with those rules, or if I need to do anything to activate them.
19:02:35 <Gui_Do> I never had to do that
19:03:31 <Gui_Do> after opening bootloader in settings reboot to fastboot and did all steps without any udev rules or so
19:05:25 <nscnt> CaptainBlackton: You shouldn't use the packages provided by Debian. Get the standalone platform-tools. If you don't want to/can't use udev rules, you may flash with sudo. It's not recommended (everything that's recommended is in the guides), but you may do it that way
19:05:38 <louipc> CaptainBlackton: where do you read that version from?
19:06:07 <CaptainBlackton> <louipc> I just ran "fastboot --version" in terminal and that's what it told me.
19:07:04 <louipc> you said 29.0.6. where did you read that?
19:07:55 <nscnt> louipc: Minimum version (from the guide)
19:08:51 <louipc> oh i see
19:08:56 <nscnt> Looks like the Debian package just says 'debian' as version number
19:09:49 <louipc> you better download the version using the specified command
19:10:08 <louipc> 'standalone platform-tools'
19:11:45 <CaptainBlackton> Thanks everyone. So it looks like there is already an option for fastboot on the phone in recovery mode. So I'm just trying to get the corresponding package updated on my computer? (fastboot needs to be on the phone as well as on the computer for it work? And I'm concerned now about the computer end of it?)
19:12:21 <louipc> fastboot is just a program on computer to interface with phone
19:16:45 <CaptainBlackton> OK, thanks! It looks like that worked so far: fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
19:16:59 <nscnt> Yes, sounds good
19:22:23 <CaptainBlackton> Is there a way to do the OEM unlocking without Internet? In order to get into the phone it required mandatory agreement to automatic updates for all their services, and I don't want it to start doing system updates and who-knows-what and messing up what I'm trying to do now.
19:23:53 <CaptainBlackton> (I already updated the system image through sideload in a previous step)
19:27:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> CaptainBlackton: what happened
19:27:37 <CaptainBlackton> Oh, maybe it's OK. Although there was no opt-out when I first went into the phone, it looks like developer options has a way to turn off "automatic system updates" after the fact
19:28:57 <louipc> sounds like you're doing some weird stuff man
19:32:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipc "sounds like you're doing some we"> That's lewd
19:32:39 <louipc> sorry
19:37:02 <CaptainBlackton> OK, I'm about to download the OS image, but should I do stable or beta?
19:38:02 <jpds> Always stable to start
19:38:46 <dwkr[m]> Beta testers are needed, but you should know what you are signing up for with beta.
19:39:31 <dwkr[m]> qubits are you getting things worked out?
19:40:25 <organicpumpkin[m> <dwkr[m] "Beta testers are needed, but you"> And what are you signing up for with Beta? Do you know?
19:40:28 <qubits> yes i m waiting to update the device with all security updates
19:40:38 <qubits> louipc gave me instructions
19:41:21 <CaptainBlackton> OK, thanks
19:54:15 <dwkr[m]> OrganicPumpkin a version that isn't best suited for grandma/grandpa, or someone who doesn't have a lot of time, energy, or a second phone to rely on. That's all.
19:57:21 <xu0ohV6a> So I've started getting pop-ups on certain web pages with Vanadium as of this morning..
19:57:44 <xu0ohV6a> Right now I'm looking at "Should Americans respect the Flag?"
19:57:55 <xu0ohV6a> That is both odd and surprising.
19:59:05 <interactive> Hello, i've finally managed to install grapheneos on my pixel 4a, now i like to use the auditor app but i do have a problem with my old phone. On the pixel 4a the auditor app ist preinstalled and on my old phone i installed it with the aurora store. Both apps work and i use the auditee mode on my pixel 4a and the auditor mode on my old phone. The
19:59:05 <interactive> pixel 4a scans the QR Code and shows it own generated QR Code. The Camera on the old phone opens and i hover it above the pixel 4a but it isnt able to scan the QR Code of the pixel 4a. My old phone is a samsung galaxy s7. Can somebody help me?
19:59:38 <dwkr[m]> xu0ohV6a  There's no ad blocking in Vandium, so were you using another means to block ads?
20:00:35 <xu0ohV6a> Per the FAQ, I had been avoiding third-party ad blocking.
20:00:47 <xu0ohV6a> What's interesting is that this pop-up is happening on Bitchute.
20:00:50 <xu0ohV6a> and only certain videos
20:01:14 <dwkr[m]> <interactive "pixel 4a scans the QR Code and s"> I think I had a similar issue auditing my 4a w my S7 Edge. Try cleaning the S7 camera, restarting the S7, and being patient while you do that last scan.
20:01:59 <interactive> dwkr[m] thank you i will try
20:02:22 <dwkr[m]> IIRC the S7 just took a few seconds to scan, I think it was a focus issue.
20:03:53 <dwkr[m]> Also worth noting, I think you need to be running the stock OS on the auditing phone. Someone was trying to audit their GOS phone from their LineageOS phone recently and it wouldn't work.
20:05:00 <interactive> it is stock, maybe my camera isnt doing it anymore
20:06:44 <dwkr[m]> 🤞
20:08:01 <interactive> i moved the camera further away from the pixel 4a and it scans it but now i encouter a verifying error. haha
20:09:41 <dwkr[m]> I'm testing my auditing setup again right now to see what it looks like for me
20:10:17 <interactive> it worked :)  my camera seems to be really borked i needed to do it just 10 times in a row
20:11:13 <dwkr[m]> I get a green screen with "Successfully performed strong paired verification....." at the top
20:11:16 <dwkr[m]> Awesome.
20:12:01 <interactive> thanks for your help, it says only basic initial verification on my screen
20:12:44 <dwkr[m]> Maybe has something to do with your first auditing ("initial")?
20:15:09 <interactive> yep you were right
20:15:18 <interactive> thanks alot, now it is green
20:15:25 <interactive> have a nice day
20:24:44 <dwkr[m]> You too!
20:24:48 <CaptainBlackton> Thanks everyone for your help! It seems to have installed properly so far, and I'm messing around with settings and testing things out. It seems the camera and light work, which were the main things I wanted to have working.
20:54:44 <dimitri> hi
20:55:25 <dimitri> I need some help with flashing
20:56:27 <dimitri> It worked 1 time and now I wan't to do it again 2 days later and the error, fastboot too old keeps popping up when I type flash-all
20:56:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hello dimitri, are you doing this from Windows, and if so, are you using PowerShell?
20:57:02 <dimitri> I am on Windows
20:57:16 <TheJollyRoger> If you use the legacy cmd prompt, you will get that error because the legacy command prompt will not parse the logic used for the safety check correctly and exit with an error condition leading to that.
20:57:21 <dimitri> The first time I did everything in CMD as administrator
20:57:40 <dimitri> I tried both CMD and powershell
20:57:44 <dimitri> same error
20:59:26 <dimitri> I redownloaded the image and sdk tools, began the whole process from start. but it doesn't want to work somehow
20:59:43 <CaptainBlackton> Hmm, does GrapheneOS allow use of an external display through the USB-C port? I read that Google had disabled this ability in the source code, but has GrapheneOS reactivated that ability? I can't find anything in the phone settings about this, and plugging the phone into the monitor doesn't seem to do anything.
21:00:37 <strcat[m]> sorrowgalaxies: that's not true about Auditor
21:00:47 <strcat[m]> sorrowgalaxies: already said it wasn't true the other day
21:00:47 <alex-resist> CaptainBlackton I'm "working" on it. Still waiting for a USB 3.0 cable, then DisplayLink could potentially work
21:01:37 <alex-resist> We were discussing this a while ago in #grapheneos-offtopic
21:02:29 <strcat[m]> sorrowgalaxies: it doesn't have any specific requirements for the Auditor device beyond minimum OS version and it not being totally broken
21:04:53 <CaptainBlackton> <alex-resist>, that's good to know. It's not super-urgent for me, but eventually I would like to sit down and plug my phone into my USB-C powered/charging HUB and be able to use it like a desktop computer, then just unplug it and walk away with it.
21:06:13 <CaptainBlackton> So far I've never gotten any of these USB-C hubs to do anything, but I can't tell if that's the fault of the phone, the OS, or the dongle itself. This dongle is passing through power currently at least. But I can't read a USB thumb drive through it
21:06:35 <alex-resist> CaptainBlackton I'm gonna try a ThinkPad USB 3.0 dock. Tried it out with a USB 2.0 cable and it does recognize an HDMI display and the USB hub, but the display stayed black. Very likely because USB 2.0 is just way too slow. It has to be a DisplayLink compatible device though, then it *might* work
21:07:12 <alex-resist> (and you need the DisplayLink app. Also this might be too off topic for the main channel)
21:09:48 <CaptainBlackton> Ok, I can join that off-topic channel if needed. Not sure what the criteria are for making something off-topic though.
21:10:01 <CaptainBlackton> So maybe I just need the DisplayLink app?
21:10:32 <CaptainBlackton> I think my dongle is pretty decent this time. And actually I just got a keyboard to work through it.
21:10:45 <dimitri> can someone please help me!
21:10:48 <dimitri> fastboot : The term 'fastboot' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
21:10:48 <dimitri> CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (fastboot:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
21:10:58 <alex-resist> CaptainBlackton you need the app and a DisplayLink compatible display or adapter. Will be afk for a bit.
21:10:59 <dimitri> on Windows powershell
21:15:11 <louipc> you missed a command
21:15:27 <louipc> or 2
21:15:34 <CaptainBlackton> Is there a recommended way to get apps on GrapheneOS? F-droid? Or side-load install or something? Or download from the web-browser onto the phone? I also remember some people talking about spoofing google services or something before.
21:20:12 <dimitri> fixed
21:20:14 <dimitri> bye
21:25:02 <CaptainBlackton> <alex-resist>, do you know if DisplayLink is OpenSource? I can't find anything about their software model on their website.
21:27:23 <dazinism> CaptainBlackton: have a look here https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
21:28:28 <dazinism> I imagine display link probably isnt open source.
21:30:55 <jayell[m]> CaptainBlackton: download apk directl from dev if it will self update. aurora store is portal to Google play. people seem to favor alt front ends to fdroid like aroura droid. just some methods available to ya . . .
21:34:35 <jayell[m]> as always, vet yer apps well. and consider using a separate user account for any apps that require unnecessary permissions (try to find an alternative to it nif possible)
22:11:12 <dwkr[m]> <strcat[m] "sorrowgalaxies: it doesn't have "> Ah ok. Sorry. I just went back and read your statements after someone mentioned auditing from stock OS.
22:29:24 <qubits> When i disable spell checker on settings-keyboard . Still some apps keep using spell checker it is really annoying to type then
22:37:14 <qubits> is there any suggestion for this issue? It is annoying especially when you need to type in diffrent languages every time, actually you are unable to type becouse it change automatically words
22:37:48 <fakhx[m]> It seems pegasus can hack pretty much any phone even with latest updates , is it the same with grapheneos ?
22:38:01 <fakhx[m]> * It seems nso's pegasus can hack pretty much any phone even with latest updates , is it the same with grapheneos ?
23:24:05 <qubits> When i use sim card it seems when device locked is that also data is not working
23:24:35 <qubits> In that case i will not get notifications but if i use wifi connection it works
23:35:33 <zugzwang[m]> <fakhx[m] "It seems pegasus can hack pretty"> They are hacking whatsapp and imessage not any phone

23:39:52 <louipc> qubits: offtopic
23:40:40 <strcat[m]> zugzwang: if you invite me to a chat you need to wait until I have time to see it and join or there's no point
23:41:20 <strcat[m]> fakhx: you don't seem to be getting information from an accurate source, you're just pulling information out of thin air - please take it elsewhere
23:42:19 <qubits> have some any suggestion why it seems dat when my device is locked and not used that data sim is not working i dont get any notifications from apps, but if my wifi is turned ON it works
23:43:22 <louipc> theres no google services qubits
23:43:31 <qubits> it works with wifi
23:43:52 <qubits> this app have own notification pushing
23:44:15 <louipc> you may need to enable running it in the background
23:44:33 <qubits> i did
23:45:22 <qubits> it looks like my sim card is in sleep modus
23:47:48 <louipc> theres also unrestricted data setting
23:47:55 <jpds> qubits: I use openboard and change the current language for spell-checking stuff
23:48:06 <qubits> i found that also unrestricted data
23:48:08 <qubits> srtill the same
23:48:57 <qubits> jpds every time when i talk i diffrent language then i would need to change it
23:52:32 <jpds> qubits: it's a simple spacebar hold down
23:53:23 <qubits> but can i disable  it like on original os, where you have function to disable predictive tezt
23:53:30 <qubits> predictive text
23:55:55 <qubits> And i think keyboard layout could be much better also. I dont know of there is option to change that
23:55:59 <jpds> You've turned off "auto-corrrection" in the settings?
23:56:09 <qubits> In wich settings?
23:56:29 <qubits> I only found Spel checker nothing else
23:57:16 <jpds> System > Input > On-screen keyboard > pick one > text correction
23:58:59 <qubits> oh i didnt notice that
23:59:01 <qubits> thanks
23:59:07 <qubits> now only this data issue
