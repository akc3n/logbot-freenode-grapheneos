00:21:24 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: the Pixel 2 is currently reaching the end of its life. I would not advise picking up a 2, and if you do have a 2, I would recommend immediately getting a new device as quickly as possible!
00:21:29 <habbihabbiya3[m]> has there been anyone who has decided to maintain pixel 5 grapheneos ?
00:22:35 <TheJollyRoger> hi habbihabbiya3[m], no, there hasn't been. Unless someone in the community steps up, it will remain off the roadmap.
00:24:17 <TheJollyRoger> To reiterate, GrapheneOS is not a business, but rather is a research and development project. The idea being, when people put the work in and work together, what comes out may be shared and enjoyed by all.
00:25:19 <TheJollyRoger> The Linux Kernel uses a similar model; companies like Google, Facebook, Intel, Samsung, etc, they often have people (and sometimes, entire teams) dedicated solely to contributing to the open source work because they depend on Linux.
00:25:55 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS aspires to do the same.
00:27:06 <habbihabbiya3[m]> would you recommend purchasing a used phone for graphene or is it not worth the risk in the case of a hardware attack?
00:28:15 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. Well, habbihabbiya3[m] I honestly can't answer that for you, because I'm not you.
00:28:25 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to "risks" as in,
00:29:04 <TheJollyRoger> "Maybe I'll end up getting a device that's been repaired more than once, and no longer has the sealant in it, was given a refurbished battery by a substandard vendor, or has a cracked screen/dead bunch of pixels that the seller's not telling me about?"
00:30:04 <TheJollyRoger> The risks of that tend to be fairly high, especially on Amazon. Even though U Break I Fix *supposedly* reapplies the sealant, I've heard plenty of reports that some locations aren't averse to taking shortcuts because they don't guarantee the sealant.
00:31:45 <habbihabbiya3[m]> i mean more replacement parts that have been tampered for the wrong reasons
00:32:37 <TheJollyRoger> As for hardware that's been fitted with implants, honestly, if you live in a location where you genuinely actually, truly DO have to worry about a three letter-agency out to get you and aren't just talking about it for the purpose of a thought exercise...
00:33:07 <TheJollyRoger> Let me put it this way: if that's the case then why are you trusting me? I'm just a random stranger on the internet whose main shtick is to play "Pirate" in tech rooms.
00:34:03 <habbihabbiya3[m]>  i dont mean the risk of state level players but more repair shop hacks
00:34:30 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, I'm not you. I can't make that judgement call for you.
00:35:03 <habbihabbiya3[m]> I understand, thank you
00:35:20 <TheJollyRoger> But I *will definitely* say you're safest buying your phone directly from Google if supplies remain.
00:35:58 <TheJollyRoger> In the past, we've had some people end up getting tricked into buying Verizon locked devices which are bootloader locked and cannot be unlocked.
00:36:14 <TheJollyRoger> Then the ebay seller refusing to take the ends back afterward.
00:40:45 <TheJollyRoger> As supplies on the official store dwindle, typically undesired Verizon devices end up being bailed as waste on ebay and secondhand. It becomes a minefield.
00:41:15 <TheJollyRoger> So if you do decide to buy secondhand, make sure your seller has a bulletproof return policy. Again, buyer beware.
00:41:41 <alzxjm[m]> Swappa is a good source
00:42:07 <TheJollyRoger> I was fairly lucky when I got my Pixel 3: a phone store I knew had one that had the box opened.
00:42:13 <TheJollyRoger> It had one small scuff on the side.
00:42:58 <TheJollyRoger> but remember that the Pixel 3 is made from frosted glass, it doesn't scuff very easily. So I bought it, then took it home, and used a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and some water to remove the scuff.
00:43:08 <TheJollyRoger> Turns out, it was just dirt.
00:43:45 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, my luck took a turn for the worst since unfortunately some sweat and lint got into the USB slot and gummed it up and caused the socket to break, so I had to get that replaced.
00:45:37 <pikey[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Let me put it this way: if that'"> yeah but come on, you do play it very very well. :P
00:46:37 <TheJollyRoger> Harr-harr, shiver me timbers indeed I fancy m'self as a salty sea dog! P.-)
00:46:51 <pikey[m]> :-)
00:47:02 <pikey[m]> you still on you P3 there JR?
00:47:07 <pikey[m]>  * you still on your P3 there JR?
00:47:17 <TheJollyRoger> Indeed, I am. I do have a P4 but it's used for testing.
00:47:45 <pikey[m]> i am. considering 4a, if its supported
00:47:53 <TheJollyRoger> The 4a is indeed supported.
00:47:57 <pikey[m]> mainly due to my battery being terrible, and i fancy the 3.5mm jack
00:48:07 <pikey[m]> luvverly jubberly
00:48:57 <pikey[m]> i need to sit down and really suss how to fully back up my 3 before i take the plunge though. i have a while, saving up for 4a
00:49:13 <pikey[m]> i dont have a ton of stuff, very little actually app wise, but a ton of music and files
00:49:31 <TheJollyRoger> It also has the fingerprint scanner!
00:49:36 <pikey[m]> haven't read graphene site for a while, need to read that again in case any new stuff
00:49:45 <TheJollyRoger> You could do it using a USB drive, if you want.
00:50:05 <pikey[m]> yeah!! i was sure the 4a would have face unlock so i was staying with 3 for that reason, when i heard it has fingerprint i was soo pleased
00:50:23 <TheJollyRoger> There should be an A-to-C Adapter in the box your phone came with, you could simply use that for your music and files.
00:50:27 <pikey[m]> yes i heard it can be done with a usb stick. have plenty of those
00:50:32 <TheJollyRoger> Fantastic.
00:50:38 <pikey[m]> they all self-combust on voice command. of course. damn 3 letter agencies. :D
00:50:46 <TheJollyRoger> Heh.
00:50:58 <pikey[m]> yep i have A-C adapter
00:51:09 <pikey[m]> i thought there were two processes
00:51:16 <pikey[m]> one for files, one for settings/apps
00:51:22 <pikey[m]> is that right, roughly speaking?
00:51:39 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Seedvault should have you covered for your settings and apps.
00:51:41 <pikey[m]> also i have android file transfer app installed on Mac OSX. I can use that for data.files too
00:52:01 <TheJollyRoger> Some apps, like Signal and Element (last I used Riot) do implement their own backup system, so make sure you set that up first.
00:52:07 <pikey[m]> will look up seedvault. heard of it but not sure, i thought it was like nextcloud!
00:52:16 <pikey[m]> roger that tahnks
00:52:33 <pikey[m]> i dont need any signal info really. i have sihgnal desktop running too
00:52:33 <TheJollyRoger> It's a part of the operating system, under Settings -> System -> Backup.
00:52:39 <pikey[m]> oh. haha
00:52:44 <pikey[m]> (blush)
00:52:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You should write your Seedvault recovery code down on a sheet of extra durable cardboard or something of the sort and store it in a safe place.
00:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> Once it's set you can't change it.
00:53:18 <TheJollyRoger> (Unless you want to start over again.)
00:53:43 <TheJollyRoger> So if you lose your SeedVault recovery seed, you are screwed. You'll be able to get your apps back, but not your settings or their data.
00:53:51 <TheJollyRoger> Note that some apps Seedvault can't back up.
00:54:20 <TheJollyRoger> These apps will set a "Please do not back me up!" flag. Seedvault will respect this flag because the security policies do not make an exception for it.
00:54:43 <TheJollyRoger> So be sure to check first which apps were and weren't backed up when you use SeedVault.
00:55:06 <pikey[m]> i see. excellent thanks. will do that.
00:55:13 <TheJollyRoger> When restoring a phone with a seedvault backup, you *must* do it from the launcher when the phone is either freshly installed, or immediately after a factory reset. It can't be done later.
00:55:14 <brenneke[m]> <dar_gomml[m] "i use k9-mail"> Aqua Mail, notifications work.
00:55:28 <TheJollyRoger> *when the phone's operating system is either
00:55:34 <pikey[m]> oh. that's kinda imporant to know! thank
00:55:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I made that mistake the first time X(
00:56:02 <pikey[m]> what is "the launcher"
00:56:17 <pikey[m]> seedvault launcher you mean or the first launch of Graphene on new device?
00:56:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, the first launch of GrapheneOS on the new device, when you get to that screen that first greets you the first time GrapheneOS is switched on.
00:57:36 <brenneke[m]> <dazinism "Apparently tutanota notification"> But no offline email unfortunately with Tutanota. They said they were working on it a year or so ago.
00:58:18 <pikey[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yes, the first launch of Graphen"> aha. gotcha. thank
00:58:31 <TheJollyRoger> pikey[m]: when you back up with SeedVault, the backups are going to be in several portions: the .apk files are packed up and kept, so you can reinstall them later, and you may also notice some files and directories with weird names.
00:58:47 <brenneke[m]> <nfpdex[m] "concerning email, you should che"> Have used it for a long time and had been flawless.
00:59:11 <TheJollyRoger> The actual data that seedvault will back up is encrypted, so it's OK for you to store it on your USB drive.
00:59:12 <pikey[m]> <TheJollyRoger "pikey: when you back up with See"> seedvault creates APKs?
00:59:26 <pikey[m]> nice
00:59:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it will take the APKs of the apps you have installed.
01:00:10 <brenneke[m]> <malicoye[m] "And Germany is 5 eyes. Far from "> Best thing is not to email about it when committing a crime.
01:00:40 <pikey[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah, it will take the APKs of t"> i always delete apk's after installig apps.
01:01:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It'll take them from what's currently installed! :) At least, that part seemed to work for me!
01:01:25 <TheJollyRoger> Just, once again, many apps do request that seedvault not back up their application data, so be sure you know which apps do and don't allow this.
01:02:11 <TheJollyRoger> When you take a backup, Seedvault should allow you to view what happened after the backup.
01:02:24 <TheJollyRoger> It's normal for some apps to not be backed up because they've requested not to be.
01:02:32 <pikey[m]> clever stuff!
01:04:08 <pikey[m]> great, yeah i will check. to be honest i am not too fussy. i run a skinny install really, not a big smartphone phone generally so i dont tend to live through the device. its mainly a phone/musicplayer/camera, the only additions being omninotes (data doesn't need backing up) and newpipe (no backups needed) and Aegis (definitely need to back that up if i can)
01:04:25 <TheJollyRoger> Fantastic. Yeah, be sure to check Aegis then!
01:04:34 <pikey[m]> otehr than that, its just tons of audiobooks and music files, and contacts of course. little else i am worried about migrating over
01:04:41 <TheJollyRoger> Also, check your Signal recovery pin code.
01:04:55 <pikey[m]> yep i got that dialled into my brain :)
01:04:55 <TheJollyRoger> And 30-digit backup recovery code.
01:04:58 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
01:05:06 <pikey[m]> 30 digit, for signal?
01:05:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, for Signal backups.
01:05:24 <pikey[m]> hmm, not sure i know about that
01:05:25 <TheJollyRoger> Signal has its own backup system.
01:05:31 <pikey[m]> but i really don't need any signal backups anyway
01:05:48 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
01:05:51 <pikey[m]> i have a 6 digit pin, but not seen any 30 digit codes, oh sorry, you probably mean that comes along when i do a signal backup.
01:05:57 <pikey[m]> which i wont :)
01:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> Bear in mind though, when you reinstall the Signal app, and reactivate it, your contacts will get the message "Pikey has changed safety numbers."
01:06:10 <pikey[m]> with any luck, i could lose a friend or two via attrition :d
01:06:34 <pikey[m]> ah yeah, so the backup would avoid the change of safety number
01:06:39 <pikey[m]>  * ah yeah, so the backup would avoid the change of safety number?
01:06:55 <TheJollyRoger> So if they're OK with it and you don't have many or any verified contacts, and your contacts won't notice this is of no consequences, but if you have a lot of reputation on your keys, then you might consider setting up a Signal backup, so it backs up your secret keys and allows you to move everything to the new phone.
01:07:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, it backs up your identity keys.
01:07:15 <TheJollyRoger> They're encrypted with a randomly generated 30-digit backup code.
01:07:19 <TheJollyRoger> You must NEVER lose this code!
01:07:40 <pikey[m]> cool. never knew this
01:07:45 <TheJollyRoger> Or you'll have to un-set it then set it back up again from scratch.
01:08:08 <pikey[m]> my contacts won't mind re-verifying, but i mighyt try the backup just for learning experience
01:08:12 <pikey[m]> thanks JR, as always
01:08:14 <TheJollyRoger> (You also will need to re-register the number on Signal, so don't throw away the SIM card or your VOIP number)
01:08:39 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime, shipmate!
01:09:52 <pikey[m]> ah good point yes.
01:10:44 <pikey[m]> this is a bonafide signal, so its the correct number. i am yet to get around to a second installation in another profile. have managed to avoid need for it but i can see it being needed after xmas, so i must look into that. will probably just get a burner sim to test that out
01:10:53 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
01:11:10 <pikey[m]> i heard signal getting some bad press in here (wiyth sensible critique) recently. you still rate it the best messaging app for privacy?
01:11:18 <TheJollyRoger> I still do.
01:11:21 <TheJollyRoger> By a huge margin.
01:11:50 <pikey[m]> good enough for lil old deckhand here then! thans
01:11:57 <TheJollyRoger> P.-)
01:12:17 <pikey[m]> i do love it
01:12:45 <pikey[m]> oh, HEY, did you see the update for desktop version? i noticed it by accident the other day. now can do video and audio calls from desktop. YAY!
01:12:50 <pikey[m]> works great too
01:13:14 <pikey[m]> all tyhey need to do now is add sceensharing function, and it's official the dog's testicles, and i can finally uninstall WIRE!
01:13:20 <TheJollyRoger> Previously, Signal backed up your contact list to their servers encrypted with the pin code and some weird stuff in the Intel SGX for secure value recovery, but the thing was they relied on the safety of the server's memory as protected by the SGX. The downside to this was, that if you set a weak pin code, in theory if someone broke the SGX and recovered the value, they might be able to run an
01:13:22 <TheJollyRoger> offline attack on it. At the time, Signal did not offer you a way to "opt out."
01:13:52 <TheJollyRoger> They do now though, and if so, the app will simply set the secure value to be unrecoverable.
01:14:22 <pikey[m]> that was, i think, one of the main points in the criticism i referred to above
01:14:27 <pikey[m]> so they fixed that. awesome
01:14:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, they fixed it, the fix dropped very quickly after the community cried out en masse.
01:15:09 <TheJollyRoger> So my suggestion is to still set the pin code, but use an EFF diceware passphrase instead of a pincode, and write the diceware password down somewhere.
01:15:50 <pikey[m]> are we talking about that six digit pin it kept asking me for?
01:15:57 <pikey[m]> you can replace that with a phrase?
01:16:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you can.
01:16:21 <TheJollyRoger> Toggle the "keyboard" button at the bottom corner of the keypad, it will return you to a virtual keyboard.
01:17:08 <pikey[m]> don't follow you there but will see if i can suss that next time it prompts
01:17:30 <pikey[m]> oh hey, being a signal user - do you have any idea how to do a carriage return in a message without sending?
01:17:32 <TheJollyRoger> This accomplishes two ends: it keeps your Signal contacts recoverable but ensures that should SGX be breached, that value will depend on another factor besides the obscurity of the SGX: the cryptographic strength of your passphrase.
01:18:55 <pikey[m]> right
01:18:56 <TheJollyRoger> It also ensures that should someone port your number out or should you forget to pay your bill and your phone provider reassigns your number, the next customer who gets assigned your old one won't accidentally reregister your number. This can be pretty handy at avoiding embarassing situations if your contacts will simply ignore and dismiss the "So and so has changed safety numbers" prompt!
01:19:00 <pikey[m]> what does SGX stand for?
01:19:22 <pikey[m]> ha, that's a DAMN good point!
01:19:33 <pikey[m]> not that I wouldn't pay my bill of course, I ain't no stinkin pirate :-D
01:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> Software Guard eXtensions. On Intel Processors, this is intended for software vendors to prevent piracy -- of the kind that don't involve cutlasses and sails and digging up treasure and drinking rum -- or reverse-engineering.
01:20:53 <pikey[m]> hahaha
01:21:06 <TheJollyRoger> What it does is it allows the app to request protection from the SGX. I don't precisely understand how it works but in abstract, the Intel Management Engine will encrypt a certain portion of the machine's memory and run the program within the encrypted "enclave".
01:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> In theory, this is so that if you attempt to dump the host machine's memory, that memory remains encrypted with keys that the host does not have.
01:22:43 <pikey[m]> abstract works a treat. neat use of SGX, signal is a damn great project. lets hope i can still use it after the tyrannical take over is complete. Since they are already trying to talk about banning encryted messengers here, cos "crime" or whatever bull shit the real criminals have learned to peddle
01:23:12 <TheJollyRoger> What Signal did was repurpose this so that contact discovery and the secured values is done within the SGX, and remains unknown even to them, so a rogue system administrator can't simply dump the host memory and make off with what's inside it.
01:23:22 <pikey[m]> seriously considering emigrating if that shit goes ahead, would be about teh final straw
01:23:38 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh.
01:23:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, Signal is definitely a great project!
01:23:54 <pikey[m]> clever .i better get that passphrase running! would you consider it bad practice to store it in bitwarden vault (behind a very strong master)
01:24:57 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I don't use online password managers and unfortunately I can't recommend or evaluate them because I honestly don't know enough to or not to.
01:25:26 <TheJollyRoger> Although my rule of thumb with anything webapp-based is, "you trust your provider and TLS."
01:25:44 <pikey[m]> yeah
01:26:04 <pikey[m]> i have stuff i dont put in there. i guess signal qualifies for same treatment reallyp
01:26:24 <pikey[m]> kinda depends what /who signal is used for too in a way. unless just practicing A1 opsec for the sake of it, which I maybe shoud, but dont
01:26:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The safest place for your Signal Backup code and Secure Value Recovery passphrase will be written down on a sheet of cardboard stored somewhere physically safe.
01:26:56 <Guest94742> Greetings, sorry to interrupt but I have a simple question: I would like to buy a Pixel phone to start using GrapheneOS. Is it possible to run it on a 4a 5g or should I get the 4a?
01:27:01 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy Guest94742!
01:27:23 <TheJollyRoger> You should go with the 4a. The 4a5G is an entirely different phone under an otherwise very similar exterior.
01:27:41 <pikey[m]> howdy
01:27:46 <TheJollyRoger> We don't have a maintainer for it, so the device will not be supported until someone steps up.
01:27:49 <pikey[m]> 4a
01:28:07 <pikey[m]> saving for one myself
01:28:14 <pikey[m]> cracking piece of kit for the money too
01:28:40 <pikey[m]> i didn't know the 5g versio was quite that different.
01:28:46 <pikey[m]> wasn't considering one anyway, but thats interesting
01:28:59 <pikey[m]> i seem to recall quite a big price diff, which would make sense now
01:29:07 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I haven't checked yet but based on what others have said, there may actually be a different chip underneath it.
01:29:29 <Guest94742> I see. So to use Graphene now I should get a 4a. Other option would be waiting for support on the newest one but it's not guaranteed.
01:29:45 <pikey[m]> yep
01:29:45 <TheJollyRoger> If indeed the chip is different (once again, I don't know, that's just a guess), then it would require an entirely different kernel, and with that, different drivers, different out-of-tree code, different everything.
01:30:05 <pikey[m]> right. huge work
01:30:09 <Guest94742> It has a different chipset, yeah
01:30:15 <pikey[m]> 4a is best bet if buying a phone for graphene us now, you think JR?
01:30:24 <TheJollyRoger> It is.
01:30:26 <pikey[m]>  * 4a is best bet if buying a phone for graphene use now, you think JR?
01:30:32 <pikey[m]> cool
01:30:48 <Guest94742> great to know, thanks
01:31:10 <pikey[m]> thanks for the tips JR. time for shuteye before dawn, big seas tomorrow (seriously!) catch ya laters.
01:32:03 <TheJollyRoger> 4s are kind of nice but Google discontinued them because honestly 4s and 4XLs, while the hardware is nice, they're kind of meh overall.
01:32:09 <TheJollyRoger> Sleep well, shipmate!
01:32:42 <TheJollyRoger> The loss of the fingerprint sensor was a sore spot, as was the high price.
01:33:30 <Guest94742> I feel the 4a is amazing for my purposes, I'm only afraid that will age bad compared to the newest 5g version
01:34:03 <TheJollyRoger> I'm honestly not too upset about 5G, but I'm also not a streamer, or do mobile gaming or use my phone for really heavy uses.
01:35:00 <Guest94742> Same, I like much more the better chip and battery to be honest
01:35:25 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I'm on a "pay-as-you-go" plan because phone plans where I live are often insanely expensive and overage fees are where the providers tend to make their money.
01:36:12 <TheJollyRoger> This I find preferable to watching my phone company suck up what could be $60-70 a month on my credit card statement.
01:36:26 <Guest94742> ouch, no doubt about it
01:36:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:39:21 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah. The safest place for your "> Buried in a chest?
01:39:23 <TheJollyRoger> LTE will be around for a long time. I mean, hell, I still have old "candybar" phones from the early 2000's that can still make calls!
01:40:11 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: Harr-harr! I'll have to be sure to keep a treasure map for that so me descendants can one day find Captain JR's lost treasure P.-)
01:42:08 <TheJollyRoger> I have wanted to put together a sea chest someday, I will when I have more time and the right tools for it.
01:51:52 <dakotah[m]> Will Graphene support pixel 5, I am thinking of getting one since they sound amazing.
01:56:35 <louipc> no plans at the moment. someone will have to volunteer to be device maintainer
01:57:12 <louipc> and be able to build grapheneos from scratch frequently
02:12:30 * TheJollyRoger sets the sign reading "It has been this many minutes since someone asked about the Pixel 5" back to 00
02:13:50 <TheJollyRoger> dakotah[m]: It's not even on the to-do. A maintainer must be able to commit to maintaining the device for the rest of its expected service life. This includes duties such as backporting security fixes to the LTS kernel and its driver code, and porting the improvements in GrapheneOS to the new device, testing and debugging it, etc.
02:15:53 <dakotah[m]> What does it take to be a maintainer?
02:16:23 <louipc> you need to be able to build grapheneos frequently
02:17:14 <louipc> and be able to use git
02:20:19 <TheJollyRoger> I'm working on that...
02:20:48 * TheJollyRoger kicks this rebase he just messed up royally by squashing the wrong commit and only realizing it about a week later.
02:30:02 <dakotah[m]> <louipc "you need to be able to build gra"> Sounds simple
02:30:57 <dakotah[m]> Maybe I will get a pixel 5 and become a maintainer to help you guys out
02:31:14 <louipc> nice
02:32:20 <dakotah[m]> What programming would I need to learn?
02:37:10 <louipc> you don't necessarily need to know programming, but any programming would help
02:37:49 <louipc> kotlin, java, c, c++, python, javascript
02:38:43 <dakotah[m]> Oh, I thought you had to know how to code in order to make it even work at all. Glad that isn't true because I know nothing right now.
02:46:33 <flashmelon> Will grapheneos be developed for other phones in the future? Are the pixel phones the only ones where it is possible to run a custom rom with locked bootloader?
02:50:03 <TheJollyRoger> Aw man we almost made it a full hour without someone asking that question!
02:50:11 * TheJollyRoger sets the flipcard sign back to "00"
02:50:28 <TheJollyRoger> flashmelon: Only when there are maintainers to make supporting those devices sustainable.
02:55:50 <poizn[m]> Anyone tested the inline autofill? Is it working?
02:56:38 <TheJollyRoger> flashmelon: at the moment, we're waiting for someone to either learn how to be a maintainer, or to step up and become a maintainer themselves.
03:03:52 <louipc> dakotah[m]: to make it work by yourself you need to know how to code, but there's other people who can code and can interpret stuff if you do the debugging and building and testing
03:04:39 <dakotah[m]> <louipc "dakotah: to make it work by your"> oh that makes it super super simple then.. I am basically a test dummy then lol
03:04:43 <louipc> but if you know how to hack stuff, patch stuff i think thats the basic requirement
03:05:14 <louipc> you dont need to be no computer scientist
03:08:02 <dakotah[m]> Thanks for the information
03:52:52 <Birdie[m]> May anyone please tell me or know why when switching between apps on gos (latest stable) on 3a, there is always 2 open element (latest) apps?

08:21:31 <trismous[m]> For offtopic go to the #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
08:24:23 <irmbrady[m]> Hi guys, excuse my ignorance, but I have a question. I have a Pixel 2 with stock android (not tried GOS yet). Google said there will no longer be updates for it from Oct 2020 (only 3 years support). Does this affect GOS updates for Pixel 2 in the future? i.e. No more pixel 2 updates from Google = no more updates for GOS?
08:24:23 <irmbrady[m]> I wanted to extend the life of my phone beyond 3 years 🤦‍♂️
08:41:09 <dallemon[m]> irmbrady: yes, when there is no longer OS and firmware updates a device is usually dropped from GOS as well.
09:02:48 <malicoye[m]> irmbrady yes. No android phone is supported longer. Apple is 7 years support. Let alone privacy, apple phones are much cheaper in the long run
09:04:02 <irmbrady[m]> Thanks for the clarification dallemon and malicoye ! I guess it's time to upgrade
09:13:10 <dazinism> tobsn.: there are alternative 3rd party clients for some services. Alternatively for some services can use their website.
09:13:40 <dazinism> For an alternativeTwitter client check out Twidere
09:15:03 <dazinism> But lots of people use their website. Can use the 'add to homescreen option in vanadium.
09:16:29 <dazinism> irmbrady: apparently there will be a December update from Google (and I think Graphene)
09:18:06 <dazinism> If I'm not getting confused, Graphene may even get an update or two after that.
09:24:07 <dazinism> The component (screen, WiFi, broadband etc.) firmware can only be updated by Google - if theres a significant security issue with any of that, after they stop releasing updates, I'm pretty sure GrapheneOS will  drop support.
09:40:25 <strcat[m]> we did a 2020-11-01 update for them even though the stock OS didn't
09:40:28 <strcat[m]> but they can't have 2020-11-05
09:40:32 <strcat[m]> missing GPU firmware update, etc.
11:08:40 <golli[m]2> Are you still able to use the IR camera on the Pixel 4's with GOS?
11:47:46 <alzxjm[m]> <golli[m]2 "Are you still able to use the IR"> Yes

15:43:09 <CameFromReddit> Specifically the bundled Contacts app.

15:45:55 <CameFromReddit> Or can I confirm that with the github link?
15:46:39 <Lia[m]1> Not sure, but that contacts app is basically what it is from aosp besides some minor string changes

19:23:50 <absynt> strcat: i might be wrong, but i think the build-instructions for webview on https://grapheneos.org/build#browser-and-webview are in the wrong order since yesterday: shouldn't the patching take place after `git checkout $VERSION`?
19:24:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> absynt: they're correct
19:25:48 <baron-digit> Hmm isnt booting at all
19:28:24 <absynt> anupritaisno1[m]: even if you built (have a checkout) of vanadium from an older release? how would i apply patches  to a newer chromium-version i did not yet checkout
19:29:24 <baron-digit86> was disconneced sorry
19:29:37 <baron-digit86> *disconnected
19:33:19 <baron-digit86> So, don't know, but I tried to start it a couple of times, nothing but black. No reaction at all. Dead and gone then?
19:40:18 <baron-digit86> If anyone has an Idea, I would really appreciate
19:42:43 <pebble2hr[m]> Will it go into recovery? Tried holding down volume and power button?
19:44:07 <baron-digit86> Nope nothing
19:44:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> baron-digit86: RMA
19:47:36 <baron-digit86> Hm ok thank you for your help
19:48:37 <TheJollyRoger> Well, guess this answers this then, flashing the wrong image on the wrong phone will hardbrick.
19:48:47 <TheJollyRoger> Cripes, that's bad luck baron-digit86 :(
19:49:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: well I'm 100% this is a bug
19:49:12 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
19:49:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> The flash should have failed
19:49:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why was it accepted?
19:50:06 <baron-digit86> It was suck at "wait for device" - it black screened while flashing
19:50:11 <baron-digit86> stuck
19:50:28 <baron-digit86> but I thought he was just rebooting
19:50:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well idk
19:50:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't want to brick mine so I'll pass on testing that
19:50:50 <baron-digit86> :-D
19:51:53 <baron-digit86> Yeah no problem, I try RMA
20:20:01 <dakotah[m]> Hahaha bricking doesn't typically sound fun
20:38:32 <Filip[m]> Hi, wanted to ask if somebody is using signal? Its really killing my battery. Like after 6 hours in background it took 30% on my pixel 4a. Is it normal?
20:44:45 <dar_gomml[m]> <Filip[m] "Hi, wanted to ask if somebody is"> yes i do. no problems with battery consumption. 5% battery consumption in 16h according to statistics..
20:45:55 <dar_gomml[m]> i took the apk from their website..
20:46:52 <msyhnk[m]> same situation for me, whatsapp doesn't eat as much
21:03:45 <dar_gomml[m]> can confirm; whatsapp used 3% in the same time, however i used signal a lot more today, even video called someone for a few minutes; so they seem to be comparable
21:04:33 <jpds> It's apparently used 1% of my battery after using for 12h
21:06:20 <Filip[m]> <dar_gomml[m] "yes i do. no problems with batte"> Thank you for your respond. I dont understand than. I also took the app from their web and no microg installed.
21:08:40 <dar_gomml[m]> same here, no microg, battery optimisation disabled, set as default sms app
21:17:57 <daeluk[m]> I dont think it's actually eating a lot of battery on my pixel 4a, but it is being reported as having been used for 12 out of 12 hours since the last full charge.
21:18:02 <daeluk[m]> Foreground usage that is
21:18:22 <jpds> daeluk[m]: That's normal, it's using a persistent websocket connection
21:19:00 <daeluk[m]> Yeah I figured something like that. Thanks for the heads up :)
21:24:39 <Filip[m]> <daeluk[m] "I dont think it's actually eatin"> Yeah but i noticed that yesterday i ended up in the evening with only 50% of battery(more than 30% took signal) and i hardly even touched the phone, no calling and only few messages. So today i went on hike,  forced quited signal and used only maps and camera and used only 9% total. So signal is eating a lot.
21:25:36 <golli[m]2> Can a app with a hidden overlay to make it always in use continue to get access to things like the microphone if it's set to "Allow only while using the app"?
21:26:27 <jpds> Filip[m]: Well, Signal has a debug log viewer in the settings
21:26:40 <jpds> Filip[m]: Check if it's doing something daft in the background
21:37:52 <Filip[m]> I dont really understand much from whats written in the log. Theres too many lines. I will try to reinstall it and just let it in background all day so i can see whats it consuption while idle. Anyway thank you all for your responds.
22:29:01 <strcat[m]> absynt: Vanadium instructions fixed again now
22:29:34 <strcat[m]> Golli: there's no such thing as a "hidden overlay"
22:30:20 <strcat[m]> unless you mean accessibility services and you should not be using accessibility services if you don't have a serious disability that necessitates trusting an app with that
22:59:41 <Lia[m]1> I cannot clone Vanadium git repo properly
23:09:07 * Lia[m]1 sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/rwRljCkvzwNBrlXNQeYmownZ/message.txt >
23:09:14 <Lia[m]1> Yet I can't see the patches
