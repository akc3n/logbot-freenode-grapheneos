00:01:15 <GlmJitter> sure thing Dolores!
00:04:14 <q22[m]> Do pixels have regional differences, like LTE bands?
00:04:48 <q22[m]> Or are they all the same no matter where i'd buy one from
00:13:57 <crabbles> has anyone set up island ?
00:14:05 <crabbles> instead of shelter?
00:16:52 <alzxjm[m]> What is good security practices around launchers? I'm sure the advice is to stick to the stock launcher if possible, but what are the risks of adding a different launcher?
00:17:32 <crabbles> check services, xml of the app with checky , classyshark
00:17:54 <crabbles> or i use appmanager from izzys repo does both
00:18:03 <strcat[m]> how is the new beta?
00:18:09 <strcat[m]> want to push it out to stable soon
00:19:41 <crabbles> would anyone know how i could replace a libh264 dependency for something less comprimising on a soip apk ?
00:22:45 <strcat[m]> ?
00:23:16 <JTL> wait what's soip?
00:23:18 <strcat[m]> hard to tell what you mean
00:23:32 <strcat[m]> and why do you need to replace a library
00:26:45 <AdventureCommuni> <strcat[m] "how is the new beta?"> I have noticed no bugs or anything
00:26:45 <AdventureCommuni> seems stable
00:26:46 <AdventureCommuni> Ive been using Spotify, newpipe, and riotx for a few hours on it now too
00:32:03 <crabbles> its a phone over ip and h264 codecs can be compromised
00:32:51 <crabbles> actually if you download snoopsnitch theres only one or two vulns on graphene ; h264 applies to the media vulnerability
00:33:24 <JTL> GrapheneOS applies security patches uptream from AOSP
00:33:29 <JTL> upstream*
00:33:59 * crabbles uploaded an image: ima_d3cd84f.jpeg (248KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZukWyyZrBVGdBqUamCZbbiFM >
00:34:31 <crabbles> inconclusive * sorry not exactly vuln but id rather not find out
00:35:04 <strcat[m]> crabbles: it doesn't say there are any vulnerabilities
00:35:10 <strcat[m]> read what it says and don't spread misinformation
00:35:13 <strcat[m]> you're really confused
00:35:20 <crabbles> ^ i corrected
00:35:38 <JTL> Fixed with October 2019 patch levels
00:35:47 <strcat[m]> what you're saying doesn't make sense
00:36:08 <strcat[m]> my suggestion is to stop trying to change stuff you're only going to make yourself less secure
00:36:50 <JTL> (cross checked those CVEs with the Android security Bulletins)
00:38:14 <strcat[m]> crabbles: also don't know why you're giving people weird security advice like alzxjm's question *shrug*
00:40:03 <crabbles> too heavy on the microdosing got me going down nonexistent rabbitholes it seems
00:40:23 <crabbles> just been trying to harden the system
00:42:34 <renlord> beta works on my end
00:47:39 <nitroneurons[m]> <crabbles "just been trying to harden the s"> graphene is already extremely hardened, no real need to tweak anything
00:52:47 <crabbles> okk thanks for correcting that ! So is that why vanadium and bromium are superior to fennec w all the  antiprismbreak addons? i was concerned about gettting fingerprinted
00:53:23 <renlord> crabbles: if you're concerned about fingerprinted, try not to stick out too much
00:53:32 <geritol[m]> <crabbles "okk thanks for correcting that !"> Firefox is very insecure
00:53:36 <renlord> and just stick to sane defaults with hardened features -- vanadium
00:53:42 <geritol[m]> Fennec is worse
00:54:06 <geritol[m]> Don't use Firefox if you value privacy or security
00:54:15 <crabbles> kk
00:55:12 <geritol[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
00:55:21 <geritol[m]> Vanadium is ideal
01:07:13 <crabbles> is there a way to add in support for the carrier if txts dont work in lte only or an alternative secure way to contact phone numbers over sms? for contacts who dont have signal
01:07:35 <strcat[m]> make them get signal
01:07:40 <jcpicard32[m]> ^^
01:07:46 <strcat[m]> LTE is not end-to-end encrypted, dunno why you would consider that secure
01:07:50 <strcat[m]> it has crappy crypto too
01:07:58 <strcat[m]> as explained in the docs that feature is for attack surface reduction nothing more
01:08:04 <jcpicard32[m]> Tell them that your service is intermittent where you live and it's the most reliable way to reach you
01:08:07 <jcpicard32[m]> That's what I've done
01:08:11 <jcpicard32[m]> It's not even incorrect
01:08:13 <strcat[m]> update to the latest release and lte only might work better
01:08:56 <crabbles> kk , i was thinking if using a soip phone would be better but idk if they ccan reach actual numbers
01:14:37 <geritol[m]> What's the recommended phone/laptop(or tablet) pairing for someone with light usage?
01:15:21 <strcat[m]> crabbles: use signal and stop coming up with weird theories
01:15:38 <geritol[m]> I was thinking Pixel 3a and Pixel Slate might be the way to go no?
01:19:53 <nitroneurons[m]> pixel 3a is great if you don't mind only have 2 years of support
01:20:17 <strcat[m]> we don't know how long devices will be supported yet
01:20:23 <strcat[m]> only the minimum guaranteed date
01:22:19 <geritol[m]> Gotcha, well I guess I'll grab a Pixel Slate and 3a then
01:22:23 <geritol[m]> Thanks
02:25:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <woot75[m] "Hello everybody!"> hello
02:29:39 <aeonsolution[m]> hi everyone
02:30:28 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: I point everyone to this link for Pixel device support questions https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en
02:30:53 <strcat[m]> just bear in mind they give a MINIMUM GUARANTEE
02:30:55 <strcat[m]> not an end of life date
02:31:10 <aeonsolution[m]> right, i'll adjust my wording
02:31:14 <strcat[m]> usually devices get at least a few extra months
02:31:30 <strcat[m]> like the original Pixels got an update 2 months after the date they stopped having a guarantee
02:31:38 <strcat[m]> and they got an extra year of major OS upgrades
02:32:11 <strcat[m]> so 1 year and 2 months extra of major OS updates, 2 months of extra sec updates
02:33:16 <strcat[m]> people shouldn't claim to know when support will be dropped - we really don't know
02:33:23 <strcat[m]> they could support a device with a whole extra year of security updates - we don't know
02:33:26 <strcat[m]> there will be a point at which new devices come up with a 4 or 5 year guarantee instead of 3
02:33:31 <strcat[m]> and then there's a good chance they do what they did with the gen 1 Pixels for major OS updates
02:33:50 <strcat[m]> and do the same thing for an older generation without the guarantee
02:34:36 <aeonsolution[m]> I will do my part to help answer these questions so you and Jolly don't have to all the time. I've seen it pop up a lot recently
02:35:07 <aeonsolution[m]> kind of a bummer people don't try to read the website or do some research to have a conversation
02:35:47 <aeonsolution[m]> so much good information on the site
02:41:29 <aeonsolution[m]> dolores0: did you ask for help on how to contribute to the project?
03:37:12 <animalchin[m]> Is there a tutorial or good posts on how to utilize the guest account? Information about what it can and can do? I have OpenVPN for Android on my main account. Would I have to install that on the guest account as well if I wanted to put my banking app on there? I know you guys have talked about this a lot. Ive skimmed through looking and want to make sure I get the full picture. Thanks
03:39:11 <animalchin[m]> Also, after I log into the guest account it makes me delete it to get back to the main account
03:41:35 <aeonsolution[m]> there isn't anyone that can answer the question in the channel right now animalchin. the only thing i could tell you is that the accounts are fully isolated from each other and that the main account acts like a systems administration account
03:42:13 <aeonsolution[m]> if you want disposable profiles, then using the guest is your best choice
03:43:29 <animalchin[m]> aeonsolution:  Thanks for chiming in. I understand that much and want to use it just want to make sure my application is solid. Thanks again.
03:46:38 <animalchin[m]> aeonsolution:  Do you know or think that purchasing a cheap Pixel 2 then flashing GOS  would be a good idea to use for Auditor? I know the updates are coming to an end I just want to us it for the auditor app. Also, can you use two different profiles to audit two different Pixels with GOS?
03:48:14 <animalchin[m]> I want to use the Pixel 2 to audit a Pixel 3a and a Pixel 4a. Does it need any updates to do its job?
03:49:55 <aeonsolution[m]> that is a really good question, as a general rule you want to make sure the devices you use for the Auditor are still receiving security patches but with that said
03:51:03 <aeonsolution[m]> at this point the Pixel 2 would be good but the last day for guaranteed support is coming in October
03:51:22 <aeonsolution[m]> Heres the link for device support: https://attestation.app/about#device-support
03:53:05 <crabbles> oouh i found some hidden settings via a shortcut manager if anyones interested;
03:53:13 <JTL> o_O what?
03:53:17 * crabbles uploaded an image: ima_f74a393.jpeg (227KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZxicGXUnQwugFwOAOzvEnMRa >
03:53:22 <animalchin[m]> Cool. So the Pixel 2 wouldn't be a good choice for checking other devices if it never sees the network? If that so I'll just buyva n acceptable Pixel 3a for the Auditor
03:53:40 <animalchin[m]> Going to check that link. Thank you
03:53:47 * crabbles uploaded an image: ima_7e79654.jpeg (230KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UYhtMNhwtmWoydKeyLqCVSLD >
03:54:18 <aeonsolution[m]> you're welcome
03:56:45 <animalchin[m]> aeonsolution: sorry but one more question. Can two devices play the role of auditor and auditee for each other?
03:57:35 <aeonsolution[m]> I've only worked with one so I'm no help there
03:58:11 <animalchin[m]> Thanks very much for the helpaeonsolution:
03:58:40 <animalchin[m]> That was honest😄
04:18:28 <animalchin[m]> Are you guys using the RiotX app on your GOS device? I noticed the permissions needed and was wondering if just logging in with Vanadium is a better choice?
04:20:12 <JTL> I don't think Riot functions well on mobile browsers
04:21:47 <animalchin[m]> Does it look better on PC? HaHa. I'm having a hard time seeing this page on my phone
04:21:59 <JTL> Yes
04:22:29 <animalchin[m]> Cool. I'll get it there
04:34:39 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: that is a minimum
04:40:37 <animalchin[m]> cn3m: did you catch the conversion that aeonsolution and I were having above? Can you add anything to that conversation?
04:41:27 <cn3m[m]> https://attestation.app/tutorial
04:43:24 <animalchin[m]> Doesn't say if two devices can audit each other or I might have missed it?
04:45:15 <animalchin[m]> Was also curious if one device could audit two devices?
04:57:09 <animalchin[m]> What I gather from reading that, a cheap Pixel 2 is fine for being the auditor even after its not supported. That good.
04:59:00 <animalchin[m]> I'm just hoping now that I can audit two devices with the Pixel 2
05:01:13 <cn3m[m]> I am not sure I can't check right
05:04:37 <animalchin[m]> No problem. I'll keep checking back for new info
05:11:10 <crabbles> does auditor have to be done on the same network?
05:11:24 <crabbles> or could we just trade qrs and verify ota
05:13:57 <animalchin[m]> crabbles: it looks like you you could  trade qr's but I would feel a little vulnerable doing that with someone who's device wasn't under my control.  Would you?
05:16:28 <animalchin[m]> Would be a pain in the arse. I'm going to order a Pixel 2 for 90 bucks and reflash all my devices and start fresh. Didn't have an auditor the first time I flashed.
05:19:04 <crabbles> sure but its just a verify check , its not like remote access. i guess maybe ip could be leaked ?
05:21:56 <animalchin[m]> I'm not that knowledgeable about the process. I will be happy though once I reflash and incorporate the Auditor.
05:22:54 <animalchin[m]> Do you know how often is recommended to recheck the autitee?
05:23:09 <animalchin[m]> Auditee^
05:37:53 <animalchin[m]> Yay! My phones updating
06:25:50 <animalchin[m]> Here's a good one by Daniel. Should became sticky. https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/g0ly0j/islandshelter_on_grapheneos/

08:19:13 <crueltekk[m]> Okay the Update for the Pixel 4 XL yesterday fixed my broken FaceUnlock. Don't know what you changed there but now it works fine :)
08:49:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Probably the security patch or the rollback index timestamp
09:39:11 <xabi[m]> Was there an extra update today appart from the one that happened yesterday?
09:39:45 <xabi[m]> my phone rebooted today 8/07 and applied system update after booting every profile
09:45:11 <dazinism> xabi: the update was announced previously, released on beta channel first, then more recently on stable
09:45:46 <dazinism> As to what happened today, or yesterday, depends where you are in the world
09:47:40 <dazinism> Pretty sure any given device will of only recieved one update
09:50:21 <dazinism> The timeline is announcement of release >some hours later beta release > some hours later stable release
09:50:30 <xabi[m]> i received an update yesterday and another one today. I m on beta channel
09:51:04 <dazinism> Mmm.. I'm on beta and have only seen one update
09:51:20 <dazinism> I'll check for another
09:51:23 <xabi[m]> system version still shows yesterdays date
09:56:44 <dazinism> xabi: my build number ends 2020.07.06.20
09:56:58 <dazinism> Im on P3 XL
09:57:59 <xabi[m]> qq3a.200705.002.2020.07.06.20,  it might be that both A and B partitions have updated? it's my first AB device
09:58:26 <dazinism> No I dont think thats it
10:01:14 <dazinism> Could you of been behind on the previous update?
10:01:22 <dazinism> xabi: https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
10:01:23 <strcat> xabi[m]: the only way that happened is if the previous update failed or you were behind a version
10:03:59 <xabi[m]> it might be previous update failing, i was low on battery around 10%, phone has updated perfectly after every update since i got it in may
10:04:18 <xabi[m]>  * it might be july update failing yesterday, i was low on battery around 10%, phone has updated perfectly after every update since i got it in may
10:05:58 <dazinism> If you definately already had the previous update then, guess it was a fail. Not sure if theres a minimum battery level when it'll attempt an update
10:06:46 <dazinism> A/B updates are pretty foolproof so not really necessary to have battery restriction
10:08:02 <dazinism> Worst case, if you lost power at a 'crucial' point in the update, the device would start fine and could just try again when its got power again
10:28:47 <randolf[m]> is it just me or is downloading the release file so slow?
10:29:26 <randolf[m]> did a speedtest, and my internet isn't the problem, I'm still getting 90Mbps, but downloading the pixel4 build is 120KB/s
10:33:30 <crueltekk[m]> Is there a way to test builds on PC like VMs?
10:35:47 <crueltekk[m]> > did a speedtest, and my internet isn't the problem, I'm still getting 90Mbps, but downloading the pixel4 build is 120KB/s
10:35:47 <crueltekk[m]> I just downloaded the .zip in about 5 Minutes so there should be no problem
10:36:28 <randolf[m]> the pixel 4 build? what speed were you getting?
10:37:20 <q22[m]> 200KB/s
10:37:36 <randolf[m]> so it's not just me then
10:37:54 <q22[m]> Europe here
10:38:00 <randolf[m]> I should be downloading at like 8MB/s but I only have 150 ish
10:39:38 <crueltekk[m]> Well than wait an Hour to get it, drink a Tee make some Yoga whatever :) At least it's not offline. Just tested to load the image and got around 1MB/s on LTE
10:40:17 <randolf[m]> I got to leave for work in 20 minutes xD
10:40:39 <randolf[m]> so I'll have to shut my PC down, and try again in 9 hours, hopefully with different results :F
10:40:59 <q22[m]> I tried different devices, 3 ISPs, VPN on/off, but no difference
10:42:59 <crueltekk[m]> > I tried different devices, 3 ISPs, VPN on/off, but no difference
10:42:59 <crueltekk[m]> Hmm and I thought Vodafone is shit :D But actually the Downstream dropped to about 200KB/s after about a Minute. Maybe because many people getting the OTA Update atm.
10:46:50 <mrxx_0[m]> Same here in Europe, really slow download speed for pixel 3a xl
10:47:29 <randolf[m]> I was thinking that may be it, today was the OTA update push, so people are probably queued for download so it doesn't overwhelm the server maybe?
10:47:32 <mrxx_0[m]> In ota of course
10:47:52 <mrxx_0[m]> Yeah maybe ?
10:48:08 <randolf[m]> I jumped to 400KB/s, but still not the 5MB minimum I hoped for
10:48:27 <mrxx_0[m]> I mean for me it's not a real problem ai can wait but I wanted to report it if this is linked to a bigger problem on the server
10:52:06 <randolf[m]> it's not for me either, but I have to leave very soon and I was hoping to get it finished before then, which sucks

11:22:26 <pikey[m]> Does anyone else have trouble with Graphene not reconnecting to bluetooth devices? I mean after you pair it, connect it, then disconnect it. Next time to you turn on BT device nearby, it should auto connect but mine doesn't. Wondering if it's a HW issue on my Pixel
11:24:51 <Mobius[m]> no issues on my end, i used to get this problem 3 updates ago
11:25:15 <Mobius[m]> do you have another device to test on ?
11:35:12 <aceace> hey, tried yesterday and i will try today again :)  for some reason Ukraine SIM cards wont work on pixel 3a XL with GrapheneOS
11:35:23 <aceace> simcards from 3 other countries work even with roaming
11:35:47 <aceace> any suggestions on how I can make the sim cards (that do work on other phones) work with graphene?
11:43:39 <pikey[m]> <aceace "any suggestions on how I can mak"> Sounds like you've tested all you need, not going to work I don't think
11:44:41 <pikey[m]> <Mobius[m] "no issues on my end, i used to g"> Hi Mobius, thanks for that. The weird thing is that the phone does auto connect to a couple sets of BT headphones I have. But one device (Parrot car kit) it doesn't auto reconnect, yet my iphone and every other phone (even an old Sony 90s phone) does reconnect to that device. Strange happenings!
12:30:41 <aceace> is there a way to submit this issue to developers?
12:30:56 <aceace> its kind of weird if entire country can't use graphene

13:43:36 <dazinism> I've been half looking for a nice clean/easy app to transfer via networking but without requiring it to leave the device, but yet to find anything.
13:44:29 <dazinism> Can use something like Nextcloud (but then the file also goes to the server)
13:45:17 <dazinism> Or use Riot - create an encrypted room with just yourself for transferring files
13:45:54 <dazinism> Then files are end to end encrypted
13:47:24 <aceace> xabi[m], they work on regular android devices and iphone, furthermre, other sims work on this phone with graphene, and last the phone was not purcahsed in this country at all.

15:17:39 <causasui[m]> hi, can anyone ELI5 or link me to a page that explains what "crosshatch" releases are? I have a Pixel 3 XL and I'm not sure which download link to use off the releases page
15:21:24 <odisaben[m]> I changed clients for here and now it says unencrypted... Did I do something or need to do something? I'm new to matrix so apologies if I am asking the wrong group. Just want to make sure I'm doing this right.
15:27:18 <pikey[m]> odisaben: this is a public room, all public rooms are unencrypted (i think) as no point in encryption here. if you open a direct chat with someone it should be encrypted if you have your settings set up. nothing to worry about. Clients now just make it clear (they didn't before) that you know you're speaking in unencrypted space
15:28:10 <pikey[m]> <causasui[m] "hi, can anyone ELI5 or link me t"> crosshatch is just one of the names of android releases for the Pixel. Google (i think) makes up the names and Graphene replicates them for each OS to match the device with same OS name given by Google. That's my understanding anyway. Either way, you just choose the latest GOS release for your device.

15:29:56 <pikey[m]> <thelearner[m] "pikey: https://freenode.logbot.i"> thanks. never seen freenode before. blush :)
15:30:26 <pikey[m]> > <@rpdelaney:matrix.org> hi, can anyone ELI5 or link me to a page that explains what "crosshatch" releases are? I have a Pixel 3 XL and I'm not sure which download link to use off the releases page
15:30:27 <pikey[m]>  * crosshatch is just one of the names of android releases for the Pixel. Google (i think) makes up the names and Graphene replicates them for each OS to match the device with same OS name given by Google. That's my understanding anyway. Either way, you just choose the latest GOS release for your device from the releases page.
15:32:29 <Damio[m]> Question: used graphene os before on pixel 2xl. Now I own a pixel 4 Does the pixel 4 build support face unlock? If not you van only use a pin because there's no fingerprint reader on the pixel 4.
15:33:21 <pikey[m]> <Damio[m] "Question: used graphene os befor"> I am not sure but I think so, think I heard a discussion about that a few days ago
15:35:01 <pikey[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/?ch=grapheneos&q=face+unlock - looks like it does work yes
15:35:28 <Damio[m]> > > <@Damio:matrix.org> Question: used graphene os before on pixel 2xl. Now I own a pixel 4 Does the pixel 4 build support face unlock? If not you van only use a pin because there's no fingerprint reader on the pixel 4.
15:35:28 <Damio[m]> > I am not sure but I think so, think I heard a discussion about that a few days ago
15:35:28 <Damio[m]> Thnx, Will do some scrolling 😉
15:35:30 <pikey[m]> damn that freenode is one handy ass link1
15:35:33 <pikey[m]>  * damn that freenode is one handy ass link!
15:35:34 <pikey[m]>  * damn that freenode is one handy ass link!
15:37:30 <Damio[m]> <pikey[m] "https://freenode.logbot.info/?ch"> That's fast 👍😂
15:38:33 <pikey[m]> hehe
15:39:21 <dallemon[m]> Damio: i have not had any issues with face unlock.
15:39:50 <pikey[m]> maybe damio isn't quite as pretty as you dally. :D
15:40:24 <dallemon[m]> <pikey[m] "maybe damio isn't quite as prett"> Haha
15:44:56 <dazinism> yxcvbnmlp: just tried out lws - lightweight web server
15:45:15 <dazinism> Works for transferring files between profiles
15:45:33 <dazinism> Even when device is in n airplane mode
15:46:32 <dazinism> I guess any app running on the device, with network permission, could snag the files if it were looking out for them
15:46:59 <dazinism> lws works without storage permission, which is nice
15:47:33 <dazinism> lWS (lightweight Web Server (lWS)) - https://f-droid.org/app/net.basov.lws.fdroid
15:48:15 <odisaben[m]> pikey: thanks for the explanation
15:49:52 <pikey[m]> is Aurora Store generally considered safe to use on Graphene? (I want to install Magic Earth)
15:51:08 <dallemon[m]> pikey: just for some clarification. freenode is the irc network that the grapheneos channel exists on. matrix has a bridge connection to the freenode irc network. the link you were refering is to logbot, which is set to log all the chat from this irc channel, among many others.
15:51:58 <pikey[m]> aah, thanks
15:52:38 <dallemon[m]> pikey: i would like to think that aurora store is the best way to get apps from the play store
15:53:30 <dallemon[m]> but the anonnymous accounts can periodically be quite unstable
15:54:10 <pikey[m]> thanks, i wouldn't normally want any apps from playstore. just need a better satnav app and someone recommended magic earth which does look good. Am I right in thinking I am not interacting with google if I use Aurora store? I will likely install it, grab the app I want, then uninstall aurora. if that wouldnt break the magic earth app?
15:54:50 <dallemon[m]> it wont break anything, but you will not be able to update it until you reinstall aurora
15:59:18 <nickcalyx[m]> Aurora downloads the apps directly from the play store AFAIK
16:03:19 <causasui[m]> You might want to use tor in conjunction with Aurora then, I'd think
16:10:09 <pikey[m]> thanks. Tor is an idea although i dont have orbot or tor on my pixel yet, permanent VPN though
16:11:05 <pikey[m]> so aurora store in fdroid is all i need?
16:25:02 <pikey[m]> well magic earth looked good, but wont work! just keeps saying mobile data is turned off. but it isn't! on to the next idea!
16:55:26 <nickcalyx[m]> Magic earth is a great app I must admit. If only it was open source
16:57:54 <pikey[m]> yes it looked it
16:58:44 <alicebobandeve[m> Hey, do you guys avoid watching Netflix on your phones?
16:59:29 <causasui[m]> Is using a rooted device discouraged?
17:02:38 <jcpicard32[m]> <causasui[m] "Is using a rooted device discour"> Yes. You'll defeat the entire purpose of installing GrapheneOS and ruin the security model.
17:05:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> Depends on your threat model
17:06:46 <causasui[m]> Seems like I have to connect to the internet to turn on OEM unlocking...?
17:08:03 <jcpicard32[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Depends on your threat model"> Not really. There's a reason every security researcher recommends against root. It's because you lose far more from the broken security features than you could possibly gain from a few new apps, most of which are privacy/security theater
17:08:12 <pikey[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Magic earth is a great app I mus"> if you know of any runners up to Magic Earth I would be grateful for some ideas to try. Open source ideally but at this point not essential
17:08:43 <pikey[m]> <causasui[m] "Seems like I have to connect to "> i dont think you should have to do that. unless youre on pixel 4 and thats new
17:09:03 <jcpicard32[m]> I had to connect to do it on my 3a
17:09:17 <jcpicard32[m]> It's not a huge deal tbh
17:09:40 <causasui[m]> I just get an internet connection and it should be an option? OR do I have to finish "Pixel Setup" ?
17:10:23 <causasui[m]> There we go
17:10:54 <jcpicard32[m]> You should be able to as soon as you connect to the internet iirc
17:11:21 <causasui[m]> It took a couple minutes is all
17:11:21 <pikey[m]> i did 3a and 3 without any internet until long after it was all installed
17:11:28 <pikey[m]> weird
17:12:53 <causasui[m]> Is it possible to use TWRP or nandroid with a locked bootloader?
17:14:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not on grapheneos
17:16:41 <hypokeimenon[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "Not really. There's a reason eve"> Right, sorry I was referring to the use of Netflix on your personal phone. I was not talking about rooting your phone.
17:17:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> <causasui[m] "Is it possible to use TWRP or na"> TWRP requires permissive selinux. Setting selinux to permissive is not possible on grapheneos
17:17:14 <jcpicard32[m]> Oh sorry I misunderstood :3
17:17:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you flash it you might brick your device and need to reflash grapheneos
17:17:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> So be careful
17:17:44 <jcpicard32[m]>  * hypokeimenon: Oh sorry I misunderstood :3
17:17:55 <causasui[m]> Ok, is it possible to create nandroid backups or similar? I'm considering how to protect my device during border crossings and may want to factory reset
17:18:07 <hypokeimenon[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "Oh sorry I misunderstood :3"> Nah, just another reason for me to dream of threads on Riot.
17:18:31 <jcpicard32[m]> causasui: You should be able to use Seedvault that's built to create a backup and restore it later
17:18:44 <jcpicard32[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Nah, just another reason for me "> Amen
17:20:00 <causasui[m]> Writing 'system_a'                                 OKAY [  2.709s]

17:25:03 <causasui[m]> That seems to have gone better. I have a GrapheneOS logo after re-locking the bootloader and rebooting
17:26:48 <causasui[m]> Looks like I'm in business. Thanks everyone who chimed in to help.
17:31:23 <jcpicard32[m]> No problem. We're here if you have any questions :)
17:34:57 <jcpicard32[m]> <alicebobandeve[m "Hey, do you guys avoid watching "> I watch on my iPad
17:35:44 <jcpicard32[m]> Although tbf part of that is so I don't distract myself during the day
17:39:26 <causasui[m]> Just noticed it looks as if orbot hasn't been updated in more than 4 years. Surely that's not because it's perfect? Is there something newer / preferred?
17:43:05 <causasui[m]> It's just not getting updated in fdroid actually. Argh
17:43:16 <jcpicard32[m]> causasui: Is this the version from Aurora Store or the version from The Guardian Project repo?
17:43:43 <causasui[m]> F-droid repo, I am trying to live without play services
17:43:51 <causasui[m]> We'll see how far I get...
17:47:14 <fomijafi[m]> The guardian project repo updated orbot 1 month ago
17:48:23 <causasui[m]> Yeah, I see that now that I enabled the guardian project repo in fdroid. Odd that such an ancient version is still in the fdroid main repo
17:58:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> causasui: use the unstable versions
17:58:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> For me the stable ones don't even connect me to tor

18:13:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Coral/flame
18:14:09 <crueltekk[m]> Would test the build :)
18:14:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can even just enroll for the official betas and report bugs

18:14:59 <crueltekk[m]> > You can even just enroll for the official betas and report bugs
18:14:59 <crueltekk[m]> Im still in Beta Channel but not on R :)
18:15:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> crueltekk: just enable the beta option
18:15:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Get the beta builds
18:15:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Report anything that feels out of place
18:15:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> And report fast
18:17:55 <pikey[m]> didn't know about beta builds. i could do that too, i have no dev knowledge at all so didn't think i could be much use but i could def do that, if i was able to make reports properly. is it via github?
18:19:21 <schismxl[m]> I think I'd like to get on that, too. I just bought a Pixel 4 XL purely for GrapheneOS. Seeing as the project aligns with my beliefs, I'd like to contribute somehow.
18:19:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
18:19:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or just go around shouting bug in my pm until I notice
18:20:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Beta builds
18:20:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Watch out for any breakages
18:20:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Report them fast
18:20:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can help in design stuff, write documentation or maybe help in bootanimation too
18:20:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a bunch of stuff that doesn't need coding
18:20:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> But equally important
18:21:59 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Or just go around shouting bug i"> hahaha
18:22:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> And if none of that
18:22:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can sponsor Daniel on github
18:22:40 <cdesai> aeonsolution[m]: for R for android-prepare-vendor, you can just try running it with the latest R beta build, and see if it works / errors out
18:22:47 <pikey[m]> yep. i have plans there, waiting for something else to pan out then i had a suggestion to put to him but thats for later.
18:23:12 <cdesai> some files would have been moved / removed so file missing errors are expected and can be fixed by removing it from the bottom on $device/config.json inside it
18:23:24 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "You can help in design stuff, wr"> there's an idea. i have virtually zero tech knowledge but i did wonder if in some weird way that could be a useful trait if only in editing or writing info for users as dumb as myself :p
18:23:25 <cdesai> if it works apart from that great, if not report bugs to AOSPAlliance and we can get it done
18:24:09 <pikey[m]> i will do it and when i find my first bug i will ask how best to report it. never used github or these other things but will get on it when have a need
18:24:15 <pikey[m]> thanks, will change my settings tonight
18:42:25 <q22[m]> Is there a list of things non-devs could do to contribute?

18:59:27 <q22[m]> Fair enough
19:18:33 <SchismXL[m]> Whilst that is true for the most part, low level translations shouldn't be much of a problem. High level direct transfer might be more difficult, though.
20:33:25 <linuxcrypt> Has anyone had issues with Verizon wifi calling? I took the SIM form my iphone 11 pro max, and put it into my Graphene pixel 3a xl. Works fine on regular verizon network. When I don't have a verizon signal and try to use WiFi-Calling it says it can't connect to mobile network.  I put the SIM back into my ihpone and wifi calling works fine.
20:33:48 <linuxcrypt> I called Verizon to ask if there was anything being blocked on their end and told them what was doing and they said it shouldn't be a problem
20:48:04 <neonfuz2> does graphene have TTS? it didn't work with osm and for me
20:52:13 <Tony48> Hi
20:53:38 <Tony48> I have an issue to connect to the hidden wifi hot spot.
20:54:28 <dazinism> neonfuz: theres no TTS included. Can get voice in OSMand by going Download maps>, (at the bottom) Voice prompts recorded, and downloading a language
20:57:03 <neonfuz2> thanks
20:58:32 <dazinism> neonfuz: then configure profile > navigation settings > voice prompts > voice guidance
20:59:18 <dazinism> Set it to the language you just downloaded, it'll probably be at the bottom (not one of the TTS languages)
21:07:54 <SchismXL[m]> > I have an issue to connect to the hidden wifi hot spot.
21:07:54 <SchismXL[m]> Tony48, I know its a long shot, but have you tried connecting to it when it isn't hidden, and/or have you restarted the hidden hotspot? Are all the IP addresses, gateway, and DNS set up correctly?
21:14:57 <Tony48> Thanks SchismXL, I already tried what you suggested, when the network is not hidden is fine, but if I leave hidden ( it is a must) the phone cannot connect
21:23:12 <SchismXL[m]> No worries. If you go to Advanced Options and scroll down, I believe there's a Hidden Network toggle. If that is set to no, set it to yes and hope for the best. I'm not currently running GrapheneOS, but I think that setting is standard for Android devices. If not, my advice finishes there lol
21:27:42 <dolores0[m]> ah I just had to deal with hidden wifi!
21:27:57 <dolores0[m]> follow schisms advise

21:33:45 <SchismXL[m]> Double team, dolores0 💪🏻
21:33:50 <dolores0[m]> I had to figure this out literally last night
21:34:33 <Tony48> as I am new with grapheneos, I have another silly question
21:34:37 <dolores0[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Double team, dolores0 💪🏻"> 🦾
21:35:26 <Tony48> At the moment I have setup the keyboard with 3 languages, 1) english, 2)french 3)Italian.
21:36:47 <Tony48> When I write any message or email the keyboard doesn't switch automatically ( not a big deal) but the "system" mark in red all the words not in english?
21:37:57 <Tony48> is there any wait the the phone recognise all the languages with any keyboard switch or red errors?
21:38:08 <Tony48> Thanks in advance :)
21:40:03 <SchismXL[m]> I had this problem on LineageOS. I use Spanish and English, but the Spanish would always show a red line. What I did was go to the System > Languages & Input > Languages and select all the localisations you want (not the keyboard).
21:42:20 <SchismXL[m]> But, you've got to select the language you're  currently writing in on the keyboard. As you said, no biggie.
21:44:08 <Tony48> On Languages & Input -> Language I have all the 3 languages
21:45:36 <SchismXL[m]> And on the keyboard, are you selecting the language you want at the time? I'm typing this now, but if I switch to Spanish, it messes up

21:48:08 <Tony48> I see... that fine, I will survive with that... Nice keyboard how did you make it dark?
21:48:14 <SchismXL[m]> But, as I said, I'm not running GrapheneOS, so my advice may not be 100%. Waiting on the Pixel 4 XL delivery, then I'll be on it
21:48:16 <crueltekk[m]> > And on the keyboard, are you selecting the language you want at the time? I'm typing this now, but if I switch to Spanish, it messes up
21:48:16 <crueltekk[m]> You wouldnt get rid of it cause the spellcheck is made in the language selected by the keyboard. It swaps the dictionary as soon as you swap languages
21:48:53 <SchismXL[m]> Yeah, that's right
21:49:23 <SchismXL[m]> I'm using OpenBoard from F-Droid :)

21:53:08 <SchismXL[m]> But seriously, how is the camera? Lol
21:53:49 <crueltekk[m]> Could send you some images made with open camera so you can compare. For me it's okay and does it's job.
21:54:36 <SchismXL[m]> Sure, only nudes though
21:54:39 <SchismXL[m]> Haha
