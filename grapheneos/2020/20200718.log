01:53:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Strcat you sure faggotson is Donaldson sockpuppet?
01:53:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well his name is already raising a lot of concerns
02:00:20 <strcat[m]> don't need 4chan trolls here
02:00:53 <strcat[m]> banning based off the name
02:00:54 <strcat[m]> don't know what he said
02:01:17 <strcat[m]> other than the tail end of it which looks to me like the usual concern trolling
02:02:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "banning based off the name"> Hey it was funny okay?
02:03:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk why I kinda start launching when I see that name
02:04:00 <zxwayland> i need help to install the graphene os lol
02:04:05 <zxwayland> i just got a new pixel 3a
02:04:19 <strcat[m]> problematic that deleting messages doesn't delete the name of the person who sent it
02:05:03 <cdesai> they never made it to irc
02:09:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> zxwayland: okay how do you need help
02:09:16 <strcat[m]> cdesai: yeah the bridge is very broken
02:14:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> zxwayland:
02:14:20 <zxwayland> i am not sure how to install it
02:14:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Have you read the FAQ?
02:14:49 <zxwayland> i just downloaded the images and updated the lastest android
02:15:29 <overheadscallop[> Did you try following the official install guide? https://grapheneos.org/install
02:15:32 <overheadscallop[> and what OS are you using
02:16:27 <zxwayland> on my computer?
02:16:47 <overheadscallop[> yes, on the pc you plan to use to install GrapheneOS on the phone
02:17:17 <zxwayland> Debian 10
02:20:08 <overheadscallop[> Ok, which step of the official install guide are you stuck on?
02:20:10 <zxwayland>  uncertain too - which GrapheneOS relies upon.
02:20:11 <zxwayland> What do you think of closing the distance between GrapheneOS and LineageOS? It seems LineageOS should be able to do almost everything GrapheneOS does... Is there a way to get the best of both? Of course it seems Pixels have some additional hardware security...
02:20:18 <zxwayland> ops sorry
02:20:51 <overheadscallop[> Is someone already helping you through PM?
02:20:59 <overheadscallop[> I don't want to get you mixed up
02:21:15 <zxwayland> no, i was on a website
02:23:54 <zxwayland> Next, add the tools to your PATH in the current shell so they can be used without referencing them by file path, enabling usage by the flashing script.
02:23:57 <zxwayland> On Linux and macOS:
02:23:59 <zxwayland> export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
02:24:07 <zxwayland> I am not sure what that means
02:24:39 <overheadscallop[> What's the directory you downloaded and extracted the platform tools to?
02:24:50 <overheadscallop[> it should be something like /home/user/Download/platform-tools
02:25:16 <zxwayland> /home/kenny/plantform-tools
02:25:51 <overheadscallop[> add that to your path, export PATH="/home/kenny/platform-tools:$PATH"
02:25:56 <overheadscallop[> in the terminal
02:26:02 <overheadscallop[> and type fastboot --version
02:26:10 <overheadscallop[> paste the result in irc
02:27:44 <zxwayland> fastboot --version
02:27:44 <zxwayland> fastboot version 30.0.3-6597393
02:27:48 <zxwayland> Installed as /home/kenny/platform-tools/fastboot
02:27:55 <overheadscallop[> ok that's good
02:28:21 <overheadscallop[> next you want to go to https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules and download the 51-android.rules file
02:28:42 <overheadscallop[> then run sudo cp -v 51-android.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
02:29:10 <overheadscallop[> then follow the guide again after doing that
02:29:15 <overheadscallop[> let me know if you have any problems
02:30:19 <overheadscallop[> right, after running the sudo cp command you need to do
02:30:20 <overheadscallop[> sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
02:30:20 <overheadscallop[> sudo service udev restart
02:31:05 <zxwayland> i need to install git
02:31:30 <overheadscallop[> You can download the raw file from https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/raw/master/51-android.rules
02:31:52 <overheadscallop[> or copy it from the browser and make a new file with the contents

02:39:28 <overheadscallop[> should be: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git
02:39:29 <zxwayland> i already did
02:39:48 <overheadscallop[> ok exactly where did it go wrong
02:39:54 <overheadscallop[> which line
02:40:16 <zxwayland> sudo cp -v 51-android.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
02:40:50 <overheadscallop[> What's the failure message?
02:41:31 <zxwayland> nothing
02:41:43 <zxwayland> do i just leave it there?
02:46:36 <zxwayland> i think i missed a step
02:46:46 <overheadscallop[> sorry, riot is acting up for me
02:47:13 <overheadscallop[> So you cloned the git repository into /home/kenny/android-udev-rules/
02:47:42 <overheadscallop[> did the `cd android-udev-rules` command

06:30:09 <sixBit[m]> Is Graphene supporting the Always On Display?
06:31:26 <aeonsolution[m]> yes, but there might be an upstream issue with the Pixel 4

06:32:41 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] yes, but there might be an upstream issue with the Pixel 4 family
07:02:02 <sixBit[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "yes, but there might be an upstr"> I see. Thanks for the info!
08:24:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: BTW isn't vendor security patch an aosp flag?
09:01:55 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: yes! Along with many other flags
09:02:07 <cdesai> What lineage does is also add it for older and show it in the ui
09:02:16 <cdesai> A lot of flags are stored on all partitions now
09:02:19 <cdesai> Like fingerprint
09:03:02 <cdesai> Getprop and you'll see ro.system, ro.vendor. and since we build everything together and matching they'll all be the same
09:03:37 <cdesai> some of those are also checked in frameworks/base and a dialog is shown on mismatch, which is patched out on other ROMs due to obvious reasons
09:04:04 <theultron[m]> Where is the boot partition in android? Can I access it via file manager with root access?
09:12:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: can you send me a build of microg without the org.microg.....FORCE_COARSE_LOCATION permission?
09:12:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just remove it from the permission list
09:13:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> theultron: /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/boot_{a,b}
09:17:05 <theultron[m]> anupritaisno1:
09:17:57 <theultron[m]> anupritaisno1: I mounted and created a file in /vendor called a.txt. File got created but it does not show in any file manager. Any idea why it is not showing in file manager?
09:18:25 <theultron[m]>  * anupritaisno1: I mounted and created a file in /vendor called a.txt. File got created but it does not show in any file manager. Any idea why it is not showing in file manager? File Manager have root access.
09:18:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> theultron: you can't mount partitions rw on grapheneos
09:19:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos sets the same flags as the stock ROM
09:23:25 <theultron[m]> Ah okay. I am not on GrapheneOS. I am on MIUI with root access. Sorry for asking this here but I thought I will get the proper response here. So is the vendor partition can't be mounted in rw mode? I am actually trying to create something like verified boot by comparing files for modification.
09:23:56 <theultron[m]> I read on the android site that Verified boot verifies these partition (boot partition and other verified partitions including system, vendor, and optionally oem partitions.)
09:25:06 <theultron[m]> I am trying to understand if my phone gets infected where can the malware reside in/go to.
09:28:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> theultron: verity can detect even a single bit misplaced
09:29:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> And in most cases verity can correct the fault for you
09:29:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> About 16MB of data is recoverable from a 2 GB partition
09:30:21 <theultron[m]> Okay. My phone don't allow me to relock bootloader with a custom recovery/rom. So verified boot is disabled on my phone afaik.
09:30:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Verified boot is independent of bootloader state
09:31:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Locking the bootloader enforces secure boot
09:34:01 <theultron[m]> I see. It won't notify me of modifications on boot screen?

09:35:05 <theultron[m]>  * I see. Will it notify me of modifications on boot screen even with unlocked bootloader? Sorry. I have a limited understanding of this.
09:43:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> theultron: no
09:43:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> It will crash on error
09:44:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> On oneplus you're taken to a crashdump mode with the message "dm-verity device corrupted"
09:44:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Other devices will probably keep looping
09:45:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixels I haven't tried tripping verity on purpose yet
09:46:06 <broda721[m]> Are there special settings you should setup to get bromite to work? I keep getting name_not_resolved errors. Its a fresh GOS on Pixel 3a. Private DNS set to automatic. Same results with 'off'.
09:46:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> broda721: disable secure DNS, known issue
09:46:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Settings > privacy > secure DNS
09:46:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tell bromite to fix it
09:48:49 <broda721[m]> Hmm i do not have that setting, my privacy tab only has permission manager, toggle for show passwords and option menu for lock screen notifications
09:49:23 <broda721[m]> Or am i overlooking something
09:49:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
09:50:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Bromite settings
09:50:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not system settings
09:50:08 <broda721[m]> Ooh, my bad haha
09:50:14 <broda721[m]> Thank you
09:55:45 <g65434-2[m]> or simply use vanadium with private dns
09:55:53 <g65434-2[m]> problem solved 🤔
10:34:08 <renlord> strcat[m]: did you see my messages?
10:35:35 <sixBit[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Tell bromite to fix it"> They did fix it already IIRC.
10:36:23 <sixBit[m]> Yep 84.0.4147.95 fixed the DNS issue.

12:21:57 <elpy111> @nikoleos[m] those are the system certificates. is there any under the other (user) tab?

12:54:14 <vThor> Is there any way to set se linux in permissive mode on a production build with open booloader? O do I need to build again a userdebug image?
13:35:09 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes
13:35:19 <strcat[m]> renlord: do you know which commit is wrong
13:35:21 <strcat[m]> let me see
13:36:04 <strcat[m]> vThor: you can only do that in userdebug builds and with a kernel that has been built with a different configuration than what we use for production
13:36:13 <strcat[m]> vThor: you would need to enable SELinux development support in the kernel
13:36:37 <strcat[m]> I'd suggest not doing that and just fixing the actual problem you have via audit messages
13:52:38 <f8sai[m]> Testing.
13:52:54 <f8sai[m]> (Why can't I see some messages)
14:28:41 <tootz[m]> strcat: Ren here. Question is if mprotect is viable for N pages + 1 dangling byte? And then PAGESIZE - 1 bytes are mapped as no write.
14:30:06 <tootz[m]> Or when passed with a non page aligned stack size the correct behaviour is to always align so mprotect will map read write in multiples of PAGESIZE also
14:30:38 <vThor> strcat, heck, I let building a userdebug while I went out. So I can stop it with 28%. But to test if it is working I need to compile each time an make an ota or flash again, right?
14:34:31 <vThor> the audit messages from se linux contain all avc, right? that means the "E/TorNativeLoader: /data/app/org.torproject.android-RM6u9aLWGwT21aKV-wp2mQ==/lib/arm64/libobfs4proxy.so: open failed: EACCES (Permission denied)" is not from se linux, also right?
14:36:15 <vThor> se linux message looks like that, or: W/project.android: type=1400 audit(0.0:947): avc: granted { execute } for name="tor" dev="dm-6" ino=2055 scontext=u:r:untrusted_app_27:s0:c66,c256,c512,c768 tcontext=u:object_r:app_data_file:s0:c66,c256,c512,c768 tclass=file
14:38:19 <vThor> the weird thing is that this error happens in the emulator (API 29 w/o google API) on the device (sargo) with my grapheneos, calyxos, but not with stock android 10, nor with emulator (API 29 with google API).
14:39:01 <vThor> And I need to figure out the reason to fix that.
14:46:10 <cdesai> vThor: emulator should be userdebug already, you should be able to get adb root
14:52:50 <vThor> cdesai cool hint, will try that
14:57:18 <vThor> okay, it's not se linux causing it :/
15:04:51 <vThor> thank you for now, I could figure out that there is the folder but not the binary :/ but what's the difference between aosp(w/o google api) and stock(with google api), anybody aware of an pure aosp build for sargo to test this also (although I think it's the same result)?
15:14:45 <xnat834[m]> > > <@xnat834:matrix.org> There is a part (https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking) where I'd like to find more sources on. I thought the code running on the baseband is not open-source and Android can only ask it to do something. Or have there been reverse-engineering projects for the modems in Pixel phones? Or maybe a data transmission test with a cellular femtocell or what they are called.
15:14:45 <xnat834[m]> > https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/cjjyd4/graphene_os/evdv0h8/
15:14:45 <xnat834[m]> I read all the sources now. If a proper hardware target is picked and the baseband can't just access the Android OS in any unwanted way, how can one be sure that the baseband, for example, actually turns off if the OS can only send it a command? The firmware is closed-source. On the other hand, cutting the power should definitely turn it off. Simple physics usually wins vs. informatics, I would think.
15:15:55 <xnat834[m]> The sources only talk about the baseband accessing the OS, not what the baseband is doing itself while being powered...
15:36:28 <f8sai[m]> Element seems to be buggy
15:36:30 <renlord> strcat[m]: i dont know if what i did was wrong.
15:36:33 <f8sai[m]> I can't see recent messages
15:36:53 <renlord> i just counted the static tls address from btm to top, whereas upstream calculated it top to btm
15:38:03 <renlord> and if you calculate it from btm to top, since stack size was not multiples of PAGE_SIZE, when you pass in that address to mprotect, it fails.
15:41:13 <renlord> look at how static_tls was calculated differently in c37491423e379bc2e4b3fa6c98f893253fb4ff52
16:09:06 <zugzwang[m]> .
16:27:19 <strcat[m]> renlord: if the mprotect address is not page aligned it'll break
16:27:30 <strcat[m]> non-page-aligned end is fine (it just rounds) but start must be page aligned
16:27:32 <strcat[m]> that's probably why
16:29:44 <strcat[m]> renlord: can you test if the first 2 commits alone work
16:29:50 <strcat[m]> I need to know which commit to add this into
16:31:33 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_bionic/commits/10 so can you test with the most recent 2 commits reverted
16:31:54 <strcat[m]> so only adding the guard page + moving pthread_internal_t but without rand
16:32:06 <strcat[m]> renlord: I just want to make sure this alignment is only needed for secondary stack rand
16:32:10 <strcat[m]> so we can make it part of that patch
16:33:55 <strcat> renlord: mprotect always protects multiples of pages - if you pass 1 page + 1 byte, it does 2 pages
16:34:02 <strcat> renlord: but the INITIAL address has to be page aligned
16:34:05 <strcat> because it works with pages
17:06:03 <faxing[m]> Does using Shelter to contain some less privacy respecting applications (Steam because I need the Steam Authenticator now) reduce the security of the whole device in any way?
17:06:22 <faxing[m]> The app just has Google Firebase but iirc thats still enough to try to sandbox it as much as possible
17:06:51 <faxing[m]> It's from Aurora but they have an apk as well, assuming it still has the Firebase integration though
17:15:11 <Th0mas_> I don't know about shelter, but I use a yubikey, which has support for generating the tokens without steam authenticator: https://github.com/Yubico/yubioath-desktop/issues/72
17:15:27 <Th0mas_> there might be other apps capable of doing the same in software
17:17:21 <DannyWorkOrderP4> <Th0mas_ "there might be other apps capabl"> any OTP app, unless I'm misunderstanding
17:19:18 <Th0mas_> Steam authenticator does some weird things and has 5 char alphanumeric OATH tokens
17:20:56 <g65434-2[m]> i think GOG has the same token length
17:47:45 <faxing[m]> No, you need steam authenticator to approve large trades
17:48:00 <faxing[m]> you can't just use a normal authenticator for that
17:48:30 <faxing[m]> for account 2fa you might be able to use something like that but my concern is with accepting trades
17:48:44 <faxing[m]>  * for account 2fa you might be able to use something like that but my concern is with accepting trades which can only be done from the official app
18:06:32 <vThor> :/ a userdebug build I flash simply the *.img files in out/target/product?
18:53:18 <Th0mas_> Is there a way to disable the Network permission for apps by default? Or ask on first start?
18:54:56 <JTL> iirc there's no formal way for applications to "ask" for the network permission so that's why it's enabled by default
18:55:35 <Th0mas_> ah too bad. ty

19:55:59 <greenmoon[m]> Faxing you can use any 2fa app for steam
19:56:09 <greenmoon[m]> You don't need to use their one
19:59:40 <faxing[m]> To authenticate trades you do need theirs
19:59:45 <greenmoon[m]> Oh wait it look like u can't use random ones,  it's a special totp format. But i use keeTray plugin for keepass and this one is compatible with steam
20:00:42 <greenmoon[m]> I use the windows app to validate trades the mobile app is too slow to validate one per one

20:02:46 <greenmoon[m]> Its useless cards Worth's only cents its a waste of time
20:02:57 <faxing[m]> hm?
20:03:20 <g65434-2[m]> what's the point of leveling besides for flexing
20:03:30 <faxing[m]> profile customization
20:05:17 <g65434-2[m]> you can do it level 0
20:05:40 <faxing[m]> you get more profile customization the more you level up, though
