00:32:23 <cn3m[m]> s0me1: my advice would be to jump in
00:32:35 <cn3m[m]> there is work on going with the AOSP_Alliance to get Pixel 4a up and running
00:32:57 <cn3m[m]> that is pretty much the first prerequisite(also Pixel 4 support for Android 11)
00:35:23 <ahowell8[m]> Hey all, I've had GrapheneOS installed on my Pixel 2XL since launch ... I just realized that contacts are now circles and home icons are squared circles. How can I change everything to squared circles? I thought it used to be under dev options themes?
00:42:25 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS uses circles
00:42:31 <strcat[m]> you probably changed the launcher icon shape
00:43:03 <strcat[m]> changing it elsewhere relies on overlay features not compatible with exec spawning since no one has ported that feature to work another way
00:43:19 <ahowell8[m]> I did long time ago... unsure how to change it back. ok, that makes sense.
00:48:57 <ahowell8[m]> Thanks strcat. So when I upgrade, which will be soon, circle is the only option for GrapheneOS atm?
01:28:30 <strcat[m]> doesn't have to do with upgrading
01:28:35 <strcat[m]> we set the OS value to a circle mask
01:28:40 <strcat[m]> have done that since the start
01:56:08 <TodorokiShto[m]> Bruh I'm watching Rob Braxman's rant and he's talking about madaidan. 's critics lmao
02:42:46 <howdoIchangeuser> His voice is really chill to sleep to. He cured my insomnia
02:43:49 <TodorokiShto[m]> Tbh I think you guys are too harsh on him ðŸ˜‚ he does make some good points on his videos
05:38:53 * lickidyspl1t[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/dqneDVEYtOccwurISZAoJNyP/message.txt >
09:38:23 <hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3> Is it possible to get push notifications to Applications to work on Graphene OS by installing MicroG? There is an application that alerts me to users on a website wanting to chat. I test the push notifications and they fail. I have Graphene OS but haven't investigated MicroG.
09:43:33 <jpds> hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3: It's not at all possible to install microg on graphene
09:44:25 <hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3> Thank you jpds
10:04:05 <inrdrna[m]> if you want microg you can try calyoxs
10:58:55 <lickidyspl1t[m]> If I want to backup my keepass file, what's a good tool for doing so? Maybe something with a simple email login? ( don't say google drive XD )
11:00:39 <jpds> lickidyspl1t[m]: I use syncthing.net
11:01:15 <null[m]1> <lickidyspl1t[m] "If I want to backup my keepass f"> The securest option would be to, I dunno back it up to a homeserver or NAS? You could setup nextcloud, syncthing or literally just rsync or sftp it to the server.
11:03:14 <null[m]1> That's how I'd do it, anyways.
11:05:43 <alzxjm[m]> <lickidyspl1t[m] "If I want to backup my keepass f"> I mean even Google Drive would be fine. Keepass database is encrypted. Google Drive has very, very reliable uptime.
12:09:28 <dazinism> hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3: depends how the chat is set up. If its some kind of forum, maybe there will be an RSS feed & you could get notifications via a RSS reader. Or maybe  this may work? https://f-droid.org/packages/com.bernaferrari.changedetection
12:10:40 <dazinism> Not sure if you'd get notifications as quick as you may like/need from either of these options.
13:14:48 <strcat[m]> going to be publishing Android 11 Alpha updates for certain devices soon for early testing
13:22:13 <derpy> funny how signal is a go-to, but when installing it it says: "this device is missing google play services... blah blah"
13:22:25 <derpy> I trust telegram more than signal... Considering Snowden is obvious controlled op
13:24:25 <qt_pie[m]> You realize telegram also had issues right? telegram stores your data on their servers. it's whatsapp with a foss client.
13:26:10 <qt_pie[m]> has*
13:28:29 <null[m]1> I don't see how this is relevant to GOS.
13:28:30 <null[m]1> But you trust a closed-source server, roll-your-own crypto messenger over one that's completely open source with a proven cryptographic algorithm?
13:29:42 <qt_pie[m]> null are you defending telegram or signal?
13:30:18 <louipc>  yea better to discuss the merits of chat protocols elsewhere
13:30:26 <derpy> of course I realize there's that aspect - you can always do secret chat
13:30:37 <null[m]1> Signal
13:30:54 <derpy> At least it doesn't complain about not having google
13:31:25 <null[m]1> FWIW i do agree Signal isn't perfect.
13:31:25 <null[m]1> But I definitely think it's better than telegram
13:32:03 <blacklight447[m]> <derpy "At least it doesn't complain abo"> Neither does signal
13:32:17 <derpy> just posted because I just installed on GOS and it did
13:32:22 <derpy> I installed signal from signal.org
13:32:37 <blacklight447[m]> <derpy "I trust telegram more than signa"> Get out with that conspirital bs
13:33:12 <qt_pie[m]> >  yea better to discuss the merits of chat protocols elsewhere
13:33:12 <qt_pie[m]> Sorry, damn. Just thought that trusting tele for the reason that it's got an optional feature was pretentious and that it should be pointed out.
13:33:21 <blacklight447[m]> <derpy "just posted because I just insta"> Notifying users that notifications work less well then normal once when you intially install an app is not complaining
13:35:12 <qt_pie[m]> Also does anyone here know how feasable it would be to make a fork of microG without signature spoofing? (of course with less supported features) Like how long would it realistically take a dev with 1 year java experience?
13:35:25 <derpy> Imagine calling someone in GOS chat a conspiracy theorist :P
13:35:36 <qt_pie[m]> 1 year? 2?
13:35:50 <derpy> I don't see why signal notifications should work less well without google play services
13:36:22 <derpy> qt_pie[m] i think dev estimates are very hard - and the fewer devs the harder the estimate
13:37:03 <null[m]1> <derpy "Imagine calling someone in GOS c"> Imagine spreading (mis)information based on no evidence in a GOS chat.
13:37:11 <blacklight447[m]> <qt_pie[m] "Also does anyone here know how f"> Depends, make it work, make it work reliablly, make it work securely?
13:37:13 <blacklight447[m]> <qt_pie[m] "Also does anyone here know how f"> Kinda depends a lot on what you see as workong
13:38:06 <qt_pie[m]> <derpy "I don't see why signal notificat"> because google play services has a push notification feature that doesnt require the device to check for messages with it's own CPU and battery life, its seriously a shortcomming and the foss community needs to work together to make some equivelant software.
13:38:24 <derpy> It isn't misinformation that signal complains about not having google
13:38:28 <strcat[m]> Signal has an essentially equivalent implementation already
13:38:37 <strcat[m]> it complains but it's just as reliable without it
13:38:48 <strcat[m]> just uses more power because Signal's implementation is not particularly optimized
13:38:50 <derpy> Exactly, I see no reason why it wouldn't work just as well.
13:38:53 <qt_pie[m]> blacklight447: yes securley.
13:38:56 <strcat[m]> it does work as well
13:39:00 <strcat[m]> and when FCM goes down it still works
13:39:07 <strcat[m]> it is more reliable
13:39:11 <strcat[m]> since if the Signal server goes down you don't have messages anyway
13:39:11 <derpy> Also signal works like whatsapp in terms of restoring backups... have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get them working
13:39:14 <qt_pie[m]> if work as well you mean drain your battery
13:39:49 <derpy> I still find it strange that even in GOS chat calling snowden controlled opposition gets one the "conspiracy theorist" title
13:39:58 <qt_pie[m]> <derpy "Also signal works like whatsapp "> signal is end to end, telegram is not. like telegram has access to your messages
13:40:01 <derpy> I thought it was obvious to all researchers now
13:40:11 <derpy> qt_pie[m] I do realize that
13:40:15 <null[m]1> qt_pie maybe have a look at this;  https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
13:40:15 <null[m]1> Reimplements part of the API only for gcam
13:40:29 <qt_pie[m]> null: I saw that today it inspired me
13:40:39 <blacklight447[m]> <derpy "I still find it strange that eve"> Because it is
13:41:05 <qt_pie[m]> derpy: dude snowden is not some puppet, dude had his life ruined to blow the whistle.
13:41:18 <alzxjm[m]> <qt_pie[m] "Also does anyone here know how f"> This is off-topic for GrapheneOS. But the point of microG is to present to other apps as Google Play Services. I don't think it can accomplish this without signature spoofing.
13:41:30 <V0inmygym[m]> off topoc lads
13:41:42 <V0inmygym[m]> * off topic lads
13:41:43 <blacklight447[m]> Being in a chat with people interested in a security focused android distro does not change the fact that its conspirital bullcrap
13:41:53 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: it can be accomplished without opening such a blatant security hole by only allowing it to spoof the Play services signatures (nothing else) and not allowing any other apps to possibly gain the ability to do that
13:41:57 <null[m]1> Even if he were a puppet, this isn't the place to mention or discuss this.
13:42:16 <strcat[m]> it's by choice that they do it in a way with such a negative impact on security and reflects on other decisions in the project
13:42:21 <alzxjm[m]> <strcat[m] "alzxjm: it can be accomplished w"> It's my understanding that CalyxOS implements microG in this way.
13:42:24 <qt_pie[m]> why is discussing something I plan to make for Graphene OS off topic?
13:42:42 <qt_pie[m]> alzxjm: it doesn't tho
13:42:48 <strcat[m]> also please no conspiracies about Snowden who is one of the people who made it possible for GrapheneOS to continue existing after the takeover attempt
13:43:50 <strcat[m]> people can say such nasty stuff about someone they don't know and don't even know much about since they just read BS instead of actual facts/history
13:44:34 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "also please no conspiracies abou"> ^^^^
13:44:41 <qt_pie[m]> strcat: wait there was a take over event? when?
13:44:59 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/#history
13:45:10 <strcat[m]> that is a quick summary
13:45:19 <strcat[m]> you can find more information elsewhere
13:46:31 <null[m]1> There was a reddit post that explains it iirc
13:53:42 <qt_pie[m]> strcat dam I actually believed in some of the lies that the copperhead os devs were spouting
13:54:05 <qt_pie[m]> I thought that graphene was based on copperhead but it was the other way around.
13:55:22 <Lallero> hellaphone
13:55:26 <strcat> I created the project in 2014
13:55:30 <Lallero> was
13:55:31 <Lallero> good
13:55:33 <strcat> Copperhead was not founded as a company until late 2015
13:55:45 <strcat> and I never turned over ownership/control of anything to them
13:55:49 <strcat> it remained my open source project
13:55:55 <alzxjm[m]> qt_pie: It can be hard to know who to trust. For me, is it the guy who is selling something or is it the guy who seems to be an incredibly knowledgeable and dedicated security researcher working insane hours to give community-supported project away for free? Why would Daniel Micay lie?
13:56:07 <strcat> they CHOSE not to bother with creating a fork rather than just reusing my releases
13:56:47 <strcat> it was suggested by me that the company create a proprietary fork because I wasn't going to make decisions based on the project based on the company's needs
13:56:49 <strcat> anyway
13:57:07 <strcat> ultimately they decided to try forcefully taking over the project through threats, coercion and manipulation
13:57:13 <strcat> and when I say they I mean James Donaldson
13:57:22 <qt_pie[m]> alzxjm: the thing is I didn't distrust micay, I just didnt know where else the info was.
13:57:24 <Lia[m]> <alzxjm[m] "qt_pie: It can be hard to know w"> Usually, the product dictates for itself.
13:57:25 <qt_pie[m]> Lallero: hai
13:57:29 <strcat> who is a highly manipulative narcissistic sociopath
13:57:30 <Lia[m]> Vanadium is nearly finished, should I regenerate a signature?
13:57:32 <qt_pie[m]> Also does anyone else get notification tones looping in newpipe or OsmAnd
13:57:39 <strcat> and if you talk to him at all you'll realize that real quick if you aren't easily duped
13:57:45 <Lallero> hai
13:57:48 <qt_pie[m]> its on pixel 3
13:59:50 <Lia[m]> Not sure, maybe if it's on "alerting" notifications, it is not too far-fetched to happen
14:00:22 <Lia[m]> <Lia[m] "Vanadium is nearly finished, sho"> On building
14:03:12 <Lia[m]> It got interrupted (again) and complained about "premature end of life; recovering"
14:03:35 <qt_pie[m]> yeah it does that, it treats the video playback notification like a never ending stream of text messages.
14:03:54 <qt_pie[m]> is this a known bug? and how can I know whether its the OS or the App?
14:04:02 <Lia[m]> <qt_pie[m] "is this a known bug? and how can"> I can't tell, but a VPN does a noisy notification every time it connects/disconnects
14:04:04 <Lia[m]> Put it on silent I guess?
14:04:10 <qt_pie[m]> I did, It just doesn't do that on AOSP, so maybe theres a way I can write some nice code that will stop that.
14:07:42 <qt_pie[m]> Lia: watchu doing to vanadium?
14:08:33 <Lia[m]> Building it as a test, then attempt to port some Bromite patches soon, if this build is successful
14:10:55 <Lia[m]> I am still figuring out how to rebase and update Chromium base
14:11:27 <qt_pie[m]> Wait so what kinda patches are you porting?
14:11:34 <Lia[m]> not yet though
14:12:18 <Lia[m]> It's a plan for now, since I'm like completely new in the world of git. I'll try always-incognito mode toggle first
14:13:04 <Lia[m]> So no guarantees
14:13:52 <null[m]1> Bromite has that.
14:13:52 <null[m]1> Might be able to port it over
14:13:54 <null[m]1> ...or is that exactly what you're doing? Lol
14:14:16 <qt_pie[m]> are you gonna make a pull request?
14:14:23 <Lia[m]> If it works
14:14:35 <Lia[m]> For now, unlikely
14:14:59 <qt_pie[m]> fingers crossed, would be willing to help
14:15:19 <qt_pie[m]> lmk ^_^
14:18:29 <Lia[m]> Thanks, not sure if I'd get it right
14:18:42 <Lia[m]> (And probably a bad idea to announce it here too)
14:28:29 <shwag> I've read everything I can on the history of new releases, etc., and still cannot decide whether to get a 4a and live with it until a release or buy a previous version
14:30:27 <qt_pie[m]> tbh pixel 3 is very nice, and battery should be better. at least you can run what you want on it. Also never tie your google account to your IMEI, because you basically need a google account unless you flash another rom on it.
14:30:53 <qt_pie[m]> also if you plan on doing that put a sim card in after google cannot gather data from the OS
14:36:04 <strcat[m]> you can just remove the Google account in the stock OS
14:36:19 <strcat[m]> there is "Factory Reset Protection" (anti-theft feature)
14:36:35 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#anti-theft
14:36:54 <strcat[m]> it uses a data storage area that persists through a factory reset to store a token tying it to the connected Google account
14:37:03 <null[m]1> <shwag "I've read everything I can on th"> Personally I'm waiting for the 4a GOS release.
14:37:04 <strcat[m]> and then it will require you to login on a fresh boot of the stock OS
14:37:13 <null[m]1> * Personally I'm waiting for the 4a GOS release.
14:37:13 <null[m]1> I intend to use the beta builds and give feedback.
14:37:25 <qt_pie[m]> im saying dont login period
14:37:32 <strcat[m]> that combined with OEM unlocking toggle within the OS (which is also gated on verification with the Google account as a 2nd layer of enforcement) is how they enforce this
14:37:33 <strcat[m]> sure
14:37:43 <strcat[m]> it's best to just skip setup and turn on oem unlocking
14:37:47 <strcat[m]> but it really doesn't matter much
14:38:00 <strcat[m]> if GrapheneOS wanted it could wipe the factory reset protection data
14:38:01 <strcat[m]> where the Google account token would be
14:38:03 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really matter
14:38:11 <strcat[m]> it's unused in GrapheneOS and only accessible to the core OS
14:38:23 <strcat[m]> on a Pixel the Titan M provides the API for this
14:38:36 <qt_pie[m]> possible to use it for something else?
14:38:45 <strcat[m]> provides a small persistent data section for the OS to use for anti-theft protection
14:38:50 <strcat[m]> we could implement our own anti-theft feature it's just not really useful
14:39:08 <strcat[m]> i.e. allow configuring a passphrase that's asked after factory reset to continue into the OS
14:39:21 <strcat[m]> don't see a point in doing it
14:56:27 <shwag> So many interesting replies so quickly! So in summary strcat[m] just go ahead and use 4a as normal until a release?
15:03:20 <alzxjm[m]> shwag: You could disable Google apps in the meantime.
15:13:42 <strcat> shwag: wasn't really replying to you
15:23:55 <qt_pie[m]> Theres no guarantee micay will work on more devices tho
15:24:07 <qt_pie[m]> thats just not guaranteed
15:28:51 <shwag> Of course
15:30:56 <qt_pie[m]> I wouldn't just buy a phone before its supported is all I'm saying
15:42:13 <strcat[m]> qt_pie: I'm not maintaining *any* new devices
15:42:22 <strcat[m]> I'm not the only person working on the project and I am not doing device maintenance for any new devices
15:42:30 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 and 4 XL were added because they have a device maintainer that's not me
15:42:41 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a will never be added unless a device maintenance team steps up
15:42:50 <strcat[m]> so far no one has even started on it
15:43:30 <strcat[m]> it will not be added unless someone starts on it, gets the work done and commits to long-term support
15:43:40 <strcat[m]> ideally more than 1 person
15:43:41 <strcat[m]> people need to stop assuming that others are always going to do the work without them being involved
15:43:43 <strcat[m]> it doesn't work that way, it's an open source project, if you want something start working on it or getting resources for someone else to do it
15:43:49 <strcat[m]> I've been very clear about this
15:44:15 <strcat[m]> I intend to maintain 0 devices, that's not my role
15:44:16 <qt_pie[m]> there you go folks. dont expect anything.
15:45:04 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 / 2 XL / 3 / 3 XL / 3a / 3a XL don't have maintainers and that situation is unacceptable
15:45:19 <strcat[m]> we won't add devices without a dedicated maintenance team anymore
15:45:25 <strcat[m]> otherwise people never step up to do it
15:46:03 <strcat[m]> right now people are just relying on me being overburdened with this work because they don't think I will drop the devices due to lack of maintainers
15:46:13 <strcat[m]> not going to add a device hoping to find maintainers later anymore
15:46:15 <strcat[m]> doesn't work
15:46:45 <strcat[m]> those past devices are to some extent grandfathered in but may still be dropped at any point due to lack of maintainers
15:46:57 <strcat[m]> don't want to hear any complaints if we drop Pixel 2 or Pixel 3 next month for example
15:47:07 <strcat[m]> there has been no maintainer from the start, it has been repeatedly brought up
15:47:17 <strcat[m]> 4 and 4 XL are the ONLY devices with a maintainer
15:47:36 <strcat[m]> those are the ONLY devices with someone actually dedicated to working on them and resolving issues
15:47:44 <strcat[m]> and keeping them supported
15:47:45 <strcat[m]> so bear that in mind
15:47:59 <strcat[m]> and don't assume that the 4a, 5 or 5 XL will become supported because the same setup will be expected for those
15:48:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Somebody summoned the pixel 4 maintainer?
15:48:24 <anupritaisno1[m]>  /s
15:48:28 <strcat[m]> and we're not receiving enough donations to get proper hardware for developers while covering costs like legal fees due to ongoing attacks on the project
15:48:34 <qt_pie[m]> Youtube search bar "how to be maintainer"
15:48:43 <strcat[m]> need to fund developers + get them phones + get them workstations
15:48:50 <strcat[m]> + have substantial other ongoing costs
15:50:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW xl doesn't have a maintainer
15:50:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> 4 xl maintainer is largely inactive
15:50:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are issues on the 4xl like the screen flicker issue that have gone unresolved for 3+ months
15:51:24 <Autopsy[m]> Thought you were it tbh
15:51:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Autopsy](https://matrix.to/#/@autopsy:privacytools.io): pixel 4 only
15:52:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also I had to blindly do the pixel 3 R bringup because nobody was willing to do it
15:52:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you are running one of the betas you're running something I made with 0 testing on pixel 3
15:53:16 <qt_pie[m]> anupritaisno1: strcat all jokes aside how can I help maintain those devices I would be willing to learn.
15:53:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> [qt_pie](https://matrix.to/#/@qt_pie:the-apothecary.club): by doing it
15:53:58 <qt_pie[m]> dope rom would be nice to have something to flew at a job interveiw. where would I get started?
15:54:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> <qt_pie[m] "dope rom would be nice to have s"> By doing it
15:54:42 <qt_pie[m]> okok I get but Like actually what to I need to know?
15:55:03 <Lia[m]> grapheneos.org/build may help
15:55:50 <alzxjm[m]> qt_pie: i'm looking into buying/building a machine that can build grapheneOS. Buy a device for testing (it should not be your daily driver) and commit to testing it and helping fix stuff. I think building GrapheneOS and flashing it to a device is going to be my first step.
15:56:20 <alzxjm[m]> https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/GrapheneOS-Shopping-List.md looks like a good resource
15:56:51 <alzxjm[m]> The whole repo, really.
15:57:22 <alzxjm[m]> I'm not super sure what the ongoing work of a device maintainer is but I figure if I learn how to build and flash it and start testing I'll learn as I go.
15:58:54 <qt_pie[m]> I have pixel 3 and everything to build willing to throw an entire summer to learn about how to maintain it. but I'm 1 year into CS. I'm willing to learn. But idk what the project entails
15:59:23 <qt_pie[m]> and if i can actually build i can commit to being a maintainer.
15:59:37 <alzxjm[m]> I've donated (small amounts) to this project and to Calyx, too. Which everyone should do if they can afford it.
15:59:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> <qt_pie[m] "and if i can actually build i ca"> No
15:59:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyone can build
15:59:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can you fix issues?
16:00:34 <alzxjm[m]> I don't know what the stats are but if it's anything like public radio or other community-supported projects it's probably like 1% of GrapheneOS users donate anything and if every single user donated like $5/mo it would go a long way to covering legal fees.
16:02:13 <alzxjm[m]> Not that I'm familiar with what the expenses of the project are.
16:02:14 <trismous[m]> Could the devs include i.e. Monero?
16:02:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> [trismous](https://matrix.to/#/@trismous:nitro.chat): why monero?
16:02:57 <trismous[m]> Some people may have problems with Bitcoin and PayPal for not being anonymous.
16:03:33 <alzxjm[m]> Daniel Micay prefers Bitcoin, I believe.
16:03:49 <alzxjm[m]> trismous: Maybe you can email the project and ask for a mailing address? You could send cash?
16:03:57 <trismous[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "[trismous](https://matrix.to/#/@"> IIRC Monero is the industry standard for anonymous crypto.
16:04:00 <trismous[m]> Encrypted blockchain etc.
16:04:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> [trismous](https://matrix.to/#/@trismous:nitro.chat): exchange monero for BTC and use a new BTC address every time
16:04:39 <Lia[m]> <shwag "So many interesting replies so q"> Or use CalyxOS, or try building GrapheneOS in 4a too, if you have the PC resources
16:05:03 <trismous[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "[trismous](https://matrix.to/#/@"> You're right.
16:06:24 <qt_pie[m]> Like I wanna do something to help
16:06:25 <qt_pie[m]> ofc but buy build I mean get it to run & bug fix. but I would be learning along the way.
16:06:54 <trismous[m]> <alzxjm[m] "trismous: Maybe you can email th"> That could be also possibility for people. I'm not a user. I'm just a person whom is interested in secure software etc. My main point was maybe offering more donate options could theoretically increase the amount of users donating to the project.
16:07:21 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200917-213644_Exodus.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/IsGJvFUYtJaExlmzTKgxyzJn/Screenshot_20200917-213644_Exodus.png >
16:07:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW why are monero addresses so large
16:07:39 <Lia[m]> <trismous[m] "IIRC Monero is the industry stan"> xmr.to
16:07:39 <qt_pie[m]> anupritaisno1: I could try I would be learning along the way, and honestly
16:07:49 <qt_pie[m]> anupritaisno1: stealth adresses
16:08:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> You literally can't even paste them on a website without overflowing the page
16:08:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> So essentially we'll need a copy button to make sure people get the address right
16:08:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise they'll be sending monero into the void
16:08:55 <qt_pie[m]> I mean you wanna always copy paste for that reason anyway.
16:10:06 <trentuncatchable> Could I also suggest some sort of response when a donation is received?  The lack of any indication after my donation raised concerns for me.  Did the donation go through,etc?
16:11:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> [trentuncatchable](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_trentuncatchable:matrix.org): a conformation would violate anonymity
16:11:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> * [trentuncatchable](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_trentuncatchable:matrix.org): a confirmation would violate anonymity
16:11:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> However if you're sending rather large amounts
16:12:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can try checking the transaction ID
16:12:14 <trentuncatchable> Two thoughts - Make confirmation optional during the donation process and explain that as part of the donation process.  Just a thought.
16:13:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> [trentuncatchable](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_trentuncatchable:matrix.org): and how do you confirm crypto donations?
16:13:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> It can take up to a week for crypto transactions to show up
16:13:40 <qt_pie[m]> anupritaisno1: you do so via block explorer and leave a fee with it
16:13:55 <qt_pie[m]> like a good fee so it arrives in a day or less
16:14:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <qt_pie[m] "like a good fee so it arrives in"> Read the donation guide
16:14:31 <qt_pie[m]> rn its like $3 to get it in the next block ~10min
16:14:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Recommended you get a low fee
16:14:40 <trismous[m]> Or you just wait the week
16:14:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> <trismous[m] "Or you just wait the week"> Yes but most people lack the patience
16:15:25 <trentuncatchable> Fair enough - I'm just suggesting options for those who want it.  I was not/am not looking for anonymity in associating with this product but I can accept others are.  Just trying to suggest possible improvements to communications.
16:15:42 <trentuncatchable> project - not product
16:16:49 <qt_pie[m]> I understand, however due to volume it could be stuck in the mempool for a month
16:19:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW the workstation and devices stuff is serious
16:19:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> I am unable to buy pixel devices even if I wanted to
16:19:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-5-india-1144087/
16:20:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> So somebody actually has to ship them to me
16:20:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> And the customs tax is almost the price of the phone itself
16:20:53 <djee737ejdd[m]> I have missed several alarms and timers since last update. Nobody else experience this?
16:21:35 <djee737ejdd[m]> strcat sorry for bothering, but is this an know issue?
16:22:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> So if you want more device support
16:23:01 <strcat[m]> djee737ejdd: no it's not a known issue and may be a configuration problem on your device
16:23:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Donate enough to grapheneos so that at least I could get the devices
16:23:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise pixel 4 will be the only one I can maintain
16:23:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because it's the only one I have
16:24:00 <djee737ejdd[m]> <strcat[m] "djee737ejdd: no it's not a known"> Will try a factory reset and see if it still happens. But only happens every few days
16:24:24 <djee737ejdd[m]> Will report back if it continues
16:24:37 <shwag> I wish I had the technical expertise to work on a project like this, for now will have to do with donating what little I can and spreading word about the project. I didn't mean to come in here acting like I had any expectations or anything, js.
16:29:43 <qt_pie[m]> anupritaisno1: If I had money, I have lots of time and a pixel 3, what do you do before you make a build I never used git, our teacher never taught us. I'm looking at git and I see pixel 3 I found the build documentation, where do I pull the latest version of graphene.
16:30:25 <qt_pie[m]> like when micay makes a change to graphene where can I find it, to add to the pixel 3 repo
16:31:00 <strcat> the build documentation covers that
16:31:06 <strcat> also again I'm not the only person who works on GrapheneOS
16:32:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> <qt_pie[m] "anupritaisno1: If I had money, I"> Sorry but
16:32:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm already full time on grapheneos
16:32:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I'm already showing one guy around
16:33:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Csmt be spending time showing 2 people around
16:33:22 <qt_pie[m]> I understand. I know it's a lot of work.
16:33:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Can't be spending time showing 2 people around
16:33:38 <qt_pie[m]> I wish I could help in some way
16:33:49 <qt_pie[m]> I'm poor college student
16:36:41 <qt_pie[m]> even if its a beta testing I would switch to the channel and check the critical stuff
16:37:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then do that
16:38:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> No matter what I say there's a high chance it won't help
16:39:29 <qt_pie[m]> is the XDA rom making guide a good place to start?
16:39:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it's going to be minimum of at least a year before you can actually do much
16:40:41 <qt_pie[m]> should I just be reading the commits and testing changes?
16:40:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've been doing this for 6 years now
16:41:42 <qt_pie[m]> were you on xda at some point?
16:41:51 <qt_pie[m]> is that how you learned?
16:42:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> I learned out of pure hate tbh
16:42:52 <qt_pie[m]> for google XD?
16:42:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've been in several development communities
16:43:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've seen shit that is beyond imaginable
16:43:31 <qt_pie[m]> Like?
16:43:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are ROMs on XDA faking security patches
16:44:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Some recoveries like orangefox are basically malware
16:44:28 <qt_pie[m]> yikes, thats gross
16:44:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are ROMs with security vulnerabilities that haven't been fixed 6 years after I reported those
16:45:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> That is XDA in a nutshell
16:45:34 <Lia[m]> XDA is a hot mess
16:45:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos is actually pretty good
16:46:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a very huge focus on getting things right
16:46:06 <qt_pie[m]> I've been using it for a year I know its solid I wanna give back.
16:46:12 <itflk[m]> hey folks, sorry to interrupt. the latest update on my pixel 3a is failing to install. is this a known issue? is doing a factory reset my only option?
16:46:27 <Lia[m]> Yeah
16:46:44 <Lia[m]> <itflk[m] "hey folks, sorry to interrupt. t"> Read grapheneos.org/releases
16:47:26 <qt_pie[m]> anupritaisno1: why do you think stuff has gotten this bad on xda?
16:47:27 <strcat> itflk[m]: were you using the Beta channel?
16:47:35 <strcat> you should probably switch to Stable from now on
16:47:36 <Lia[m]> TLDR, just deny it several times to roll back to failed beta then wait fot Android 11 releases
16:47:39 <strcat> read the latest release notes
16:47:44 <itflk[m]> <strcat "itflk: were you using the Beta c"> i was yes
16:48:01 <strcat> itflk[m]: yeah so the PREVIOUS release had an issue that will prevent upgrading without a factory reset to a future Android 10 release
16:48:03 <strcat> like the final one
16:48:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well I just hated the dev community for this garbage I saw on XDA
16:48:14 <Lia[m]> > <@itflk:matrix.org> hey folks, sorry to interrupt. the latest update on my pixel 3a is failing to install. is this a known issue? is doing a factory reset my only option?
16:48:14 <Lia[m]>  * https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.11.14
16:48:23 <strcat> you need to either accept the factory reset or reject it several times to roll back to the cancelled beta
16:48:27 <strcat> and then wait for Android 11 GrapheneOS
16:48:29 <strcat> coming soon
16:48:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> So [qt_pie](https://matrix.to/#/@qt_pie:the-apothecary.club) I was like screw it all
16:49:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll make my own ROM and all that
16:49:18 <Lia[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Well I just hated the dev commun"> Been on that mess too, felt like there was no standards at all in XDA
16:49:52 <Lia[m]> Not a dev, but I kinda witnessed the culture there
16:50:16 <itflk[m]> <strcat "you need to either accept the fa"> hey folks, sorry to interrupt. the latest update on my pixel 3a is failing to install. is this a known issue? is doing a factory reset my only option? would it be ok to switch to stable release channel in update settings? or is that not recommended?
16:50:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Lia[m] "Been on that mess too, felt like"> Oh and that behavior like developers are gods
16:50:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> They're not

16:50:49 <Lia[m]> <itflk[m] "hey folks, sorry to interrupt. t"> Wait, you didn't see my last message, but yes it is a known issue
16:50:56 <itflk[m]> sorry weird ctrl+V issue lol
16:51:07 <Lia[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.11.14
16:51:17 <qt_pie[m]> any more roms you wanna throw shade at? which ones are the worst. and I've seen the developer praising, its because most people are just running fastboot flash.
16:51:39 <Lia[m]> LineageOS /jk
16:51:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well back then I heard of copperheados
16:51:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Decided to look at the source
16:52:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> This was way before the lawsuit btw
16:52:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> And there was strcat
16:52:46 <Lia[m]> <itflk[m] "sorry weird ctrl+V issue lol"> Anyways, you can deny the factory reset several times and it will rollback to previous beta release. Better wait for stable Android 11 and disable the updater until then
16:53:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well I knew him by thestinger back then and no he didn't know me
16:53:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> I just wanted to see what copperheados was about
16:54:00 <strcat[m]> itflk: you should just be using the stable channel
16:54:07 <strcat[m]> but it's not going to resolve that you already got this problematic beta release
16:54:11 <strcat[m]> you need to read the release notes
16:54:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sadly I was too young back then to even comprehend what Daniel was doing
16:54:25 <strcat[m]> don't use beta if you aren't prepared to deal with things like that
16:54:42 <strcat[m]> soon Android 11 GrapheneOS will go out to beta likely with many issues that we still need to resolve
16:54:52 <strcat[m]> using Beta is a way to help test unstable code and report issues
16:55:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I definitely couldn't get AOSP on my device at that time
16:55:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> I took lineage, the only decent ROM available to me and started porting copperhead patches
16:55:44 <strcat[m]> we don't have a huge userbase and development where we could split things up further into stable/beta/alpha/testing
16:55:48 <strcat[m]> instead of just stable/beta/testing
16:55:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Somewhere down the road glassrom was born
16:56:00 <strcat[m]> one public testing channel (beta) is as good as it gets
16:56:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> And now I somehow find myself developing the very ROM I wanted to try 6 years ago
16:56:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Quite the small world eh
16:56:46 <hjagsdasd767asd7> #1 :  hi, how to force all traffic trough tor by default `?  #2 Where is the boot animation located, is it just generated by code?
16:56:58 <itflk[m]> gotcha. thanks Lia and strcat you've been a big help
16:57:08 <qt_pie[m]>  what should I do if I wanna teach my self to be a goood contributer to graphene.
16:57:10 <hjagsdasd767asd7> #1 can iptables be modified on build by default to only enable tor traffic?
16:57:12 <qt_pie[m]> anupritaisno1:
16:57:28 <strcat[m]> hjagsdasd767asd7: you don't need to modify anything to do that just use Orbot's VPN service
16:57:31 <strcat[m]> that's a built-in feature
16:57:53 <strcat[m]> that's what VPN services provide, forcing all traffic to be routed through an app
16:58:34 <strcat[m]> set it as always on VPN and turn on blocking connections
16:58:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> <qt_pie[m] "anupritaisno1: "> ?
16:58:48 <strcat[m]> next release has a fix for the upstream bug with this when switching between user profiles too

16:59:27 <hjagsdasd767asd7> thx, and where is the bootanimation? can i just add a zip file and it will use that one?
16:59:39 <strcat[m]> hjagsdasd767asd7: standard place
16:59:48 <strcat[m]> just have to add one

17:36:23 <strcat[m]> build guide should be fully updated for Android 11 now
17:36:46 <strcat[m]> main change is that we switched to using otatools-package for our signing script instead of ad-hoc usage of the source tree
17:37:31 <strcat[m]> so if you sign in a different environment you also don't need to copy the whole source tree and build output there anymore

18:06:23 <vartaa[m]> Hi, i have a question. I update my pixel 3a to android 11. Is there a problem if i install the lastest grapheneOS release, which is android 10?
18:12:44 <Seplx[m]> Is GOS not caf?
18:13:21 <cn3m[m]> vartaa: from my understanding that is what you are supposed to do if you want to switch
18:13:31 <cn3m[m]> Seplx: it is built straight from AOSP with the hardening patch set
18:14:08 <alzxjm[m]> Seplx: what is "caf"

18:14:45 <Seplx[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Seplx: what is "caf""> Codeaurora Forums. Basically AOSP for snapdragons
18:15:56 <cn3m[m]> <Seplx[m] "Iirc the Mi A2 was considered to"> Yes, but AOSP is far far easier to run on Android One than anything else
18:16:22 <vartaa[m]> <cn3m[m] "vartaa: from my understanding th"> Ok, thanks :)
18:17:16 <Seplx[m]> <cn3m[m] "Yes, but AOSP is far far easier "> Wouldn't it be too complicated to get AOSP to get to work on the a2 without caf?
18:19:06 <cn3m[m]> <Seplx[m] "Wouldn't it be too complicated t"> I could be wrong, but the only instructions for CalyxOS are for AOSP
18:19:07 <cn3m[m]> I don
18:19:27 <cn3m[m]> don't want to ping any of those guys as they might be busy
18:20:35 <strcat> vartaa[m]: you're expected to have the latest release of the stock OS to use the official instructions
18:20:49 <strcat> it's recommended to update (not required, but recommended as a best practice)
18:22:33 <qt_pie[m]> if build is the same as aosp try iy
18:23:24 <Seplx[m]> <cn3m[m] "I could be wrong, but the only i"> It seems like they put all of the caf stuff to the device trees instead of the rom source. They even have some lineage stuff in there. https://gitlab.com/calyxos/device_xiaomi_sdm660-common/-/tree/android10/overlay-lineage
18:23:52 <cn3m[m]> Seplx: oh thanks

18:24:46 <cn3m[m]> looks like it struggles with GSIs
18:24:51 <cn3m[m]> which is not a good sign
18:25:21 <Seplx[m]> <Seplx[m] "It seems like they put all of th"> The lineage stuff is just for the dialer app and the camera app. And a really small overlay file
18:30:56 <Seplx[m]> <Seplx[m] "It seems like they put all of th"> And actually no, the lineage sdm660 tree seems populated like the calyx one too
18:34:55 <Seplx[m]> And just a simple search revealed that calyx has a bit of caf too. https://gitlab.com/calyxos?utf8=âœ“&filter=Caf
18:56:52 <dexlibre[m]> How can I use public WiFi securely? Is a VPN enough?
18:58:28 <cn3m[m]> dexlibre: please read the WiFi privacy section
18:58:40 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
19:41:54 <pheonix3082[m]> I'm having an issue with my SMS app. Messages that are sent, I receive. But the notification sound isn't being triggered. I've checked settings and haven't managed to find out what the issue is
19:44:33 <s0me1[m]> Once AOSP Alliance finishes there part of working on the 4a  i'm willing to donate $299 so the dev can buy a phone..I'm also willing to throw my hat in the ring for a maintainer. I'm a linux engineer & have no experience on the inner workings of android (besides messing with adb) so we will see how much I can help..
19:45:52 <cdesai> AOSP Alliance bits for Android 10 for 4a are already done
19:46:00 <cdesai> 11 is WiP, but that's the same for other devices too.
19:47:46 <cn3m[m]> good work guys
19:55:04 <gnubahn[m]>  Can someone help me set up vanadium to go through orbot?
20:01:13 <seepiol[m]> Guys if i go to settings>battery>battery usage i see an application called "-5" which uses the 6% of the battery. What is it? Is something related to graphene os or should I start to worry? In the application list there isn't and it persists after a reboot
20:16:20 <strcat> gnubahn[m]: you set up orbot as a VPN service and all apps go through it, or a specific list if you choose to do it that way
20:16:24 <strcat> it's not something you set up in the apps
20:16:46 <strcat> it's far better to rely on the OS forcing traffic through the VPN service than configuring an app to use a proxy, which it could screw up
20:17:24 <strcat> and you should really just send everything via the same VPN service instead of trying to choose since that's prone to leaks (like one app making a request through another via mutual consent)
20:17:36 <strcat> read our documentation on this stuff and past posts about it here and on reddit
20:30:14 <dexlibre[m]> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/usage#wif"> Thank you!
20:31:18 <seepiol[m]> > Guys if i go to settings>battery>battery usage i see an application called "-5" which uses the 6% of the battery. What is it? Is something related to graphene os or should I start to worry? In the application list there isn't and it persists after a reboot
20:31:18 <seepiol[m]> Any ideas?
20:41:05 <strcat[m]> not all system apps have sensible names
20:41:14 <strcat[m]> since they aren't meant to be user-facing
20:41:21 <strcat[m]> you're getting worried about nothing
20:42:23 <strcat[m]> it isn't in the application list because you aren't enabling showing system apps
20:43:19 <strcat[m]> if you show system apps you'll see it
20:43:27 <strcat[m]> look at the app id rather than the user-facing name
20:43:39 <strcat[m]> don't know why they didn't give it a sensible user-facing name
20:44:08 <strcat[m]> but in general system apps are not user-facing, that seems like an exception, it should perhaps just show it via a generic name

20:49:31 <kelownagirl[m]> Or do I have to download a different zip file for stock android instead of using the ota zip file I already have?
20:49:31 <kelownagirl[m]> Only asking cause Iâ€™m on limited monthly data home internet plan and every GB counts ðŸ˜ž
20:56:18 <seepiol[m]> > if you show system apps you'll see it
20:56:19 <seepiol[m]> Nope, even if I show system apps there isn't anything like that
20:57:06 <strcat[m]> kelownagirl: same process as installing GrapheneOS but use the stock factory images instead
20:57:16 <strcat[m]> OTAs are not involved in either
20:58:43 <kelownagirl[m]> <strcat[m] "OTAs are not involved in either"> Okay... thank you.
20:58:58 <strcat[m]> yes and follow the same instructions, locking after you're finished
20:59:14 <strcat[m]> the only extra bit is that clear avb_custom_key command to wipe the custom key set by the GrapheneOS flashing script
20:59:38 <strcat[m]> once you flash the stock factory images and wipe the custom key along with locking again with stock
20:59:48 <strcat[m]> it'll be back to being identical to a fresh phone
20:59:56 <kelownagirl[m]> <strcat[m] "yes and follow the same instruct"> Thank you so much for your help

23:21:29 <cn3m[m]> only links or anything you tap?
23:23:16 <birdie[m]> Links in particular, just double checked....in element as well as vanadium. Doesn't seem to be doing it in gos settings atm..
23:23:35 <cn3m[m]> that might be worth an issue

23:25:12 <birdie[m]> Thanks.. I'll take a peak right now before I head out, then submit properly when I'm back home..
23:25:37 <cn3m[m]> I am not sure why, but if it is inconsistent
23:25:41 <cn3m[m]> that would be interesting
23:29:04 <birdie[m]> <cn3m[m] "I am not sure why, but if it is "> It seems to be inconsistent with gos settings and gos in general but 100% consistent for links in element and vanadium...
23:31:17 <dazinism> birdie: I noticed, sometimes (but not very often) I've had to tap lower at links in tor browser
23:31:55 <dazinism> Is this consistent, even after restarting?

23:37:46 <birdie[m]> <dazinism "Is this consistent, even after r"> Yes
23:39:29 <bypassbobby[m]> OK just noticed turning adaptive brightness on makes the screen flicker
23:39:30 <bypassbobby[m]> Turning off then turning the screen brightness up stops it
23:46:30 <awsazuregcp[m]> bypassbobby: its the adaptive refresh rate that is causing the flicker, you cant see it when the brightness is high
23:47:07 <awsazuregcp[m]> you can force 60hz everywhere with adb or turn on battery saver mode which forces 60hz
23:48:03 <bypassbobby[m]> Mine doesnt do it at all with brightness above around 70
23:48:15 <awsazuregcp[m]> bypassbobby: it does, you cant see it
23:52:37 <bypassbobby[m]> I can't maybe my eyes are bad
