01:06:48 <k3tan> renlord: https://www.zdnet.com/article/nbn-broadband-tax-clears-parliament/
01:06:53 <k3tan> lol what a joke
01:07:11 <k3tan> government literally cannot compete so slugs a tax on the competition
01:18:32 <renlord> nbn cant get privatised if competition does not get eliminated
01:18:54 <renlord> then nbn is a white elephant, but it already kinda is.
01:19:13 <renlord> k3tan: ^
01:20:44 <k3tan> so we don't believe in competition in this country anymore?
01:30:04 <renlord> free market has more or less dissapeared altogether
01:30:16 <k3tan> very sad
01:30:18 <renlord> *disappeared.
01:30:35 <k3tan> we will soon be censored and blocked
01:30:40 <k3tan> north korea incoming 3 2 1
01:31:14 <renlord> during the health crisis, our government also introduced emergency bills that enable the ASIO to interrogate minors without legal representation.
01:34:53 <TheJollyRoger> S hiver me timbers... everything seems to be going to hell in a hand basket.
01:42:46 <BrokenCog> anyone happen to know where the key file lives for signing the public key?  via this step:
01:42:49 <k3tan> renlord: really?
01:43:05 <k3tan> source?
01:43:18 <BrokenCog> signify -G -n -p keys/crosshatch/factory.pub -s keys/crosshatch/factory.sec
01:43:23 <BrokenCog> I'm getting this error:
01:43:27 <renlord> https://www.smh.com.au/national/new-asio-law-one-more-step-towards-a-totalitarian-state-20200513-p54smi.html
01:43:28 <BrokenCog> https://termbin.com/y5r1
01:44:12 <renlord> i wonder everyday how this piece of shit gets elected
01:45:09 <BrokenCog> sorry ... wrong command:
01:45:15 <BrokenCog> script/encrypt_keys.sh keys/crosshatch
01:46:00 <renlord> BrokenCog: was this your first time encrypting the key?
01:46:10 <renlord> or you're changing the password?
01:46:51 <BrokenCog> 'first time' in this tree, or first time since "rm -rf out keys" ?
01:47:20 <BrokenCog> I believe it did succeed the first time I build the images.
01:47:26 <BrokenCog> since I had an image to flash ...
01:48:02 <renlord> i assume you left empty for the first passphrase?
01:48:10 <renlord> and just hit "enter"?
01:48:21 <BrokenCog> correct.  I did actually try with a passphrase since I thought it might be related to the previous signing step.
01:48:35 <BrokenCog> (the private keys, I mean)
01:48:49 <renlord> then running subsequently didnt work anymore?
01:48:56 <renlord> can you just delete the key and make a new one?
01:49:30 <BrokenCog> well, the full saga would be "successful build ; flash image ; device OS not recognized ; re-try build ; fail ; rm -rf out keys ; and here we are"
01:50:01 <BrokenCog> that's my question, where is the key to delete it?
01:50:17 <k3tan> renlord: yeah, i think dutton is the worst person ive ever seen in politics
01:50:28 <k3tan> he's an excop on an ego trip
01:50:33 <k3tan> the ones you find on highway patrol
01:51:57 <renlord> hopefully, demographic changes in the federal seat of dickson will have him ousted in the next federal elections
01:53:27 <k3tan> tbh, to think at democracy actually works is naive
01:53:28 <BrokenCog> okay, turns out I typo'd the old key passphrase wrong.  TWICE.
01:53:40 <k3tan> democracy is still a soft form of socialism
01:55:55 <renlord> k3tan: that's not always the case. it is just the times.
01:56:42 <renlord> you're mostly a victim of the whole tyranny of the majority aspect of a democracy.
02:00:27 <k3tan> there are only a few types of people who would enter politics, generally those who wish to control people.
02:00:42 <k3tan> and don't mind threatening them with violence to get the job done
03:24:02 <BrokenCog> is there a minimum/max version  of fastboot we should use?
03:24:12 <BrokenCog> or, latest version is good?
03:31:29 <TheJollyRoger> BrokenCog: use the latest.
03:31:42 <BrokenCog> okay.
03:32:17 <BrokenCog> also, is it required for the device to be locked before an initial boot??  or, just to avoid data loss?
03:37:17 <TheJollyRoger> You can boot GrapheneOS with the bootloader unlocked - I do it just to test that the proper update partition is selected.
03:37:23 <TheJollyRoger> When doing a fresh install.
03:37:32 <TheJollyRoger> I also do it whenever testing the debugging cables.
03:37:40 <BrokenCog> right.  wanted to make sure my previous error wasn't related to booting without unlocking or somesuch.
03:37:58 <BrokenCog> also, the yellow warning about "different operating system" is that avoidable?
03:38:09 <gervarouge[m]> You should lock for security and not losing your data. You can boot unlocked, but you don't want too besides testing
03:38:22 <TheJollyRoger> No, the yellow warning about loadinga different operating system is not avoidable.
03:38:39 <BrokenCog> okay.  it happens every boot?
03:38:43 <TheJollyRoger> Not with us getting a copy of Google's keys, which are permanently fused in place into the chip.
03:38:48 <BrokenCog> or was that just part of the fastbootd?
03:39:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, it should happen every boot. If it doesn't happen, it means you're loading an operating system signed by Google.
03:39:52 <strcat[m]> bseeinu: Android has an autofill API, you certainly should NOT allow anything as an accessibility service
03:39:56 <BrokenCog> well, custom build image flashed seems to be a success.
03:40:04 <strcat[m]> apps should be using the OS autofill support not abusing accessibility services, etc.
03:40:09 <strcat[m]> that's very suspicious, in fact, if they do
03:40:10 <BrokenCog> probably wouldn't have succeeded without aeonsolution[m] ushering me through a few steps.
03:40:50 <gervarouge[m]> Are the Pixels the only devices with support for custom keys?
03:41:12 <gervarouge[m]> I mean beside a few other obscure Androids. Laptops and such
03:41:30 <TheJollyRoger> BrokenCog: splice the mainbrace!!!
03:41:37 <strcat[m]> gervarouge: other than Chromebooks, laptops generally don't support any kind of comparable verified boot
03:42:18 <BrokenCog> TheJollyRoger: Inhale the Mariner's Puff and Rejoice!
03:42:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
03:42:47 <strcat[m]> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows10-secured-core-computers is not a long list
03:43:03 <TheJollyRoger> gervarouge[m]: at this moment, yes. There was some hype that some of Xiaomi's phones supported custom keying and for a while there was hope that OnePlus might have, but this turned out to be a disappointment because both of them turned out to be broken, unfortunately.
03:47:01 <renlord> strcat[m]: do those laptop in that list have comparable verified boot?
03:48:13 <strcat[m]> renlord: no because the OS doesn't
03:48:55 <gervarouge[m]> <strcat[m] "gervarouge: other than Chromeboo"> Thanks, I know of those. But they don't support custom keys either. Iirc
03:48:57 <strcat[m]> renlord: but they have basic hardware/firmware support for it, although it's not the same as what Android needs since it doesn't support atomic upgrades with rollback, etc.
03:49:11 <gervarouge[m]> macOS definitely doesn't have custom verified boot keys. Unfortunately
03:49:33 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really have meaningful verified boot available yet either
03:49:35 <strcat[m]> just some progress towards it
03:49:56 <renlord> it at least checks for a signed bootloader?
03:51:10 <renlord> and why'd rollback be a potential attack vector if we can assert that the bootloader does correct things?
03:51:37 <gervarouge[m]> All Windows 8 or newer devices have Secure Boot. It's not going to stop persistent attacks in practically
03:54:30 <strcat[m]> gervarouge: Secure Boot != the meaningful support for verified boot that I'm talking about
03:54:37 <strcat[m]> and as I said the OS doesn't support it
03:54:58 <strcat[m]> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows10-secured-core-computers is not the same as just having incomplete hardware/firmware support for verified boot
03:55:49 <strcat[m]> gervarouge: most laptops/desktops do not support verified boot, their 'Secure Boot' feature is not what it seems
03:56:00 <strcat[m]> what good is that if the firmware is not verified, etc.
03:58:15 <gervarouge[m]> That what's I'm saying
03:58:30 <gervarouge[m]> It's not going to stop attacks
04:01:53 <TheJollyRoger> renlord: I'm hoping to someday figure that out with my T2 by using FlexVer/LPCGuard, when it arrives in the near future.
04:02:19 <TheJollyRoger> so at least my bootloader where I type in my LUKS password can be signed and verified.
04:02:39 <renlord> i thought they are signed already nowadays
04:02:49 <renlord> at least windows does
04:06:55 <renlord> is the problem tampering with the OS image and the signed bootloader can still boot into a tampered OS?
04:07:39 <renlord> so there's still that missing piece -- which is dm-verity?
04:08:02 <renlord> and people still have to bend over backwards to set this up?
04:08:35 <renlord> and on desktop there's no secure place to store the dm-verity digest resources?
04:27:20 <gervarouge[m]> renlord: Can't you have a bootloader like GRUB that verifies the system. Maybe on another drive that has a hardware read only switch?
04:27:31 <gervarouge[m]> Hypothetically
04:36:04 <nickcalyx[m]> That's kind of how heads works
04:36:31 <nickcalyx[m]> At least somewhat
04:38:31 <headgas[m]> Whatsup nick
04:38:46 <headgas[m]> And whatsup gervarouge
04:39:15 <headgas[m]> I got Fedora installed now
04:40:09 <nickcalyx[m]> Sup
04:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> renlord, a bit back I was thinking of trying to install gpg and signify into petitboot, but then I realized that's much more complex than I originally thought it would be since it has to be done at compile time.
04:41:14 <TheJollyRoger> And everything needs to be wedged into that tiny little 32MB flash chip for the hostboot.
04:41:29 <TheJollyRoger> I am thinking of buying a bigger flash chip for this reason.
04:41:43 <TheJollyRoger> I will likely keep several of them on hand just in case.
04:43:13 <renlord> gervarouge[m]: dont think GRUB does verify systems
04:44:35 <TheJollyRoger> I need to make a demotivational poster captioned: Hostboot and OpenBMC: "Yo dawg, we heard you liked booting Linux kernels, so we put yo' Linux kernel boot in a Linux kernel so you can boot yo' Linux kernel while you's boots yo' Linux Kernel."
04:44:59 <TheJollyRoger> *, dawg."
04:56:56 <headgas[m]> Now that I got Fedora installed, is there any other apps or anything you guys recommend getting?
05:04:08 <gervarouge[m]> <renlord "gervarouge: dont think GRUB does"> I meant a modified one
05:25:46 <cn3m[m]> <headgas[m] "Now that I got Fedora installed,"> Windows 10
05:25:48 <cn3m[m]> half kidding
05:38:31 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 LTSC and GrapheneOS and iPadOS is my setup right now
05:38:54 <headgas[m]> Sold my iPad pro
05:39:37 <cn3m[m]> gotcha, tablets aren't for everyone
06:56:10 <xabierd[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Are the Pixels the only devices "> Oneplus 5 supports locked Bootloader and custom keys, thats what i m running until my pixel 3 arrives  on tuesday.
06:57:55 <cn3m[m]> I'm pretty sure that doesn't actually work
07:10:01 <xabierd[m]> ?
07:14:20 <TheJollyRoger> xabierd[m]: OnePlus verified boot support is apparently broken.
07:32:58 <Florian2> Hello
07:33:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yo-ho!
07:34:54 <cn3m[m]> hey
07:34:54 <TheJollyRoger> How be ye, Florian2?
07:41:30 <Florian2> I'm good, thanks. how are you?
07:41:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, all be ship-shape!
07:43:14 <Florian2> Haha
07:43:56 <Florian2> I have 2 questions regarding grapheneos before I make the switch, can you help me with that?
07:44:30 <cn3m[m]> this is the perfect place
07:44:39 <TheJollyRoger> Certainly! What can I do for ya?
07:46:16 <Florian2> Are the android gestures (the ones that Google pretty much copied 1:1 from apple) supported?
07:46:23 <TheJollyRoger> Let me check.
07:47:02 <cn3m[m]> yes
07:47:02 <TheJollyRoger> Swipe fingerprint for camera, yes.
07:47:05 <cn3m[m]> I am using them right now
07:47:14 <TheJollyRoger> Jump to camera, yes, two button navigation, check...
07:47:23 <cn3m[m]> for navigation
07:47:35 <Florian2> Swipe from buttom up closes the app?
07:47:39 <TheJollyRoger> Double-tap to check your phone, yes,
07:47:46 <cn3m[m]> identical to an up iPhone X/11
07:47:54 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, swipe from bottom up is the same.
07:48:01 <Florian2> I meant the navigation gestures, sorry should've been more clear on that
07:48:12 <Florian2> Perfect, thanks!
07:48:29 <TheJollyRoger> Lift to check your phone, yeah.
07:48:37 <cn3m[m]> you on a standard pixel right now?
07:48:58 <Florian2> s8 sadly, but thinking about buying a pixel 3 for grapheneos
07:49:12 <TheJollyRoger> I love my Pixel 3.
07:49:40 <Florian2> they seem to get more expensive over here
07:50:06 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3a okay?
07:50:26 <TheJollyRoger> Hey this is interesting. "Lift to check phone" only works if you tilt it *up*
07:50:36 <TheJollyRoger> If you tilt it sideways or down, it stays asleep.
07:50:47 <cn3m[m]> that's so it doesn't spam you ha
07:50:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, yeah, makes sense.
07:52:00 <Florian2> has anyone tried the substratum theme app on graphene? works on my s8 without root and I was hoping for something similar in grapheneos
07:52:20 <TheJollyRoger> I haven't heard of that.
07:53:23 <cn3m[m]> I worked in adtech and am mostly an app guy. Switching to an Android was scary for me with how much I've been able to extract and bypass from them for work compared to iOS. I gotta say the improvements with GrapheneOS feel like it's fully up to snuff now
07:53:59 <TheJollyRoger> I can't make any guarantees but GrapheneOS will run most Android apps that target recent versions of the API (28) and don't try to violate the security policies set by the operating system.
07:54:10 <cn3m[m]> I don't think Substratum works without root on GrapheneOS which you should never do
07:54:28 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, well, there we go.
07:54:31 <cn3m[m]> Samsung pre sets it up iirc
07:54:36 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
07:54:51 <Florian2> oof, okay thanks!
07:55:17 <cn3m[m]> I'll try it though
07:55:17 <cn3m[m]> which one do you use?
07:56:15 <Florian2> substratum + andromeda is supposed to work on non samsung roms
07:57:47 <cn3m[m]> got links?
07:57:47 <cn3m[m]> I'll try it
07:58:00 <Florian2> the theme I use is called Flux, but if you can get any free theme to work that would be great
07:58:20 <Florian2> you probably don't have the play store right?
07:58:40 <cn3m[m]> sounds good
07:58:54 <Florian2> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=projekt.substratum
07:58:59 <Florian2> that's the theme engine
07:59:12 <TheJollyRoger> Florian2: ah, yeah, GrapheneOS by design doesn't include Play Services, due to their invasiveness.
07:59:43 <Florian2> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=projekt.andromeda
08:00:14 <Florian2> that's the plugin for support without root
08:01:33 <cn3m[m]> that doesn't work on Android 10
08:01:34 <cn3m[m]> only 8
08:01:46 <cn3m[m]> so it's not possible here
08:02:05 <Florian2> oh, that's a shame, but thanks a lot for trying it out!
08:03:33 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks, cn3m[m].
08:03:37 <cn3m[m]> of course man
08:03:39 <cn3m[m]> anything else I can check for you?
08:05:15 <cn3m[m]> we do have light and dark themes which are nice if you're into that
08:06:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I like the dark theme, it's great.
08:07:11 <Florian2> yeah, dark theme is great! I'll definitely make the switch once I find a pixel 3 in my area!
08:07:26 <TheJollyRoger> Woo!
08:07:32 <headgas[m]> I mean it was cool but I just didn't use it cus I used my phone.
08:07:35 <TheJollyRoger> Any questions about the operating system, installing...?
08:08:07 <headgas[m]> And I would use windows ltsc but I've used windows forever and I really like Linux so im sticking with linux
08:08:26 <xabierd[m]> > xabierd: OnePlus verified boot support is apparently broken.
08:08:26 <xabierd[m]> Oneplus is well known for their bootloader vulnerabilities, probably broken. Anyway it offers some basic functionality, fastboot doesn't work and anything that you flash with different signature key boots to a red error screen.
08:08:34 <Florian2> I think I can handle that. used to flash a lot of roms on my s3 back then, so this shouldnt be too hard
08:09:08 <TheJollyRoger> Great! The process is identical to installing a full production factory image.
08:09:16 <TheJollyRoger> So it's got flash-all and everything included.
08:09:26 <Florian2> Installing from linux is possible right?
08:09:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
08:09:35 <Florian2> Sweet!
08:09:45 <Florian2> Oh, actually one more question
08:09:55 <TheJollyRoger> However, there's a catch: Be sure to only use platform-tools directly from Google.
08:10:11 <Florian2> The pixel 3 gets a lot of praise for its camera, how is the camera on graphene?
08:10:17 <xabierd[m]> > I don't think Substratum works without root on GrapheneOS which you should never do
08:10:17 <xabierd[m]> Android 10 lets you change accent colour from developer options, right?
08:10:20 <TheJollyRoger> Unless you run Arch, which correctly versions fastboot, never use the adb/fastboot combination included in your operating system repositories.
08:10:46 <TheJollyRoger> xabierd[m]: I think it used to, then the feature somehow got removed upstream.
08:11:26 <cn3m[m]> pixel 3a camera isn't great 3 is though
08:11:50 <TheJollyRoger> Florian2: the camera's great on the 3. You'll need to use OpenCamera and set the camera API to "Camera2" to use the Pixel Visual Core.
08:12:00 <Florian2> I'm on manjaro, how would I know if my adb/fastboot version is correct?
08:12:05 <Florian2> good to hear!
08:12:36 <TheJollyRoger> Florian2: type in `fastboot --version` (backticks used to indicate command syntax) and see if it returns something like 29.0.43757.
08:12:38 <xabierd[m]> > Unless you run Arch, which correctly versions fastboot, never use the adb/fastboot combination included in your operating system repositories.
08:12:38 <xabierd[m]> I never ran into issues, I have been using adb/fastboot with anything included in the linux distro that I was running since htc magic
08:12:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ideally, it should be 29 or greater.
08:13:20 <xabierd[m]> > Unless you run Arch, which correctly versions fastboot, never use the adb/fastboot combination included in your operating system repositories.
08:13:20 <xabierd[m]>  I never ran into issues, I have been using adb/fastboot with anything included in the linux distro that I was running since htc magic
08:13:40 <TheJollyRoger> xabierd[m]: We've had a couple people in this channel softbrick (phone reports "no OS found", easily repairable) with incorrectly versioned, obsolete versions of Fastboot. I don't want other people to take the risk so I'm being pragmatic about it.
08:14:56 <xabierd[m]> > xabierd: We've had a couple people in this channel softbrick (phone reports "no OS found", easily repairable) with incorrectly versioned, obsolete versions of Fastboot. I don't want other people to take the risk so I'm being pragmatic about it.
08:14:56 <xabierd[m]> Im running manjaro and debian testing right now. Manjaroo should match arch with 2 weeks delay
08:15:24 <cn3m[m]> it's not hard to fix that though right?
08:15:59 <TheJollyRoger> cn3m[m]: yeah, if you get the "No OS found" error, then all you really have to do is simply flash it with the correct version of fastboot.
08:35:33 <blacklight447[m]> Question, is there a way to let vanadium always forget everything after closing a session
08:35:40 <blacklight447[m]> Just like the firefox "always use incognito mode" setting?
08:36:00 <TheJollyRoger> Morning blacklight447[m], hey, good question, let me check.
08:36:18 <headgas[m]> Has anyone started working on grapheneos for the pixel 4 yet?
08:37:07 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. I don't see any options for an always-on incognito mode under settings...

09:37:04 <xabierd[m]> i use brave as a browser  for work stuff, separated from my main browser, all extras like BAT disabled. I don't need tor
09:37:33 <gervarouge[m]> BAT is opt in and always will be
09:38:36 <joshman[m]> Chromium + Ublock is barebone brave if you opt out everything. Why even bother using it? It's one more profit hungry company to trust

09:38:58 <joshman[m]> * Ungoogled Chromium + Ublock is barebone Brave if you opt out everything. Why even bother using it? It's one more profit hungry company to trust
09:39:15 <gervarouge[m]> Brave has better anti fingerprinting and it has https upgrades built in
09:39:28 <gervarouge[m]> It doesn't require to trust any add-ons since everything works as you would like out of the box
09:40:23 <xabierd[m]> bromite works quite nicely for that, despite not being recomended for anti tracking by some people the webview is great, no adds system wide
09:43:22 <cn3m[m]> bromite is very strong anti tracking. Android is just too easy to fingerprint with the whole screen size issue
09:52:25 <xabierd[m]> > Ungoogled Chromium + Ublock is barebone Brave if you opt out everything. Why even bother using it? It's one more profit hungry company to trust
09:52:25 <xabierd[m]> ungoogled chromium needs some time to merge the updates
10:09:34 <blacklight447[m]> There is a reason why the tor project chose firefox for tor browser though
10:09:39 <blacklight447[m]> Even if they rather be on chromium
10:09:43 <blacklight447[m]> Proper proxy support.
10:10:25 <cn3m[m]> that's sadly true
10:11:10 <blacklight447[m]> In the end, the most important goal for tor is anonymity
10:11:31 <blacklight447[m]> And if you cannot guarantee that the browser won't leak your ip, then its useless for tor s usecase
10:17:08 <cn3m[m]> I don't think Chrome wants the attention either. Firefox is at 4% market share, but has more 0day vulnerabilities. Lack of security only is part of it as a lot of Firefox security features missing just minimize damage. that's probably all from the Tor attention it gets
10:23:42 <cn3m[m]> PartitionAlloc and CFI are awesome of course, but the things like sandbox issues don't directly effect Firefox 0 day count. 60% market share and Google bug bounties should make Chrome a much larger target
10:24:45 <jalb> Do you know if Vanadium system webview really needs network permission or only the browser?
10:24:46 <BallMonokuma[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Proper proxy support."> Ahhhh that makes sense
10:28:30 <jalb> I denied Network access and all is ok, but I don't really know if it's important to keep this permission in webviewç
10:30:26 <cn3m[m]> I think it's tied to the app's network permission
10:31:01 <jalb> cn3m[m], thanks!
10:31:59 <jalb> So, even denying network access and working Vanadium browser as usual, maybe it does something to make it better
10:32:19 <jalb> And we must keep that permission
10:32:58 <cn3m[m]> if you use duckduckgo browser for instance you need to block duckduckgo for the webview to not work
10:33:21 <jalb> cn3m[m], ah ok, Bromite works great too
10:33:29 <jalb> EVen without network access in webview
10:33:44 <jalb> That's why I asked
10:35:14 <jalb> It would be interesting to know if it's necessary and what it does
10:35:51 <cn3m[m]> Bromite doesn't use webview
10:37:06 <jalb> cn3m[m], ah ok
10:38:28 <cn3m[m]> which is a good thing Bromite gets Chromium patches out on Android faster than anything
10:38:32 <cn3m[m]> even faster than Chrome
10:40:03 <jalb> Good to know!
10:42:03 <jalb> Well, then I'll give it network access again
10:42:06 <jalb> Thanks
11:46:04 <xabierd[m]> > Bromite doesn't use webview
11:46:04 <xabierd[m]> Bromite has its own webview
11:52:36 <bseeinu[m]> But you can't really replace the Vanadium system webview on Graphene with Bromite's

13:04:02 <dallemon[m]> <duke_h3 "I have a question, Is there any "> Recently some work has been done to Android prepare vendor. But device is still missing a maintainer AFAIK
13:10:09 <rwarr627[m]> Hi duke_h3, this has been discussed at length before, you should be able to search this chat’s history here: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
13:24:46 <xabierd[m]> > But you can't really replace the Vanadium system webview on Graphene with Bromite's
13:24:46 <xabierd[m]> I wouldn't anyway, it would propably mean less hardening
13:35:57 <duke_h3> Thanks for the info :)
13:36:16 <duke_h3> I guess what you are saying is get a Pixel 3 / Pixel 3A now
13:36:31 <duke_h3> And a Pixel 4 later when support will be here
13:36:43 <duke_h3> ( or help out with the support )
13:37:35 <duke_h3> Has anybody looked into runing XEN / KVM on top of GraphenOS?
13:38:03 <duke_h3> Or more to the point, running XEN / KVM as a base for GraphenOS and the runing a regular Android in a "BOX"
13:50:05 <xabierd[m]> I got the pixel 3 until octobet 2021, then i will decide which pixel to get
14:13:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai "rollback protection is when lock"> On oneplus it is enabled when unlocked and data can't be decrypted

17:12:51 <tronss> strcat: can I ask you a question about security/privacy with the camera?
17:13:40 <strcat[m]> Ask the channel not me specifically
17:13:46 <tronss> Ok thanks
17:15:14 <tronss> If I disable the camera permission to my camera app, could some malware in my phone start the app and begin recording or it's impossible and in some way GOS protect us?
17:15:56 <tronss> i'am always worried about the camera and I haven't put a protection in it
17:19:13 <tronss> I'm not sure If I should order something to hide the camera or not. I don't use it very much and when I use it I enable the permission. When I finish I disable it again.
17:20:39 <madaidan[m]> <tronss "If I disable the camera permissi"> If the app doesn't have the permission, it cannot use it.
17:21:01 <madaidan[m]> You can just use a piece of tape.
17:21:20 <tronss> madaidan[m], can the malware or malicious app change it in any way, maybe through the settings permission that it's always enabled?
17:22:35 <tronss> Or the other 2: system UI and org.codeaurora.ims
17:24:10 <tronss> You know, in my laptop I always hide it but in my new Google pixel I'm not convinced and it doesn't look good
17:24:37 <madaidan[m]> They can if they manage to exploit the OS which would be very hard to do.
17:25:07 <tronss> madaidan[m], so, they exploit the OS and then change the permissions and lauch the app to record
17:25:19 <tronss> Well, at least GOS is great about it
17:25:54 <tronss> As I don't know a lot about the security in GOS apps or the system I always thought about it
17:26:21 <tronss> The same with the microphone
17:26:36 <tronss> But thanks a lot for the answer madaidan[m]
17:27:04 <fll[m]> They would need a very expensive exploit that would work on any android out there to do that
17:27:22 <tronss> fll[m], yes...
17:27:54 <tronss> Do you hide the camera in your Pixel?
17:28:01 <fll[m]> Graphene is probably the best protection against that that you can get
17:28:21 <fll[m]> I don't, but I'm no high profile target to anyone
17:29:00 <tronss> Or you trust in the system to avoid these possible attacks?
17:29:10 <tronss> finn[m], thanks
17:29:20 <madaidan[m]> <tronss "madaidan., so, they exploit the "> If they exploit the OS then they can use the camera directly without needing to launch another app.
17:29:30 <fll[m]> I do cover it up on my fedora laptop though :P
17:29:47 <tronss> madaidan[m], so they don't even need the camera app?
17:30:07 <tronss> fll[m], yes, I do the same, but in the smartphone it's weird
17:30:17 <tronss> Or make it feel ugly
17:31:25 <madaidan[m]> <tronss "madaidan., so they don't even ne"> No, they do not.
17:32:01 <tronss> Oh... that's creepy
17:32:37 <fll[m]> They would need either a malicious app to which you have given camera access rights or system/root access to the whole phone, but that would an exploit worth a lot of money
17:33:35 <tronss> fll[m], or maybe we install a malicios app without not knowing?
17:34:16 <tronss> If I don't launch that app I think it's impossible, only when I launch it in GOS, am I right?
17:34:41 <madaidan[m]> <tronss "fll, or maybe we install a malic"> The app would still need to exploit a critical vulnerability in the OS which would be really hard.
17:35:32 <madaidan[m]> It'd also be non-persistent unless they also have a verified boot bypass which is even more unlikely.
17:35:56 <fll[m]> madaidan.: hmm...if you give camera and network access to a malicious app it could send of fotos/videos, or not?
17:35:59 <tronss> madaidan[m], well, I think I'll trust the system then. I don't know if many people here hide the camera, or even you madaidan[m]  ;)
17:36:37 <madaidan[m]> <fll[m] "madaidan.: hmm...if you give cam"> We were talking about an app without the permission.
17:37:05 <madaidan[m]> <tronss "madaidan., well, I think I'll tr"> I always tape it over just in case.
17:37:08 <fll[m]> Ah ok. Yea, then of course you're right
17:37:29 <tronss> madaidan[m], well, there isn't 100$ security, that's true...
17:38:56 <tronss> With the microphone it's more difficult to protect because you need an external device to talk
17:39:25 <tronss> It's something hard and maybe we don't even  need to think about it
17:39:57 <tronss> But I always had this in my mind and using GOS I wanted to know your opinion. Thank you both.
17:41:01 <dazinism> If you install an app and give it accessibility service powers I think it would be able to get to use your camera
17:42:32 <dazinism> Possibly the same if you give an app admin app powers also.
17:42:52 <dazinism> *an app device admin powers also
17:43:42 <tronss> dazinism, how could it be that accessibility service?, I can't see it in the camera permission. Do you mean the accessibility option in the settings?
17:44:14 <tronss> dazinism, in fact it has the Settings permission yet, I don't know if it's a high permission...
17:44:28 <tronss> And we can
17:44:36 <tronss> *and we can't disable it
17:45:27 <tronss> Maybe the settings permission could change what it wants, IDN
17:52:16 <dazinism> If you look in settings > accessibility you'll see a 'downloaded services' section if theres anything on your device that could use this. Apps can ask you to enable this downloaded service and take you to that settings page.
17:52:56 <dazinism> Once you've enabled that the app has more power on the device than you.
17:53:59 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Accessibility_services
17:56:07 <tronss> dazinism, I see, thanks!. No, I don't enable those options there
17:59:07 <tronss> I only see Dark theme, disable animations and rotate the screen
18:01:20 <tronss> And what about the Settings permission itself?
18:02:02 <tronss> I don't know why it's enabled in the camera permission and not in other permissions
18:02:59 <tronss> It must be something needed by the camera
18:03:25 <dazinism> Probably best not granted if the app functions OK. Not sure what are legitimate things that apps use that for
18:03:44 <dazinism> Certainly malware can use it to mess with you.
18:04:16 <tronss> That's what I thought... Finally I must order something to hide the camera lol
18:16:54 <dazinism> tronss: maybe just disable settings permission from all apps, and dont grant it to any apps you install.
18:18:17 <tronss> dazinism, I can't disable the Settings in the camera permission
18:18:48 <tronss> I mean, not the camera app, but the camera permission, it doesn't let me, so I suppose it's there for something useful
18:19:08 <dazinism> For your camera app? Are you using GrapheneOS?
18:19:41 <tronss> Not my camera app. Where you find all the permissions your smartphone uses
18:20:07 <tronss> Network, Sensors, Camera...
18:20:42 <tronss> If you check the Camera, it always use the Settings permission
18:20:59 <tronss> English is not my main language, I suppose it's Settings the translation
18:21:09 <tronss> Yes, I use GOS
18:21:15 <tronss> Pixel 3a
18:27:14 <tronss> Maybe I missunderstand these permissions with the apps themselves
18:27:35 <tronss> Sorry for my ignorance if it's not like that
18:30:40 <neothechosenone[> Is guardian project application Checkey good for checking signing certificates for applications? I just ask because it seems to be unmaintained ?

19:32:10 <TheJollyRoger> Working for me on Blueline.
19:32:40 <TheJollyRoger> I'm calling and texting myself, seems to be working on my end.
19:53:35 <duke_h3> TheJollyRoger do you know if anybody have been able to run GOS under XEN on a Pixel 3?
19:53:53 <duke_h3> TheJollyRoger do you know if anybody have been able to run GOS under XEN / KVM on a Pixel 3?

20:00:50 <cn3m[m]> the only related project is xen4android and that's dead
20:02:38 <TheJollyRoger> duke_h3: don't think so.
20:05:49 <TheJollyRoger> In order to do something like run a different kernel on those handsets, it almost certainly would require Qualcomm's co-operation, or a LOT of community involvement.
20:06:15 <TheJollyRoger> Google has wanted to Android to run Mainline for how many years now? *Google* of all people, has not been able to get Qualcomm to budge.
21:32:19 <duke_h3> TheJollyRoger Okj:) I will dig further, as far as I know KVM is part of the kernel, and there are offical kernals for this plattform.
21:32:39 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
21:33:04 <duke_h3> On an x86 plattform I can strart LXC on a vanilla kernel
21:33:26 <duke_h3> I am not sure if KVM support is compiled into the current GOS kernel
21:34:10 <cn3m[m]> try limbo to see?
21:34:16 <duke_h3> As far as I can see on the net, bouth KVM and XEN has been run on ARM plattform
21:34:41 <duke_h3> ( I am currently reading up om the Pixel 3 plattform )
