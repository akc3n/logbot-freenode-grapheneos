00:03:40 <cdesai> JTL: thanks :) - all good here, hope things are okay on your end too!
00:04:46 <JTL> Yeah
00:05:01 <JTL> Thanks
00:08:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: yeah I'm not even sure they do

00:10:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can't confirm if the keys are stored
00:14:28 <cdesai> well, even if they are, what you said means they aren't used for any checks which I'd argue ends up being the same as not storing them

03:07:31 <brenneke[m]> Does Auditor app serve any function on installed device or is it just for checking other devices?
03:18:03 <nickcalyx[m]> pretty sure you can use auditor to check your local device against a remote server
03:22:41 <JTL> Yes
03:29:45 <brenneke[m]> OK, but not necessary to have running all the time, manual check only right?
03:54:09 <rutxonboard[m]> nickcalyx: hey quick question. I saw the website for calyx looks like there hasn't been a new image lately. Is it still frequently updated?
03:55:47 <nickcalyx[m]> we generally have an update every month but we may not have one for april 2020
03:57:55 <rutxonboard[m]> > we generally have an update every month but we may not have one for april 2020
03:57:55 <rutxonboard[m]> Thanks. Good work. Would you guys be open to adding a notice of the patches? It looks a little like the project is unmaintained at first blush.
03:58:30 <rutxonboard[m]> No offense at all, I understand it's easier to OTA and not build a new image everytime.
03:58:51 <nickcalyx[m]> We do build new images every time
03:59:10 <rutxonboard[m]> I don't see them on the site. I might be missing it
04:11:44 <grapheneosuser[m> Sorry to jump in here with a different topic, but which option is preferred? Shelter app from fdriod or just creating a different profile under Multiple Users? Use case is for work/uni aka apps like Microsoft excel, fb etc or apps that might have trackers.
04:14:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> Separate profiles, according to Daniel.
04:15:31 <cyborgninjaneer[> Device admin and accessibility services aren't recommended.
04:18:37 <joshman[m]> How bad would that be to have Working Gcam on a separate profile? Installing microg gives me shivers
04:21:27 <grapheneosuser[m> Thank you cyborgninjaneer for your helpful response.
04:22:32 <rutxonboard[m]> > How bad would that be to have Working Gcam on a separate profile? Installing microg gives me shivers
04:22:32 <rutxonboard[m]> microg is safe as an apk. It's the install process. If it fools an app like gcam you're fine
04:23:24 <rutxonboard[m]> The bigger risk is Google Camera's selinux domain. microG is just an app. Signature spoofing to get it to work in 99% of cases is the scary
04:25:07 <joshman[m]> Right. It won't work with network disabled. Nevermind. Won't install this snake oil of an app
04:25:51 <rutxonboard[m]> > Right. It won't work with network disabled. Nevermind. Won't install this snake oil of an app
04:25:52 <rutxonboard[m]> Google Camera works without network
04:26:19 <rutxonboard[m]> It just has too much access to the hardware via loosened SELinux domain
05:34:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's currently only working because of a loophole in the policy. This is likely to change soon to further mitigate potential exploits, and could change before then if Google decides to take their ball and go home. So it's likely to break at any moment.

13:46:22 <strcat[m]> I will have increasingly less time and energy available for it due to the attacks from Copperhead and also others to a lesser extent
13:46:50 <strcat[m]> need the community to step up and help with defending the project from the people trying to destroy it
13:47:05 <strcat[m]> along with making substantial contributions and taking over the work that I used to do and am no longer doing
13:47:09 <strcat[m]> and more work that I need to stop doing
13:47:42 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of things that I used to do which are now no longer happening leading to shrinking viability of the project
13:47:48 <strcat[m]> since people aren't stepping up enough
13:49:00 <strcat[m]> will be making a major announcement soon about the escalation of attacks on the project by Copperhead
14:06:47 <strcat> let me check on these domain name scammers
14:12:14 <nscnt> The decision for the future device support is a proper step.

14:25:12 <Zenithium[m]> I don't even know how people fall for this sort of scan, are you supposed to own every possible domain that contains grapheneos in the name? lol
14:25:14 <cx2[m]> I'm going to go spend an hour collecting 20 TLDs for Chase Bank....then send them an email.... see how that works out for me.
14:25:15 <nscnt> strcat: If someone wanted to take on tasks like an equipment attendant, what would be the first thing they could do right now?

14:26:03 <cx2[m]> woof.... what a waste of time.
14:26:07 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: lol yeah grapheneos.org is enough why would I buy other domains
14:26:15 <strcat> I can't possibly buy every variant of it
14:26:22 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: also how can they even claim to be buying grapheneos.org.cn
14:26:25 <strcat> that makes no fucking sense
14:26:34 <strcat> unless there is a registrar for org.cn
14:26:37 <strcat> i.e. if it's a public suffix
14:26:42 <strcat> I seriously doubt that? let me check
14:26:55 <strcat> https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat
14:27:10 <strcat> ok it actually *is* a public suffix
14:27:13 <strcat> that's stupid as hell lol
14:27:17 <Zenithium[m]> I think .cn domains need to be approved by the Chinese government or something like that, I remember that the process is different than usual
14:27:20 <strcat> so you can buy grapheneos.cn
14:27:27 <strcat> but you can also buy grapheneos.org.cn
14:27:34 <strcat> why would you even WANT org.cn
14:27:42 <cx2[m]> strcat:  https://google.org.cn/
14:27:47 <strcat> cx2[m]: yeah I checked

14:27:53 <cx2[m]> strcat: turns out google is in trouble too...
14:28:01 <Zenithium[m]> You should get grapheneos.com.org.cn just to cover your bases
14:28:13 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: lol that wouldn't be available
14:28:17 <strcat> someone likely has com.org.cn
14:28:23 <strcat> but yeah
14:28:24 <Zenithium[m]> Or maybe grapheneos.com.org.net.cn
14:28:25 <strcat> it's so dumb
14:28:45 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.cn
14:28:47 <strcat> look at
14:28:50 <strcat> Generic second-level domains
14:28:59 <strcat> Any individual may register for second-level domain names. However, the registry has created a set of predefined second-level domains for certain types of organizations and geographic locations. Registrations for such third-level domains were available before second-level domains became available in 2003, and registrants of third-level domains were given priority for names at the second level.
14:29:05 <strcat> how does that make any sense?
14:29:17 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: I guess it's a legacy thing
14:29:25 <strcat> since they started selling *.com.cn before *.cn
14:29:53 <strcat> yeah mutt is fucking stupid how do I disable line wrapping doesn't seem possible
14:29:59 <strcat> set wrap=0 still wraps at terminal width
14:30:03 <strcat> just going to set pager to less probablt
14:30:06 <strcat> I hate email so much
14:30:11 <Zenithium[m]> It must be possible, it's mutt lol
14:30:45 <cx2[m]> https://google.tw is also available it seems.
14:30:45 <cx2[m]> strcat seems i've stumbled upon a money pit here... just redirect that email to google. I KNOW they are good for the money.
14:30:56 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: no it's not possible without patching I found multiple clear answers
14:31:05 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: so basically 'wrap' makes it wrap at some fixed value
14:31:08 <strcat> but even disabling that
14:31:12 <strcat> it ALWAYS wraps at terminal width
14:31:15 <strcat> so it breaks the lines
14:31:24 <strcat> I could disable 'markers' and it'd stop putting + when wrapping but...
14:31:40 <strcat> that isn't helpful since it still wraps them and then it just looks like the person who sent the email wrapped it
14:31:46 <strcat> anyway I did 'set pager=less'
14:31:56 <strcat> it's just annoying because then you can't do stuff like replying to the email with 'r'
14:32:02 <strcat> you have to exit pager first
14:32:43 <strcat> I already use vim as the editor instead of mutt's horrific editor
14:32:44 <strcat> ofc
14:32:53 <cx2[m]> speaking of mutt... anyone have /.muttrc they care to share? I need a little kickstart
14:32:55 <strcat> with 'set edit_headers' to just manually edit those
14:33:16 <Zenithium[m]> You could probably improve your email workflow but it's a time sink lol
14:33:22 <strcat> cx2[m]: I had an old one for IMAP with Gmail but I started over
14:33:29 <strcat> since I'm just using mutt on mail.grapheneos.org
14:34:03 <strcat> I set up IMAP/SMTP auth but it's easier to just login with ssh and use mutt
14:34:27 <nscnt> cx2[m]: renlord's https://github.com/renlord/dotfiles/blob/master/HOME-STOW/mutt/.muttrc
14:34:30 <strcat> because to use IMAP/SMTP I'd have to send all this mail to some dovecot virtual account
14:34:33 <cx2[m]> Id imagine the same one for gmail would work for fastmail
14:34:34 <strcat> instead of just using root
14:34:51 <strcat> so I'll probably just use the external IMAP/SMTP for other people
14:34:51 <cx2[m]> ah... yeah good point
14:35:09 <strcat> also I need to set up postfix to disallow people who authenticate to send mail with arbitrary from headers
14:35:38 <strcat> it was so much easier to configure OpenSMTPD but it lacks SPF verification for inbound mail, DANE verification for outbound mail and MTA-STS verification for outbound mail
14:35:43 <strcat> so I had to switch to postfix
14:35:54 <strcat> it's a PITA to configure postfix properly
14:36:14 <strcat> cx2[m]: I'm not gonna using GPG anymore it's fucking terrible
14:36:19 <strcat> been stripping away my last uses of it
14:36:27 <strcat> it's insecure and just awful
14:37:22 <cx2[m]> strcat: TheJollyRoger has me on a warpath to learn AGE
14:37:33 <cx2[m]> or in my case RAGE
14:37:34 <Zenithium[m]> Email is just crap in general lol
14:37:43 <strcat> age + signify is the way to go
14:37:53 <strcat> age provides encryption with integrity
14:38:08 <strcat> if you want to prove it came from you, sign with signify
14:38:21 <strcat> but you don't need to use signify to prevent tampering
14:38:56 <cx2[m]> wonder if there's a thunderbird plugin for signify
14:39:16 <strcat> it would be nice if age had to option to specify / verify the identity of the person encrypting but it leaves that to signify
14:39:25 <strcat> would just be easier to use if it was an extra switch

14:43:53 <Zenithium[m]> strcat: do you have a list of mailing lists you're subscribed to? I'm curious because I started looking into them recently since I wasn't following any but I feel like a lot of security stuff is on there
14:44:12 <Zenithium[m]> strcat: I'm guessing the ones from https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/welcome that you mentioned somewhere are a good start
14:44:14 <strcat> I unsubscribed from all mailing lists
14:44:34 <strcat> not subscribed to any people just CC on random shit and it spams me with emails

14:44:43 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: no
14:44:50 <Zenithium[m]> Oh
14:44:51 <strcat> they are too high traffic, boring and anger inducing
14:45:54 <strcat> I don't want to subscribe to oss-security and see more people reporting stuff like exploiting a kernel through control of the kernel command line (doesn't make any fucking sense, not interested in the security theatre desktop linux lockdown nonsense)
14:46:00 <Zenithium[m]> I'm just looking for knowledgeable people to learn from but it's hard to find where they congregate lol
14:46:20 <Zenithium[m]> Seems like most people don't know what they're talking about
14:46:27 <strcat> there aren't enough knowledgeable people that are active in that sense
14:46:31 <strcat> to have a mailing list of them
14:46:42 <strcat> oss-security is silly
14:46:44 <strcat> lots of silliness
14:46:52 <strcat> and it's mostly just vulnerabilities
14:47:47 <Zenithium[m]> I remember you saying Twitter has a lot of the security community on there but I dislike Twitter because any good stuff gets overshadowed and buried under a mountain of stupidity
14:48:15 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: well the way you have to use twitter is follow people who post good content
14:48:23 <Zenithium[m]> Twitter uses stupid timeline features where posts aren't chronological and posts from people you don't even follow show up constantly etc. it's just annoying
14:48:24 <strcat> you certainly never look at "hashtags" or whatever
14:48:31 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: you can disable those things
14:48:51 <strcat> you can set it to chronological and if you don't want to see tweets liked by people who you follow, you can disable that
14:48:52 <nscnt> You don't even need Twitter. You could use a rss reader.
14:49:10 <strcat> you need twitter to properly set up following and control which types of things you see

14:50:59 <algebro[m]> while you aren't wrong, i dont know if it's just reddit
14:51:04 <cyborgninjaneer[> Reddit is like... A colon polyp. Other social media is leukemia.
14:51:06 <strcat> nscnt: follow everyone I follow and maybe remove the few that aren't infosec people
14:51:19 <strcat> nscnt: make a twitter account, follow every single account I follow, and you'll have a good infosec news feed
14:51:23 <strcat> remove the few that aren't infosec
14:51:26 <nscnt> I don't have a Twitter account. I can't see who you're following.
14:51:35 <strcat> make an anonymous one then
14:52:03 <strcat> infosec community is on twitter
14:52:17 <strcat> nowhere else can you find public discussion by the core infosec community really
14:52:55 <strcat> I follow 242 people, I'd say it's 90%+ infosec
14:53:07 <strcat> some is android, compilers, language design, etc.
14:53:14 <strcat> software verification
14:53:30 <strcat> there are probably only like 5  accounts that are not computer-related
14:53:42 <strcat> oh and some is bitcoin
14:53:47 <cyborgninjaneer[> Ooh.
14:54:30 <cyborgninjaneer[> What's the most private way to access twitter?
14:54:47 <strcat> just make an account anonymously? it probably just needs an email address
14:55:02 <strcat> I would use a real email address you can continue accessing but you could make a unique one for it
14:55:32 <strcat> if you want a good feed of infosec stuff I'd say you pretty much need to use twitter
14:55:55 <strcat> or some third party site that lets you follow people perhaps but I'd guess that twitter's API makes it worse than using twitter
14:56:09 <strcat> and it's better if you can actually reply and DM people
14:56:10 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "I don't want to subscribe to oss"> I remember that thread lol
14:56:17 <madaidan[m]> Can't wait for the `nosmap` CVE too
14:56:26 <strcat> madaidan[m]: it makes no sense
14:56:28 <strcat> basically
14:56:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> I guess I shouldn't worry overly much about what's in Twitter's site code.
14:56:45 <strcat> they are okay with being able to boot a different userspace, disable verified boot for userspace
14:56:49 <strcat> the kernel does NOTHING useful itself
14:56:52 <strcat> it serves userspace
14:56:55 <strcat> it makes no fucking sense
14:57:12 <strcat> cyborgninjaneer[: I use twitter to set up talking to people on Signal
14:57:25 <strcat> I have a lot of public discussions with the infosec community
14:57:30 <Zenithium[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "What's the most private way to a"> You can make an account through Tor (I did) but they make you jump through hoops and you have to contact support to unlock your account etc. if you don't give them any personal data
14:57:31 <strcat> and then via DMs I set up talking via Signal
14:57:58 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: I think you can use it tho
14:58:05 <strcat> just not post stuff people can see etc.?
14:58:44 <madaidan[m]> They wouldn't let me create an account through Tor :(
14:58:50 <madaidan[m]> Might try it again
14:58:55 <strcat> use a VPN?
14:59:08 <strcat> I don't really use Tor in practice much
14:59:17 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yeah, they can't get your IP. That's all tor hides anyway
14:59:45 <strcat> it's too slow and I don't want my traffic going through malicious exit nodes really, just increases attack surface
14:59:49 <cyborgninjaneer[> Neither do I.
14:59:50 <strcat> I trust my ISP more than Tor exit nodes
15:00:11 <strcat> software is terrible and I don't trust it not to leak data
15:00:14 <strcat> or get exploited
15:00:27 <strcat> I don't think I really do much that leads to unencrypted connections but still
15:00:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> When I do, I run tor through my VPN (so the ISP doesn't see it) and never log into anything.
15:00:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> It is NOT secure.
15:00:52 <Zenithium[m]> Most stuff is HTTPS nowadays so it's fine
15:01:00 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: MOST stuff
15:01:27 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "use a VPN?"> I prefer Tor than paying for a VPN
15:01:54 <strcat> madaidan[m]: tor is so slow
15:02:00 <strcat> I have gigabit internet and want high bandwidth + low latency
15:02:07 <strcat> I can max out my connection with PIA
15:02:41 <Zenithium[m]> I don't really feel that it's slow unless I want to stream HD video or something, just browsing the internet is fine
15:02:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> madaidan.: if you simply cannot pay for a VPN, perhaps run Proton's free one. It's possibly the best free option, faster than tor and more trustworthy unless you have just something against the company
15:02:43 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "Zenithium: MOST stuff"> I'd take my chances when 90% of visited websites are https
15:02:44 <strcat> my threat model is I don't want sites tracking my interests etc.
15:02:46 <Zenithium[m]> Maybe I'm just used to it lol
15:03:27 <strcat> ok like right now
15:03:32 <strcat> I'm watching a 4k youtube video
15:03:42 <strcat> there is 500mbit+ of downloads going
15:03:51 <strcat> separately
15:04:00 <strcat> and I'm browsing the web and expecting that to be fast/painless
15:04:12 <strcat> expecting pages to load in 200ms
15:04:25 <madaidan[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "madaidan.: if you simply cannot "> I use that sometimes and it's slow as shit. Tor is faster most of the time.
15:04:32 <strcat> and I need to be able to upload stuff at near 1gbit
15:05:08 <strcat> it's like $2/month
15:05:27 <Zenithium[m]> Yeah watching 4K video is not happening over Tor lmao

15:07:46 <strcat> and why is it 1 second by default
15:07:47 <strcat> what the FUCK
15:08:02 <strcat> they literally have an option that delays things by default by 1 second
15:08:05 <strcat> like changing folders
15:08:07 <Zenithium[m]> lol
15:08:09 <strcat> it just sits there for 1 second
15:08:24 <strcat> k that's better now it switches instantly
15:08:40 <strcat> using less as the pager sucks can't toggle showing all headers etc
15:09:23 <strcat> To: Undisclosed recipients: ;
15:09:31 <strcat> why does postfix even accept this email
15:09:35 <strcat> and give it to root
15:09:41 <Zenithium[m]> Reminds me of a post I read about a guy using sleep() all of the place in his code and then removing a bit from time to time to impress managment by speed increase
15:09:45 <algebro[m]> i tried to submit patches to the linux kernel but mutt couldn't get it formatted well enough for greg kh to tolerate them
15:10:02 <strcat> algebro[m]: use git send-email
15:10:04 <strcat> always
15:10:20 <strcat> git is so fucked up it has email handling built into it
15:10:22 <strcat> sending and receiving
15:10:35 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: yeah so
15:10:38 <algebro[m]> hahaha, thanks for the tip, i'll keep it in mind once i feel up to trying again
15:10:39 <strcat> when you switch folders in mutt, etc.
15:10:42 <strcat> it sleeps for $sleep_time
15:10:45 <strcat> which is 1s by default
15:10:47 <strcat> why???
15:11:04 <strcat> so basically you add 'set sleep_time=0' and now it's not unnecessarily slow
15:12:42 <Zenithium[m]> > Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational messages, while moving from folder to folder and after expunging messages from the current folder.
15:12:45 <Zenithium[m]> From the docs
15:13:01 <Zenithium[m]> So I guess you're gonna miss out on some "informational messages" strcat hahah
15:15:10 <strcat> I can't read those in 1s anyway
15:15:18 <strcat> I won't be expecting a message
15:15:23 <strcat> what kind of messages lol
15:15:39 <strcat> lemme try deleting a mail and doing it with sleep_time
15:16:01 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: yeah so it shows the number of purged mails in status bar
15:16:04 <strcat> but really
15:16:09 <strcat> that is not a valid way for me to consume that info
15:16:17 <strcat> I'm not really going to process that and I don't care anyway
15:16:29 <strcat> it's line noise
15:21:47 <Zenithium[m]> I think it's worth losing some not-that-useful info for getting rid of the delay while switching folders :P
15:24:34 <Zenithium[m]> Well, I don't know everything that's included in "informational messages" but going by the name I don't think it's anything important/essential
15:34:58 <limitless0[m]> Wont the sites track your habit even if you are on vpn via trackers and cookies?
15:41:08 <cx2[m]> <limitless0[m] "Wont the sites track your habit "> Hundreds, if not thousands are users are potentially using the same server. In addition you could change servers from time to time depending on the time service youre using
15:41:20 <cx2[m]> Not to getinto a vpn discussion here....
15:41:21 <limitless0[m]> <strcat "I trust my ISP more than Tor exi"> Is it better for privacy or security to use signal through a Vpn or Orbot?
15:42:15 <limitless0[m]> <cx2[m] "Hundreds, if not thousands are u"> But cookies and trackers are device specific, Ip its less relevant
15:43:21 <cx2[m]> sure so use browser settings that purge cookies, etc.
15:43:36 <algebro[m]> strcat probably trusts his ISP more than a vpn provider based on that comment
15:43:57 <algebro[m]> but also privacy and anonymity arent the same thing so tor has nothing to do with privacy
15:44:17 <algebro[m]>  * but also privacy and anonymity arent the same thing so tor has nothing to do with making signal more private
15:45:40 <Zenithium[m]> <cx2[m] "sure so use browser settings tha"> It doesn't matter, your browser is fingerprintable in countless ways unless you have JS disabled
15:48:12 <limitless0[m]> Rabbit hole
15:48:12 <cx2[m]> Eh... regarding the trust of any number of potential exit nodes vs a truly vetted (I know there are few) VPN, I would probably err on the side of the vpn.
15:48:13 <cx2[m]>  In theory every single exit node is independantly hosted. and there are a LOT of them. In contrast, a good VPN provider at owns their servers.
15:48:16 <cx2[m]> Zenithium:
15:49:15 <Zenithium[m]> I don't trust any VPN provider, I can't verify that they don't keep logs etc. and they're a prime target for government surveillance
15:49:29 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Comments, too:
15:49:30 <DannyWorkOrderPr> What a one line change did to the Chrome sandbox https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22945630
15:50:06 <Zenithium[m]> VPNs are pointless unless you want to sidestep region blocks or torrent illegally. Otherwise just use ISP or Tor traffic
15:50:38 <strcat> I don't trust Tor
15:50:43 <strcat> it can be flooded with malicious nodes
15:51:09 <cx2[m]> Zenithium:  First, that statement was regarding cookies. Not browser fingerprinting. Second, I don't disagree...that's why attempting to limit add-ons is relatively important. the "Blending in" is a real thing.
15:51:09 <cx2[m]> Third - Ok. I'm not attempting to change your mind here.
15:51:55 <cx2[m]> Zenithium:  nor did i want to have a protracted discussion of VPNs. Although you ARE on the web so you must have your trust in someone...
15:54:02 <analogpathy[m]> Sybil attacks are a real issue
15:55:28 <cx2[m]> While infosec is WILDLY subjective in nature, I can assure you there are some relatively hard and fast rules....but because most have subscribed to a line of thinking already, and then did a small bit of "research" on their own, there's rarely any mind changing in the infosec world.
15:55:29 <cx2[m]> It's always, "Nah, you're shit is flawed, mines better... " And in nearly every case it's without context.
15:59:08 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "I don't trust Tor"> What do you think of other networks like I2P?
16:01:40 <strcat> i2p sucks
16:04:28 <madaidan[m]> Fair enough

16:13:39 <grapheneuser> Chanced upon this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/g4s35n/pixel_4/
16:14:39 <grapheneuser> Are there plans to discontinue pixel 3 support anytime soon?
16:15:54 <strcat> grapheneuser: no devices have maintainers yet
16:16:03 <strcat> all devices without maintainers will need to be dropped
16:16:21 <strcat> we need the community to step up and start making substantial contributions
16:17:22 <strcat> grapheneuser: the plan is for the community to step up and for each currently supported device to have at least one person actively doing testing and development/maintenance for it
16:17:36 <strcat> the *plan* is not to drop any devices, that's what will happen if the plan fails
16:17:40 <cyborgninjaneer[> What areas of knowledge are needed to become a device maintainer?
16:18:42 <grapheneuser> I'm guessing the legacy pixel 2 devices will be dropped first?
16:20:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yeah, the support from Google ends for the 2's later this year. It'd be better for someone to jump on the 3a or 4a.
16:20:35 <grapheneuser> What about the pixel 3 lineup? Do you see the possibility of the pixel 3(xl) being dropped on favour of the 3a(xl) to minimize the workload? Or the other way around?
16:21:02 <grapheneuser> In favour*
16:21:17 <strcat> grapheneuser: every device without a maintainer has to be dropped
16:21:22 <strcat> up the community which devices remain supported
16:21:32 <strcat> ideally people will help with all of it and nothing has to be dropped
16:21:34 <strcat> that's the plan
16:22:29 <madaidan[m]> <grapheneuser "What about the pixel 3 lineup? D"> I think it'd be more likely for the 3a to be dropped
16:23:07 <grapheneuser> I'm deciding between the 3/3a ATM. Thought I'll ask
16:24:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): What sort of skills does a device maintainer need? What is the workload like? An article about becoming a maintainer might be a good idea. There are a lot of bright people here. Smartphones are just a little obtuse at first.
16:27:22 <cyborgninjaneer[> Something along the lines of, "Google this and this, learn how x y and z work, then start working toward x y and z goals on a specific device."
16:28:06 <cyborgninjaneer[> Then the community can point to that, and help people find resources.
16:30:59 <cyborgninjaneer[> I did a couple of uninformed DDG searches just now and I'm just as clueless as before about what a device maintainer does or what skills are needed. We need an accessible starting point to get people on board.
16:37:23 <algebro[m]> Are there any promising alternatives for push notifications on the horizon?
16:37:55 <algebro[m]> I saw one mentioned somewhere but it hasn't had a commit in 8 months so I assume it stalled
16:38:04 <strcat> algebro[m]: what do you mean?
16:38:12 <strcat> apps can easily do it properly on their own
16:38:14 <nscnt> I asked about the absolute next steps to maintain a device (like, what to do right *now*), but it got no response.
16:38:34 <strcat> start by building and testing on that device
16:38:48 <strcat> and working on device support and issues filed that are specific to the device
16:39:01 <strcat> you need a dedicated dev device
16:39:04 <strcat> to be a maintainer
16:39:07 <algebro[m]> Like some sort of drop in alternative for Google's push notification library. I don't know how it works at a fundamental level so that might not be possible but I was just curious
16:39:10 <strcat> it can't really be your personal device
16:39:29 <strcat> algebro[m]: that's not at all possible if you mean without the app changing their server
16:39:38 <algebro[m]> You can get somewhat cheap pixels on eBay it you look
16:39:40 <strcat> algebro[m]: the app's server connects to FCM and sends a push through it
16:40:20 <algebro[m]> Damn, was afraid of that...thanks
16:41:15 <cx2[m]> strcat: I don't know if this matters, BUT I would be willing to purchase and ship a specific device for dev to someone that can "maintain" a device....
16:41:18 <cyborgninjaneer[> Okay, so that will have to wait until I've got dough in my pocket for an extra piece of hardware. Maybe by the time the 4a is out I'll have funds. Not sure about time.
16:41:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > I don't know how it works at a fundamental level so that might not be possible but I was just curious
16:41:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Think the question is "what functionality are you asking about/what are you missing right now?"
16:41:33 <Nikos[m]> I think he means a unified way so each up doesn't wake the device on its own draining battery by all the apps combined causing more wakes than necessary. I remember someone working on a prototype using the matrix protocol but I forget the name and it still needed work last I heard about it.

16:43:25 <strcat> the project has paid for 2 contributors to get Pixel 3a dev devices
16:43:35 <strcat> if people contribute the project will get them a dev device
16:43:38 <strcat> perhaps multiple dev devices
16:43:42 <strcat> perhaps a workstation

16:46:50 <madaidan[m]> <cx2[m] "What level of proficiency is req"> I'd assume mainly C, C++ and Java
16:47:20 <cx2[m]> safe assessment
16:47:46 <strcat> yeah but learning Java is trivial
16:47:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cx2[m] "What level of proficiency is req"> Please visit grapheneos.org and actually read the documentation =]

16:56:32 <strcat> really annoying
16:56:35 <strcat> I hate email
16:57:47 <strcat[m]> 3.1. Message-Id: headers
16:57:47 <strcat[m]> Message-Id: headers contain a local part that is to be created in a unique fashion. In order to do so, Mutt will “leak” some information to the outside world when sending messages: the generation of this header includes a step counter which is increased (and rotated) with every message sent. Other parts include the date, time, PID of mutt, and $hostname. In a longer running mutt session, others can make assumptions
16:57:47 <strcat[m]> about your mailing habits depending on the number of messages sent. If this is not desired, the header can be manually provided using $edit_headers (though not recommended).
16:57:49 <strcat[m]> why does mutt do this shit
16:57:56 <strcat[m]> instead of generating a random number
17:00:38 <valldrac> cx2[m]: anyone that has the knowledge to become a device maintainer can easily get a very well paid job right now in the industry
17:00:53 <valldrac> but a full time job doesn't left you much free time for contributing
17:01:21 <valldrac> there are exceptions for sure, like university researcher, or talented people that can get a sponsor
17:02:05 <valldrac> or have fixed incomes
17:10:10 <valldrac> you cannot spend too much time on training and helping people to onboard on technical stuff because the risk of leaving later is high :/
17:11:38 <cx2[m]> true... but if someone has the abilitiy to at least do a menial, but needed task, then it's better than not. Especially for someone that already has a day job
17:12:12 <cx2[m]> I don't even know if that's a thing
17:22:46 <valldrac> cx2[m]: the problem is Daniel's time is very valuable and scarce
17:23:02 <valldrac> we should find somehow tasks that doesn't require time from him
17:24:27 <cx2[m]> Oh for fucks, sake.... I understand that... we ALL understand that.... that's where others in the channel that  know what needs to be done, can help point those things out.
17:26:26 <cx2[m]> Solutions. Not more problems. I am, for one, do not have the background. But I am certain there is a way that I can  assist. Given that criteria, I would expect someone to say, "Hey, cx2 (or anyone else for that . matter), go download and do this thing.... or modifiy this page..... or whatever"
17:26:26 <valldrac> I cannot help to much on this... I've just arrived
17:26:47 <valldrac> I'm going to need some help to debug some nasty bugs near soon
17:27:26 <valldrac> for the Pixel 3a

17:31:10 <rutxonboard[m]> > I'm deciding between the 3/3a ATM. Thought I'll ask
17:31:10 <rutxonboard[m]> There's a device section on the sites. The main thing is the 3a has longer guaranteed support and the 3 has a much better camera in Graphene

17:38:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If you're coming from a 6P or similar, the 3a is off the fucking chain in every way, and I'm baffled/unanswered as to what, for example, people are lacking when it comes to the "shittier" camera, lol
17:39:24 <cx2[m]> josh.man: Agreed... Pretty big fan of the 3a. Actually a huge fan. But the 3 edges it out a bit in my opinion.
17:39:24 <cx2[m]> That said, the the rear camera is the exact same across ALL of the 3a/3 series.... this includes the XL models.
17:39:43 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <valldrac "there are exceptions for sure, l"> Or, Uni student looking for a co-op/internship credit in lieu of sitting in class learning MS Access or some whack shit, lmao
17:39:54 <cx2[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: The camera itself is literally the exact same... it's the software that's different.
17:41:20 <cx2[m]> Maybe someone can answer as to wether or not GOS takes advantage of Pixel Visual Core..... because if not? there is no different.
17:47:06 <cx2[m]> All of that said, can't go wrong with the 3a though. I would also add that the Spiegen Tough Armor case is one of the best looking/feeling cases I've used on any handset, and is a great compliment to the 3a.
17:50:03 <rutxonboard[m]> 3a XL seems good too
17:50:22 <rutxonboard[m]> 6" screen no notch
17:52:24 <cx2[m]> That one I can't attest to... I have the 3a and 3.... Was really tempted to spring for the XL, but for years I have been wanting phones to come back down in size a bit and the 3's in my opinion really hit the mark. MAYBE a touch wider would have been nice a la iPhoneXR-ish

18:15:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): so what's the whole problem?
18:15:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just buy grapheneos.cn yourself
18:16:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> If they can't even buy it
18:16:48 <strcat> not buying a bunch of domains I don't want
18:16:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> They don't have a case against you
18:16:54 <strcat> just bothers me they're trying to extort me
18:16:56 <strcat> for money
18:17:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Who
18:17:50 <strcat> that "domain registrar" emailing me
18:18:01 <nickcalyx[m]> The Chinese domain registrars do that to everone
18:18:38 <nickcalyx[m]> They always bug me to buy calyx.cn but I don't want to do business in China anyway so...
18:18:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos website came up way before that
18:18:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "that "domain registrar" emailing"> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): but that's impossible
18:20:20 <cx2[m]> anupritaisno1: google doesn't even own all of the google.XXX TLDs... Including google.cn. its a redirect.
19:02:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): I'm looking for documentation on Linux secure boot you got some?
19:02:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can't find it and need to know why the lockdown LSM is forced on secure boot
19:03:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> And how Linux does secure boot in general
19:04:09 <strcat[m]> because the desktop Linux people pushed a security theatre approach to secure boot that's meaningless
19:04:20 <strcat[m]> inherited from the legacy form of desktop Windows secure boot
19:04:31 <rutxonboard[m]> It's garbage
19:05:16 <cdesai> I'd look at chromiumos for non android boot protection
19:05:27 <strcat> it's very similar cdesai
19:05:40 <strcat> the android one is actually more modern now with AVB
19:05:47 <cdesai> strcat: I figured, given all the other similarities.
19:06:22 <cdesai> but I guess what I meant was more you might be able to take that and plug it in with the rest of the linux stack
19:06:32 <strcat> ChromeOS uses ugly TPM stuff
19:06:37 <strcat> instead of the nicer approach of the Titan M
19:06:41 <rutxonboard[m]> No you can't cdesai
19:07:21 <strcat> cdesai: traditional linux distributions are incompatible with verified boot, sandboxing for all third party code, proper full system MAC, etc.
19:07:38 <strcat> cdesai: the approach they take to the base system, updates, packages just doesn't work with that
19:07:47 <strcat> can't just drop anything in
19:07:54 <cdesai> true
19:09:08 <rutxonboard[m]> Porting Android to PC doesn't work since SELinux rules are not even remotely close to being decent. Wait for Fuchsia
19:09:32 <strcat> not sure what you mean by that
19:10:34 <rutxonboard[m]> BlissOS and Android-x86 have had a hard time getting anywhere with functioning security at all on PC with Android. I am not sure that's an option either
19:10:42 <strcat> they approach it wrong
19:11:25 <strcat> Android-x86 doesn't understand the security model, update model, etc.
19:11:38 <strcat> they fork the OS and do a bunch of stuff counter to how it's supposed to work / required to work
19:12:20 <strcat> AOSP runs fine on x86
19:12:41 <rutxonboard[m]> They don't even get security patches out, at least BlissOS does that. However the no sandboxing is bad
19:12:50 <strcat> ok but those are not AOSP
19:12:52 <rutxonboard[m]> > AOSP runs fine on x86
19:12:52 <rutxonboard[m]> Of course it's just a lot of work no?
19:12:53 <strcat> and they are also not Android
19:12:55 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Can't find it and need to know w"> They're tied together which is stupid.
19:12:56 <strcat> rutxonboard[m]: no
19:13:05 <strcat> rutxonboard[m]: you're talking about forks of AOSP which are *not* Android anymore
19:13:12 <strcat> and trying to use that to talk about AOSP / Android
19:13:14 <strcat> it doesn't make sense
19:15:57 <rutxonboard[m]> You could just get AOSP to boot on a laptop without the level of effort they have to put into it?
19:17:15 <strcat> yes
19:17:26 <strcat> they don't know what they're doing and don't understand the OS or security
19:17:52 <strcat> a lot of what they're doing is just reinventing it into something they're more familiar with and making it not Android
19:18:02 <rutxonboard[m]> Interesting, I have tried doing some logging and selinux testing, but the whole system was designed like crap
19:18:12 <strcat> AOSP runs fine on x86 and I don't know where you get the idea that it doesn't
19:18:16 <strcat> rutxonboard[m]: that's not AOSP / Android
19:18:27 <strcat> they're forks turning it into something totally different
19:18:51 <strcat> see FirefoxOS/KaiOS as other more extreme examples
19:19:14 <strcat> you're talking about a different OS and trying to apply stuff about that to AOSP - it's not correct
19:19:32 <strcat> AOSP x86 support works fine
19:19:42 <strcat> AOSP SELinux integration on x86 works fine
19:19:59 <rutxonboard[m]> I didn't imagine it was that bad. I will have to mess with that, could be interesting. Writing SELinux rules are something I am comfortable with, but Android-x86 was so crap
19:20:27 <strcat> AOSP runs on x86
19:20:31 <strcat> don't use Android-x86
19:20:33 <rutxonboard[m]> Thanks for correcting me
19:20:43 <strcat> that's a fork that's not AOSP and not actually Android per CTS/CDD
19:21:06 <strcat> it's like someone making GrapheneOS-arm64
19:21:14 <strcat> rolling back a bunch of security features
19:21:18 <strcat> making some weird installer
19:22:49 <rutxonboard[m]> Interesting I really gave up too early I guess
19:25:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat "AOSP runs on x86"> Thanks, this is news to me also. SEO etc is ruining the web =\
19:27:06 <strcat> GrapheneOS runs on x86
19:27:16 <strcat> in fact I make prebuilt Vanadium for x86_64 to make it easier to build
19:29:23 <strcat> no promises that it runs particularly well and doesn't discover assorted memory corruption bugs in mesa, etc.
19:29:25 <strcat> but it runs
19:30:05 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-targets
19:32:00 <rutxonboard[m]> I have that built and ran that on an emulator. I never tried that on a real PC
19:38:13 <JTL> 07:15 <@strcat> https://paste.xinu.at/xVz look at these motherfuckers trying to extort us
19:38:18 <JTL> I wouldn't even have responded tbh
19:38:42 <JTL> Gotten those before for companies I've worked with in the past. Unless there's more to it it just goes in the "lol" box
19:41:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): so how to do an aosp build and boot it off an emulator?
19:41:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> On x86
19:41:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> That'd actually be a lot of help to know where certain errors come from
19:41:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "I have that built and ran that o"> Though bare metal might be better
19:41:56 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: covered in the GrapheneOS build instructions

19:42:25 <strcat> choosecombo release sdk_phone_x86_64 user
19:42:29 <strcat> make -j20
19:42:41 <strcat> and to run the emulator, just use the emulator command
19:42:43 <strcat> that's it
19:43:01 <strcat> AOSP sets it all up for you

19:43:10 <strcat> er
19:43:36 <TheJollyRoger> Hi guys. Sorry about the delay and sluggishness - I'm experiencing a few uh... uh... "technical difficulties" involving graphics cards and Xorg and amdgpu not getting along (the usual suspects) and elogind and other various dumb stuff. I'll try to get back to anyone who pinged me earlier as soon as the darn computer's working again.
19:44:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mandatory Wayland reminder
19:44:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just kidding
19:44:28 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. don't know if that's tested and keyworded for my architecture.
19:44:48 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise, I would want to give it a try.
19:45:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): I don't think I have choosecombo. Is it included in your scripts?
19:45:33 <strcat> no
19:45:37 <strcat> it's an AOSP thing
19:45:44 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: you need to 'source build/envsetup.sh'
19:45:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah yes forgot
19:46:30 <strcat> our envsetup.sh is just a wrapper around that setting some environment variables and enabling batch scheduling
19:46:43 <strcat> instead of the usual interactive scheduling
19:47:23 <strcat> batch scheduling uses long time slices
19:54:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> You mean the chrt?
19:55:01 <strcat> yes
19:55:15 <strcat> makes builds faster and disrupts interactive usage less
19:55:42 <strcat> tells the kernel to optimize it for throughput, not latency
19:55:56 <JTL> That's sensible
19:55:59 <strcat> uses really long time slices and won't mess up interactive usage nearly as much
19:56:09 <strcat> makes build faster while disrupting your usage less
19:56:11 <strcat> worth doing
19:56:27 <strcat> although if you run the emulator inside that shell you wouldn't want it...
19:56:58 <strcat> maybe I should put it inside soong or w/e
19:58:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> What if I don't mind disruptions?
19:58:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because I build on a computer dedicated to just building android and nothing else
19:58:59 <strcat> batch scheduling is still faster
19:59:18 <strcat> if you use the normal scheduler it thinks it's interactive and keeps context switching quickly
19:59:22 <strcat> to provide good latency
19:59:24 <strcat> which is useless
19:59:42 <strcat> wastes a lot of resources especially after all the CPU side channel mitigations
20:00:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> So do all children of that process inherit the scheduling change?
20:00:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> That process = the shell
20:02:22 <strcat> yes
20:02:30 <strcat> it could also be used to run make instead
20:02:50 <strcat> the way I did it sets it on the shell you use to run it
20:02:55 <strcat> chrt -b -p 0 $$
20:03:10 <strcat> the alternative would be
20:03:13 <strcat> chrt -b make -j20
20:03:20 <strcat> might be better to suggest that, think I will
20:04:10 <strcat> chrt -b 0 make -j20
20:04:49 <strcat> or teach soong or w/e to set it
20:06:38 <strcat> strcat@thinktank i ~ master % bash
20:06:40 <strcat> [strcat@thinktank ~]$ chrt -p $$
20:06:42 <strcat> pid 225914's current scheduling policy: SCHED_OTHER
20:06:44 <JTL> Hey strcat, could I poke you for a sec (about GrapheneOS)

20:06:46 <strcat> [strcat@thinktank ~]$ chrt -bp 0 $$

20:06:52 <strcat> pid 225914's current scheduling priority: 0
20:06:54 <strcat> JTL: yes
20:18:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then he never asked

20:19:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> <mrxx_0[m] "Hello ladies and gentlemen "> mrxx_0: no

20:22:59 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
20:23:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because that's the only distribution to ship the hardened kernel officially
20:23:18 <bseeinu[m]> But the "your device is booting a different os" stayed. That normal, forever?
20:23:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: crack open a cold one for the boys
20:23:51 <mrxx_0[m]> Hey were should I look to start Android ? I am frustrated by my lack OK knowledge on the platform
20:24:19 <bseeinu[m]> Finally installed on blueline and relocked bootloader/oem but “your device is booting a different OS” stayed
20:24:27 <bseeinu[m]> Is that normal to have forevah?
20:24:34 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: arr!
20:24:36 * TheJollyRoger pours the rum!
20:24:47 <TheJollyRoger> bseeinu[m]: yes, that's normal and that's a good sign!
20:24:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> By reading

20:24:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then come back and learn programming
20:25:17 <TheJollyRoger> If you see that yellow warning sign, that means that the Verified boot is on and enforcing, and it's not loading Google's operating system, but one that's been signed by a different key -- but that it has been signed.
20:25:23 <bseeinu[m]> Nice, I love good signs. Seriously though? :D
20:25:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "Strcat is an arch user"> madaidan.: everybody use arch
20:25:33 <TheJollyRoger> You should visit https://attestation.app and try the remote auditor.
20:25:37 <TheJollyRoger> *remote attestation.
20:25:45 <TheJollyRoger> That'll allow you to prove that the root of trust is legit.
20:25:45 <bseeinu[m]> Ok cool, thanks for that
20:25:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: let's steal Google's key
20:26:20 <TheJollyRoger> As long as you see that yellow warning screen, you are good. It's if that screen turns *orange* that you should start to worry. If that screen ever becomes orange, your bootloader has been unlocked and the verified boot has been disabled.
20:26:22 <bseeinu[m]> I'll read that, hpping I don't need anything mounted on a server or other android phone :)
20:26:44 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "TheJollyRoger: let's steal Googl"> Replace all OSes with GlassROM
20:26:50 <bseeinu[m]> Oh I can put that on a 6P I Guess
20:27:08 <TheJollyRoger> bseeinu[m]: all you need is another device you can trust that won't lie to you.
20:27:18 <TheJollyRoger> *that you can trust not to lie to you.
20:27:50 <TheJollyRoger> The operating system running on the handset can lie to the display, but the operating system can't lie to the hardware-backed keystore and remote attestation.
20:29:42 <bseeinu[m]> Took 12 days to arrive but it's a new Pixel 3. Finally
20:29:49 <TheJollyRoger> I love the Pixel 3!
20:30:20 <bseeinu[m]> Just for the camera and wireless, I have wireless chargers everywhere since the launch of iPhone X
20:30:42 <TheJollyRoger> Bit of trivia you may find cool about Auditor: some rootkits (like magisk) are capable of lying to Android Debug Bridge, but Auditor can catch them red-handed. It's really neat.
20:31:06 <bseeinu[m]> uhuh

Exposure to water repeatedly will likely kill the USB slot and the wear and tear on the USB slot is not covered by warranty.

20:48:20 <strcat> yeah but don't usually need that target
20:48:25 <strcat> makes a bunch of pointless stuff
20:48:30 <strcat> just do target-files-package alone
20:48:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe that's a lineage addition
20:48:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> But just m uses 6 threads and -j does allow me to control how many I want to use
20:48:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah I just find it convenient the file name is constant
20:48:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> It does?
20:49:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've only ever seen it be like Dist: out/dist.... for 3 seconds and done
20:49:30 <strcat> for debug builds I would just use `m`
20:49:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> And yeah I also keep otatools
20:49:37 <strcat> not a specific target, don't need target-files-package
20:49:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe I should remove that
20:49:46 <strcat> debug builds -> `m`
20:50:04 <strcat> release builds that will be signed -> `m target-files-package` and then a release signing script
20:50:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's a remnant from when brotli was being a mess
20:50:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> And bro wasn't a thing
20:50:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Is brotli fixed now BTW?
20:51:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or does it still throw file not found
20:53:34 <strcat> is what fixed?
20:53:41 <strcat> the modern command is called brotli
20:53:47 <strcat> there are no issues with it now
21:02:55 <bseeinu[m]> Oh boy, swipe gestures for navigation and dark mode are two simple things that make the UX experience coming from iOS much more bearable
21:03:04 <bseeinu[m]> Especially gesture navigation. After almost 3 years on iPhone X, it's hard to go back
21:10:12 <nscnt> It's annoying that the white line actually occupies the screen up to the edges; it's still a bar. I like it better on iOS.
21:14:19 <bseeinu[m]> It actually takes up barely the speaker witdth on mine..?
21:17:05 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "They do not allow custom builds"> That's bullshit. They do allow custom builds. They just don't like random forks piggybacking off their server.
21:18:01 <JTL> madaidan[m]: ^^
21:18:21 <JTL> I've seen no evidence of client or account bans for third party clients/builds
21:18:35 <JTL> Just a bunch of vague hand waving and some fuss on GitHub
21:19:12 <bseeinu[m]> I need a Spotlight replacement :D
21:23:43 <nscnt> bseeinu[m]: The white line has only speaker width. Take a closer look in different apps.
21:24:10 <nscnt> The bar still takes up the whole screen width.
21:24:39 <bseeinu[m]> Yeah exaclty, at least in dark mode it;s basically like iOS except that on blueline the device is not all-screen
21:38:32 <valldrac> madaidan[m]: True, I've never an issue with my Signal fork
21:42:54 <limitless0[m]> Is it advisable to use adb to uninstall a app ? It wont uninstall otherwise either from settings menu or the app info uninstall
21:43:21 <valldrac> Signal is not community driven... they just published the source code. But regarding custom builds, they don't want people making business on top on their infrastructure. Just that
21:44:21 <JTL> I think the hostility towards the community is somewhat short sighted
21:44:57 <JTL> Obviously we can't have anarchy and merging in PRs from random folks unaudited monkeying with cryptography code, but the status quo isn't ideal
21:44:59 <cx2[m]> especially when looking at what they bring to the table
21:53:52 <valldrac> cx2[m]: what do you mean?
21:54:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> Loki will use an onion-routed version of the Signal protocol, but won't be cross-compatible with the Signal Foundation infrastructure. We'll have to see how Loki turns out. It could be really good.
21:55:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's a good concept anyway.
21:55:28 <cx2[m]> an application that makes it harder and harder for the average consumer to say no.
21:55:28 <cx2[m]> Ive successfully got most of my family on it now.
21:56:31 <cx2[m]> cyborgninjaneer: Loki is now "Session".... it's a bit rough at the moment, but I have it
21:57:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> Well, I'm not referring strictly to the messaging app. The whole network and the currency is a nice concept.
21:57:25 <cx2[m]> 052b524d8ccbcd29e68169ecb84a43ccee2334b42f1e138e5e92774f8a1e107020
21:58:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> Oh, is that your Loki public key or whatever?
21:58:40 <cx2[m]> right
21:58:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'll get session when it's on Fdroid.
22:00:54 <cx2[m]> Michael Bazzell interviewed these guys not too long ago
22:02:07 <analogpathy[m]> <cx2[m] "Michael Bazzell interviewed thes"> They also had a presentation for Session in some sort of convention when it came out day one.
22:02:30 <analogpathy[m]> also, you should read https://getsession.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Session-Whitepaper.pdf
22:02:41 <analogpathy[m]> there's many things that haven't been implemented yet
22:02:51 <analogpathy[m]> on paper it looks good but right now I wouldn't use it as my form of direct messaging
22:03:06 <valldrac> right, the routing protocol is not working yet
22:03:44 <cx2[m]> no not at all. But it could be pretty slick in the not too distant future.
22:51:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <bseeinu[m] "Now I have to convince everyone "> 80+% of the world is on Android, fuck your social circle, honestly.
22:51:52 <bseeinu[m]> I'll forward that to my mom
22:54:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> 😝
22:54:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Forward a 3aXL to her instead, preloaded with m.facebook.com pre-logged in, and a Riot account with a direct chat to yours. Worked for me!
22:55:11 <cx2[m]> Oh i do like that Idea
22:55:38 <bseeinu[m]> She has signal actually :)
23:25:24 <dazinism> Theres been some chat over the months about setting up a community wiki.
23:25:34 <dazinism> For GrapheneOS
23:25:54 <dazinism> I'm thinking I'd like to do this
23:28:18 <dazinism> Somewhere for community to work on documentation - some of which could maybe end up on grapheneos.org  Also somewhere for other stuff thats less likely to be suitable for inclusion there.
23:28:31 <dazinism> Anyone got any thoughts
23:28:43 <dazinism> Particularly strcat
23:29:30 <dazinism> I'd be very happy to share admin of the wiki with other long term members of this channel/community
23:37:09 <bseeinu[m]> Alternatives to reddit could be Lemmy, or even Discourse.
23:37:27 <bseeinu[m]> Discourse has extensions for Kanban/tickets
23:41:20 <JTL> dazinism: Talk to JollyRoger, he's done the most preexisting work there
23:42:17 <dazinism> JTL: yeah, done that, TJR is up for being involved
23:42:23 <JTL> Alright
23:42:54 <JTL> My fear is we're going to have multiple seperate projects with the same goal but different people and duplicated the work involved
23:43:03 <JTL> I might discuss with him some more later
23:44:15 <dazinism> <JTL "My fear is we're going to have m"> What you mean?
23:44:36 <dazinism> Working on community space for GrapheneOS
23:45:22 <dazinism> Or multiple projects, GrapheneOS & other similar??
23:46:42 <JTL> I mean without coordination other people would start a documentation/wiki project and have twice the effort towards the same goal
23:49:23 <dazinism> Well I guess thats part why I mention it, to start coordinating with folks
23:49:35 <JTL> Of course
23:50:33 <dazinism> I often work on projects with open organizing groups
23:54:06 <JTL> Of course
23:56:16 <dazinism> JTL: I remember some chat some months ago, but nothing materialized.
23:56:50 <JTL> Yeah okay
23:56:57 <JTL> I might have some more discussions with JollyRoger later
23:56:57 <dazinism> Is anyone still working on anything?
23:57:32 <JTL> Jolly has some public drafs
23:57:34 <JTL> drafts
