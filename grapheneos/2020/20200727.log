00:09:13 <ille_[m]> pixel phone arrived!! gonna install grapheneos asap
00:09:45 <ille_[m]> any tips or recommendations while I install it?
00:10:21 <ille_[m]> also should I install stable or beta?
00:10:25 <travankor_> wow that was fast
00:10:27 <overheadscallop[> follow the official install guide at https://grapheneos.org/install not a youtube video
00:10:52 <ille_[m]> living in a major city has its perks I guess lol
00:11:25 <ille_[m]> I would like to install beta and contribute to like reporting bugs or other quirks but is it stable enough as an everyday driver?
01:38:54 <renlord> ille_[m]: yes, i use beta as a my daily driver
03:46:32 <switchdominion[m> I've noticed a couple of people have had issues on the Pixel 4 with screen flickering at 90hz. I installed GOS on my Pixel 4 with no such issues. Specifically from, while reading through the chat, travankor . I checked the developer options and there is no 'Force 90hz Refresh Rate' option, so I'm having trouble reproducing the issue. Can anyone speak to why that option isn't available?
03:50:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> switchdominion: the app responsible for refresh rate control toggles is closed source and causes crashes on AOSP
03:51:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since these crashes are actually occurring in the system itself your device may boot to recovery and repeatedly ask you to format. Not to mention the app does not work at all
03:51:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> An upstream ticket has been open for quite a while and Google did not take any action
04:06:32 <renlord> how does pixel4 pass CTS then
04:06:39 <renlord> should not be android compatible lol
04:08:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't ship the app?
04:08:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Implementing a force 90 hz toggle isn't a part of CTS
04:09:10 <renlord> isnt there a cts suite that tests display?
04:09:27 <renlord> i suppose causing epilepsy is not necessarily part of the cts test suite
04:20:50 <Knull[m]> Holy shit, i thought the phone i got was bad. I'm glad to hear it's not just me
04:35:07 <switchdominion[m> Thanks, anupritaisno1. So, other people have screen flickering on GOS with refresh rates over 90hz and I might have been lucky with the device I acquired but is there any information I can gleam from my device that could help resolve this issue for others?
04:36:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> switchdominion: the issue is present on all devices
04:37:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's just that a few people are more sensitive to it so they notice it
04:43:05 <switchdominion[m> anupritaisno1: Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the issue. Perhaps I should be grateful I'm not as sensitive to the flickering ðŸ˜‚

05:49:31 <nickcalyx[m]> I.read 90Hz seriously kills battery too
05:49:54 <anonhat[m]> Would explain the Pixel 4's shitty battery life.
05:51:40 <cdesai> Yeah its real bad. Barely lasts a day and I don't even use my phone that much
05:52:02 <renlord> how does screen refresh if the screen is off for most of the day?
05:52:09 <cdesai> Haven't noticed the flickering yet myself though
05:52:24 <cdesai> renlord: what?
05:55:46 <anonhat[m]> Refresh should usually only occur when the screen is on, but OLED displays like those in the Pixels have background display functionality which allow them to be "off" but still display background graphics in low power mode.
05:56:07 <anonhat[m]> Intuitively, I think that may be part of the problem.
05:56:33 <cdesai> Low power mode for oleds is basically only turning on a subset of the LEDs unlike LCD where it's all or nothing
05:57:10 <cdesai> also why true black night mode instead of just a dark color would help battery life. Black for oled means the pixel is totally off drawing no power
06:53:15 <joshman[m]> Finally decided to use multiple profiles
06:53:15 <joshman[m]> Can someone point onto how to activate app installation? Fdroid won't install. There was some toggle somewhere (not the on inside vanadium, that one is on already)
06:53:16 <joshman[m]> Also. Does multiple profiles affect performance?Like on my PC having multiple users eats up tons of RAM
06:56:50 <strcat[m]> you're trying to install an outdated version of F-Droid
06:57:01 <strcat[m]> it has to be the same version or newer as what's installed elsewhere
07:52:44 <dazinism> josh.man: this has got some info about using profiles https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
07:53:28 <dazinism> Stuff running on a different profile does get shut down in the background, like in the main profile.
07:54:41 <dazinism> Checking with running services in developer options it does appear that some things keep running
07:55:26 <dazinism> Can restart the device to stop this
07:55:38 <dazinism> Or force stop apps
07:56:13 <joshman[m]> Ok. Then no multiple users for me then ðŸ™„ too much of a hassle
07:57:41 <joshman[m]> Slower, VPN issue, forcing stop apps. Naaah.
08:07:46 <anonhat[m]> I never thought there would be a day I would ask for 8 GB+ of RAM on an Android phone...
08:27:36 <renlord> very few apps actually run in background
08:27:54 <renlord> and the oomkiller is quite eager to reap processes when there is not enough memory
08:29:20 <chrono[m]> Android doesn't handle memory like a desktop. You basically want near 100% memory usage. It caches stuff so it's quicker and can handle closing apps to make room for memory easily.
08:32:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <chrono[m] "Android doesn't handle memory li"> This is wrong have a day
08:34:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just an average day
08:34:41 <renlord> there's a balancing act between having more memory vs. battery consumption
08:35:02 <renlord> ram sticks do sip a bit more battery over time
08:35:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord: gib 16 GB sar
08:35:30 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Just an average day "> I don't think that is a good idea right now
08:35:43 * chrono[m] uploaded an image: 15958389178978124986597540245002.png (68KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/tchncs.de/ljCfTHEVgJViztMzJheXaZbh >
08:35:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> No I'm actually serious
08:36:01 <chrono[m]> Here's a friendly and easy to understand image from Google
08:36:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> I thought 12 gb on the op7pro would be enough
08:36:14 <renlord> but 4gb is a bit little with all that evicting and reloading, you probably use more battery spinning the core
08:36:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> But I pretty much filled it
08:36:30 <renlord> 8gb probably the sweet spot
08:36:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> I could use some 16gb to open a few 100 more chrome tabs rn
08:36:40 <renlord> max 2 dimm modules on the sbc
08:36:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord: quad channel on pixel
08:36:59 <renlord> there was a ram shortage when pixel3 was released i think
08:37:24 <chrono[m]> Only time low ram has affected me is closing out some games when I swapped apps
08:37:44 <chrono[m]> Most apps are generally good at handling sudden shutdowns and relaunches
08:38:04 <chrono[m]> Since it's part of Android's design they will kill your app at any time
08:38:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord: we need 64 GB of ram on phones
08:38:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just so that you can flex on it
08:39:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well I would buy a 64GB ram phone
10:03:07 <cdesai> honestly at this point I just try to use phones as a user without caring what amount of RAM it has. I also usually always get the cheapest variant anyway, and so far it's been fine.
10:03:40 <cn3m[m]> cdesai: you mean on storage?
10:04:02 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: yeah pixels have uniform RAM, but others have more RAM when you pay for more storage
10:04:45 <cn3m[m]> ah fair
10:04:47 <cn3m[m]> I do too
10:05:55 <cdesai> I have 64GB on desktop, had 32 but then it wouldn't be usable when compiling which wasn't fun.
10:06:12 <anonhat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Well I would buy a 64GB ram phon"> There are IBM mainframes with less RAM. In fact, that's the minimum loadout you can have in an IBM z15.
10:06:15 <cdesai> now I can't really notice.
10:15:08 <anonhat[m]> Are there any plans for a port to RISC-V? I would like to see the groundwork laid for a fully open source, hardened phone.
10:15:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> anonhat: no
10:16:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not unless we had an entire IT department
10:16:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> RISC-V isn't even supported by android so we'd have to add supoort
10:16:45 <anonhat[m]> It can't be that hard. Debian's RISC-V port has, like, three contributors IIRC.
10:17:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well they don't have standards
10:17:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's Debian
10:18:01 <cn3m[m]> Debian security is waiting for other people to find issues
10:18:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: I call Debian either debshit or downtime OS
10:18:56 <anonhat[m]> Oh, my. Don't go trash talking my OS, now.
10:19:38 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "cn3m: I call Debian either debsh"> ^
10:19:46 <cn3m[m]> <anonhat[m] "Oh, my. Don't go trash talking m"> Debian is so bad man..
10:20:15 <cdesai> you know, trash talking other projects like this is really not nice.
10:20:15 <cdesai> Sure, point out it's flaws, say which it's bad technically if you feel like it.
10:20:15 <cdesai> but name calling, really?
10:20:18 <cdesai> what are we, 10?
10:20:19 <anonhat[m]> I like it because it's stable and I can run it on my toaster.
10:21:22 <Kurai> you mean outdated?
10:21:40 <anonhat[m]> You mean not beta/alpha stage?
10:22:25 <cn3m[m]> cdesai: the main problem is when projects claim to be security focused so strongly. Debian saltstack took a week and we saw that attack in the wild look at the Lineage server hack
10:22:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai "you know, trash talking other pr"> Well I will
10:22:43 <cn3m[m]> I can see the frustration
10:22:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> If something is shit I will call it out
10:22:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is why I piss many people but I don't play pretend
10:23:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Debshit has caused 8 months of combined downtime for glassrom
10:23:25 <cn3m[m]> it would be like GrapheneOS calling itself a haven of user tweakability and customization
10:23:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Archlinux stands at just 20 minutes
10:23:33 <anonhat[m]> The point is that a RISC-V port is possible. Android has been ported to MIPS and x86 in the past. It's doable.
10:23:43 <cn3m[m]> <anonhat[m] "The point is that a RISC-V port "> no it is not possible
10:23:57 <anonhat[m]> It is though.
10:23:59 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is not possible to support anything beside Pixels right now
10:24:10 <anonhat[m]> ...
10:24:11 <cn3m[m]> no it is not
10:24:19 <cn3m[m]> find one RISC-V machine that means the requirements
10:24:23 <cn3m[m]> I will be impressed
10:24:34 <cn3m[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
10:24:50 <cn3m[m]> if it doesn't meet the requirements it is not GrapheneOS
10:24:52 <anonhat[m]> Go ahead and explain why. I already know why only Pixels are supported, but go ahead and tell me why a RISC-V board can't be found or built which meets the security requirements.
10:25:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because nobody bothers to anonhat
10:25:52 <cn3m[m]> of course you could build one, but not even the OpenTitan project has cracked the very small part is the security chip
10:26:08 <cn3m[m]> that is one requirement there are many
10:26:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> The FOSS team is like "hardware encryption bad", " hardware attestation bad" and so on
10:26:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> They're literally hostile to the stuff we need to make it secure
10:26:38 <cn3m[m]> That is how we get Purism shipping with known vulnerabilities
10:26:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even when there's completely free as in freedom hardware that is proven to be secure they'll reject it
10:26:53 <cn3m[m]> The FSF is dragging down privacy
10:26:56 <anonhat[m]> The LowRISC project is literally a RISC-V based hardware ROT chip project.
10:26:56 <anonhat[m]> https://www.lowrisc.org/
10:27:17 <anonhat[m]> If you want hardware crypto, there you go.
10:27:41 <anonhat[m]> Oh
10:27:51 <anonhat[m]> They rebranded as OpenTitan. God damn I am out of the loop.
10:28:02 <cn3m[m]> np
10:28:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway thing is it is possible but
10:28:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't have the resources
10:29:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> The FOSS community is openly hostile to some of our ideas
10:29:58 <anonhat[m]> As an ambassador of said supposedly hostile community, I can assure you that my only complaint about hardware crypto is the fact that it uses (at the moment) proprietary hardware. OpenTitan will presumably fix that.
10:30:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> anonhat: no it does not
10:30:22 <anonhat[m]> And in general, I like GOS and support its goals.
10:30:24 <cn3m[m]> You should read the FSF guidelines for a recommended device
10:30:29 <cn3m[m]> it is garbage
10:30:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google has made a requirement in the CTS that hardware and software encryption must produce exactly the same result
10:31:11 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "You should read the FSF guidelin"> Do you have a link?
10:31:16 <cn3m[m]> that is how you get the Librem 5 and PinePhone without the option of signed firmware
10:31:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only the implementation and not the format must change
10:31:23 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Do you have a link?"> I can find it
10:31:25 <anonhat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Google has made a requirement in"> But the Titan M chip is still a black box.
10:31:55 <cn3m[m]> https://ryf.fsf.org/about/criteria/EssentialChaos:
10:31:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> anonhat: it doesn't matter because they have to proof that encryption in SW and from the titan M is exactly the same
10:32:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> In other words hardware based encryption must only change the implementation and not the on disk format
10:32:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> * anonhat: it doesn't matter because they have to prove that encryption in SW and from the titan M is exactly the same
10:32:44 <cn3m[m]> anonhat: anu is right, but the other thing to consider is you are trusting so many companies with firmware and root certs you name it
10:32:50 <cn3m[m]> Titan M should be the least of your worries
10:32:54 <anonhat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "anonhat: it doesn't matter becau"> But because there are so many possible combinations of inputs and outputs, I would question the totality of the accuracy of such tests. Further, how do we know that Google hasn't backdoored the chip to allow bypassing the rate limiter?
10:33:18 <cn3m[m]> it also has insider attack resistance and rollback protection
10:33:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you rely on a rate limiter to prevent brute forces on a password you might as well hire a monkey that just shoots at everything as a security guard
10:34:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Set a strong password. Nothing else should ever be considered to be secure
10:34:24 <cn3m[m]> <cn3m[m] "it also has insider attack resis"> the Titan M is extremely hard for Google to backdoor for the government(a
10:34:30 <anonhat[m]> The rate limiter is referenced in GrapheneOS documentation as a reason for only supporting the Pixels.
10:35:00 <cn3m[m]> The SEP has been going strong for 7 years on the Apple front. Google traditionally keeps up pretty well
10:35:31 <cn3m[m]> Titan M should hold, but no guarantees of course
10:35:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: do you think google could like sign apps with a per user key with bundles?
10:36:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> An attacker would have to compromise millions of keys instead of one then
10:36:30 <cn3m[m]> right, but the side effect is you would have less verification
10:36:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Users could opt in to encrypt their keys with their account
10:38:15 <cn3m[m]> would definitely improve the pinning situation
10:38:37 <cn3m[m]> it is better than Google signing everything
10:38:46 <SchismXL[m]> <anonhat[m] "The rate limiter is referenced i"> A long password should circumvent most brute force attacks. So, even if they did have a "backdoor" to bypass the chip, it would still take a lot of compute time to cycle through potential passwords.
10:38:55 <cn3m[m]> ideally devs would sign everything themselves, but alas
10:39:06 <cn3m[m]> <SchismXL[m] "A long password should circumven"> Key Derivation too
10:39:20 <cn3m[m]> SEP is using it I would bet $50 Titan M is too
10:39:48 <cn3m[m]> 150ms with a dedicated crypto engine for the SEP which is way more than it sounds
10:41:03 <anonhat[m]> <SchismXL[m] "A long password should circumven"> I'm aware of this. But for the sake of the average user, who won't want to use a long password on their phone, a rate limiter that has been thoroughly audited for vulnerabilities makes sense.
10:41:16 <cn3m[m]> if you have an iPhone with a 10 digit PIN it would take 700 years for it to bruteforce itself with a bypassed hardware ratelimiter
10:42:29 <cn3m[m]> long password + biometrics is probably the way to go though
10:42:47 <cn3m[m]> more robust and protects from shoulder surfing and CCTV
10:42:59 <SchismXL[m]> <anonhat[m] "The rate limiter is referenced i"> As an example, it would take 58 minutes of compute time to crack the password "grapheneos". Add 1 to that, it'll take 1 month to crack. Add an exclamation mark, so your password is now " grapheneos1!" It'll take 200 years. Now, just adding 123 to the end of the password would take approximately 32 million years of compute time to crack the password "grapehenos1!123". So,
10:42:59 <SchismXL[m]> even if they did have a backdoor, they'd be taking their sweet time with the device lol
10:43:15 <anonhat[m]> <cn3m[m] "long password + biometrics is pr"> Oh yeah. Biometrics. Because no one ever lost a finger due to the access they had to a fingerprint-locked system.
10:43:37 <cn3m[m]> only in screen fingerprint sensors can't detect a dead finger
10:43:53 <cn3m[m]> anyway https://xkcd.com/538/

10:45:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Try brute forcing any of these
10:45:19 <cn3m[m]> grapehenos1!123 would take 120.34 thousand centuries for the NSA to bruteforce in 2013

10:52:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> The only copy of the detached header is on the boot partition
10:52:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "What is a "detached header"?"> Basically even if you have the password you can't decrypt it
10:52:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Android already does this btw

10:53:07 <anonhat[m]> TPM is bad. Even the German government thinks so.
10:53:25 <cn3m[m]> let me guess you think it is a backdoor?

10:56:22 <anonhat[m]> The issue of TPM as a black box remains, though. And it's implemented by companies with a history of severe hardware level vulnerabilities. Spectre? Meltdown? Anyone?
10:56:43 <EssentialChaos[m> <anupritaisno1[m] "Somebody wanted to make glassrom"> Let me guess... in Techlore Telegram?

11:00:29 <cn3m[m]> 3a is not that slow
11:00:44 <cn3m[m]> it is overrated the impact

11:01:34 <cn3m[m]> NewPipe is not a super smappy app to be honest

11:01:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes it is actually faster on oneplus as the storage is almost 2-3x faster

19:38:01 <LinusSexTips[m]> VPNs are overrated but I trust moolvlad more than my isp
19:38:36 <q22[m]> I'm having trouble establishing a connection
19:38:55 <cn3m[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "VPNs are overrated but I trust m"> this
19:39:24 <LinusSexTips[m]> <q22[m] "I'm having trouble establishing "> regenerate wireguard key?
19:39:35 <q22[m]> Whereas wireguard doesn't have any problems
19:40:00 <q22[m]> I'll give it a try
19:40:04 <q22[m]> Thanks
19:40:47 <LinusSexTips[m]> just go to settings -> advanced -> wireguard key -> regenerate
19:59:38 <LRS> hello, I'm on flashing my Pixel4XL with the coral-factory-2020.07.06.20.zip. while flashing it shows:archive does not contain 'vendor_boot.img'
19:59:38 <LRS> extracting super_empty.img (0 MB) to disk... took 0.000s
19:59:54 <LRS> is this normal?
20:04:49 <LRS> I'm ending in the GrapheneOS Recovery... should I load something via sideload? this is not prvided on the homepage, please excuse the stupid questions
20:21:56 <SchismXL[m]> LRS are you following the guide on the website or something else?
20:22:37 <LRS> just the guide on the website, but i'm a newbie
20:23:07 <SchismXL[m]> What operating system are you using?
20:23:20 <LRS> manjaro linux
20:23:55 <SchismXL[m]> And have you checked to see if fastboot is the latest version?
20:24:04 <LRS> yes sir
20:24:21 <SchismXL[m]> Good start!
20:24:35 <SchismXL[m]> Have you verified all the downloads?
20:24:56 <LRS> this is my second try
20:24:56 <LRS> via signify
20:25:42 <LRS> but where is the .img? do i have to load it somewhere else?
20:25:48 <SchismXL[m]> Yeah, either signify or signify-openbsd.
20:26:01 <LRS> i used signify
20:26:35 <SchismXL[m]> Everything should be in the zip folder. Have you downloaded it again?
20:29:07 <LRS> I loaded the files on diffrent machines, same result
20:29:07 <LRS> it contains the bootloader-coral-c2f2-0.2-6374983.img and the raddio-coral etc.img
20:30:02 <LRS> and the image-coral-2020.07.06.20.zip
20:30:32 <LRS> but I think this is something that I dont have to unzip
20:31:33 <SchismXL[m]> Let me just get my laptop
20:32:00 <LRS> thanks, take your time
20:35:04 <SchismXL[m]> Okay, so once you've flashed everything, what screen does the phone show?
20:35:42 <LRS> it ended in the grapheneos recovery
20:35:50 <LRS> i think
20:35:50 <LRS>  
20:36:12 <LRS> w8 i'll do it again to say it clearly
20:38:30 <LRS> ok wrong it shows a warning messages that the bootloader is unlocked
20:38:30 <LRS> --> next google-splash-screen
20:38:30 <LRS> --> next fastbootd --> grapheneOS FastBoot
20:38:59 <SchismXL[m]> Yep, let it do it's thing
20:40:09 <SchismXL[m]> If you're following the guide, it will boot into fastbootd and will reboot once it has finished. It will then go back to the bootloader screen, where you can relock the bootloader
20:40:16 <LRS> ok, how? I have the options:
20:40:16 <LRS> Reboot system now
20:40:16 <LRS> Enter Recovery
20:40:16 <LRS> Reboot to bootloader
20:40:16 <LRS> Power off
20:41:11 <LRS> on the other hand seems the flash-all.sh not ready yet... should I reboot to bootloader that the script can finsh?
20:41:29 <SchismXL[m]> Let's start from the beginning, yes
20:41:36 <LRS> thanks
20:42:23 <LRS> script is finished, now I should lock the bootloader?
20:42:57 <SchismXL[m]> If the phone has booted back into the bootloader screen, where it says it is unlocked, yes
20:43:13 <LRS> ok
20:43:32 <SchismXL[m]> If this doesn't work, we can work our way through together
20:44:33 <LRS> thanks a lot
20:44:33 <LRS> bootloader is locked
20:44:33 <LRS> i would now try to boot into the system
20:46:09 <LRS> i got a warning message, that my device will load a different OS, GOOGLE appeared short and it boots into the bootlader
20:46:50 <SchismXL[m]> Okay, no worries. It should boot into GrapheneOS after the Google screen (which is normal)
20:46:54 <SchismXL[m]> The warning message is also normal
20:47:31 <LRS> i'm back on the bootloader
20:47:45 <LRS> enter reason: reboot bootloader
20:48:08 <SchismXL[m]> Okay, assuming your bootloader is now locked, unlock it again
20:48:26 <LRS> it show device state lock
20:48:32 <LRS> i will lock it
20:49:17 <LRS> device state: unlocked
20:49:25 <SchismXL[m]> Good, okay
20:50:02 <SchismXL[m]> Now, I know this is going to be a bit of a nuisance, but the best thing to do is to delete all the files you've downloaded, so we can go through the install process again
20:50:37 <LRS> thank, i think it would be the best

20:54:24 <LRS> kk, factory is loading, it should be ready in 9 min...
20:55:04 <SchismXL[m]> No rush :)
20:56:36 <LRS> total of 1039M is correct?
20:59:51 <SchismXL[m]> Should be approx. 1.1gb
21:01:16 <SchismXL[m]> Once downloaded*
21:01:27 <SchismXL[m]> But yeah, uGet is showing 1039

21:03:41 <SchismXL[m]> Excellent, so now we're able to go onto the next part
21:04:11 <SchismXL[m]> unzip coral-factory-2020.07.60.20.zip
21:04:11 <LRS> unzip coral-factory-2020.07.06.20.zip
21:04:17 <LRS> ^^
21:04:29 <LRS> done
21:04:55 <LRS> now sudo fastboot ./flash-all.sh
21:05:08 <LRS> wrong -fastboot
21:05:18 <LRS> just flash-all
21:05:20 <SchismXL[m]> I was going to say
21:05:27 <LRS> sorry
21:06:09 <LRS> was i right?
21:06:26 <SchismXL[m]> Haha, don't worry. While it isn't necessarily recommended to use sudo for this, it shouldn't harm
21:06:48 <SchismXL[m]> I usually do "sudo su" to elevate myself, then just run ./flash-all.sh
21:08:32 <LRS> ok warnig message and the fastbootd-screen
21:08:36 <LRS> +n
21:08:49 <SchismXL[m]> Just let it do it's thing
21:08:56 <SchismXL[m]> Don't touch it until you're back onto the bootloader screen
21:09:28 <LRS> i dont have to do something?
21:09:36 <SchismXL[m]> Sit back and relax
21:09:56 <LRS> i doesn't seem that there is something happen
21:10:04 <SchismXL[m]> I know
21:10:11 <LRS> dont say
21:10:31 <SchismXL[m]> On the fastbootd screen, it looks like nothing is happening. Eventually, the phone will reboot.
21:10:41 <SchismXL[m]> If you check the terminal, is anything happening?
21:10:46 <LRS> script is waiting for device
21:11:28 <SchismXL[m]> And it is now in fastbootd?
21:11:35 <LRS> should i:
21:11:35 <LRS> reboot system now
21:11:35 <LRS> enter recovery
21:11:35 <LRS> reboot to bootloader
21:11:35 <LRS> power off
21:11:35 <LRS> ?
21:11:49 <SchismXL[m]> Go back to bootloader
21:11:54 <LRS> ok
21:12:03 <SchismXL[m]> It shouldn't be doing that
21:12:17 <LRS> script says finished
21:12:34 <SchismXL[m]> We're going to try the process again
21:12:36 <LRS> stop
21:12:47 <LRS> there is a errormessage:
21:13:11 <LRS> fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable.
21:13:37 <SchismXL[m]> Don't worry, we can try again
21:13:44 <LRS> kk
21:14:06 <LRS> should i flash again?
21:14:23 <SchismXL[m]> On bootloader screen, do you see your device when doing fastboot devices?
21:14:50 <SchismXL[m]> Did you download platform-tools, too?
21:14:59 <SchismXL[m]> Can you do fastboot --version for me, with sudo?
21:15:14 <LRS> i see my serialnumber
21:15:14 <LRS>  
21:15:36 <LRS> fastboot version 30.0.0-2
21:15:42 <SchismXL[m]> Good, at least it is seeing the phone!
21:16:03 <SchismXL[m]> Is that with sudo, yeah?
21:16:36 <SchismXL[m]> It is an older version of fastboot than the one recommended on the guide
21:17:07 <SchismXL[m]> What I want you to do is to download the platform-tools from the guide:
21:17:10 <SchismXL[m]> curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.3-linux.zip
21:17:10 <SchismXL[m]> echo '19c74e779f3d81f15ba21207ec405439416d99330c3f5a337dab6d58ea20b465 platform-tools_r30.0.3-linux.zip' | sha256sum -c
21:17:10 <SchismXL[m]> unzip platform-tools_r30.0.3-linux.zip
21:17:22 <LRS> but the told, that the arch packeges where updated?
21:17:22 <LRS>  
21:17:36 <SchismXL[m]> Manjaro can lag behind sometimes
21:17:52 <LRS> i'll download
21:18:02 <LRS> sorry
21:18:29 <SchismXL[m]> Don't worry. I'm on Mint, so I have to follow it to the letter anyways
21:21:03 <SchismXL[m]> Once you've downloaded the platform-tools, elevate yourself using sudo su, then do this:
21:21:05 <LRS> ok unzipped everything
21:21:11 <SchismXL[m]> export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
21:21:45 <SchismXL[m]> The reason why I'm saying to do it in su, is because if you do that just for a normal user, it won't change it for sudo.
21:22:11 <LRS> fastboot version 30.0.3-6597393
21:22:11 <LRS> and i'm root via su
21:22:20 <SchismXL[m]> Nice
21:22:33 <SchismXL[m]> Okay, now try running ./flash-all.sh
21:22:40 <LRS> ok
21:23:00 <SchismXL[m]> And don't touch the phone lol
21:23:06 <LRS> ^^
21:23:14 <LRS> it begins...
21:23:53 <LRS> fastbootd again
21:24:04 <SchismXL[m]> Terminal waiting for device?
21:24:09 <LRS> yes
21:24:25 <LRS> reboot bootloader?
21:24:29 <SchismXL[m]> No
21:24:33 <LRS> ok
21:24:40 <SchismXL[m]> Unplug the device and plug it back in
21:25:03 <LRS> done, nothing happens
21:26:07 <SchismXL[m]> Hmm
21:27:17 <LRS> how long should it take?
21:27:28 <SchismXL[m]> The only thing I can think of is that you're missing android udev r ules
21:27:29 <SchismXL[m]> rules
21:28:29 <LRS> dump question: what should i do?
21:29:04 <SchismXL[m]> Check your repositories or aur to see if you can install android udev rules that way
21:29:06 <SchismXL[m]> Or...
21:29:41 <LRS> i'll take a look
21:31:00 <LRS> ok seem that say missed
21:31:52 <LRS> installed theme
21:31:56 <LRS> -e
21:32:19 <LRS> should i start from the beginning?
21:32:22 <SchismXL[m]> Good, now try flash-all.sh again, with su
21:32:27 <LRS> kk
21:33:24 <LRS> fastbootd
21:33:38 <LRS> waiting for any device
21:34:08 <SchismXL[m]> What I was going to say after "Or..." is, if the rules wasn't in your repositories, you could download them from https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/raw/master/51-android.rules then copy them to /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
21:34:27 <SchismXL[m]> Just leave it for a few minutes and see if it does anything
21:34:35 <LRS> ok
21:34:50 <SchismXL[m]> The next thing to try is another cable, if you have one
21:36:39 <SchismXL[m]> Or do what i just said above, copying the 51-android.rules file to that directory, then run "sudo chmod a+r 51-android.rules" in the same directory as that file.
21:37:10 <LRS> i'll do
21:39:04 <LRS> ok i start again
21:40:33 <SchismXL[m]> Worst case scenario, you can always run the Google installer through Chrome to get back to "official" and then try the whole process again
21:41:10 <LRS> i'll got via flashing the old version back, the last time i tried
21:41:50 <LRS> fastbootd...
21:42:28 <SchismXL[m]> Waiting for device again?
21:43:13 <LRS> yeah, but i missed something... one mom please
21:44:47 <LRS> after creating the udev rule and changing the right to read 4 all, do i have to do something else?
21:45:17 <LRS> maybe rebooting?
21:45:37 <SchismXL[m]> Nah, it should be fine. However, you could reboot your computer. You'd then have to do export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH" again
21:46:07 <SchismXL[m]> And try another cable and/or port
21:46:40 <LRS> i just can change the port, and can grap another cable tomorrow from work
21:46:56 <SchismXL[m]> The official cable that came in the box didn't work for me on my Pixel 4 XL, so I used an older one from a spare Xperia I have floating around
21:47:51 <LRS> they wrote, that there are problems with usb3.0, maybe i can find a cable from another device
21:48:23 <SchismXL[m]> That's probably it
21:48:41 <LRS> but man, thanks a lot for your time
21:49:17 <SchismXL[m]> You seem to be clued up on the installation now, though. Sorry we couldn't get it sorted - but once it gets to fastbootd, it should detect the device and then it'll go through some progress bars on the terminal. Eventually, it'll reboot back to bootloader and then you can lock the bootloader
21:49:53 <SchismXL[m]> No worries. I don't have the skills people have here regarding coding and the like, so I just try to contribute by helping every once in a while
21:51:16 <SchismXL[m]> And, btw, if you end up having screen flickering on your Pixel 4 XL (yes, I moan about it a lot), just search the logs. It took me a while, but I've ended up forcing 60hz all the time using adb.
21:51:19 <LRS> thanks again, i will reboot my computer, try again and if it fails agian, i'll going to load the official rom back on
21:52:13 <SchismXL[m]> Good luck!
21:52:53 <SchismXL[m]> If you need any more help tomorrow or whenever, just @ me and I'll see what I can do, even if it's just cheerleading reassurance.
21:53:27 <SchismXL[m]>  * If you need any more help tomorrow or whenever, just @ me here and I'll see what I can do, even if it's just cheerleading reassurance.
21:53:33 <LRS> thanyou are the best, i'll do, i'm sure^^
