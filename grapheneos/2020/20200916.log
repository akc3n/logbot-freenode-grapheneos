00:38:06 <Julian16> I just got a pixel 3a. Was about to install grapheneOS through Mint. First thing I did was update phone to Android 11, but apparently its not supported yet? Do I have to wait till android 11 is supported before doing an install?
00:51:14 <Julian16> .... Am I in the right place?
00:52:30 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <Julian16 "I just got a pixel 3a. Was about"> well I can tell you recently I reinstalled Graphene from Android 11 Beta, it worked fine
00:52:57 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> but did feel sad to downgrade from Android 11 to 10...
00:53:02 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> sad emoji
00:53:50 <Julian16> So if I follow these instructions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0UFZjuotg) I should be good?
00:53:58 <Julian16> Im pretty noob about it all.
00:54:19 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <Julian16 "So if I follow these instruction"> haha me too. Well if it worked on my Android 11 beta, I dont see why it wont work on yours
00:54:24 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> So it would be fine
01:31:22 <julian-olson[m]> Doing an install.... I have Mint. Will the instructions for Ubumtu work?
01:53:14 <julian-olson[m]> Can you do an install with Mint?
01:53:44 <julian-olson[m]> Sorry. Meant to ask if you can to an install with Manjaro. Do you follow the instructions with Arch then?
01:56:39 <louipc> that would be the logical choice
02:18:13 <aeonsolution[m]> i just have one word for the chat history for the past two days, wow
02:21:33 <aeonsolution[m]> julian-olson: don't use that video to flash grapheneos just follow the instructions on https://grapheneos.org/build
02:21:48 <aeonsolution[m]>  * julian-olson: don't use that video to flash grapheneos just follow the instructions on https://grapheneos.org/install
02:22:34 <aeonsolution[m]> the officially supported operating systems are on https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites
02:23:21 <aeonsolution[m]> it is possible for you to use manjaro but the packages can go out of sync with arch so at any point you would have to figure out how to troubleshoot that issue for yourself
02:23:44 <aeonsolution[m]> just stick to the officially supported oses on the website
03:00:07 <awsazuregcp[m]> How do i join the offtopic from element web or android?
03:05:26 <louipc> awsazuregcp[m]: you have to select freenode network
03:08:05 <faxing[m]> <julian-olson[m] "Can you do an install with Mint?"> I installed Graphene with Debian, so I'd assume Mint would also work, considering it is based on it after all.
03:10:15 <gee_one_> This might be a duplicate.  My internet seems to have dropped just as I was posting...  So, I've been out of the loop for the last month or so... Is there anything I can do to help with the android-prepare-vendor scripts?  I have a computer that can build and a sargo that I can flash.
03:33:26 <aeonsolution[m]> gee_one_: check out https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-prepare-vendor/issues/12
03:34:43 <aeonsolution[m]> GrapheneOS works with AOSPAlliance to get android-prepare-vendor
03:35:13 <aeonsolution[m]> it would be great if people support cdesai and dan-v with apv
04:39:09 <danielrf[m]> To follow up on that, I just had a PR merged to apv on the android11 branch for taimen/walleye
04:39:59 <danielrf[m]> If any devs have a pixel 2 (xl) phone and want to test that android11 branch, I'd be interested in hearing what works

07:33:15 <strcat[m]> and it's highly likely there will be major issues
07:33:34 <strcat[m]> so switch to the stable channel if you don't want to deal with that, or if you want to help with it switch to the beta channel from stable

08:33:35 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone have any tips on installing micro G on graphene?
08:50:58 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: it's not available, since it has to be built into the OS and whitelisted for various things along with having a signature spoofing patch to trick the client-side checks of the signature
08:51:12 <strcat[m]> since when apps rely on other apps, they verify it's not an attacker by checking the signature via the OS API
08:51:30 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't have microG, and that's that
08:51:34 <strcat[m]> if you want it you have to fork the OS
08:52:00 <Iusearchbtw[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): I mean it does work
08:52:08 <Iusearchbtw[m]> There are apps that won't verify the signature
08:53:42 <strcat[m]> many parts of it aren't going to work without being whitelisted and in general the SDK checks the signature
08:53:55 <strcat[m]> the only thing that will work is apps that simply want it to be present but not functional
08:54:08 <strcat[m]> in which case you don't need it just an app with that app id
08:54:18 <strcat[m]> and perhaps some non-functional APIs
08:55:06 <strcat[m]> so no it doesn't "work" unless by "work" you mean it is present, broken, and apps try to use + hit errors but handle that better than not having a non-functional Play services around
08:55:14 <strcat[m]> which may be the case for some apps
08:55:36 <strcat[m]> but note that other apps which worked without it are going to break because they see it and start using Play services code instead of their non-Play-services code
08:56:05 <strcat[m]> so it will break apps that do something like check for Play services and use FCM if Play services is there, otherwise their own implementation
08:56:09 <strcat[m]> since it is not going to be functional
08:56:11 <strcat[m]> but it is going to be there
08:56:14 <strcat[m]> that's a big problem
08:56:18 <strcat[m]> definitely doesn't "work"
08:58:50 <strcat[m]> has to be built into the OS with a patch to trick the signature check and various whitelisting + setup to make it provide services via Google
09:00:11 <bypassbobby[m]> I seen the guides people where flashing it on. I just don't want google services to have any access to my data
09:01:03 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: that's not GrapheneOS
09:01:08 <strcat[m]> if you're "flashing" something else over it
09:01:24 <strcat[m]> that's a fork, and you won't have GrapheneOS updates, or verified boot, or GrapheneOS in general
09:01:55 <strcat[m]> if you take GrapheneOS images and replace them with something else, don't get confused into thinking you are using GrapheneOS, you're not
09:02:50 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: if you don't want Google services to have access to your data, why are you trying to bake in an implementation of Google services to the OS with special privileges?
09:04:12 <bypassbobby[m]> Doesn't it spoof the google services though?
09:04:25 <bypassbobby[m]> I just want certain apps like wickr signal etc
09:04:58 <inrdrna[m]> signal works without google
09:05:55 <bypassbobby[m]> Is there a good alternative app to work WhatsApp on graphene?
09:06:35 <lickidyspl1t[m]> WhatsApp ü§ï
09:06:45 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Yuck üò´
09:07:03 <sad_plan[m]> bypassbobby signal. Whatsapp also works afaik
09:07:03 <cn3m[m]> WhatsApp works
09:07:09 <inrdrna[m]> ^ confirmed
09:07:30 <cn3m[m]> Facebook is very big on that they don't like the whole Google dependence historically
09:08:19 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: neither WhatsApp or Signal depends on Play services
09:08:26 <bypassbobby[m]> Cool is it a stand alone installer or through an appstore
09:08:27 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: please don't assume apps require Play services without trying
09:09:03 <bypassbobby[m]> strcat: I'm new to this I only got a pixel last night and installed grapheme early hours
09:09:08 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: microG is an open source reimplementation of Play services, it still implements proprietary Google Services, the open source code is the client side part
09:09:16 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: make sure the complete the installation process including locking
09:09:17 <bypassbobby[m]> * strcat: I'm new to this I only got a pixel last night and installed graphene early hours
09:09:56 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: and microG does not work without being built into the OS in order to whitelist it having special privileged permissions, to make it the provider of various services and to trick apps into thinking it is signed with the proper key
09:10:09 <strcat[m]> so there is no way to have working microG on GrapheneOS, because you have to fork it and make it into a different OS
09:10:14 <strcat[m]> with those changes
09:10:31 <strcat[m]> microG still uses proprietary Google services
09:10:41 <strcat[m]> and, it is not simply a regular app that can be installed
09:11:03 <cn3m[m]> microG notifications(the key feature) also sends push notifications through google's servers without end to end encryption
09:11:09 <strcat[m]> and even whitelisting it for various things is not enough since apps using it are checking the signature, as they should
09:11:26 <strcat[m]> the Play services SDK checks
09:12:59 <bypassbobby[m]> Its weird how they send notifications through google I watched the Congressional hearing a few weeks ago they all spy in order to steal other companies apps
09:13:48 <bypassbobby[m]> Steal popular apps and create there own and build them into there system
09:14:51 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Bruh download tracker control and launch your apps through that
09:15:04 <lickidyspl1t[m]> You'll be surprised how many companies apps ping.

09:51:10 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: read the usage guide section
09:51:11 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
09:51:11 <strcat[m]> MAC randomization alone does not provide privacy
09:51:19 <lickidyspl1t[m]> It is.
09:51:33 <lickidyspl1t[m]> *#21#* I think it is
09:52:03 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Mine was forwarded to a federal gov enterprise.....
09:52:11 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Hence the want to change imei or throw dev away
09:52:14 <lickidyspl1t[m]> üò´üò´
09:52:19 <bypassbobby[m]> I know for a fact when people get raided they take the routers and check the devices connected
09:52:20 <strcat[m]> lickidyspl1t: modern basebands do not support changing the IMEI, it is not an OS feature

09:53:03 <lickidyspl1t[m]> That's why I said I understand with all the other stuff you guys do
09:53:07 <strcat[m]> you're many orders of magnitude off what would be required
09:53:15 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Its not something your working on
09:53:24 <strcat[m]> it is not something we can work on
09:53:26 <strcat[m]> you seem confused
09:53:48 <strcat[m]> you want different hardware, it's not an OS thing
09:53:57 <lickidyspl1t[m]> I didn't being it up üòõ I was just saying what I was told before
09:54:00 <strcat[m]> the OS could only expose an interface to change the IMEI if it was supported by the hardware
09:54:06 <strcat[m]> and it isn't
09:54:06 <blacklight447[m]> I always assume that changing your imei gives you a false sense of security anyway
09:54:15 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: there are other hardware identifiers
09:54:27 <strcat[m]> similar to how my section on Wi-Fi explains how MAC address is not at all the only identifier
09:54:33 <bypassbobby[m]> I've seen ways of doing it but I dunno if there legit or not
09:54:38 <blacklight447[m]> Even if you change your imei, your bound to be still trackable via connection and location patterns
09:54:49 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: they aren't legitimate they just change the IMEI seen by the high-level OS while still using the same IMEI
09:54:51 <cn3m[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Even if you change your imei, yo"> yeah it just makes you stand out
09:55:02 <strcat[m]> and it's not accessible to apps anyway there is no use in showing a fake IMEI in the UI...
09:55:14 <blacklight447[m]> Also, the fact that your first have imei A, and suddenly it dissappears and IMEI B popup out of nowhere on the exact same location
09:55:16 <strcat[m]> as I said
09:55:20 <strcat[m]> the hardware does not support doing this
09:55:24 <strcat[m]> and there are OTHER identifiers
09:55:33 <strcat[m]> so it's a misconception that this would accomplish anything
09:55:36 <bypassbobby[m]> IMSI I know
09:55:44 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: no, not just that
09:55:46 <blacklight447[m]> And continues with the same patterns, makes it childs play to link them together
09:56:04 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: please read the section about Wi-Fi and then apply what you learn there to cellular which is comparable
09:56:15 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: read https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
09:56:39 <strcat[m]> did you know that MAC randomization on Broadcom Wi-Fi doesn't accomplish anything because it leaks other hardware identifiers over the air?
09:56:48 <strcat[m]> covered in that section
09:57:08 <strcat[m]> (doesn't specifically call out Broadcom Wi-Fi but that's because we don't and won't support devices with it)
09:57:17 <lickidyspl1t[m]> So the only prevention against stingrays is to not use a sim at all
09:57:25 <strcat[m]> no

09:58:03 <strcat[m]> there doesn't need to be any local interception going on for this to be relevant

09:58:27 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: in general, Wi-Fi vendors do not consider privacy / tracking
09:58:30 <strcat[m]> it is not part of what they work on
09:58:40 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: there is no attempt made to offer anonymity
09:58:47 <bypassbobby[m]> You also got amprs linking vehicles to phones. cell sites of your phone near any camera
09:58:48 <lickidyspl1t[m]> In Australia we have encryption laws
09:58:51 <blacklight447[m]> Stingrays can't really do anything outside of simply dossing  you if your traffic is properly encrypted
09:58:58 <cankerwort[m]> The ssd works with my laptop perfectly but it is not detected by the phone
09:59:15 <bypassbobby[m]> Even if you change your sim and your phone but stay in the same hotel they ring the sim provider and what other sims had the same pattern
09:59:23 <bypassbobby[m]> I know of a care where this happened
09:59:24 <blacklight447[m]> Sting rays simply intercept traffic by faking a phone tower
09:59:26 <strcat[m]> the only supported filesystem for an external drive is FAT32 until exFAT becomes supported
09:59:30 <bypassbobby[m]> * I know of a case where this happened
09:59:42 <blacklight447[m]> A stingray sees the exact same as your provider does
09:59:49 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: and importantly, that's not particularly relevant because the networks are secure, logged, and monitored by a lot of people with access to them anyway
09:59:49 <bypassbobby[m]> * Even if you change your sim and your phone but stay in the same hotel they ring the sim provider and ask what other sims had the same pattern
09:59:55 <strcat[m]>  * blacklight447: and importantly, that's not particularly relevant because the networks are insecure, logged, and monitored by a lot of people with access to them anyway
10:00:07 <cankerwort[m]> So I need to reformat my ssd to FAT32?
10:00:08 <blacklight447[m]> Simple rule of the thumb is that if its safe from your provider, then its safe against stingrays
10:00:08 <strcat[m]> the protocols are insecure, the way they are networked together is insecure and trusts everyone / all providers
10:00:20 <strcat[m]> cankerwort: if you want it to show up as a drive it at least needs a FAT32 partition on it
10:00:39 <strcat[m]> until exFAT is supported, that's the only option
10:00:51 <strcat[m]> NTFS wasn't ever properly supported by the Linux kernel and exFAT makes more sense for external drives anyway
10:01:13 <strcat[m]> recently there is a lot of progress on exFAT support, it will take another few years before it's supported
10:01:15 <strcat[m]> til then as I said
10:01:20 <strcat[m]> FAT32
10:01:21 <bypassbobby[m]> In the case of encro all of 60k devices used KPN sims. So it was easy to track and survey these users
10:01:31 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "the protocols are insecure, the "> Im a networking administrator, and i can say the more you learn about networks, to more you know how insecure they are
10:01:39 <strcat[m]> *nix filesystems aren't suitable for external drivers because they inherently force having user/group, POSIX permission bits, etc.
10:01:41 <blacklight447[m]> Im surprised as well as they do
10:01:51 <strcat[m]> which makes no sense for a drive portable between computers and doesn't work
10:01:52 <cankerwort[m]> Thank you for the tips I'll look into that
10:02:03 <blacklight447[m]> I generally just assume any network is untrusted and act accordingly
10:02:16 <strcat[m]> the only filesystems suitable for portable drives are FAT32 and exFAT really
10:02:56 <strcat[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Disk_Format was theoretically an alternative
10:03:15 <strcat[m]> but I don't think macOS and Windows consider it as a normal filesystem for a flash drive
10:03:17 <blacklight447[m]> Psh, who uses file systems anyway
10:03:19 <strcat[m]> and I don't think Android does either
10:03:30 <blacklight447[m]> Just write binary data straight on the drive like a real man

10:04:47 <strcat[m]> and read the linked blog post

10:05:15 <blacklight447[m]> Hmmm
10:05:21 <strcat[m]> they realized that MAC randomization actually didn't work
10:05:25 <blacklight447[m]> Does ethernet actually work on graphene
10:05:38 <strcat[m]> a few other researchers with expertise on this worked with Qualcomm and Google to implement proper MAC anonymity
10:05:44 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: read the section and the blog post
10:05:50 <blacklight447[m]> I know android has support for in in developer options, but ive never tried it
10:05:54 <strcat[m]> this issue is addressed on Pixels
10:05:57 <blacklight447[m]> I dont have a usb c to ethernet dongle to check either
10:06:02 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: ethernet over USB works fine
10:06:08 <Iusearchbtw[m]> <strcat[m] "and I don't think Android does e"> Doesn't
10:06:08 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "academic researchers found priva"> the iOS issue was not reproducible. They could only get it to identify as an iPhone not a specific one
10:06:26 <Iusearchbtw[m]> I've connected a UDF drive to my phone before
10:06:47 <strcat[m]> cn3m: I'm talking about the earlier paper
10:06:52 <strcat[m]> apple and google addressed these issues
10:07:16 <cn3m[m]> I think people tried it right after and before Apple fixed it let me pull it up
10:07:18 <cn3m[m]> could be wrong
10:07:21 <strcat[m]> if you're on a device other than a Pixel or iPhone you'll need to use a device to capture over-the-air traffic and figure out if it's leaking identifiers, and if it ranomizes probes, etc.
10:07:30 <strcat[m]>  * if you're on a device other than a Pixel or iPhone you'll need to use a device to capture over-the-air traffic and figure out if it's leaking identifiers, and if it randomizes probes, etc.
10:07:38 <strcat[m]> refer to https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy and the blog post about it
10:07:41 <blacklight447[m]> Btw, i hope by the time the pixel 6 comes out, android desktop has become more mature
10:07:45 <strcat[m]> https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/changes-to-device-identifiers-in.html
10:08:11 <blacklight447[m]> I can only dream of connecting my phone to a docking station via usb C and use it on a big monitor as a mobile workstation
10:08:13 <strcat[m]> it's likely that most non-modern-Atheros Wi-Fi devices other than iPhones cannot support Wi-Fi anonymity
10:08:23 <strcat[m]> and it's possible the Atheros changes for doing this are not actually used much outside Pixels
10:08:47 <strcat[m]> originally they made a special driver for this because Google wanted it developed (see that blog post about the collaboration with the academic researchers)
10:08:52 <strcat[m]> special driver + firmware
10:09:01 <strcat[m]> it may be standard for new Atheros chips now
10:09:02 <strcat[m]> I don't know
10:09:15 <strcat[m]> it's also quite possible that the mainline driver doesn't support the features required
10:09:16 <strcat[m]> seems likely
10:09:23 <blacklight447[m]> Think about it, have a secure graphene os workstation on your monitor, keyboard mouse and everything connected
10:09:36 <blacklight447[m]> Then just unplug the usb c cable and your ready to go on the road, taking everything with you
10:10:01 <cn3m[m]> gotta fix the hardened_malloc issues with Android 10 desktop mode to even think about that iirc
10:10:18 <blacklight447[m]> I am aware
10:10:22 <strcat[m]> cn3m: well it works in kvm and hyper-v
10:10:35 <blacklight447[m]> But a man can dream
10:10:58 <blacklight447[m]> Also, the pixel 6 is most likely 1.5 years away
10:11:02 <strcat[m]> haven't tried the free form window mode, etc. in a long time
10:11:09 <blacklight447[m]> Maybe it works by then
10:11:21 <strcat[m]> HiKey's mali GPU driver has memory corruption bugs
10:11:22 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 6 should have MTE since Android S will bring 64bit only. Apple just got MTE today
10:11:26 <strcat[m]> so I stopped bothering with HiKey
10:11:35 <blacklight447[m]> But it would be really nice to have everything i do on a single graphene devuce
10:11:35 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 6 will be a good one
10:11:45 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: well it works in kvm and h"> oh interesting
10:12:03 <blacklight447[m]> Just one device to backup and manage, securly
10:12:08 <blacklight447[m]> No syncing between devices anymore
10:12:18 <blacklight447[m]> Everything on one place thats always with you
10:13:11 <blacklight447[m]> What do you think strcat ?
10:14:21 <strcat[m]> if the hardware supports stuff like display mirroring and it's set up for AOSP no reason stuff like that won't work
10:14:26 <strcat[m]> mouse and keyboard work fine with GrapheneOS already
10:14:39 <strcat[m]> so does DisplayPort / HDMI out when it's supported by the hardware
10:15:00 <strcat[m]> AOSP has a free form window mode, although not a proper launcher, etc. to use with it
10:15:20 <strcat[m]> so it really wouldn't be hard to set up that kind of thing, it's already essentially all developed
10:15:29 <strcat[m]> other people have external projects filling in the gaps like the launcher
10:15:34 <strcat[m]> if you want to work on that kind of thing go ahead
10:15:39 <strcat[m]> but current devices do not have HDMI out
10:15:40 <Iusearchbtw[m]> <cn3m[m] "Pixel 6 should have MTE since An"> 64-bit only you serious?
10:15:54 <Iusearchbtw[m]> That might mean 4 level page tables may work
10:16:17 <cn3m[m]> huh yeah I think that is confirmed
10:16:19 <cn3m[m]> or close to it
10:16:44 <cn3m[m]> Google Play has confirmed it
10:17:03 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: 32-bit support is not why 4-level page tables are broken with certain drivers
10:17:15 <cn3m[m]> and they really need it for security reasons
10:17:17 <strcat[m]> 4-level pages tables already work fine today but it breaks certain drivers
10:17:23 <strcat[m]> it boots up fine and can be used
10:18:01 <Iusearchbtw[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: 32-bit support is"> They might fix it if 32-bit is gone
10:18:22 <cn3m[m]> MTE is a massive jump and Google will want to do it right especially if they are so far behind Apple. I am almost certain they will drop 32bit
10:18:53 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't see how it's related to 32-bit
10:18:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's not connected
10:19:18 <cn3m[m]> the driver is 64 bit
10:19:24 <cn3m[m]> if I recall correctly
10:19:25 <strcat[m]> we could have 4 level page tables on current hardware and 32-bit support is not relevant
10:19:34 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "but current devices do not have "> But if future pixels support the hdmi out, it should technically work?
10:19:39 <strcat[m]> cn3m: MTE can be used even if there are 32-bit processes still around
10:19:46 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: GrapheneOS isn't only for Pixels
10:19:48 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: for one thing
10:19:52 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: MTE can be used even if th"> right, but it is ideal to only have 64bit
10:19:59 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: on devices where HDMI out is supported it works fine on GrapheneOS
10:20:07 <strcat[m]> it worked on past devices where it was supported
10:20:23 <strcat[m]> it stopped being supported by Pixels at some point, I don't remember when it was last a feature
10:20:59 <strcat[m]> similar to how Miracast was dropped from their software device support code
10:21:11 <strcat[m]> but not dropped as something AOSP has support for doing if the device provides an implementation
10:21:19 <beaver19292> hey guys, does graphene has a system wide dark mode?
10:21:23 <beaver19292> have*
10:21:32 <blacklight447[m]> That would be exciting, i mean that means i won't have to buy two devices anymore in the future, but just one for graphene that i can use as my phone and desktop
10:21:37 <strcat[m]> there is a difference between what GrapheneOS supports and what it supports on certain devices
10:21:38 <cn3m[m]> beaver19292: yes it does
10:21:50 <blacklight447[m]> Then we can just have one secure work station on the go
10:22:10 <strcat[m]> it's not up to GrapheneOS what the hardware supports and we're also not going to go out of the way to implement additional device support code to expose hardware features even if they're technically there
10:22:12 <strcat[m]> it's not what we do
10:22:22 <Iusearchbtw[m]> [blacklight447](https://matrix.to/#/@blacklight447:privacytools.io): no
10:22:39 <Iusearchbtw[m]> You can't really use android as a workstation
10:22:47 <Iusearchbtw[m]> It'll be slow
10:22:47 <strcat[m]> unless we are getting our own device made it's not up to us if it supports DisplayPort over USB-C
10:23:25 <blacklight447[m]> It will cut out aome attack surface as well
10:23:26 <blacklight447[m]> As i have one device less to manage
10:23:26 <blacklight447[m]> And don't have to setup any syncing
10:23:26 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "it's not up to GrapheneOS what t"> I am aware
10:23:51 <DylanKnoll[m]> Pixel 2 doesn't have video over USB, think it was just OG Pixel
10:24:08 <blacklight447[m]> But seeing how it should technically already work software wise, we only have to wait and hope google introduces a pixel with hdmi out, right?
10:24:38 <blacklight447[m]> <Iusearchbtw[m] "You can't really use android as "> Mate, i used to daily driver a qubes laptop with a 5400 rpm hard drive and 8 GB of ram
10:25:06 <jpds> blacklight447[m]: You'll definitely want syncing for your backups/contacts/calendar
10:25:11 <blacklight447[m]> And that was back in beta when it was more buggy as well
10:25:21 <blacklight447[m]> I can handle a bit of slowness
10:25:56 <blacklight447[m]> <jpds "blacklight447: You'll definitely"> Yeah, but i can just set up syncing to a cloud , end to end encrypted
10:26:14 <blacklight447[m]> <jpds "blacklight447: You'll definitely"> I wont have to sync between devices
10:26:23 <strcat[m]> Dylan Knoll: I forget when it was dropped, Nexus 5X/6P probably had it
10:26:31 <strcat[m]> maybe original Pixels had it and then Pixel 2 dropped it
10:26:35 <cn3m[m]> 5x didn't
10:26:36 <cn3m[m]> look at maruos
10:27:35 <strcat[m]> I used to use it on a Nexus 9 and then IIRC, a Pixel C, I can't recall exactly
10:27:41 <strcat[m]> maybe a Nexus 10 at some point
10:27:57 <strcat[m]> I think Nexus 10 actually had a mini-displayport
10:28:00 <strcat[m]> something like that
10:28:12 <blacklight447[m]> Lets just say im really hyped for android desktop, and i cannot wait to start using it
10:28:23 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS only ever publicly supported Nexus 9 years ago
10:28:31 <strcat[m]> but I did work on Nexus 10 very early on just wasn't ever published
10:28:36 <blacklight447[m]> Im just praying the pixel 6 will support hdmi out
10:29:35 <blacklight447[m]> Seeing how google is developing android desktop as a feature themselves, i would see it likely that they would support it in a few years as pixels are supposed to be the android experience google aims for
10:29:42 <blacklight447[m]> Including supporting all features
10:32:28 <cn3m[m]> blacklight447: the real issue is Android apps don't even work on a tablet well
10:32:30 <cn3m[m]> why would they be good on desktop
10:33:48 <blacklight447[m]> Because android tablets tend to be lackluster
10:34:01 <blacklight447[m]> And never got any proper focus from developers
10:34:14 <blacklight447[m]> Once android desktop takes off, that might change
10:34:26 <blacklight447[m]> I can see how big companies would be interested in a solution like this
10:34:48 <blacklight447[m]> Less hardware to buy
10:34:52 <dazinism> Got a video saved of someone connecting external monitor to a modern pixel
10:34:55 <blacklight447[m]> Always accessible and reachable, always with the employee
10:35:20 <blacklight447[m]> I can really see it take off
10:35:21 <dazinism> Pixel 4
10:35:28 <dazinism> Sorry pixel 3
10:35:33 <dazinism> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2iw4YJpiBVo
10:35:42 <dazinism> I've still not watched it yet...
10:36:39 <jpds> blacklight447[m]: This is exactly what Ubuntu Phone was hyped up to be and that didn't really go anywhere
10:36:42 <strcat[m]> cn3m: apps do work well with free form window mode now due to ChromeOS doing this for apps
10:37:42 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: apps do work well with fre"> ah gotcha it is broken on GrapheneOS so I never tried that
10:37:48 <cn3m[m]> good to know they improved that
10:38:30 <blacklight447[m]> <jpds "blacklight447: This is exactly w"> Issue with ubuntu is, is that its significantly less secure then graphene
10:38:39 <blacklight447[m]> <jpds "blacklight447: This is exactly w"> Android is already widely supported and secure
10:39:03 <cn3m[m]> yeah Samsung with DeX would be the alternative
10:39:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> ew Samsung
10:39:48 <cn3m[m]> I am personally waiting for GrapheneOS(or Pixels in general) to support a full desktop mode or for an iPad Mini with the Air facelift
10:40:15 <cn3m[m]> either will do the trick for the one device experience
10:40:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> Wish Samsung would just make hardware for Google
10:40:30 <hypokeimenon[m]> Their tablet looks nice
10:40:48 <cn3m[m]> probably should move this to offtopic
10:43:46 <strcat[m]> we don't care if a device is a Pixel or not
10:44:00 <strcat[m]> Pixels go through the same considerations as any other device
10:44:14 <cn3m[m]> A2 was considered iirc
10:44:22 <cn3m[m]> just no one would maintain it
10:44:24 <strcat[m]> we don't just default to supporting them, Pixel 4a and 5 will not necessarily be supported unless maintainers step up for them
10:44:35 <strcat[m]> there's a lot of talk about device support
10:44:39 <strcat[m]> but when it comes down to it
10:44:40 <strcat[m]> people don't really want it
10:44:50 <strcat[m]> there isn't interest in doing the work or funding it
10:45:06 <strcat[m]> there isn't interest in even doing research into devices to figure out which ones support which requirements
10:45:19 <cn3m[m]> Samsung there is a claim the Exynos chips support android verified boot. That possibly could be supported if true
10:45:21 <cn3m[m]> yeah that is the thing
10:45:28 <cn3m[m]> people need to care
10:45:38 <cn3m[m]> which Pixels do the job
10:45:46 <strcat[m]> cn3m: supporting Android Verified Boot does not in any way imply support for AVB with alternate OSes
10:45:51 <strcat[m]> and the same goes for other security features
10:46:00 <strcat[m]> traditionally, Samsung limits many hardware / firmware security features to the stock OS
10:46:16 <strcat[m]> support for alternate OSes is not a requirement of AVB
10:46:41 <cn3m[m]> I meant custom key
10:46:42 <cn3m[m]> sorry
10:46:52 <strcat[m]> it standardizes verified boot for the OS but they can deviate from it to some extent and they don't have to support alternate OS
10:47:10 <cn3m[m]> someone had it in build instructions for their "secure rom" no idea if the custom keys actually work
10:47:12 <cn3m[m]> or anything
10:47:18 <cn3m[m]> could be a OnePlus situation
10:47:25 <cn3m[m]> I didn't look into it beyond that
10:47:52 <strcat[m]> worth noting "avb_custom_key" is something Google added to Qualcomm's standard code for Pixels
10:48:04 <strcat[m]> avb_custom_key is not in any way a standardized fastboot virtual partition
10:48:12 <strcat[m]> it's how they chose to add it to the fastboot UI
10:48:23 <cn3m[m]> I just remembered someone you saying Samsung and Motorola were on the shortlist of brands you would seriously consider viable(OnePlus being a hell no)
10:48:29 <cn3m[m]> strcat: hrmm I should look into it again
10:49:00 <cn3m[m]> though they can be hard to find the Exynos variants anyway
10:54:14 <beaver19292> Exynos variant are mostly for eveywhere except USA.
10:56:04 <blacklight447[m]> How are exynos devices security wise
10:56:34 <blacklight447[m]> Would the lean more on the qualcomm end, or more on the broadsign end of the spectrum
10:57:29 <cn3m[m]> <beaver19292 "Exynos variant are mostly for ev"> I thought Qualcomm is in Korea too
10:58:04 <beaver19292> might be.
10:59:22 <cn3m[m]> Samsung is huge in the US and Korea
11:02:08 <cn3m[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Would the lean more on the qualc"> "Devices from vendors like Motorola, Samsung, etc. can be considered but OnePlus is completely off the table. Ultimately, the goal is custom hardware, and devices from other vendors eventually won't need to be supported. Broad device support is not a goal of the project. As explained there, the expectation is that people purchase a device for use with GrapheneOS, and
11:02:08 <cn3m[m]> eventually a device designed and built to run it that ships with it."
11:02:18 <cn3m[m]> they also get day 1 updates out for the flagship devices
11:04:13 <strcat[m]> btw Pixel 2 has issues caused by Android 11 and no maintainer
11:04:14 <strcat[m]> unless people step up to help with Pixel 2, we're dropping support for it this month
11:49:36 <Sean[m]1> does grapheneos support eSIM? (sim card stored on internal sim)
11:52:20 <andrewmartini[m]>  https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/159
12:15:59 <ham5urg> There are different versions of Pixel 4, before buying one I would like to ask if there are big differences?
12:17:30 <strcat[m]> don't get a verizon one
12:17:41 <strcat[m]> and Pixel 4a is not supported yet + no one is working on it yet
12:19:18 <dazinism> Pixel 4XL has a much bigger battery. Pixel 4 has a reputation for not having greatest battery life
12:20:39 <ham5urg> Ok, I have seen Pixel 4 G020M and G020P. Also some US-versions like GA01181-US, GA01182-US. Maybe that's the Verizon stuff.
12:21:33 <ham5urg> Look like P stands for XL, like the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6p in the past.
12:21:56 <ham5urg> G020M <> G020P
12:22:14 <cn3m[m]> <ham5urg "Look like P stands for XL, like "> that is a throwback
12:23:56 <ham5urg> Even with small battery, I would prefer Pixel 4. G020M looks good I guess.

12:46:41 <bypassbob[m]> Any idea why it keeps showing this instead of just booting up right to graphene?
12:47:06 <zyxt128[m]> because it's a not google verified ROM

12:48:14 <bypassbob[m]> Ok

12:48:47 <cankerwort[m]> any ideas?
12:48:52 <derpy> since I'm in a foreign country, one thing I just realized I would be missing leaving regular android is google translate in chrome... Is there a way to get auto webpage translation in vanadium?
12:49:36 <cankerwort[m]> The light is pulsating blue instead of a solid blue light
12:50:46 <ham5urg> derpy, take a look at deepl.com
12:51:15 <derpy> ham5urg doesn't like it can do webpages, unless I'm mistaken...
12:51:50 <derpy> I'm guessing vanadium can handle chromium plugins? maybe a plugin could do translation from offline dictionaries... and it would probably bean chrome's translation performance.
12:52:39 <derpy> hmmm there's this: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deepl-translator/fjokdddhdjnpombkijbljbeemdmajgfj?hl=en
12:52:49 <ham5urg> derpy, no it can't, but the quality is above all I know.
12:53:01 <derpy> cool, will look into it
12:53:26 <citypw> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rl82OQDoOc
12:53:51 <derpy> I guess there used to be a deepl translator on fdroid: https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/com.anthony.deepl.openl
12:54:17 <derpy> citypw kind of off topic - but if it isn't then I'll add my view too: Snowden is 100% controlled opposition
12:54:41 <derpy> partially on-topic, in my view, is that DDG is controlled opposition for google.
12:56:56 <citypw> derpy: what is DDG?
12:56:59 <derpy> duckduckgo
12:57:10 <derpy> default vanadium search engine :)
12:57:13 <citypw> i see
12:57:27 <citypw> the only option we have though;-)
12:57:32 <derpy> no there's lots
12:57:50 <derpy> I'll be self-hosting searx when I've the gumption :P
12:58:42 <cankerwort[m]> I have tried several cabled with the ssd, but still just blinking blue light
12:58:44 <citypw> how about the feature? even ddg is not good as google when you do some technical stuff digging
13:02:59 <bypassbob[m]> <derpy "citypw kind of off topic - but i"> 100% not one mention of the spying on trump or antifa.
13:03:29 <bypassbob[m]> Even when spying was the only topic of the full interview really shocking in my eyes
13:04:06 <derpy> bypassbob[m] those who have done this kind of research for decades realize that anytime some information was well known - and then the government comes out with an "official release" with a scapegoat (and the media is finally comfortable reporting it)... ‚ÄúThe best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.‚Äù ‚Äï Lenin

13:16:33 <Autopsy[m]> Click connected device?
13:17:06 <cankerwort[m]> "Couldn't switch"
13:17:53 <cankerwort[m]> I have tried all USB ports on the laptop and this is the same laptop I used to flash GOS onto the phone a few months ago
13:18:02 <cankerwort[m]> Other peripherals work with the laptop
13:18:59 <Autopsy[m]> Go to dev options, go Default USB configuration, then select File transfer.
13:19:05 <Autopsy[m]> Then plug in the device and see if that works
13:19:36 <cankerwort[m]> Aaaaaand it just suddenly got recognised by the laptop as soon as I ask for help after fiddling for like an hour
13:23:01 <Lia[m]> Just don't forget to switch back to "Allow USB peripherals when unlocked later on" for security reasons
13:23:08 <derpy> cankerwort[m] ya its a pain... I'd use the adb tool

13:23:35 <derpy> cankerwort[m] ya i dont try to give it control, just set transfer and use "push" with adb
13:26:38 <cankerwort[m]> Yes even though the laptop seems to have recognized the phone, it won't allow me to open it in the file explorer
13:26:46 <cankerwort[m]> Maybe I will try push with adb
13:28:38 <Autopsy[m]> Worst case, use KDE Connect?
13:30:30 <cankerwort[m]> I'm starting to think it is a problem on my laptop end. It is a janky Ubuntu installation that is in need of a refresh

13:39:38 <derpy> how does one easily see their local IP on GOS?
13:41:30 <derpy> cankerwort[m] ya all file explorers are a pain via that (mtpfs stuff)... gotta use adb for some reason (the other must be lacking some support, despite mounting and moving with root).

14:34:55 <strcat[m]> remember that encryption is per-profile, if you make 2 profiles they each have their own encryption keys based on their primary unlock method (ideally a passphrase)

16:45:38 <bypassbobby[m]> Does grapheneos still send pings via WiFi and Bluetooth when in airplane mode? Just watched a video and the guy said there was a university study dome looking into when people are in an airplane and how it interferes with communication where they checked android and iOS  to see if they where still pinging in airplane mode

17:13:23 <inrdrna[m]> you can use aurora store to avoid that, and if you're really paranoid, you can use apkscan in order to check their APK signature
17:15:29 <bypassbobby[m]> <inrdrna[m] "you can use aurora store to avoi"> Is apkscan a native app?

19:33:38 <awsazuregcp[m]> Hey I've been told conflicting information. The pixel 4XL screen flicker is a hardware or software issue?
19:33:53 <awsazuregcp[m]> I've heard both
19:36:06 <awsazuregcp[m]> Problem is i just got a refurb device from assurant (google protection contractors) and i put graphene on here and i've got a flicker. Although i've never tried this device with stock google android so i dont actually know if its graphene or the screen hardware
19:37:30 <alzxjm[m]> awsazuregcp: It's a hardware issue.
19:37:38 <alzxjm[m]> Google did not properly calibrate the display and it has had low-brightness issues since launch.
19:40:53 <awsazuregcp[m]> yes, i get flickering annoyance only at night
19:45:11 <alzxjm[m]> awsazuregcp: You can use `adb` commands to manually cap the refresh rate at 60 Hz.
20:09:03 <Mathilde73> Hi! I was just wondering, how do i set the 90hz function on the Pixel4XL to always on (cant find it as one normally would on the developer settings)
20:09:28 <awsazuregcp[m]> Thats not supported yet
20:09:45 <awsazuregcp[m]> <Mathilde73 "Hi! I was just wondering, how do"> Not supported yet in graphene

20:11:43 <alzxjm[m]> It's not a faulty display.
20:11:49 <alzxjm[m]> Most of the phones do the flickering thing at low brightness.
20:12:24 <awsazuregcp[m]> oh ok, so a replacement wont fix this? This is a graphene support issue
20:12:38 <Mathilde73> So it appears
20:12:55 <Mathilde73> I didn't have that issue until i installed GrapheneOS as far as im aware...
20:12:56 <alzxjm[m]> You might luck out and get a P4 with a display that doesn't do it. But your replacement will probably do it too.
20:13:31 <alzxjm[m]> It's worse on GrapheneOS than on stock for some reason. But the screen became super green at low brightness even on stock.
20:13:41 <Mathilde73> Yikes.
20:14:10 <alzxjm[m]> No idea why that would be. Doesn't really make sense.
20:14:11 <alzxjm[m]> Forcing 60 Hz all the time cured the problem on my display.
20:14:27 <Mathilde73> Which commands should i run?
20:14:54 <awsazuregcp[m]> that or use battery saver mode (which forces 60hz)
20:15:56 <alzxjm[m]> The commands I gave you above force 60 Hz.
20:16:13 <Mathilde73> Oh right! thanks :))
20:18:33 <awsazuregcp[m]> i put it in battery saver at night
20:19:08 <alzxjm[m]> awsazuregcp: This is actually a fairly elegant solution. Thanks for the idea.
20:22:00 <Mathilde73> Alrightie! both options worked great! i ended up forcing the 60Hz
