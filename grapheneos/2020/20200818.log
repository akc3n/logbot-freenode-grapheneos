01:06:02 <brenneke[m]> Odd Vanadium behaviour.....no Exit below Settings
01:07:17 <brenneke[m]> Always remembers a Syncthing page I once visited even after clearing history, cache and rebooting phone.
01:09:03 <brenneke[m]> So without Exit button I back arrow out of Vanadium, next time I open, it will be on same Syncthing page even though home page is set to DDG.
01:09:21 <brenneke[m]> Pixel 2XL
01:12:45 <brenneke[m]> None of this happens in Bromite and Exit is there too below Settings.
01:26:34 <aeonsolution[m]> did you close the tab before clearing everything?
01:56:00 <analtenderloin[m> Does anyone know if there's a way to fix the ghosting effect when scrolling from black to grey?
02:02:24 <strcat[m]> exit isn't part of Chromium
02:02:29 <strcat[m]> that's added by a Bromite patch
02:08:02 <analtenderloin[m> <strcat[m] "that's added by a Bromite patch"> Its pretty convienent NGL
02:11:57 <refragable[m]> aeonsolution: I rebased my Vanadium pull request, you can do a new build to test whenever it's convenient. I started a clean build right now.
02:14:58 <aeonsolution[m]> nice! thanks, i added the patch to my vanadium build-currently building vanadium right now. i just wanted you to update your fork and fix the conflicts to make merging the patch faster ðŸ˜€
02:16:01 <renlord> strcat[m]: any ideas what might be the issue behind dm-verity?
02:16:08 <renlord> on userdebug build
02:17:42 <renlord> anyone have the link to jollyrogger's UART guide?
02:20:20 <brenneke[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "did you close the tab before cle"> Thanks, that did it.....used to using Exit on Bromite.
02:23:05 <aeonsolution[m]> right, i get you. its what works for me, i can imagine a scenario where people want to clear their cache and history but also keeping tabs open
02:25:35 <aeonsolution[m]> the use case you brought up is valid so thanks for sharing it
02:26:34 <brenneke[m]> Any plans for adding little extras to Vanadium  down the road?
02:26:34 <brenneke[m]> Some way to back up bookmarks
02:26:34 <brenneke[m]> Exit
02:28:12 <aeonsolution[m]> at the moment, there isn't, I first want to tackle some of the privacy and security features strcat wants to add to Vanadium
02:29:14 <brenneke[m]> Clear history on exit setting would be nice too but I know I am pushing it!
02:29:14 <aeonsolution[m]> if there are features Bromite and other browsers have in forms of patches, we can review them and see if its something strcat would like added to Vanadium
02:29:52 <aeonsolution[m]> they have to be noninvasive patches and follow some strict guidelines
02:37:02 <aeonsolution[m]> <brenneke[m] "Clear history on exit setting wo"> yeah, this one would be nice too
02:41:48 <aeonsolution[m]> <renlord "anyone have the link to jollyrog"> is this the one you needed? https://github.com/Peter-Easton/android-debug-cable-howto
02:55:22 <renlord> yes thanks

03:06:32 <angtheephemeral[> Pardon my ignorance, but would Graphene OS protect against something like this at all, or would a processor vulnerability mean that Graphene's protections could be bypassed? https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/snapdragon-chip-flaws-put-1-billion-android-phones-at-risk-of-data-theft/
03:08:05 <cn3m[m]> angtheephemeral: Pixels do

03:08:31 <angtheephemeral[> You mean they'd defend against this?
03:08:33 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS does take it further SELinux rules, but it didn't matter in this case
03:09:05 <angtheephemeral[> I'm sorry, do you mean that it would or wouldn't matter?
03:09:22 <cn3m[m]> angtheephemeral: Pixels have it taken care of
03:09:28 <cn3m[m]> OS doesn't matter
03:09:29 <angtheephemeral[> Ah ok
03:09:49 <cn3m[m]> This is not an issue on Pixels due to much better sandboxing than regular Android
03:10:54 <cn3m[m]> Lineage Unofficial builds last I checked ARE effected on Pixels
03:13:35 <angtheephemeral[> I appreciate the info / feedback.
03:15:12 <cn3m[m]> angtheephemeral: https://nitter.net/DanielMicay/status/1292398497677877249#m here's the tweet from GrapheneOS lead dev.
03:28:08 <renlord> sad
03:50:45 <theultron[m]> <sandelinos "I've never heard of DivestOS bef"> They have a thread on F-Droid. Check that out.
05:30:08 <dngray> does graphene have LZMA support in the kernel?
05:33:22 <dngray> only reason i ask is because I was having some trouble using TWRP https://twrp.me/google/googlepixel3axl.html
05:33:36 <dngray> > Please note that you cannot install this on stock, unless you are running a kernel that supports LZMA compression.
05:33:48 <dngray> my guess is t hat's what is the issue with running this on grapheneos hmm
06:18:06 <smashingclerk[m]> dngray: TWRP isn't supported in grapheneos
06:19:29 <smashingclerk[m]> it's insecure
06:25:31 <cn3m[m]> citypw: welcome
08:14:16 <dngray> <smashingcler "it's insecure "> for the usecase i had i needed it
08:14:23 <dngray> essentially i want to run a piece of software and don't want it reporting imei/sn etc and things related to android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE
08:14:41 <dngray> so the idea was i was going to strip the phone down, run edexposed framework, to intercept and spoof those identifiers
08:14:58 <dngray> then when done, wipe phone and put graphene back on it
08:15:34 <dngray> i might just find another ROM that isn't grapheneos
08:15:39 <dngray> for that and then use that temporarily
08:15:46 <dngray> probably can do it with aosp rom
08:16:23 <cn3m[m]> dngray: they can't see imei
08:16:32 <dngray> yeah they need priviledged for that
08:16:50 <JTL> Root apps can see imei, but that's obviously a different thing :P
08:16:54 <cn3m[m]> you need an app to be able to do that?
08:17:34 <JTL> I'm not entirely sure what dngray is trying to do
08:17:55 <dngray> yeah that's not an issue
08:18:05 <dngray> this application doesn't use root so that's fine
08:18:23 <JTL> I do know remember stock AOSP several versions ago allowed apps to query the IMEI, obviously not a thing anymore, and for the beter imo
08:18:24 <dngray> exposed obviously does, but that's okay as it is intended
08:18:39 <JTL> also lol
08:18:40 <JTL> https://discussions.soti.net/thread/read_privileged_phone_state-permission-on-android-10/
08:19:16 <dngray> you used to be able to do that with android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE
08:19:23 <dngray> but now it's a different permission
08:19:39 <cn3m[m]> what are you trying to do?
08:20:26 <dngray> here we are, yeah those are protected now https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/device-identifiers
08:20:36 <dngray> ie they require READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE
08:20:58 <dngray> which fortunately means most apps, cannot pull data like your serial number now
08:20:59 <cn3m[m]> yes that is in the GrapheneOS FAQ
08:21:22 <dngray> thank fuck
08:21:37 <dngray> that's a really good android 10 change
08:22:00 <cn3m[m]> yep
08:22:04 <dngray> this might be much easier then than i thought
08:22:20 <dngray> i can just use grapheneos, and zoom cannot get those identifiers
08:22:42 <dngray> in the past i would have had to root, use xposed framework to intercept it and spoof it
08:22:49 <DarkUranium> Zoom is such a horrible piece of software.
08:22:54 <DarkUranium> I have a long list of issues with it somewhere.
08:22:58 <cn3m[m]> yes the only reliable ID you can get(without storage permission) is ad id
08:23:07 <cn3m[m]> which GrapheneOS doesn't provide
08:23:08 <dngray> i wonder if it can get your device MAC address
08:23:25 <dngray> <DarkUranium "Zoom is such a horrible piece of"> yes it is, and i have not used it yet, but i need it on my phone for one day
08:23:30 <cn3m[m]> <dngray "in the past i would have had to "> unfortunately that is vulnerable to bypassing due to relying on client side checks
08:23:38 <cn3m[m]> so that method is not reliable
08:23:47 <dngray> normally i would only ever use it in a browser if i had to use it
08:23:54 <cn3m[m]> I can't confirm if Zoom is bypassing Xposed (I think they do not)
08:24:05 <dngray> <cn3m[m] "so that method is not reliable"> nah it isn't really, but it would be better than nothing
08:24:19 <dngray> and iirc zoom doesn't do anything intentionally malicious in that regard
08:24:25 <cn3m[m]> dngray: also a Limbo VM or AnLinux would work
08:24:57 <dngray> still gonna make sure i have no accounts added on my phone
08:24:59 <dngray> i wonder if it works without google apps
08:24:59 <cn3m[m]> <dngray "and iirc zoom doesn't do anythin"> it doesn't have to be malicious
08:25:05 <cn3m[m]> iirc
08:25:11 <dngray> <cn3m[m] "dngray: also a Limbo VM or AnLin"> that is probably a better way
08:25:42 <dngray> i mean the UX doesn't have to be great, i only need it once, and need it on a phone for portability
08:26:07 <dngray> but would require use of camera
08:26:39 <dngray> you'll laugh when you find out why i need to do this.
08:26:50 <dngray> essentially i have to have a meeting with an interior designer in another state lol
08:27:04 <dngray> borders are locked, and he has certain specialisations so can't attend on-site
08:27:18 <DarkUranium> dngray, cn3m[m]: Found it. I'm sure the people in these quotes won't mind me quoting them (one of them was in a public channel anyways)
08:27:29 <DarkUranium> http://vpaste.net/plZnR
08:28:03 <cn3m[m]> you couldn't use a PC, Teams, or Duo?dngray:
08:28:12 <dngray> DarkUranium: yes i'm only planning on using it with a throw-away account
08:28:27 <DarkUranium> You don't want to use Teams. Trust me.
08:28:39 <dngray> <cn3m[m] "you couldn't use a PC, Teams, or"> must use what they use, and also need it to be portable, ie a laptop is not portable when you're trying to show them particular things up close
08:28:54 <dngray> also as far as the ECB thing is, that was fixed it now uses GCM
08:29:00 <dngray> so that paste is a bit dated
08:29:01 <DarkUranium> Teams does work on phones. In theory (... in theory *only*).
08:29:08 <DarkUranium> (it's an absolute piece of shit)
08:29:19 <dngray> so that ADDENDUM BY ANOTHER PERSON is no longer correct
08:29:35 <DarkUranium> dngray, I don't care: The fact that it happened ever at all is enough, IMO.
08:29:56 <DarkUranium> Because it proves the core point, which is that they don't give a damn about security. At all.
08:30:09 <JTL> DarkUranium: As someone else likes to call it "Microsoft Tears"
08:30:11 <dngray> maybe so
08:30:20 <DarkUranium> JTL, ha.
08:30:22 <dngray> and it is not something people generally use by choice
08:30:33 <DarkUranium> JTL, it seriously is extremely bad, though. Constant problems with it. CONSTANT. And that's ignoring the UI/UX issues.
08:30:43 <dngray> in those situations where one must be realistic, we take what precautions we can.
08:30:58 <JTL> I've been fortunate not needing to use either, but that might change soon
08:31:20 <dngray> cn3m: can you pass a camera into anlinux?
08:31:42 <cn3m[m]> shit idk
08:32:08 <cn3m[m]> but I wouldn't worry about it on GrapheneOS
08:32:17 <cn3m[m]> or Android 10 in general
08:32:27 <cn3m[m]> they can't even use the camera in the background
08:32:36 <JTL> I do agree that's a welcome improvement
08:32:43 <JTL> and a threat I thought of years ago :P
08:32:46 <JTL> cheers
08:33:00 <dngray> i'm not really worried about that so much
08:33:03 <dngray> more just about my device identifiers being sent off to zoom servers
08:33:15 <dngray> but it would appear they can't do that on android 10
08:33:18 <cn3m[m]> dngray: run Privacy Breacher to see what they see largely
08:33:28 <JTL> That's a fair concern, given past fingerprinting research
08:34:29 <dngray> they can get the MAC address through android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE but that can be randomized i guess
08:36:53 <dngray>  my grapheneos rom is pretty lightweight, i only have dav5x, k9mail and element on it lol
08:37:56 <cn3m[m]> no KDE Connect?
08:39:06 <dngray> nope
08:45:47 <dngray> you know what i wonder, is if zoom works in things like vanadium
08:45:56 <dngray> i bet it will check the user agent and go nope
08:47:19 <dngray>   hmm you might be able to use it without gapps which is good
08:47:32 * dngray feels so filthy
09:44:03 <citypw> cn3m[m]: thanks
10:23:44 <dazinism> I've found some web apps eg.(Jitsi video calls) try to get you to install their app if you visit from a phone. Requesting the desktop version from settings gets it working.
10:30:15 <dngray> one thing i will say about zoom, least you don't need to give them a phone number
10:30:37 <dngray> imagine if everyone wanted facebook messenger or some google messaging service lol
10:41:46 <cn3m[m]> <dngray "imagine if everyone wanted faceb"> Google Duo doesn't need an account either and it uses Signal end to end encryption
10:41:59 <cn3m[m]> in comparison it is far better
10:42:10 <dngray> yeah i haven't actually used that
10:42:24 <dngray> i thought google was going hard down the path of RCS
10:42:36 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> <cn3m[m] "Google Duo doesn't need an accou"> I don't trust Spygle.
10:42:50 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Google
10:43:42 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Jami is the best solution for privacy.
10:44:40 <cn3m[m]> dngray: Facebook doesn't require an account for joining Rooms either. Unfortunately it doesn't offer a Signal based option unlike regular Messenger
10:44:56 <cn3m[m]> literally everything is better than Zoom imo
10:45:12 <dngray> oh i didn't think facebook had a guest mode
10:45:20 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Is Jami bad?
10:45:26 <cn3m[m]> <SECLUDED-M3[m] "Is Jami bad?"> no
10:45:27 <dngray> nah, it's pretty good
10:45:33 <dngray> p2p as well which is nice

10:46:36 <trismous[m]> <[Redacted][m]1 "Google Meet? :)"> Depending on who you hate more ;)
10:47:24 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Students should recommend Jami for video conference and Element for chat.
10:47:38 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Or even for work
10:47:39 <trismous[m]> Jami or Jitsi IMO
10:47:55 <trismous[m]> Selfhosted Jitsi is super cool and reliable solution
10:47:55 <cn3m[m]> <SECLUDED-M3[m] "Students should recommend Jami f"> element is too ripe for abuse for wide spread adoption

13:27:07 <oaktree> hello
13:27:47 <oaktree> can i flash grapheneos to UK version pixel 4 xl
13:33:53 <dazinism> oaktree: should be no problem. Only Verizon (from USA) phones are locked against reflashing

14:31:33 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <aaaaaa "and / or have root access? was g"> Root access goes against the security model of GrapheneOS iirc.
14:32:49 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Try searching about root on r/GrapheneOS
14:41:43 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Or on the channel logs
14:52:17 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <aaaaaa "and / or have root access? was g"> As @za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a:privacytools.io said, rooting GrapheneOS is highly discouraged. It's a better idea to use Private DNS with an ad-blocking DNS (example: NextDNS)

16:19:48 <Son_Of_Enki> I posted this on reddit, but it says there that this is a better place for this
16:19:54 <Son_Of_Enki> I don't know if this is the right way to submit this, but I've never used GitHub, so I wouldn't know how to do it there. I'm using GrapheneOS on a Pixel 3.First, the website says to use Vanadium whenever possible because it is the most secure option, but it seems that the global autofill for my password manager(Bitwarden) doesn't trigger in
16:19:54 <Son_Of_Enki> Vanadium. This is annoying because I either have to copy and paste from Bitwarden, type in username and password manually, or save the username and password insecurely in the browser's native autofill. I also experienced this same issue in Bromite browser on Android 10, so maybe this is a problem across all Chromium based browsers, but I haven't
16:19:55 <Son_Of_Enki> used any non-foss browsers in quite some time, so I have nothing to compare to. The global auto fill service and auto fill accessibility service are activated in the system settings, and it works for all other apps including Firefox Klar.Second, in the native SMS app, the keyboard switches out the new line/enter key for an emoji button. This makes
16:19:56 <Son_Of_Enki> it impossible to send a list separated by lines without copypasting from another app. This isn't exactly a deal breaker, and I could always just switch to QKSMS from F-Droid, but it would be nice to see this remedied or at least have an option to change, as I don't use emojis anyways.Third, (and this is more of an issue of getting used to doing
16:19:56 <Son_Of_Enki> something a different way) there isn't an option in the settings for the native keyboard to overlay the symbols on the letter keys, meaning any time I want to put a question mark, or quotation mark, or apostrophe, I have to press the "?123" button instead of long-pressing the appropriate letter key. Again, I could easily just switch to OpenBoard
16:19:57 <Son_Of_Enki> from F-Droid, but it would be nice to see this option included in the future.On an aside, is there any way to enable push notifications? It seems that even privacy respecting apps like Protonmail are unable to send me notifications on GrapheneOS. Obviously it is better to *not* get notifications than to have Google Play Services installed, but it
16:19:57 <Son_Of_Enki> would be nice to know when I have an email. Also, I read on the website that the GrapheneOS team is considering implementing a local adblock blacklist. This is a feature that I would really like to see, as I don't like having to choose between a VPN and a global adblocker. I would definitely consider switching my monthly donation from Blokada to
16:22:04 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> It is weird that Vanadiun doesn't put adblocker. It is like chrome but security hardened and that's it.
16:22:16 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> * It is weird that Vanadium doesn't put adblocker. It is like chrome but security hardened and that's it.
16:23:58 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> What browser that does have ad blocker but chromium based and gsf independent (please don't mention Brave Browser)
16:24:12 <theultron[m]> <SECLUDED-M3[m] "What browser that does have ad b"> Bromite.
16:24:33 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Still have ads.
16:24:53 <theultron[m]> <SECLUDED-M3[m] "Still have ads."> Can you pm any example site to test?
16:24:58 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Ad blocker not effective all the time. They should update it.
16:25:28 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> In some webs, yes but not all sites.
16:25:50 <theultron[m]> You can host your own ad filter. https://www.bromite.org/custom-filters
16:26:15 <theultron[m]> or use nextdns/adguard with it.
16:27:12 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> <theultron[m] "You can host your own ad filter."> How can I use it? I don't understand the instructions the site you gave.
16:27:16 <droshi[m]> Son_Of_Enki: each app has to have a solution for push notifications from what I have been able to see, specific to protonmail they say they are working on a solution and trying to get it onto F-Droid, see here: https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues/1323
16:27:45 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Can I edit the ad filter on android without pc?
16:29:05 <theultron[m]> <SECLUDED-M3[m] "Can I edit the ad filter on andr"> No. Bromite requires you to host ad-filter on a server and then reference it in Bromite Setting. Default is https://www.bromite.org/filters/filters.dat
16:29:49 <theultron[m]> It will be easier to use a private dns called NextDNS in Android Settings. It is flexible and allows you to choose from multiple filters.
16:30:06 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> What software should I use to change ad filters in filters.dat
16:32:39 <theultron[m]> rule_set converter. https://github.com/bromite/filters/releases/
16:32:48 <theultron[m]> But do note that you will need to self host the file to be able to call it in Bromite.
16:45:35 <droshi[m]> Graphene keyboard, and OpenBoard...neither of them have swipe word capabilities is that correct? or have I just not enabled a setting I can't find?
16:48:39 <zen_monkey[m]> That's right
16:49:59 <droshi[m]> thanks, are there any good suggestions for FOSS keyboards that do and are still privacy oriented by not sending data back to servers?
16:50:35 <droshi[m]> i have tried AnySoftKeyboard from f-droid and it does have beta swipe capability, didn't know if i had other options or how good that one was
16:58:43 <theultron[m]> <droshi[m] "Graphene keyboard, and OpenBoard"> AnySoftKeyboard.
17:18:23 <Wonderfall[m]> <Son_Of_Enki "I don't know if this is the righ"> Unfortunately, it's a known issue with Chrome, it's being worked on, see this issue: https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/issues/489
17:26:01 <dazinism> droshi: pretty sure ASK is your only option for that.
17:44:38 <droshi[m]> OK thanks
17:54:09 <nikitalita[m]> I've noticed that there are people using apps which require (and actually use as opposed to just checking for the existence of) google play services; how were you able to get them to work?
17:54:16 <nikitalita[m]> (on GrapheneOS, natch)
18:08:55 <droshi[m]> most seem to use them for push notifications, if you don't care about being notified, they usually still work, all depends on the app though. even if they work, they still can report usage to trackers which may or may not be OK with you for privacy
18:09:50 <nikitalita[m]> Understood, I'm just wondering if its possible, or if I'd just have to use something like CalyxOS
18:10:13 <nikitalita[m]> I really try to avoid using proprietary apps in general so I don't really need to do that, I was just wondering
18:30:41 <redfoxblueeyes[m> Graphene on a small tablet would be perfect. No baseband, no problems . much more secure compared to a mobile phone.
19:55:14 <osmon[m]> After setting up a fresh GrapheneOS on a Pixel 3a, I am unable to manually add any accounts. When I tap "Add account" in the default Contacts app, nothing happens. Same thing when I try it from the System's settings menu.
19:55:14 <osmon[m]> When I install Signal, it manages to add its own account to the list, but the manual behavior doesn't change. Any ideas?
20:03:20 <osmon[m]> Or am I misunderstanding the Accounts functionality and I have to install apps that provide accounts?
20:04:01 <dazinism> nikitalita: think some folks installed the microG services core apk to get Google Camera working.
20:04:21 <dazinism> I never tried that
20:05:00 <dazinism> most now use the much smaller (and safer) apk to fool GCam
20:05:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> dazinism: yes
20:05:12 <dazinism> designed just to do that
20:05:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Install microg and the camera
20:05:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Force stop gcam
20:05:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's it
20:05:45 <dazinism> I imagine the microG apk may possibly fool some other apps?
20:06:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dunno
20:06:37 <dazinism> This is different than building microG into Graphene and getting access to Googles push messaging
20:06:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Never tried
20:07:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have that permission BTW
20:08:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> You know very well which one
20:08:55 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200819-013844_Permission_controller.png (126KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/PxvQaTEDcPOxndjwAZalXzqk/Screenshot_20200819-013844_Permission_controller.png >
20:10:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically I can fool all apps rn dazinism
20:38:04 <djee737ejdd[m]> anupritaisno1: is that from GrapheneOS?
20:52:21 <djee737ejdd[m]> Why aren't signature spoofing implemented in GrapheneOS behind a permission? Isn't SELinux safe enough to protect against misuse?
21:01:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not safe enough
21:01:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can't fool the package manager or selinux
21:02:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> But nothing stops me from replacing an app on your phone with a malicious one and granting the permission for instance
21:02:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Although all attacks require physical access
21:03:03 <djee737ejdd[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Although all attacks require phy"> But you should never trust a device which has been outside of your sight, while in the hands of someone else anyways
21:03:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also
21:04:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Microg isn't the only app that can spoof signatures
21:04:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> I made a number of apps about a year ago with spoofed signatures
21:05:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> All open source apps that suffered from tivoization
21:06:26 <dazinism> djee737ejdd: verified boot, usb disabling when screen locked and auditor make it difficult for someone with physical access to mess with your device
21:07:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well if I signature spoof an app on my phone you definitely have worse worries than the fake app
21:07:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because almost all exploits need physical access
21:07:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Well if I signature spoof an app on your phone you definitely have worse worries than the fake app
21:09:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> The working is simple
21:09:36 <djee737ejdd[m]> Thanks
21:09:36 <djee737ejdd[m]> Does anyone know why AOSP got Serial No. constraints? Which reasons could it be besides targeting individuals?
21:11:32 <dazinism> @djee737ejdd: not sure what you mean, what serial number constraint?
21:12:20 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GIhlIxpXpdSHNSsosPGvhPCv/message.txt >
21:12:24 <djee737ejdd[m]> "Android updates can support serialno constraints to make them validate only on a certain device but GrapheneOS rejects any update with a serialno constraint for both the Stable and Beta channels."
21:12:24 <djee737ejdd[m]> From: https://grapheneos.org/usage
21:15:15 <djee737ejdd[m]> Which reasons is there for having this in AOSP besides targeting individuals?
21:15:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Eh tbh I'd like to do that
21:16:00 <djee737ejdd[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Eh tbh I'd like to do that "> Do what?
21:17:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have the same phone as my friend and sometimes I just drop her a build
21:17:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might be useful for my use case so that I don't accidentally release one of my tests to her
21:18:18 <djee737ejdd[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Might be useful for my use case "> So you think Google is using it beta testing internal and not targeting individuals?
21:18:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dunno
21:19:31 <djee737ejdd[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Dunno"> Would Auditor protect against an malicious OTA on stuck Android?
21:19:50 <djee737ejdd[m]> or inform  you**
21:20:40 <dazinism> Google does push out updates in stages
21:21:04 <dazinism> A few at first, to check for bugs
21:21:20 <djee737ejdd[m]> <dazinism "Google does push out updates in "> But that is different. Here everyone gets an update, but some part of it only validates on certain devices with the specific serialno
21:21:25 <dazinism> *minimize impact from any bugs
21:22:35 <djee737ejdd[m]> So technically, they could write malicious code into everyones OTA, but it would only activate on your phone. Deactivated on everyones else phone, even though you have the same OTA.
21:24:30 <dazinism> From the text you quote, looks like its the whole update, not part.
21:25:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> djee737ejdd: no
21:25:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> They can ship you a different OTA
21:25:46 <djee737ejdd[m]> <dazinism "From the text you quote, looks l"> My understanding is that the same OTA is sent out to everyone, but part of it will you validate and t hen activate on certain devices
21:25:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> However there is no such thing as one OTA behaving differently
21:26:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or installing differently
21:26:26 <djee737ejdd[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "djee737ejdd: no"> No to what? That auditor would protect against it?
21:26:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're basically wrong
21:26:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> The update must be exactly the same on every device
21:27:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise it won't even boot
21:27:22 <djee737ejdd[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Otherwise it won't even boot"> Are we talking stuck Android or GrapheneOS now?
21:28:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Both
21:28:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can't install an OTA differently
21:28:10 <djee737ejdd[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "The update must be exactly the s"> But isn't that the whole point of Serialno constraints? Everyone gets the same update, but the malicious code only activate on certain devices
