05:47:20 <thelearner[m]> TheJollyRoger: Hi, have a question about the auditor app. Why doe sit display different colours after the phone has been audited and what do they mean? Thank you. :)
05:48:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hi thelearner[m], I'm glad you asked! I'll see if I can explain as best as I can:
05:49:32 <TheJollyRoger> So, the thing with Auditor, is that to establish *some* amount of trust at the onset, is that for the initial pairing, it relies on a certificate chain which is validated all the way back to Google's digital signature saying "yes, this is a real Android Device."
05:49:42 <TheJollyRoger> Then afterward, it relies on /that specific device/.
05:49:53 <TheJollyRoger> So, in a nutshell...
05:50:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yellow is the Auditor telling you that "I've never seen this device before, but the Auditor key is signed by the batch key, which is then attested by the vendor saying that 'it's legitimate' which is then backed up by Google saying 'Yes, the vendor is legitimate.'"
05:51:27 <TheJollyRoger> Green is the Auditor telling you that "I've seen this device before, and it's legit, because I know I've seen this device before and the keys haven't changed for it."
05:51:44 <TheJollyRoger> If that screen turns red, that's the auditor telling you "Hold it! Something's wrong!"
05:54:11 <thelearner[m]> Thank you very much TheJollyRoger: that makes sense. I looked on the grapheneos site and couldn't find this there. Maybe it should be updated? Or maybe I missed it haha.
05:54:47 <TheJollyRoger> Let me go take a look, and I can go and add it if need be!
05:56:23 <thelearner[m]> So, to keep it simple green and yellow is okay, but red is a no go or aka red alert and the person would need to reinstall grapheneos properly?
05:56:42 <TheJollyRoger> well, there are some more innocent reasons that can produce a red screen...
05:56:49 <TheJollyRoger> The first one of them, is large amounts of clock skew.
05:57:29 <thelearner[m]> And thanks for adding it to the GOS site, if need be.
05:57:42 <TheJollyRoger> If the clocks don't agree or are incorrect, then you can end up producing a red screen error.
05:58:35 <thelearner[m]> The two phones being in two different time zones? Is that an instance of clock skew?
05:59:30 <TheJollyRoger> Don't quote me on this but I think if one phone is set to be a much, much earlier date than the other, then sometimes this can produce an incorrect result.
06:00:18 <ahmouse[m]> hey
06:00:25 <TheJollyRoger> Another one can be holding the phone upside-down, or if you don't hold the phone steady enough, and you can get an error, since there's a lot of data to go through in the "response" QR code and sometimes that small screen can produce very tiny pixels.
06:00:27 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
06:00:35 <TheJollyRoger> So you have to hold it steady or sometimes it can end up producing an error.
06:01:09 <thelearner[m]> Okay and will do. Thanks once again. Also, should I use the app after a fresh install or every new update?
06:01:46 <TheJollyRoger> I need to check this, but if your bootloader's not locked, then it might also say "something's wrong" - I can check this for you after my CTS run finishes.
06:02:10 <TheJollyRoger> Well, you can set up Remote Verification, and that'll do it automatically every 4 hours.
06:02:21 <TheJollyRoger> If you do find something wrong though, there is a very simple solution!
06:02:25 <TheJollyRoger> And that is...
06:02:31 <TheJollyRoger> ...reboot your phone!
06:03:13 <TheJollyRoger> If you've locked your bootloader, what that does is essentially do a complete bitwise validation, signature check, and if something fails, a reinstallation of GrapheneOS.
06:03:21 <TheJollyRoger> Every time the operating system boots.
06:03:26 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks to Verified Boot.
06:04:10 <thelearner[m]> Could you please explain the use case for Remote Verification? Thank you.
06:04:53 <thelearner[m]> And please do check after your CTS run finishes or whenever you have time. Don't want to hold you up.
06:04:56 <TheJollyRoger> Every device running GrapheneOS has a bitwise identical system image to every one of the same devices running GrapheneOS. For instance, if you have a Pixel 3a, and I had a Pixel 3a, it doesn't matter that we're completely different people, running different use cases, apps, and such, the system image on both your phone, and my phone, is bitwise identical and the Qualcomm Bootloader that's been
06:04:58 <TheJollyRoger> keyed to s?trcat's signing keys will check that every time the phone reboots.
06:05:21 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. One potential use case for Remote Verification is to check heuristically for intrusion.
06:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> *check regularly for intrusion.
06:06:12 <TheJollyRoger> let's take an example...
06:07:09 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, let's say that there's an Extremely Determined Adversary (we'll call 'em the EDA) that wants to get control of your phone and discovers an exploit that can escape from the multiple layers of isolation and sandboxing that keeps the apps confined and isolated.
06:07:47 <TheJollyRoger> And they use this exploit to reach into your phone's system partition, and say... modify it to do something like say, break the permission model, or install a backdoor or even pivot to a further exploit.
06:08:29 <TheJollyRoger> If the operating system becomes compromised like that, then it's going to fail attestation because the device is no longer running GrapheneOS unmodified in its original condition.
06:10:31 <TheJollyRoger> Because Auditor relies on the attestation data generated by your phone's Strongbox (if you're running a Pixel), even if the operating system can lie to /you/ on the screen or even to Android Debug Bridge, it can't lie to remote attestation.
06:14:08 <thelearner[m]> Thank you for the very detailed response. The auditor app, seems to be essential to the security of GOS. Why is it separate from the built in settings of the OS, instead being a stand alone app?
06:14:09 <TheJollyRoger> So the remote attestation is essentially a way for you to, if you're worried that someone might fool around with your device by potentially a software exploit, to be able to periodically check to make sure that it hasn't gone so far as to modify the operating system itself. A good use case for this, as an individual, is if you're about to travel over a border, and you've paired your phone with
06:14:11 <TheJollyRoger> an attestation server beforehand.
06:14:45 <TheJollyRoger> Partially because it goes a bit further than GrapheneOS! It can be used on and installed to other non-GrapheneOS phones!
06:15:36 <TheJollyRoger> There's a long list of phones it does support, some with better security than others (Phones that support Strongbox, and have the dedicated hardware to support Strongbox, are going to be much harder for an adversary to exploit than ones that don't have Strongbox).
06:15:55 <TheJollyRoger> Provided you're running the vendor operating system on thosse phones, Auditor can extend many of the same benefits to them, too.
06:16:38 <thelearner[m]> Makes sense in regards to the use case. Oh, haha my fault, thought it was a GOS only app. Amazing app though.
06:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> (If the phone doesn't support Strongbox, then it's likely going to utilize the Trusted Execution Environment, but while that's a considerable security gain from allowing the operating system domain over it, it has more attack surface than letting a separate enclave chip process it)
06:17:05 <TheJollyRoger> It is! :D
06:17:22 <TheJollyRoger> In a company/corporate setting it could become even more valuable with a few subtle tweaks.
06:18:54 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, a theoretical use case would be... let's say you're running an organization like say, activism, journalism, or a legal firm, where you need to make sure that your company phones aren't tampered with to maintain client or source confidentiality and your members' phones are high value targets.
06:19:52 <TheJollyRoger> Although this functionality to self-host and use multiple attestation servers needs to be added, it would be possible for you to set up remote integrity monitoring to provide a periodic "check in"
06:20:08 <TheJollyRoger> And if one of those phones either A) goes dead, or B) starts sending back invalid attestation data,
06:20:53 <TheJollyRoger> right then and there you know that A) something has happened to one of your members, or at the very least, one of their phones. B) one of your member's phones has been hacked and should be retrieved and examined right away.
06:22:35 <TheJollyRoger> Of course, in that situtation it's best to check before hitting the roof: maybe they just forgot to put it on the charging plate that night and their phone has run out of battery power.
06:22:44 <TheJollyRoger> That's an entirely innocent reason a phone could literally "go dead."
06:22:59 <TheJollyRoger> Or they dropped it in a mud puddle or something.
06:27:18 <thelearner[m]> Very informative! :D Would you have any links or lectures that I could read/follow? Just don't want to bog down this with too many questions haha. Could I send message to your chat of I have another question regarding auditor or other? Also, thank you once again for your very detailed response. Very helpful in understanding the auditor app use case and why it is need or important.
06:27:59 <TheJollyRoger> I don't have any links or lectures, but I tell you what... I could write one and put it on my knowledge base if you like. You can ask me anytime you like. I'm probably going to head off for the night shortly, but I'm usually on on most days.
06:28:29 <TheJollyRoger> If you send me a PM and I don't appear to get it within about 48 hours or so, usually try sending it again, because on occasion my Integricloud server crashes and then I lose the notification.
06:28:45 <TheJollyRoger> (I didn't add enough memory to it X(... I really should :P )
06:31:37 <cn3m[m]> If you are interested in security chips in general I watched a wonderful blackhat on the SEP. Might give you insight
06:31:50 <TheJollyRoger> I'd love to see it!
06:32:20 <thelearner[m]> That would be very handy and would be most welcomed! :) Could you send a link to your knowledge base/website. Also, thank you for wanting to give your time to help and answer my questions, very grateful.
06:32:20 <thelearner[m]> Will do. Haha got no idea what that is, but hope you find a fix for it soon. :)
06:33:25 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. It's a tad bit out of date but some of the stuff here might help you on general directions, I think I'll add our discussion on Auditor to it. https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge
06:34:02 <thelearner[m]> Sounds good and no worries. Will give it a good read over.
06:35:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah! And if you've got more questions let me know and I can add them!
06:36:07 <cn3m[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLGFriOKz6U&t=415 TheJollyRoger
06:36:13 <thelearner[m]> Awesome. Sounds good. :)
06:36:19 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo!
06:38:59 <cn3m[m]> It's very good
06:39:03 <thelearner[m]> In regards to Secure Core Laptops, would there be anyones with good GPUs?
06:40:27 <TheJollyRoger> I actually uh... humm... I dunno anything about Secure Core Laptops >_<.
06:41:07 <cn3m[m]> I'd get an ARM Mac at this point. They are going to have a bonkers GPU on them and even good x86 performance
06:41:43 <cn3m[m]> ARM is better built for verified boot and it's much cheaper
06:43:10 <thelearner[m]> That's okay. :) yea, been hearing a lot lately about apples new ARM Macs, just don't want to get apple products and mainly, would want a laptop that I could game on. Mostly portability is why, otherwise would just build a rig.
06:44:07 <macg[m]> <thelearner[m] "That's okay. :) yea, been hearin"> Yeah the fastest supercomputer in the world right now is ARM based
06:44:25 <cn3m[m]> Security and gaming don't go super well together. You install a lot of sketchy insecure code as admin or root
06:44:32 <thelearner[m]> macg: Japanese one?
06:44:37 <macg[m]> yup
06:44:51 <cn3m[m]> macOS is pretty good about not needing root for stuff, but it's not great for gaming
06:45:00 <thelearner[m]> cn3m: that's a shame.
06:45:22 <macg[m]> Do you guys also use privacy-enhancing main OSs like FreeBSD?
06:45:27 <thelearner[m]> Yea, if only apple did both, would be perfect.
06:45:48 <macg[m]> Yeah and if only apple had decent hardware... the best mac they ever made was the 2015 pro
06:45:53 <thelearner[m]> macg: no just windows.
06:46:09 <cn3m[m]> If you want security and gaming I'm not sure there's a better platform than iPad or macOS
06:46:26 <macg[m]> Yep macOS is the best for both
06:46:58 <thelearner[m]> macg: What about the cheese shredder, in regards to decent hardware.
06:47:44 <thelearner[m]> cn3m: too much $$ for me. Might just stick too windows.
06:48:34 <cn3m[m]> I use Windows, but I only game on Steam and keep it in another profile
06:48:55 <cn3m[m]> That's the least insecure way to game
06:49:42 <cn3m[m]> On Windows
06:49:49 <cn3m[m]> Steam installs games for you as admin. As Steam so they are a little less likely to do shady things
06:50:02 <thelearner[m]> Fair. Though, apple stuff wasn't the best for gaming? Will that change in 4 years with ARM?
06:50:25 <cn3m[m]> I'd use Steam exclusively
06:50:45 <dazinism> Auditor is now on the izzyondroid Fdroid repo
06:50:48 <dazinism> https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/app.attestation.auditor
06:51:56 <cn3m[m]> <thelearner[m] "Fair. Though, apple stuff wasn't"> ARM Macs will be able to play iPad games FWIW
06:53:41 <thelearner[m]> cn3m: don't have anything apple, though good to know. :)
06:54:14 <thelearner[m]> TheJollyRoger: Thank you once again for your help. Have a great day! :)
06:56:20 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime! :)

17:57:44 <jalb> Hello, to use auditor remotely, do I need a friend or someone else with Auditor installed to check the QR code or there's some website to check it?
18:01:23 <aeonsolution[m]> Here are the instructions https://attestation.app/tutorial
18:02:36 <jalb> aeonsolution[m], thank you very much for your help!
18:05:20 <httplov3craft[m]> <bend[m] "hi everyone, I was told on reddi"> What did you break? 😏😂
18:11:46 <jcpicard32[m]> Quick sanity check. Did you let things keep running when you hit the fastbootd menu? When I installed originally I didn't realize that things continued installing after you first get there, and I had similar issues.
18:14:24 <jalb> aeonsolution[m], do you think it's safe or private in some way to use attestation website to check remotely my system?, it uses Google DNS
18:14:30 <defconanon12[m]> bend: If you hit the enter key before the flash finished you are going to have a corrupt OS. In this case a corrupted Graphene OS.
18:16:55 <jcpicard32[m]> When I had this problem I just tried reinstalling and gave it plenty of time to do its thing and it worked.
18:17:22 <defconanon12[m]> bend: Well at this point you need to reflash the stock OS and start over from there. It is possible you have a bad Stock OS not sure. Depends where you got the Stock OS from.
18:17:23 <jcpicard32[m]> You definitely have Fastboot working, which provided you used the version from google means you avoided the other common pitfall
18:17:26 <jcpicard32[m]> Yeah that's what I did
18:17:35 <jcpicard32[m]> You could also try reflashing the stock OS
18:17:47 <jcpicard32[m]> Just make sure to switch the keys back using the instruction at the end of the guide
18:20:11 <jcpicard32[m]> That is normal. Just let it do its thing when you get there
18:21:01 <nickcalyx[m]> you should read the output of the script
18:21:09 <nickcalyx[m]> to figure out what's not working
18:21:28 <nickcalyx[m]> maybe your disk is filling up when it tries to unzip graphene

19:30:33 <strcat[m]> @maneo:matrix.org: no not at all
19:30:38 <cn3m[m]> <maneo[m] "would taking the steps outlined "> No not even close
19:31:16 <strcat[m]> thinking that making assorted little tweaks makes a substantial difference for your security is so wrong too
19:31:54 <madaidan[m]> <maneo[m] "would taking the steps outlined "> Not even close
19:32:13 <strcat[m]> BTW I'm getting tired of people using this channel to get desktop security advice
19:32:15 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 has good security options, but they are just extending the already partially formally verified and well audited hypervisor features
19:32:18 <strcat[m]> whenever I look at it that's the discussion
19:32:20 <madaidan[m]> Changing a few settings will not fix architectural security issues
19:32:25 <strcat[m]> and people are not willing to go back and read past discussions
19:32:32 <jknsec[m]> Would it be ill-advised if I duel booted a rarely used Arch with Windows? Currently using Qubes but it works very poorly on my hardware and I need something
19:32:35 <maneo[m]> thank you guys, in that case it sounds like it might be worth it to go back to windows
19:32:36 <jknsec[m]> oh okay
19:33:19 <jknsec[m]> lol I ask a question immediately when strcat mentions he's tired to desktop security stuff
19:33:35 <strcat[m]> it was never on-topic
19:33:42 <antranigv> Hey all
19:33:47 <jknsec[m]> True
19:33:51 <strcat[m]> and if it's just a retread of past and especially recently discussions it's not appropriate
19:34:11 <strcat[m]> when you want to know something you should do research
19:34:20 <strcat[m]> asking questions here is a last resort when you can't find the answer yourself
19:34:24 <sixBit[m]> <cn3m[m] "Windows 10 has good security opt"> Do you use an AV?
19:34:35 <maneo[m]> if only ltsc was easier to purchase
19:34:41 <antranigv> I have a Pixel 2 with GrapheneOS where I do some testing of friend's software. However, I really want to use a proper powerful phone (this one's batter is no-good anymore), which one do you guys recommend?
19:34:52 <strcat[m]> @maneo:matrix.org: ltsc is an optional enterprise feature and is not advisable
19:34:54 <cn3m[m]> We all saw the was bad timing don't worryjknsec
19:34:59 <strcat[m]> you should follow the normal releases
19:34:59 <antranigv> I know Graphane is Pixel-only, so I'm assuming the coming Pixel 5 or current Pixel 4?
19:35:04 <strcat[m]> and again
19:35:07 <strcat[m]> you could just read past discussions
19:35:10 <strcat[m]> and see this
19:35:30 <antranigv> also, is there a way to "sandbox" an application and then run it? sometimes I need to run non-opensource apps.
19:35:32 <strcat[m]> it's tiring repeating the same things about off-topic stuff people want to talk about more than the topic of the channel
19:35:42 <strcat[m]> antranigv: all apps are sandboxed
19:35:56 <strcat[m]> antranigv: an app being open source does not mean it's secure or privacy friendly
19:36:25 <antranigv> strcat[m] but at least I can read the code :) :P
19:36:27 <antranigv> just kidding
19:36:43 <cn3m[m]> This chat is logged you can search strcat[m] Windows for example
19:37:04 <cx2[m]> antranigv: would seriously consider typing keywords into the channel search. You will fine answers to all questions you've asked.
19:37:14 <cn3m[m]> <antranigv "also, is there a way to "sandbox"> This is covered in the FAQ and Usage guide. It covers what apps can see
19:37:37 <antranigv> cx2[m] thanks! I'll search now (I think my ZNC keeps the logs)
19:37:45 <strcat[m]> antranigv: you can read the compiled code either way - and I'm not sure how that really helps you
19:37:47 <antranigv> cn3m[m] thanks! I'll read it again.
19:37:52 <maneo[m]> thanks again, and my bad for derailing the discussion strcat
19:37:53 <jknsec[m]> sorry, lol, I've done research just didn't realize it was a big issue
19:38:22 <dazinism> cn3m: you got any more  info/links about verified boot on Samsung s10e?
19:38:23 <strcat[m]> if you search the logs for this channel you'll see people want to talk about desktop operating systems multiple times a day
19:38:25 <jknsec[m]> But I do have a question about the device descriptor bug or whatever it's called
19:38:27 <strcat[m]> and I'm not sure whty
19:38:31 <strcat[m]>  * and I'm not sure why
19:39:06 <strcat[m]> and each time people bring it up, it will be harder to find the discussions which were more in-depth - which are few
19:39:13 <strcat[m]> so you're just making your own life harder
19:39:22 <strcat[m]> because either way I expect people to go read the past discussions
19:39:29 <strcat[m]> so yes you will have to dig through 300 non-in-depth ones
19:39:33 <strcat[m]> with people posting misinformation
19:39:38 <strcat[m]> because people keep bringing it up daily
19:39:50 <TheJollyRoger> @strcat ah crud, sorry. I'll ask people to take desktop security questions elsewhere.
19:40:09 <strcat[m]> it's no longer an appropriate topic - it has been discussed enough
19:40:11 <cn3m[m]> strcat: can madaidan and your discussion here https://forums.whonix.org/t/fixing-the-desktop-linux-security-model/9172
19:40:11 <cn3m[m]> Be the go to resource?
19:40:31 <strcat[m]> no
19:41:08 <strcat[m]> cn3m: feel free to point people there w/e
19:41:11 <strcat[m]> just no more about this
19:41:30 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. No more desktop security questions, then.
19:41:38 <strcat[m]> tired of this topic 3 times every day, almost every time I look at the channel it's just people discussing the same misunderstandings/misconceptions they have about desktop Linux - it's pretty stupid
19:42:05 <jknsec[m]> strcat Has there been a proper patch for it or is there still just a sort of "workaround"? Or is that the patch?
19:42:26 <strcat[m]> why
19:42:27 <strcat[m]> look at the thread
19:44:15 <jknsec[m]> what thread? I checked release notes and am under the impression that something was simply disabled in the hardened_malloc implementation
19:44:24 <jknsec[m]> Still
19:44:33 <jknsec[m]> * But I do have a question about the device descriptor bug or whatever it's called.
19:46:41 <strcat[m]> jknsec: it was disabled for that specific audio process
19:46:47 <strcat[m]> you can look at the threads on the issue tracker]
19:46:51 <strcat[m]>  * you can look at the threads on the issue tracker
19:47:45 <jknsec[m]> kk
19:48:22 <jknsec[m]> I feel as though I hath invoked the daily annoyance of strcat
19:49:03 <strcat[m]> it's no easier for me to search for the thread and link it to you than it is for you to find it
19:49:17 <strcat[m]> there is one for the original issue and one for the workaround
19:49:25 <strcat[m]> linking to each other
19:49:38 <cn3m[m]> It's a lot of work to be community manager and lead developer. He's trying to have people do their own research.

19:54:00 <MysteriousWizard> Makes sense (it doesn't) but thanks
19:56:11 <jknsec[m]> bend Waiting for any device usually means it's not reading the device properly
19:56:51 <TheJollyRoger> jknsec[m]: are you on fastboot?
19:57:03 <TheJollyRoger> And if you are on Linux, are your udev rules set properly?
19:58:00 <jknsec[m]> I can't remember. That was simply my experiencing with flashing. Then again I did it on Arch.
19:58:06 <cn3m[m]> MysteriousWizard1943: he's only here as strcat, only on GitHub as thestinger, and only on Reddit as DanielMicay
19:58:45 <jknsec[m]> TheJollyRoger bend Is the one having the issue though...
19:59:09 <aeonsolution[m]> bend redownload the release
19:59:12 <aeonsolution[m]> and try again
19:59:33 <aeonsolution[m]> you probably moved files you werent supposed to by accident
20:00:11 <aeonsolution[m]> when the bat file runs, the device moves to fastbootd
20:00:17 <aeonsolution[m]> the flashing happens here
20:00:19 <jknsec[m]> ^
20:00:31 <aeonsolution[m]> when it finishes, the script reboots into the bootloader
20:00:45 <TheJollyRoger-M> Oh wait I see... The bridge conked out and I don't see Bend because the bridge is silently dropping his messages.
20:00:47 <aeonsolution[m]> and at this step you lock the device following the instructions on the install page
20:00:57 <jknsec[m]> woah
20:01:00 <TheJollyRoger-M> Sorry jknsec my mistake.
20:01:10 <aeonsolution[m]> if it messed up between fastbootd and the bootloader
20:01:13 <jknsec[m]> It's fine, lol
20:01:42 <aeonsolution[m]> then you tampered with the unzipped release thus why its failing to flash the device
20:01:46 <jknsec[m]> Probably need to switch to an IRC client on of these days. Or just use both.
20:02:21 <jknsec[m]> Also need to make a Github account. Add it to the pile.

Early Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL bootloader versions use a non-standard unlocking system not covered by these installation instructions. You can either update the device via

20:52:00 <aeonsolution[m]> the flashing will always fail

21:01:49 <georgeaux[m]> Is it normal or how it supposed to work, how should I use it? Because now its kind of annoying in my opinion.
21:07:17 <georgeaux[m]> Noone gets me. Okay :D Than I guess everything imported goes on the "desktop/main screen" and for other apps I have to move my fingers twice.
21:22:45 <greenmoon[m]> You are doing it wrong I think
21:23:12 <greenmoon[m]> You are opening the multitask thing instead of the drawer

22:05:23 <kinderkraft[m]> Hello, how can I see that Grapheneos was updated? Then I am pushing the button, check update : nothing hapening. I installed it, in the begining of the month and now on the homepage I see that it was update (after I installed it) do not know what to do... Maybe I schould use sideloading?
22:07:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> kinderkraft: you must reboot
22:08:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can only apply one update at a time
22:08:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> You must reboot after that before you can apply another

22:16:07 <kinderkraft[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "You can only apply one update at"> Just I am doing it for the first time... Actually I do not know how does the update looks like
22:17:45 <jcpicard32[m]> cn3m: TheJollyRoger Aww thanks guys. Just trying to do what I can to help out. Programming skills aren't there yet but I can at least apply what I've read about <3
23:07:15 <animalchin[m]> Hey all. Hope the day has been good for all of you. I have a question.  Is there any benefit to using DoH on a browser if I'm already using VPNForAndroin? I know my VPN provider already uses its own DNS. Some articles I've read say do it. Some say just use the VPN.  I noticed on the VPN website it shows I'm protected with the VPN IP but a DNS leak test shows the DoH address. Any input would be appreciated. Thank
23:07:15 <animalchin[m]> you.
23:28:39 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-dns
23:28:45 <strcat[m]> read the sections about DNS, VPNs, etc.
23:28:54 <strcat[m]> it explains that the DNS server you're using can be detected
23:29:03 <strcat[m]> so if you're using a VPN and want to blend in use the VPN provided DNS servers
23:29:18 <strcat[m]> if you want ad-blocking use a popular VPN provider providing it as an option
23:33:41 <animalchin[m]> strcat: thank you very much for the answer
