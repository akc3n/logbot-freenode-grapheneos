02:40:46 <majesticfruit[m]> Hi all. New to the community here. Apologies if this has been answered: What is Daniel‚Äôs take on ios vs graphene os in terms of privacy and security? Specifically ios 14 vs current graphene os version. Threat model includes adversaries with reasonable amount of resources (think local/state police, small/ mid-sized organizations with ~$100k for attacks). Think mid-tier political activists with valuable assets in
02:40:46 <majesticfruit[m]> the form of data. Looking for secure smartphones for communication and temporary data storage of valuable data that would be damaging if in the wrong hands.

04:46:31 <bustybroccoli[m]> When Pixel 4a support comes out do you think that the Pixel 4a 5G will be supported as well? Thanks!
04:47:15 <bustybroccoli[m]> Also hello I‚Äôm new here! Just getting into all of this
04:49:42 <strcat[m]> no
04:49:49 <strcat[m]> they're completely different devices
04:50:05 <strcat[m]> the 4a 5G naming is misleading, it's more like a "5a"
04:51:38 <strcat[m]> no one is working on Pixel 5 or 4a 5G support and both are currently only supported by an AOSP device branch not aligned with the normal releases
04:51:49 <strcat[m]> they use a branch of Android newer than normal Android 11, until the next maintenance release for Android 11
04:54:42 <bustybroccoli[m]> Oh okay, thanks for the info!
07:04:53 <lpcvoid[m]> Are the device updates currently building? Saw there's a new release on the platform manifest repo
07:07:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lpcvoid](https://matrix.to/#/@lpcvoid:matrix.org)  yes that's because I fucked up something yesterday
07:08:01 <lpcvoid[m]> Haha, happens. Looking forward to the update :)
07:08:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> So the release had to be pulled back until the issue could be resolved
07:08:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's resolved now
07:08:35 <Floria[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "So the release had to be pulled "> How hard is it to find the device ID in Auditor?
07:14:14 <Floria[m]> Like the current support right now

13:36:28 <somenerd[m]> Kinda dumb question, but what is the auditor used for?

13:38:06 <somenerd[m]> ok nvm
13:38:57 <ISSHIN[m]> I bought a Pixel4a recently and would like to shift to more private and secure GrapheneOS but there are many things in Pixel that really impress me, for eg, its camera and I actually mean the software behind it. I doubt Google has made it open-source so I was wondering if the Camera and image processing in GrapheneOS is just as good or not?
13:38:57 <ISSHIN[m]> A few other things are Pixel's smart gestures and just general optimization of the OS which I think is really cool.
13:38:57 <ISSHIN[m]> And then we have Pixel's Titan Security Module, how does GrapheneOS affect it?
13:39:24 <somenerd[m]> I think since Google Camera isn't there, it won't be as good
13:39:40 <Resynth[m]> You can sideload the APK
13:40:01 <somenerd[m]> It doesn't need Google Services?
13:40:07 <Resynth[m]> It runs fine without
13:40:16 <Resynth[m]> You need something called 'GCam Services Provider' tho
13:40:30 <somenerd[m]> ok
13:40:38 <Resynth[m]> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
13:40:47 <Resynth[m]> Just install the APK and Camera will work
13:40:47 <somenerd[m]> hmm
13:40:56 <Resynth[m]> Block internet access from Camera though, for privacy reasons
13:40:58 <ISSHIN[m]> Thanks a lot.
13:41:02 <somenerd[m]> yeah
13:41:10 <ISSHIN[m]> I never turn it on
13:41:22 <ISSHIN[m]> And what about the Titan security module?
13:41:48 <Resynth[m]> Graphene works fine with Titan M
13:41:52 <Resynth[m]> I still think Titan M is shit, but it exists on GrapheneOS
13:42:07 <somenerd[m]> what was it for again?
13:42:21 <Resynth[m]> Security: encryption, etc.
13:42:42 <Resynth[m]> https://www.androidauthority.com/titan-m-security-chip-915888/

13:43:10 <ISSHIN[m]> Well given it's from google, we still have doubts if the NSA has encryption keys to it

13:57:46 <ISSHIN[m]> Eeeek Pesky demons

14:22:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is because the wipe implementation simply does an rm -rf /data and doesn't bother to check if the operation actually succeeded

14:25:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Free national security‚Ñ¢
14:27:40 <strcat[m]> harmful misinformation was being spread here about encryption
14:27:48 <strcat[m]> people spreading misinformation like that will be banned, you don't get a warning
14:28:00 <strcat[m]> if you don't know what you're talking about please don't try to make technical claims and give other people advice
14:28:11 <somenerd[m]> ok
14:28:20 <somenerd[m]> will try to remember that
14:29:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW really excited about the pixel 5 encryption
14:29:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> AFAIK they are using the mainline implementation now
14:29:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> So that should be way more supported by upstream top
14:29:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> * So that should be way more supported by upstream too
14:31:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> And since hardware based encryption and software based encryption on mainline produce exactly the same result
14:31:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can verify that the hardware is not backdooring it
14:32:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> See the docs, you can freely switch between software and hardware encryption when using the inlinecrypt_optimized option
14:32:47 <somenerd[m]> the AOSP ones?
14:32:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yep
14:32:59 <somenerd[m]> where are they? (just wondering)
14:33:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google themselves says their mainlined version only changes how the encryption is done and not the on disk format
14:33:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> So you can switch hw->sw or sw->hw freely
14:34:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> <somenerd[m] "where are they? (just wondering)"> It's basically the same thing all pixels use already
14:34:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> They just standardized it
14:35:20 <somenerd[m]> sounds good (as far as I understand)
14:50:50 <somenerd[m]> can auditor replace PGP signature verification? (in terms of verifying authenticity and integrity)
14:52:46 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't use PGP
14:52:59 <strcat[m]> PGP is a very poor encryption and signing mechanism
14:53:39 <strcat[m]> not really sure what you mean though
14:53:49 <strcat[m]> not sure what you're asking
14:54:10 <somenerd[m]> I might have confused PGP w/ something else
14:54:15 <somenerd[m]> let em check
14:54:22 <somenerd[m]>  * let me check
14:54:27 <strcat[m]> Auditor is a tool for using hardware-based attestation and the hardware-based keystore to verify the OS, firmware and device identity
14:55:30 <strcat[m]> as an implementation detail it uses ECDSA with the P-256 curve since it wants 128-bit security (i.e. far more than enough) and ~256-bit EC keys offer 128-bit equivalent security
14:55:50 <strcat[m]> i.e. the key it generates on the hardware-backed keystore is an ECDSA P-256 key
14:56:01 <strcat[m]> it will switch to Ed25519 when it's supported by the hardware keystore but it's very unimportant
14:56:29 <strcat[m]> you can look at the code if you're interested in the implementation details
14:56:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "i.e. the key it generates on the"> Afaik the only issue with nist curves is don't have a broken RNG?
14:57:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Right?
14:57:27 <strcat[m]> essentially issues like they, they are less misuse resistant
14:57:31 <strcat[m]> but it's not being misused
14:58:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well there's a hardware rng on pixels that does seem to pass fips
14:58:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> So that is not a concern with the nist curves?
14:58:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Well there's a hardware rng on pixels that does seem to pass fips 140-02
14:58:56 <strcat[m]> passing CSPRNG tests is not any kind of verification of security, that is not why it is secure
14:59:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
14:59:08 <somenerd[m]> > PGP is a very poor encryption and signing mechanism
14:59:08 <somenerd[m]> yeah I meant the signing of the GrapheneOS download
14:59:19 <strcat[m]> and if you're talking about the hardware random number generator that is obviously not used directly anyway it's an entropy input
14:59:21 <strcat[m]> among others
14:59:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Thanks [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org)
14:59:32 <strcat[m]> if you're talking about the one provided by the SoC for the OS
15:00:17 <strcat[m]> the Titan M has dedicated hardware entropy generation + CSPRNG, so that's what's used internally for the StrongBox keystore
15:00:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "if you're talking about the one "> I just decided to study crypto in the past but was left with more questions than answers
15:00:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> And all of the advice online seemed horribly wrong
15:00:46 <strcat[m]> Titan M random number generation is just for StrongBox
15:01:05 <strcat[m]> and other stuff it does internally
15:01:28 <strcat[m]> it's not a service it provides to the OS, etc. since the SoC already has a good implementation of that functionality anyway
15:01:38 <strcat[m]> no harm in using both but that's not done
15:02:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "it's not a service it provides t"> So where's /dev/hwrng coming from?
15:03:01 <strcat[m]> SoC
15:03:08 <strcat[m]> and that is not used directly for anything
15:03:16 <strcat[m]> it's used as an entropy source to feed into the kernel CSPRNG
15:03:34 <strcat[m]> which is fed with multiple sources of entropy
15:04:07 <strcat[m]> the kernel CSPRNG is what stuff uses, including to seed userspace CSPRNGs (which exist to avoid system call / locking overhead)
15:04:40 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc has an internal CSPRNG specialized for the use case of the randomization-based exploit mitigations
15:04:42 <strcat[m]> so look at that
15:04:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "SoC"> Pm
15:04:50 <strcat[m]> it's performance-oriented though
15:05:22 <strcat[m]> it's just for exploit mitigations so it's overkill as it is
15:05:43 <strcat[m]> anyway https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/random.c is the CSPRNG implementation
15:05:57 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/chacha.c is the stream cipher it uses
15:05:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> One of these days
15:06:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Going to seriously read h_malloc code
15:06:16 <strcat[m]> it doesn't encrypt anything, so the stream cipher implementation is ChaCha with support for a message removed
15:06:34 <strcat[m]> usually it generates a keystream and as it goes it XORs it with the message to encrypt it
15:06:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW why chacha instead of something like xorshift?
15:07:02 <strcat[m]> since there is nothing to encrypt, but rather a CSPRNG to implement, it has the message parameter removed, and the XOR of keystream with message removed
15:07:09 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: because XorShift is not secure
15:07:14 <strcat[m]> it's not a CSPRNG
15:07:37 <strcat[m]> it needs a fast CSPRNG, ChaCha fits what it needs without requiring platform-specific acceleration
15:07:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: because XorShift "> Think you can explain in OT?
15:07:55 <strcat[m]> XorShift is an insecure RNG
15:08:18 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have security properties
15:08:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "XorShift is an insecure RNG"> Yeah but why so
15:08:27 <strcat[m]> because it doesn't have security properties
15:08:46 <strcat[m]> it just does an arbitrary thing that seems to produce random-ish numbers
15:08:56 <strcat[m]> for the most part
15:09:12 <strcat[m]> that is not what is required for the use case
15:09:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
15:10:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) BTW did you implement chacha.c yourself?
15:10:02 <strcat[m]> XorShift and other non-CSPRNGs mimic randomness, CSPRNGs are indistinguishable from randomness and have actual security properties / proofs
15:10:22 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no it's the reference implementation with the message parameter and XOR of the keystream with the message removed
15:10:26 <strcat[m]> so it outputs solely the keystream
15:10:34 <strcat[m]> it says where it's from at the top of the file
15:10:36 <strcat[m]> and the license
15:10:59 <strcat[m]> random.c is my code
15:11:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> K
15:11:37 <strcat[m]> https://cr.yp.to/streamciphers/timings/estreambench/submissions/salsa20/chacha8/merged/chacha.c
15:11:59 <strcat[m]> const u8 *m
15:12:02 <strcat[m]> there is no message
15:12:04 <strcat[m]> delete that parameter
15:12:11 <strcat[m]> delete XOR of message with keystream
15:12:19 <strcat[m]> reformat it to the same codestyle, and you get what I have
15:12:38 <strcat[m]> and I renamed it to be called _keystream
15:12:43 <strcat[m]> since it's not an encryption function anymore
15:13:20 <strcat[m]> keystream_bytes instead of encrypt_bytes as the function name
15:14:04 <strcat[m]> you can see https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/random.c is a CSPRNG instance seeded from either the OS or another instance of itself
15:14:18 <somenerd[m]> Sorry to interrupt
15:14:19 <strcat[m]> reseeds itself from the OS after a certain amount of usage
15:14:34 <somenerd[m]> I was wondering what was the suggested way to verify the Graphene download and installation? Auditor, or the signatures on the website(or both)?
15:14:58 <strcat[m]> verify the download with signify
15:14:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <somenerd[m] "I was wondering what was the sug"> Ideally do both
15:15:02 <strcat[m]> then verify the installation with Auditor
15:15:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> But just auditor is enough too
15:15:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> If something is corrupt it won't boot after you lock the bootloader
15:15:39 <strcat[m]> yes but it will if it was signed with a malicious key
15:15:44 <strcat[m]> that won't pass Auditor verification
15:15:50 <strcat[m]> but the initial Auditor verification is a weak unpaired verification
15:15:56 <strcat[m]> read the Auditor documentation to understand why
15:16:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "yes but it will if it was signed"> That is why auditor
15:16:17 <somenerd[m]> are the docs on the website?
15:16:17 <strcat[m]> so Auditor does verify it but it doesn't provide a strong assurance until it is paired
15:16:31 <strcat[m]> @lelmister101:matrix.org: https://attestation.app/about
15:16:47 <strcat[m]> read that, and read the link to the technical documentation there (that is not the technical documentation)
15:17:07 <strcat[m]> it links to the Auditor technical documentation and the Android documentation on key attestation
15:17:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <somenerd[m] "are the docs on the website?"> Basically we do a first weak initial pairing that verifies the key used to sign the system and we put a key in your keystore
15:17:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> The first pairing is weak because we just verify the system and trust the keys we put in the keystore
15:17:52 <strcat[m]> just read the official documentation
15:18:02 <strcat[m]> don't try to explain it here
15:18:16 <somenerd[m]> yeah I'll read the docs
15:18:24 <somenerd[m]> Thanks a lot for helping!
15:19:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> The second verification is stronger because it verifies the ROM as well as the identity of the device from the keys pinned in the first verification. The keys cannot be moved off the device and the hardware will refuse to disclose them if the OS is modified in any way
15:19:51 <somenerd[m]>  * yeah I'll read the docs as well
15:20:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> And now go and read the docs
15:20:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is a very simplified version that doesn't explain everything
15:20:24 <strcat[m]> the initial verification relies on the attestation root
15:21:02 <strcat[m]> the device being audited generates a hardware backed key with attestation enabled
15:21:52 <strcat[m]> subsequent verifications have both the public key of that key and the attestation certificate chain pinned, so it's now also verifying signatures from the hardware-backed key and isn't relying on the attestation root since it pinned the certificate chain
15:21:54 <strcat[m]> documentation explains all this
15:22:06 <strcat[m]> really best to just refer to the documentation

18:12:11 <fourstepper> Hi, I have a question: how is the experience with notifications on slack/mattermost? Can the push notifications be made to work well on graphene? Thanks
18:14:31 <Floria[m]> <fourstepper "Hi, I have a question: how is th"> No notifications
18:14:42 <Floria[m]> https://github.com/techlore-official/plexus/blob/master/src/data/Plexus.csv
18:18:30 <dazinism> Its possible to use slack integrations to send notifications about slack events in a way that you would get notifications.
18:18:40 <dazinism> Not used slack much
18:24:47 <mx[m]> Hi, where can I download app if it is not on f-droid? Is Aurora store safe enough?
18:25:26 <mx[m]> Looking for a bank apps like revolut
18:29:05 <fourstepper> <dazinism "Its possible to use slack integr"> What do you mean with slack integrations ?
18:29:45 <dazinism> Maybe just get them to send email notifications (fairemail apparently handles push notifications via IMAP IDLE)
18:30:36 <fourstepper> <Floria[m] "No notifications"> No way around that?
18:30:40 <fourstepper> <dazinism "Maybe just get them to send emai"> That could work
18:31:50 <dazinism> fourstepper: its been a while, but in slack you can add 'integrations' which add the possibility for the slack channel to interact with other services. After a few you have to pay.
18:31:51 <dazinism> Many of them can only be added by the channel / room admin
18:32:32 <dazinism> Eg. You can create an matrix/element room and bridge a slack room to that.
18:32:46 <dazinism> Then you'd get notifications via element
18:32:58 <oj-j[m]> Is the grapheneos device difficult to get inside without your permission?
18:32:58 <oj-j[m]> I mean with iPhone you have the option of data erase after trying 10 times.
18:34:01 <dazinism> mx: look at https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
18:34:07 <fourstepper> I see - I am mostly concerned about being in a company that requires me to use slack eg on call sysadmin
18:34:16 <strcat[m]> oj-diehard: you need to ask clearer questions
18:34:22 <strcat[m]> oj-diehard: be specific
18:34:39 <strcat[m]> not worth trying to answer very unclear, overly broad questions
18:35:30 <strcat[m]> and you follow up that broad, vague question with something very specific and fairly different from what your question seems to imply you want to talk about
18:35:50 <dazinism> fourstepper Imagine you can get slack to send email notifications of messages that would be the easiest way to get notifications
18:37:21 <strcat[m]> oj-diehard: you need to do research and reading first, before asking here
18:37:42 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of existing posts, etc. about topics like exploit mitigations, attack surface, encryption
18:38:01 <strcat[m]> so ask a specific question based on a gap in what you're missing after reading
18:38:05 <oj-j[m]> Sorry strcat.
18:38:57 <strcat[m]> the supported devices have hardware-based exponentially increasing throttling (quickly throttles to 1 day per key derivation attempt) for decryption attempts
18:39:00 <fourstepper> <dazinism "fourstepper Imagine you can get "> Ah so thats built in? I guess that would solve the problem - I am already using fairemail so that would work
18:39:11 <strcat[m]> if you want to wipe after N failed attempts you can do that
18:39:16 <strcat[m]> but neither of those seems to be what you actually asked about
18:39:27 <fourstepper> dazinism would that require anything else from my employer to do?
18:40:17 <strcat[m]> wiping after N attempts is a feature provided for device managers, there isn't a UI for it in the Settings app, probably because it's regarded as prone to having users lose their data
18:40:36 <oj-j[m]> I am just asking since I come from a iPhone to grapheneos. Just want to know if here you also have a data erase after trying many times to unlock the device
18:40:47 <strcat[m]> with little impact on a sophisticated adversary and no impact with any decent lock method
18:40:51 <strcat[m]> oj-diehard: not what you asked
18:41:12 <strcat[m]> oj-diehard: as I said there's hardware enforced exponentially increasing throttling by default via the Weaver feature
18:41:38 <strcat[m]> oj-diehard: and you can optionally enable software-based wiping after N attempts via device manager support (there isn't a UI for enabling it in Settings, but it's supported by the OS)
18:42:12 <strcat[m]> the hardware enforcement (which is always enabled) makes it so that 1 attempt can be made per day
18:42:15 <strcat[m]> after it throttles up
18:42:18 <oj-j[m]> I understand now
18:42:37 <oj-j[m]> The strcat
18:42:45 <oj-j[m]> Thx
18:43:03 <strcat[m]> the hardware does not implement hardware support for the wipe after N attempts limit probably because it seems like a recipe for losing data
18:43:33 <strcat[m]> it could
18:43:47 <strcat[m]> it'd fit right into the existing Weaver feature
18:44:13 <strcat[m]> it could support an optional attempt limit configured after successful authentication, and just enforce that alongside the existing exponentially increasing throttling
18:44:21 <strcat[m]> just doesn't, so that's software only
18:44:54 <mx[m]> <dazinism "mx: look at https://hub.libranet"> Thanks. I will switch soon to GrapheneOS
18:46:25 <dazinism> oj-diehard: maybe have a read of https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/GrapheneOS-Security-Q%26A.md
18:48:44 <oj-j[m]> Thank you dazinism
18:51:58 <dazinism> fourstepper: maybe this will work for you? https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360042339754-Guide-to-email-notifications

19:02:42 <Gibbeh> Hello.
19:04:34 <dazinism> Hello Gibbeh
20:25:59 <redibc[m]> I ordered a pixel 3 today
20:26:09 <redibc[m]> Now I am going to change to graphene when it gets here
20:26:47 <redibc[m]> I hope I can do it I've never done anything like this
20:33:33 <fragaria[m]> is it possible in the (pixel 3/ grapheneOS) the insertion of the lock-screen password via an external keyboard  and via an usb hid emulator through the usb-c ?
20:36:17 <LinusSexTips[m]> redibc: It's not a terribly complicated process, people here can help you
20:37:32 <redibc[m]> Okay
20:39:02 <redibc[m]> Do you guys ever use sip and voip with your phones?
20:52:21 <M473857a[m]> I'm having trouble getting autofill to work. I'm using Keepass2Android, is autofill working for any of you, and what did you change to make it work?
21:06:06 <doobry[m]> wow, super excited to see experimental support for the pixel 4a being added in yesterday's release. thanks so much for working on it ‚ù§Ô∏è
21:09:55 <randombloke[m]> <doobry[m] "wow, super excited to see experi"> me too. i'm toying with buying one, despite the build note that states "Pixel 4a support is still experimental and does not yet have a hardened Linux kernel."
21:11:49 <dazinism> üçìüçìüçì: I suspect it will work if you change your usb settings to allow new usb peripherals when locked.
21:12:57 <dazinism> 473857a: I think autofill still doesnt work with chromium/vanadium. I use the magikeyboard and keepassDX because of this.
21:15:30 <fragaria[m]> [dazinism](https://matrix.to/#/@DzzzzzzR:matrix.org): got it
21:35:37 <LinusSexTips[m]> <M473857a[m] "I'm having trouble getting autof"> As someone else said, KeepassDX has a keyboard to fill passwords so you don't need auto fill
21:36:10 <tepigweir> New to IRC, testing that I am reaching real humans
21:36:36 <redibc[m]> Yea you are
21:36:59 <tepigweir> ok great the feed was blank for a while I guess I was catching up to the server
21:38:03 <tepigweir> I came in search of a solution to Android 11 mvno upstream issues on the Pixel 2xl. Apologies if this is a stale topic.
21:44:08 <M473857a[m]> <dazinism "473857a: I think autofill still "> That's too bad. Thanks for all answers though
22:17:10 <spathionema[m]> any updates on the 4a?
22:49:07 <Poglord[m]> strcat has the  beta been pushed ota yet brother
22:49:30 <Poglord[m]> Nevermind just  pinged
