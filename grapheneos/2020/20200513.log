01:01:46 <headgas[m]> Did anyone see my message?
01:02:37 <gervarouge[m]> Just ask again
01:04:58 <headgas[m]> Ok so im back on my pixel 4 xl since you guys said it was safer than my Nexus 5 running Ubuntu touch. I have Google deleted and everything I can think of to de-google as much as I can. I know I can't delete play services. But I have fdroid and replaced everything I can think of with apps from there. Anything else I can do until grapheneos or something is available for my phone?
01:08:02 <gervarouge[m]> You're probably good then
01:16:54 <aeonsolution[m]> have successfully built the tmp branch and and flashed my pixel 3a for development; what! what!
01:19:45 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: why the tmp branch
01:20:37 <strcat> that's just a temporary thing for making the stable releases
01:20:40 <strcat> not intended to be used
01:20:50 <strcat> I guess it does match the last stable release
01:20:59 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: tmp branch?
01:22:02 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: when i pulled the branch it was pointing at r36 and i noticed the tmp branch had r35
01:22:32 <aeonsolution[m]> from the xml file
01:22:37 <strcat> the 10 branch is the development branch
01:22:49 <strcat> the tmp branch in the manifest repository is just a temporary scratch space I use, not intended for use
01:22:57 <strcat> I use it to create the stable tags
01:23:09 <strcat> both were using r36
01:25:56 <aeonsolution[m]> thats good know, i was digging around trying to figure out why i was getting errors
01:26:00 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: either use the 10 branch or the stable tags from now on
01:26:06 <aeonsolution[m]> got it
01:26:08 <strcat[m]> 10 branch should work fine for you
01:26:57 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, the error ended up being something else that dan-v helped me with; will do that from now on. thanks for the guidance
01:28:07 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: you can init your sources to the 10 branch
01:28:09 <strcat> with repo init
01:28:12 <strcat> don't need to redownload it all
01:28:25 <strcat> init and sync
01:28:53 <aeonsolution[m]> got it; doing that now
01:29:10 <aeonsolution[m]> do i need to add the branch or just `repo init`
01:29:26 <aeonsolution[m]>  * do i need to add the branch or just `repo init` will do
01:30:01 <JTL> repo init should be enough
01:30:03 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: put the full repo init command
01:30:12 <JTL> should error out if there is any issues
01:30:12 <strcat> not just `repo init` by itself - do what the build documentation says
01:30:20 <aeonsolution[m]> got it
01:30:31 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch
01:30:36 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#updating-and-switching-branches-or-tags
01:38:34 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: since i was in the tmp branch, should I add the `--force-sync` option?
01:38:56 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: If you don't and it has an issue, it *should* error out
01:39:24 <aeonsolution[m]> perfect, thanks
01:39:37 <JTL> hold on I know an option here
01:39:55 <JTL> --fail-fast
01:40:15 <aeonsolution[m]> for repo sync thats valid?
01:40:20 <JTL> yes
01:40:31 <JTL> It'll abort the sync early if it errors out
01:40:41 <JTL> rather then waiting for other threads to complete (I assume)
01:40:42 <aeonsolution[m]> cool, the more you know
01:40:49 <JTL> You're welcome
01:41:04 <aeonsolution[m]> thank you
01:42:20 <aeonsolution[m]> JTL: can you help me with the understanding the builds table https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers#source-code-tags-and-builds
01:42:42 <JTL> Er In what context?
01:43:00 <aeonsolution[m]> Build 	Tag 	Version 	Supported devices 	Security patch level
01:43:00 <aeonsolution[m]> QQ2A.200501.001.B3 	android-10.0.0_r36 	Android10 	Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL 	2020-05-05
01:43:00 <aeonsolution[m]> QQ2A.200501.001.B2 	android-10.0.0_r35 	Android10 	Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL 	2020-05-05
01:43:19 <JTL> What about it?
01:43:20 <aeonsolution[m]> when i'm pulling the vendor files
01:44:21 <JTL> I usally just keep this link handy
01:44:23 <JTL> https://developers.google.com/android/images
01:44:30 <JTL> Becaues it lists the device and version by monthly patch level
01:44:42 <JTL> But it's really the same data if you look closely
01:45:21 <aeonsolution[m]> let me check it out, i just get confused because r36 points to pixel 2 and pixel 2xl
01:48:14 <strcat> just use the 10 branch
01:48:19 <strcat> it works for all the supported devices
01:48:34 <strcat> we use android-10.0.0_r36 for all devices - not just the Pixel 2 and 2 XL
01:48:40 <strcat> we use a unified source tree
01:48:47 <JTL> Good to know
01:48:54 <strcat> the only difference is that for some devices you need to use a different BUILD_ID for the factory images
01:49:11 <strcat> and for tags, we include the appropriate upstream BUILD_ID, regardless of the tag we're using
01:49:18 <strcat> so that people can get the factory images
01:49:34 <strcat> our version is STOCK_BUILD_ID.OUR_BUILD_NUMBER
01:49:55 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: you're making things way more complicated than they need to be
01:50:01 <aeonsolution[m]> ok that makes sense, i was mixing up the two things
01:50:05 <strcat> you're overthinking it and that's what made it take so long
01:50:15 <aeonsolution[m]> you're right
01:51:18 <Guest693> hello guys
01:52:49 <Guest693> can somone help me with this: I Enabling OEM unlocking, Unlocked the bootloader. What and how do i go form there?
01:54:14 <aeonsolution[m]> Guest693: https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-factory-images
01:55:37 <aeonsolution[m]> If you have a specific question on this part, please add it the chat and we'll try to help as best as we can.
01:55:46 <Guest693> Hey, yes i read this of course but couldn't manage it. Can somone send me a private message and walp me through it?
01:56:43 <Guest693> sure, so i need to be still in the "Fastboot Mode" right?
01:57:15 <aeonsolution[m]> For these steps, don't worry about putting the questions on here. There maybe someone else with that same problem.
01:57:53 <strcat> Guest693: first download the appropriate factory images
01:58:05 <strcat> and if you have signify available via your distribution, verify them
01:58:16 <Guest693> i did, they are on my computer
01:58:31 <Guest693> called "sargo-factory-2020.05.05.02"
01:58:41 <Guest693> correct?
01:59:11 <Guest693> its a zip file
01:59:25 <strcat> if you have a Pixel 3a
01:59:29 <Guest693> yes
01:59:44 <strcat> so move along to https://grapheneos.org/install#flashing-factory-images
02:00:05 <strcat> it suggests using curl to download it so that it doesn't need to tell you to `cd` to the directory you downloaded it
02:00:35 <Guest693> is the "bootloader " the same as the "Fastboot Mode"?
02:01:01 <strcat> yes
02:01:16 <strcat> the terms they use are not entirely accurate
02:01:22 <strcat> the 'bootloader mode' is really 'fastboot mode'
02:01:35 <Guest693> okey and the "sargo-factory-2020.05.05.02" is a zip file so i just unzip it right?
02:01:47 <strcat> yes you unzip that
02:02:01 <Guest693> okey and then i cd that path right
02:02:06 <strcat> you're going to need to be in a terminal to set up PATH and run ./flash-all.bat
02:02:13 <strcat> and you need to have up-to-date fastboot in your PATH from earlier
02:02:31 <strcat> the reason the instructions stick to doing everything in the terminal is so you can simply copy-paste the commands as you go
02:02:37 <strcat> and you don't need to do anything not listed there
02:02:47 <strcat> if you download it in a browser and unzip, you'll need to cd to where you did that
02:02:51 <strcat> then set up fastboot as it said earlier
02:02:59 <strcat> there's a reason behind why the instructions are given how they are
02:03:22 <strcat> I guess I do need to update the flashing section for Windows by saying to use `tar xf` instead of `unzip`
02:04:17 <aeonsolution[m]> Guest693: what OS are you using?
02:05:02 <strcat> can tell it's Windows because it defaults to hiding file extensions
02:07:07 <MadCamel> might confuse the users, couldn't do that now could we
02:07:30 <aeonsolution[m]> trial by fire
02:07:38 <Guest693> well i think it worked, just said something like "File system type raw not supported." not bad is it?
02:07:50 <strcat> Guest693: make sure to lock the bootloader after it finishes
02:08:03 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install#locking-the-bootloader
02:08:07 <Guest693> yeah i read
02:08:33 <aeonsolution[m]> you'd be surprised how many people skip this part
02:09:15 <Guest693> yeah really hard to miss. I read it a few times
02:09:18 <Guest693> :)#
02:09:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I've seen our obesity rate, nothing surprises me anymore.
02:09:39 <Guest693> its locked so now i just boot for the first time?
02:09:58 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
02:10:32 <aeonsolution[m]> you'll get an information message about the os being different then it'll boot to GrapheneOS
02:10:53 <Guest693> cool very nice, thanks a lot for your help
02:10:59 <strcat> I've been working on making the instructions cover absolutely everything and to have them fully support macOS and Windows in addition to Linux
02:11:12 <strcat> it would be simpler if Linux distributions used bsdtar instead of GNU tar
02:11:34 <strcat> it's annoying trying to write instructions that work on 3 OSes as 1 document
02:11:42 <strcat> I guess I could split it into 3 documents that are kept in sync
02:11:50 <Guest693> so just for feedback. What was the largest challenge for me is that i couldn t unlock the bootloader for some reason it didn t take the command "fastboot flashing lock"
02:12:17 <strcat> Guest693: the command failed? or fastboot wasn't in PATH
02:12:26 <aeonsolution[m]> It would be easier to follow but i think harder to maintain because you'd might want to check with the other OS instructions
02:12:46 <strcat> yes it's just kinda annoying to follow when it splits into different paths per OS
02:12:49 <aeonsolution[m]> windows makes it hard to setup environment variables
02:13:00 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: I wouldn't really say that
02:13:04 <strcat> I actually think it's better on Windows
02:13:05 <Guest693> i did some research for a couble of hours then it turned out to be some windows drivers
02:13:10 <Guest693> i found them there: https://usbdriverspie.com/google-pixel-3a/
02:13:12 <strcat> they have a nice GUI for persistently configuring environment variables
02:13:30 <gervarouge[m]> Honestly should people even use GrapheneOS if they can't figure out how to install it?
02:13:49 <strcat> AFAIK Windows is supposed to auto install the drivers
02:14:01 <strcat> I could give instructions on obtaining the proper first party drivers
02:14:22 <aeonsolution[m]> finding it and knowing how to set it up correctly is kind of confusing, the syntax is hard for beginners on windows since they dont work with command line tools all that much
02:14:43 <aeonsolution[m]> thats the angle im coming at it
02:14:59 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: there's a GUI for setting env variables persistently but the way these instructions work they have you download a temporary platform-tools
02:15:11 <strcat> it doesn't have you install it or put it somewhere sensible and it's not going to update itself
02:15:21 <strcat> since it's a specific release without the usual SDK package manager
02:15:34 <strcat> proper instructions on setting up a self-updating SDK including platform-tools are in the build guide
02:15:39 <strcat> but it'd be overcomplicated here
02:16:08 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: on Windows people could just install Android Studio - that may put fastboot in PATH for you - don't know
02:16:13 <strcat> if it doesn't they could do it with the GUI
02:16:26 <strcat> but ultimately they do need to open up a terminal to run fastboot flashing unlock and then fastboot flashing lock after flashing
02:16:38 <strcat> it's easiest to just open up a terminal and copy paste the commands there one by one
02:16:51 <strcat> I've set it up so that the commands can just be copy-pasted one by one with 0 manual intervention / changes
02:17:09 <strcat> that's why I have people use curl and tar xf to extract
02:17:47 <strcat> because if they do it via their browser I'd need to explain how to open a terminal and go to that directory and I don't know where they dl'ed it
02:18:01 <strcat> and also I have people verify the hash of platform-tools
02:19:20 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: there could be a GUI program wrapping the entire thing but it'd throw away the trust chaining this does when the distro has signify available
02:19:23 <strcat> and proper packages
02:19:27 <Guest693> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/8ceafe9aa81f1af57d469f4992877b80/image.png
02:19:29 <Guest693> well for me the windows USB C drivers where the largest problem
02:19:55 <strcat> Guest693: you got them from some weird third party site though? that's odd
02:20:01 <Guest693> when i downloaded them and put them in the devicemanager like on the screenshot then everything worked :)
02:20:18 <strcat> afaik it's supposed to auto-detect a device was connected and dl the driver from MS
02:20:23 <strcat> are you on Windows 10?
02:21:09 <Guest693> yes MS 10 with a usb c port but the universal driver just let s you do a file transfer
02:21:55 <strcat> maybe https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb is what people need
02:22:04 <strcat> but I thought it'd dl automatically once the device is in fastboot mode
02:22:26 <Guest693> also when the phone was booted the fastboot tool could see it. But not when it was in "Fastboot Mode".
02:23:17 <Guest693> Does that make sense? For that i needed the drivers which are now shown in the device manager called "Android Bootloader interface"
02:24:43 <aeonsolution[m]> I think it does, I didn't download anything else to get it to flash the device on Windows
02:25:09 <aeonsolution[m]>  * I think it does, I didn't download anything to get it to flash the device on Windows
02:25:47 <strcat> yeah I don't think installing any driver should be required especially not a third party one
02:26:07 <strcat> it does need to be installed but it's supposed to auto-detect and pull it via windows update automatically
02:26:22 <Guest693> i understand
02:26:28 <strcat> definitely not supposed to need to install any third party version
02:26:40 <strcat> I can't easily test this
02:26:56 <strcat> for the Linux install and build instructions I can spin up a new container and test that it works without any extra dependencies
02:27:06 <strcat> but I can't do that for Windows
02:28:26 <bseeinu[m]> Just boot a Linux live OS friends
02:28:40 <bseeinu[m]> I gave up on dealing with Windows
02:28:57 <aeonsolution[m]> i have a spare windows laptop im going to reformat soon, i can test and let you know later
02:28:57 <bseeinu[m]> And all the WSL and etc
02:30:28 <BalooRJ> GrapheneOS was the reason I installed Linux in the first place
02:30:36 <BalooRJ> since then I've ditched Windows and just use Debian
02:30:53 <strcat> and I can't test macOS at all
02:31:20 <BalooRJ> even when I was dual booting, Windows 10 wouldn't even allow file transfer on my GrapheneOS flashed phone
02:31:29 <BalooRJ> it recognized the device was plugged in...and that's about it
02:55:24 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Hello
02:55:46 <aeonsolution[m]> Welcome!
03:18:22 <madaidan[m]> Hi
03:41:38 <minimisk> Since installing GrapheneOS on my Pixel 2 XL a week ago, I am not receiving any notifications through SMS nor through Signal, even with battery optimizations disabled and with Signal's background connection enabled. Does anyone know what might be the problem?
03:49:25 <aeonsolution[m]> Did you setup your network? Signal should still work with other users using Signal over WiFi.
03:50:24 <nickcalyx[m]> What happens if you try sending a signal msg
03:56:44 <minimisk> Please let me know if I'm missing the point, but I can send and receive messages properly, I simply do not receive notifications.
03:57:09 <minimisk> I know that without Play Services notifications are expected to be delayed, but I'm not getting any at all.
04:01:44 <aeonsolution[m]> I would say try checking out if its something with the app: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues
04:02:04 <aeonsolution[m]> Which Pixel are you using?
04:03:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> aeonsolution they said Pixel 2 XL above
04:04:48 <aeonsolution[m]> My bad, missed it by accident. Thanks for letting me know.
04:06:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I searched the Signal Issues for kicks, didn't see anything device specific
04:06:28 <minimisk> I have done this. However, this seems to be happening with all apps (Signal, QKSMS). What's more, in certain apps like Orgzly (an Emacs org-mode client), persistent notifications do not appear.
04:07:18 <aeonsolution[m]> Yeah same here, there was a label for no-play-services Danny@WorkOrderPro but it's still an open issue
04:07:39 <minimisk> For example, in Orgzly there's an option to enable a persistent notification to make a quick note. This worked with stock Android, but no notification appears when the setting is toggled.
04:07:58 <minimisk> However, the app's other notifications still work
04:08:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> minimisk: have you opened the APN settings screen? Ensure your bubble radio button is filled for your carrier?
04:15:12 <minimisk> Yes it is
04:17:00 <jawsua[m]> minimisk Your problem is notifications not showing, correct? Not network or SMS issues?
04:17:37 <minimisk> Correct, only notifications are not showing. Everything else is working great
04:37:59 <minimisk> Sleep is important, but I'll be checking this thread in the morning. Thanks for your help

05:21:48 <aeonsolution[m]> Hey dan-v are you in the chat?
06:10:33 <strcat[m]> would be useful if someone could figure out the build targets to build SDK repository packages
06:11:02 <strcat[m]> so the platform-tools-30.0.0 tag, etc. are how they publish those releases via AOSP
06:11:13 <strcat[m]> and I know how to build adb, fastboot, etc. by themselves of course
06:11:21 <strcat[m]> (`m adb fastboot` and so on)
06:11:33 <strcat[m]> but dunno the build target for the platform-tools package

08:40:17 <strcat> renlord[m]: for hosts with DANE, MTA-STS isn't really any use right now - although it would be useful if it was used to enforce that the certificates had SCTs

08:45:36 <gervarouge[m]> I have a 3a I'm hanging onto right now. Don't have a lot of spare cash due to corona
08:45:55 <gervarouge[m]> I guess 2 3as will be the way to go
08:47:03 <gervarouge[m]> * Pixel 4a would be expensive for a second device no?
08:47:11 <cx2[m]> Given that its going to be supported for the next two years, at least by google, I would thumbs up that decision for sure.
08:48:55 <gervarouge[m]> Yeah Pixel 3 is a lot cheaper since you can get a screen burned in one on eBay in decent shape for under $100
08:49:01 <gervarouge[m]> I am on the fence
08:50:14 <strcat> valldrac: btw I forgot to actually merge your VPN lockdown patches into the production branch... it's fixed now for the next release
08:50:16 <strcat> sorry about that
08:50:21 <strcat> not sure how that got lost
08:51:27 * TheJollyRoger wonders if he should donate one of those multicharging blocks that allow a whole pile of phones to be charged all at once to the project...
08:53:00 <gervarouge[m]> I think I'll go Pixel 3 it's a lot more affordable. Pixel 3as are too expensive unless they are totally smashed up which I don't trust much. Thanks for the input
08:53:03 <cx2[m]> Also a good choice, condition notwithstanding. I'd look at swappa.com if you haven't already.
08:53:35 <cx2[m]> And support is officially not much shorter
08:54:22 <gervarouge[m]> Thanks
08:54:54 <BallMonokuma[m]> <gervarouge[m] "I think I'll go Pixel 3 it's a l"> aren't "3 A"s cheaper?
08:55:10 <strcat> gervarouge[m]: Pixel 3a is the cheap one
08:55:14 <strcat> Pixel 3 is higher end
08:55:15 <gervarouge[m]> The other option is I could switch to an iPhone due to the affordable used market here and turn my Pixel into a dev device. I dunno if I want to upgrade my phone yet though
08:55:23 <strcat> if you can get a Pixel 3 for cheaper than a Pixel 3a then yeah get a Pixel 3
08:55:26 <strcat> but I think you're mixing them up
08:55:49 <gervarouge[m]> I see Pixel 3 with pink screen burn in for $90 and Pixel 3a with cracked screen for $120
08:56:23 <gervarouge[m]> Either is fine for a Dev device I guess
08:56:25 <gervarouge[m]> Both unlocked
08:57:14 <gervarouge[m]> I should make sure my GrapheneOS build works on my daily driver first
09:07:27 <valldrac> strcat: np
09:07:41 <strcat> valldrac: really not sure how it got dropped, need to check that other patches weren't dropped :\
09:08:06 <strcat> I think I just never pulled it after merging on github
09:08:12 <strcat> and then when rebasing onto the next security patch it was lost?
09:08:18 <strcat> something like that
09:08:49 <strcat> I have a tree for testing and then the actual reference tree
09:08:56 <strcat> make mistakes sometimes :(
09:10:56 <valldrac> happen even in the best families :P
09:11:46 <valldrac> today I'll take a look at the camera crashes in Pixel 3. It seg faults in the vendor libraries... so I'm going to attach a debugger and see what's going on
09:13:40 <gervarouge[m]> If I understand correctly the best way to help GrapheneOS(beside coding) is to run beta and report any bugs. Does submitting an auditor sample help at all on a supported device?
09:17:35 <strcat> valldrac: if my workaround in hardened_malloc is disabled it won't start at all
09:23:06 <valldrac> strcat: even with the workaround, it crashes when switching the front and rear cameras
09:25:23 <strcat> valldrac: yeah because it has multiple bugs or it's the same bug manifesting in diff ways
09:25:30 <strcat> I just reduced how often it catches the bugs
09:25:36 <valldrac> true, there maybe more than one bug in play here
09:25:57 <strcat> valldrac: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/commit/e4619af0bb8fc38d19bfa0be86e0b733e756db97
09:26:06 <strcat> the way I worked around it doesn't guarantee it avoids finding the bugs
09:26:16 <strcat> I just disabled some of the sec features for it
09:26:24 <strcat> it sucks having to do this
09:28:24 <gervarouge[m]> I apologise for the dumb question, but how serious are camera vulnerabilities?
09:30:12 <gervarouge[m]> I have seen several mentioned in Google blogs and such
09:37:54 <valldrac> gervarouge[m]: I guess in the worst case scenario an App with access to the camera can elevate privileges locally
09:38:34 <valldrac> I don't know if any of the current camera bugs have security implications, we'll see
09:38:52 <strcat> valldrac: they tend to be use-after-free bugs and are a pain to debug
09:38:59 <strcat> especially with how hardened_malloc finds them
09:39:03 <strcat> although some of that is disabled atm
09:39:08 <strcat> you may want to build it without any features disabled
09:39:16 <strcat> just revert that commit in the 10 branch
09:39:55 <valldrac> gervarouge[m]: anyway, better strcat that to answer that. I'm new to aosp
09:40:40 <valldrac> strcat: yup that was my idea
09:41:57 <strcat[m]> valldrac:  afaik all this code in vendor has symbols
09:41:59 <strcat[m]> but not all is open source
09:42:17 <strcat[m]> and of the code that is open source, we aren't building most from source even though we could be
09:42:19 <strcat[m]> just due to lack of time investment in it
09:42:33 <strcat[m]> valldrac: so you can debug it because it has symbols
09:42:38 <strcat[m]> and you can see all the function names etc
09:42:55 <valldrac> strcat: for use-after-free bugs, is it supposed to crash before returning from the 2nd free() call?
09:43:00 <strcat[m]> but there aren't necessarily sources that we can build - it'd be hard to fix the bugs in some cases
09:43:31 <strcat[m]> valldrac: that would be a double-free - a double-free is detected reliably as a double-free
09:43:49 <strcat[m]> although it's possible that the extra free gets delayed past the point that it has been allocated again
09:44:00 <strcat[m]> but that's not usually what happens
09:44:07 <strcat[m]> valldrac: use-after-free is when it keeps being used after being freed
09:44:13 <strcat[m]> that's what tends to be happening with these bugs
09:44:17 <strcat[m]> most common issue we encounter
09:44:31 <strcat[m]> valldrac: so it's found in multiple ways
09:44:31 <valldrac> true, sorry. I was thinking on that kind of bugs
09:44:46 <strcat[m]> valldrac: zero-on-free, write-after-free check on alloc, and various other features
09:44:50 <strcat[m]> valldrac: virtual memory quarantine
09:44:55 <gervarouge[m]> <valldrac "gervarouge: I guess in the worst"> Thanks. Yet another reason to not allow camera permissions
09:45:02 <strcat[m]> the fact that the allocator actually releases memory
09:47:40 <valldrac> the main issue to me is those proprietary libraries without source code. Bugs are everywhere, but if we cannot fix them and just place workarounds... bad
09:47:51 <strcat> valldrac: well we could fix it but it's painful
09:48:00 <strcat> luckily there are not closed source kernel drivers
09:48:25 <strcat> but there are these closed source libraries - although the issue is mostly that we are using prebuilt vendor code instead of building it from source due to lack of time investment
09:48:37 <strcat> valldrac: it's painful to fix it in the existing assembly code if it's complicated
09:49:23 <valldrac> strcat: lovely, binary patching xD
09:51:37 <valldrac> strcat: btw building the primary hw audio library from source is in my TODO list
09:53:34 <gervarouge[m]> What's the advantage of building from source?
09:53:47 <strcat> being able to harden and change the code
09:54:26 <strcat> can't realistically do that without building it all
09:54:34 <strcat> so we need to work towards building all the vendor image
09:54:39 <strcat> like we do with the rest
09:56:36 <gervarouge[m]> Then everything would be hardened or HAL sandboxed on Graphene
10:02:02 <renlord> isnt the hal already kinda sandboxed since its managed by system server?
10:02:20 <renlord> and i assume system server inherits the native android sandboxing
10:02:31 <strcat> renlord: the HALs are sandboxed, they don't run in system_server since Treble
10:02:32 <renlord> unless the idea is to further modularise system server?
10:02:44 <renlord> ok
10:02:54 <strcat> but they are still relevant to security
10:14:54 <dazinism> gervarouge: last camera vuln I saw was a malicious app
10:15:56 <dazinism> Which IIRC sent an intent to Gcam
10:17:36 <dazinism> Gcam would happily take a photo. The malicious app needed storage permission to grab the photos
10:18:40 <dazinism> Google patched Gcam, I guess to stop it acting on that intent
11:14:28 <renlord> there's also another pending issue
11:14:37 <renlord> cfi issue
11:14:51 <renlord> but strcat added a workaround
11:15:04 <renlord> vanadium video issue
11:15:52 <renlord> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/175
11:16:48 <renlord> turning on cfi diagnostics didnt help much
12:07:50 <limitless0[m]> Therr are some statements on R/Privacy about hoe its safer yo download apps rather than use in browser if its possible, is this true is using an app safer than the browser version of it?
12:08:00 <limitless0[m]> Herr are the comments

12:34:58 <dazinism> limitless0: there are many things that need considering - app for what how much do you trust the service provider. What permissions do you give to the app.
12:35:16 <dazinism> What browser and how is it set up.
12:36:00 <dazinism> What do you consider safer (what are you worried about)
12:39:45 <dazinism> As far as running the code that the service provider intends. The genuine app from Play has to give best guarantee.
12:41:09 <dazinism> Also with an app they can give a pretty high guarantee that you are connecting to the service you intend, rather than a malicious fake.
12:43:52 <dazinism> But I'd look to many other ways of using Facebook,  before I ever install their app. As they've repeatedly abused user trust / data.
13:09:58 <MadCamel> better to poison the well. Give their app access to a contact list containing all 1 billion US phone numbers ;)
13:14:05 <renlord> limitless0[m]: why do you even use a screenshot?
13:14:12 <renlord> was it not possible to share a link?
13:14:43 <renlord> our eyeballs have to work doubly hard to read the text
14:04:52 <bseeinu[m]> <valldrac "strcat: even with the workaround"> I just live with it, though it's pretty comedic when I try to take a mundane pic and everyone around patiently waits between the crashes :D
14:12:30 <organella[m]> Re contact lists, I'd love a sub-contact-list feature where you can pick a few contacts only and show that to untrusted apps like whatsapp instead of all or nothing
14:13:00 <organella[m]> Would even be interested in implementing it, just that I don't know the first thing about Android programming
14:19:51 <organella[m]> But if someone is interested in doing the overall setup, I'm happy to do the actual coding and testing, writing Java is not a problem
15:38:38 <nickcalyx[m]> https://twitter.com/cBekrar/status/1260543284008456192?s=19
15:40:58 <nickcalyx[m]> Hiya
15:43:30 <xabierd[m]> Hello!
15:43:30 <xabierd[m]> I just got myself a cheap pixel 3, will be installing it as soon as it gets home
15:44:00 <dazinism> xabierd: nice
15:44:41 <xabierd[m]> One step further, leaving microg behind.
15:51:19 <dazinism> organella: the best way to isolate apps, that require permissions to to function, from sucking up all your data is to use profiles.
16:01:27 <organella[m]> profiles are a good way and i use them, but for some things like messengers i find it more hassle than it's worth, and some extra permission features would add both extra privacy and convenience
16:02:09 <organella[m]> another feature i'd love to add is to have network permission off by default and apps have to ask to get it
16:03:20 <xabierd[m]> Can messengers run in a non active profile and access them via web?
16:06:33 <organella[m]> I don't know but it's certainly less convenient than going to Contacts, selecting 'new list', adding the 10 people I expect to chat with initially, and feed that to the app
16:16:43 <dazinism> <organella[m] "another feature i'd love to add "> The way permissions work I think the app would have to be written in a way to call for this permission. As network permission is normally always on, no apps support this.
16:17:15 <dazinism> organella: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
16:18:16 <dazinism> The ideal would be able to have user profiles sharing the same UI like work and personal profiles do with shelter.
16:20:50 <MadCamel> only slightly related but a good way to manage/backup contacts is etesync. client-side encryption before the data is sent out. can run your own sync server for free or pay to use the authors.
16:21:01 <dazinism> Being able to have more than two profiles on the same UI would be amazing.
16:21:56 <dazinism> Theres someone working on multiple user profiles for their GSI of lineageOS
16:22:17 <dazinism> Also was some custom profiles thing back on the Blackphone
16:23:57 <dazinism> The folks who developed that also released their own custom OS that offered multi profiles, which I think shared some UI stuff, although I never tried it...
16:24:48 <limitless0[m]> <dazinism "What do you consider safer (what"> Just in general apps that you can usr in browser aswell,lets take twitter for example
16:26:05 <limitless0[m]> <renlord "our eyeballs have to work doubly"> Sorry ,im used to screenshots
16:27:46 <organella[m]> Thanks for the link. Indeed it would be great to have multiple profiles on the same UI, maybe with the possibility for a bit better isolation so the clipboard doesn't leak for example and is maybe Qubes-style instead
16:28:47 <organella[m]> Multiple profiles will also allow multiple app installation without depending on an extra app, which would be nice
16:29:53 <organella[m]> As I said I'd be happy to contribute to Graphene, but can only do so as a 'junior' programmer with someone else taking the lead, even if they don't do much/any of the coding
16:32:55 <nickcalyx[m]> > The folks who developed that also released their own custom OS that offered multi profiles, which I think shared some UI stuff, although I never tried it...
16:32:55 <nickcalyx[m]> Weren't they Czech or Romanian or something
16:35:13 <dazinism> https://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/development/secure-spaces-android-rom-t3251299
16:35:56 <dazinism> Their site is down but the © holder at the bottom leads to
16:36:12 <dazinism> https://cismobile.com/
16:37:38 <dazinism> Looks like they branded it as altOS
16:39:07 <dazinism> Sorry meant someones working on support for multiple work profiles on their LineageOS GSI builds
16:40:59 <cdesai> https://cismobile.com/solutions/ - they have this thing where you can switch between "containers"/users/profiles? using a fingerprint
16:48:34 <dazinism> Mainly looking like a bit of shine ontop of user profiles and MDM
16:49:25 <dazinism> https://f-droid.org/app/org.flyve.mdm.agent.mqtt
16:51:16 <dazinism> Moving to a different user profile by presenting a different finger to the scanner is nice shine, if thats what it does
16:53:45 <dazinism> organella: thinking that working on user profiles rather than permissions may be less likely to get broken between android updates.
16:55:23 <dazinism> They've been changing how  permissions work with each new version. To try to satisfy demands for privacy.
16:56:17 <dazinism> While I imagine that the way user profiles are implemented will remain fairly stable.
16:58:18 <dazinism> By comparison.
16:58:42 <mxnorvak[m]> With LOS i tried to take a screenshot while i wasn't in my owner profile and i noticed the pic gets saved to the owner profiles storage,does that happen with Graphene?
17:18:40 <dazinism> mxnorvak: screenshots stay in the user profile where they were taken.
17:20:25 <dazinism> Except when I take in a work profile app, they end up on main profile storage>pictures>screenshots
17:26:53 <dazinism> limitless0: with Twitter, if you are worried about someone taking control of your account or reading your DMs, I think youd be safer with their app than a browser.
17:28:35 <dazinism> If you are worried about twitter collecting data on you - probably best with a 3rd party client, or a webview based browser just for twitter.
17:28:52 <limitless0[m]> <dazinism "limitless0: with Twitter, if you"> Im not worried of anything specific.just general privacy.just had the idea that web apps are safer than apps
17:29:10 <limitless0[m]> Yea thats what i was gonna say now you typed it beforee
17:29:40 <gervarouge[m]> Webapps are always safer
17:30:00 <limitless0[m]> Thats what i thought aswell
17:30:22 <gervarouge[m]> Keep in mind apps see your real ip
17:31:33 <gervarouge[m]> Apps have a lot of privacy implications, but Android and Graphene have been making a lot of progress there
17:32:06 <gervarouge[m]> I always use Vanadium or sometimes Bromite for apps when I can
17:32:22 <gervarouge[m]> The security of your device is much stronger since they generally need to break through your browser and then attack your OS
17:33:05 <limitless0[m]> The conversation started cos on r/privacy someone said that apps are safer than webapps
17:33:37 <gervarouge[m]> Of course IPC/XSS means tabs and apps can attack each other so they are likely pretty close in that way. Use a separate profile or browser to kill that though
17:33:56 <limitless0[m]> And they go on detail about it so i askef here since i trust this community
17:34:29 <limitless0[m]> I use twidere for twitter and whenever i can webapps
17:34:41 <gervarouge[m]>  /r/privacy is terrible
17:35:08 <gervarouge[m]>  /r/privacytoolsio is meh. /r/netsec is awesome
17:36:03 <limitless0[m]> <gervarouge[m] " /r/privacytoolsio is meh. /r/ne"> Netsec is out of my basic knowledge
17:37:14 <gervarouge[m]> One cool thing I see recommended here. If you want to learn something you can search. https://www.redditcommentsearch.com/ Topic DanielMicay
17:37:59 <limitless0[m]> <gervarouge[m] "One cool thing I see recommended"> Lol, Already have and saved as pdf
17:38:59 <gervarouge[m]> Good good
17:39:14 <gervarouge[m]> Other guys I trust are thegrugq and madaidan
17:39:17 <gervarouge[m]> I follow them a bit
17:39:52 <limitless0[m]> Who is madaidan?
17:41:21 <gervarouge[m]> Whonix security guy
17:41:49 <gervarouge[m]> Zdziarski was a guy I followed closely, but he went quiet after Apple hired him
17:42:10 <limitless0[m]> Me too on zdiarski
17:42:24 <limitless0[m]> He' very good on ios security
17:42:46 <limitless0[m]> Its said all the latest changes on ios on privacy its cos of him
17:43:12 <limitless0[m]> Since they hired him all this privacy on ios have been upscaled
17:43:12 <gervarouge[m]> Tim Cook completely changed my view of Apple. Decisions like hiring this guy are huge
17:43:21 <gervarouge[m]> Steve Jobs just wasn't it for me
17:43:55 <gervarouge[m]> iOS privacy features have been pretty epic since iOS 8
17:44:28 <gervarouge[m]> Relatively*
17:44:32 <limitless0[m]> Zdiarski was talking of disabling the charging port after period of time before he joined apple and then it was introduced when he joined them
17:45:26 <limitless0[m]> He had a blog site on how to lockdown iphone with apple configurator
17:47:21 <mxnorvak[m]> <dazinism "mxnorvak: screenshots stay in th"> Tnx
17:47:35 <gervarouge[m]> Google should hire Daniel Micay then they'll get them back
17:50:28 <limitless0[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Google should hire Daniel Micay "> Im surprised they havent, android would wipe the floor with ios if they did
17:58:48 <dazinism> <gervarouge[m] "Webapps are always safer "> Not sure. An app can just use an API, no need to have the huge functionality of a browser exposed to the web.
17:59:21 <cam_> limitless0[m]: it would def improve android security, but with their main business being surveillance, i doubt they will. it would be like a weapons company hiring a pacifist to work on bombs
17:59:49 <dazinism> Also have certs hardcoded
18:00:43 <dazinism> Daniel was offered a job at Google after he split from Copperhead
18:01:08 <dazinism> Decided not to take it.
18:01:41 <cam_> dazinism: did he say why?
18:02:46 <dazinism> Mmm... if I'm not getting confused, recently mentioned that he did go for an interview, but didnt like the culture he saw
18:04:02 <cam_> dazinism: given his work, i'd think he'd be opposed to their business model
18:04:30 <cam_> dazinism: i'd think that alone would be an inherent dealbreaker
18:04:37 <limitless0[m]> If they hire him now they will have to accept hos conditions on why they hiring him
18:04:57 <limitless0[m]> He wont join google to make cups of tea for staff
18:07:00 <cam_> limitless0[m]: ofc. but him joining at all would seem like $starWarsHero going over to the dark side
18:08:15 <limitless0[m]> cam_: why would it? If they give him the  freedom he needs on his work
18:09:32 <cam_> limitless0[m]: it only would if his principles are what i assume them to be. but i don't know him so my assumptions could be totally wrong
18:09:39 <limitless0[m]> <cam_ "limitless0: ofc. but him joining"> If cellebrite tried to hire him then this would be true
18:10:47 <limitless0[m]> I dont know him either but from what i can make out is that his principles are in the right place
18:11:23 <cam_> in any case, i def appreciate his work
18:11:40 <dazinism> Guess the split was hectic time. I could see how the offer of a decent wage, set hours, potentially stable job with big company, compared to what Daniel was dealing with previously.
18:12:16 <dazinism> ....and also what he still has to deal with
18:12:22 <cam_> google def has the resources to make a lucrative offer
18:12:33 <dazinism> Could be attractive
18:12:48 <organella[m]> I concur on the Google culture, from at least their Zürich office. My impression was it was very boring and lacking style
18:14:34 <cam_> slightly OT, but what would someone with wide but shallow IT knowledge and basic programming skill need to learn to be able to contribute to grapheneos?
18:15:13 <organella[m]> Also I imagine Google don't want Android becoming too private, goes directly against their main revenue channel
18:15:25 <dazinism> cam_: I think so. If you wanted to code, think the easiest place to start would be the apps
18:16:11 <limitless0[m]> Anyone knows if Chromium on fdroid by same developer of Bromite is ok to use?
18:16:16 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os

19:58:15 <c3po[m]> Should we trust completely that our camera is not recording us if we deny the camera and microphone permission?, it always has the settings permission, do you know why?. Thanks!
19:58:19 <MadCamel> Not really ironic. There's lots of reasons to record a conversation to protect oneself from fraud.
20:04:42 <M1eyejack[m]> Excatly. Actual anything a individual say can be held up on Court. So recording a conversation can be beneficial evidence
20:05:10 <M1eyejack[m]> *In court
20:06:26 <M1eyejack[m]> I understand microphone can be insecure but on sure there's a work around
20:06:39 <M1eyejack[m]> Kill switch maybe
20:08:03 <TheJollyRoger-M> <c3po[m] "Should we trust completely that "> It's trustworthy. Breaking the permissions would require breaking the mandatory access controls enforced by the kernel. In short, breaking the camera permissions would require breaking Linux.
20:11:55 <c3po[m]> And why the settings permission always enabled?, couldn't it bypass some restrictions?
20:13:06 <TheJollyRoger> They're not allowed in background. When apps are first installed, they're actually installed in a "stopped" state, meaning they require user action to launch.
20:14:28 <TheJollyRoger> Permissions usually end up being granted by default because people generally expect their apps to do what they request them to. If you don't want that, you're free to simply switch off those permissions prior to launch. The app cannot launch itself after being installed, because until you deliberately go tap on it to and launch it, it's considered "stopped."
20:16:39 <cx2[m]> <M1eyejack[m] "*In court"> Fair.
20:17:43 <c3po[m]> I thought that maybe that setting enabled in camera permission permission could own the system, as it control all the settings.
20:17:52 <TheJollyRoger> No.
20:18:37 <c3po[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Permissions usually end up being"> Thanks a lot!

20:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> Android is not like a desktop operating system that relies a "perimeter" based security system, where root = god, and user = everything in one. Instead, Android is comprised of many different processes, all which are constrained to do only what they are specifically designed to do by mandatory access control policies.
20:21:13 <TheJollyRoger> It's quite an elegant design.
20:21:49 <c3po[m]> So, it could only be if our phone is compromised with malware and that permission enabled by the attacker and also launching the camera.
20:22:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
20:23:01 <TheJollyRoger> Well,
20:23:06 <TheJollyRoger> If YOU enable that permission.
20:23:17 <c3po[m]> And we avoid many attacks using GOS 👍
20:23:33 <TheJollyRoger> If you disable that permission, then it can't access the camera without being granted it again.
20:24:48 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS is designed to improve on the security of the AOSP by trying to mitigate exploits. This is sort of its raison d'etre.
20:25:11 <c3po[m]> Good to know, thx
20:25:55 <TheJollyRoger> TLDR: if you deny the application the ability to access the camera, it can't use the camera without breaking Linux or breaking the operating system. There are multiple layers of security in place to prevent this from happening.
20:26:40 <TheJollyRoger> Each app is individually sandboxed within its profile. Each profile is itself individually sandboxed.
20:28:49 <c3po[m]> That's great!
20:29:05 <TheJollyRoger> Apps cannot "give themselves" permission.
20:29:45 <gang718[m]> Guys, random question. I set up scheduled remote verification and I got an email "Devices failed to provide valid attestations within 36 hours". What does this mean exactly?
20:32:06 <c3po[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Apps cannot "give themselves" pe"> Installlng malware from some app maybe?
20:33:00 <mxnorvak[m]> I'm wondering, if the Linux kernel has many problems and so its mostly recommended in here that using a linux based OS is not secure at all, why is android using it for its kernel and why is lets say selinux or breaking the linux kernel of android counted as a tough thing to do?
20:33:35 <c3po[m]> Like when you hide the webcam in your pc...
20:34:21 <mxnorvak[m]> And another one, by linux not being secure ,why do so many ppl in here prefer   using it rather than other desktop OSes?
20:35:10 <TheJollyRoger> c3po[m]: Apps can't install other apps unless you give them special permission to. Even then, they can't change the permissions of those apps.
20:36:31 <MadCamel> mxnorvak[m]: Well, I think it's because Linux isn't secure-by-design, nor does it follow good development practices for secure software. But it's still a great OS that is free and easily customized. Many people prefer something they can tinker with/improve vs a black-box that isn't easily examined or modified.
20:36:35 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: Android uses it for its kernel but at this moment Google's hoping to move away from it and if so, this project will follow them away from it since a microkernel has been on the wishlist.
20:37:30 <TheJollyRoger> What he said -- and another thing that bears keeping in mind as well is largely, the discussion on that vein is in response to the security misconceptions people build up after spending too much time in reddit echo chambers.
20:37:42 <TheJollyRoger> *what MadCamel said
20:39:47 <mxnorvak[m]> <MadCamel "mxnorvak: Well, I think it's bec"> So would you say if a user knows the limitations and is knowledgeable enough, they're better of using a Linux distro?
20:39:52 <mxnorvak[m]> Off*
20:41:58 <mxnorvak[m]> I personally have wanted to switch from windows to linux but i changed my mind once i started reading what ppl had to say about it in here
20:43:23 <MadCamel> well.. that's tough to say
20:43:32 <c3po[m]> <TheJollyRoger "c3po: Apps can't install other a"> You gave some peace of mind, I appreciate it 👍
20:43:52 <MadCamel> in my personal opinion windows is more secure out of the box. But linux can be made more secure than windows if you know what you are doing.
20:44:15 <MadCamel> For example windows enables the iommu by default to help mitigate DMA attacks. Linux distros do not ship with these features enabled - you have to do it manually
20:44:54 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: Android uses it for it"> Aha, honestly I've been confused that ppl have turned down linux phones as a fail promise and then use that same linux kernel as the boss the app can't beat to do something shady
20:48:33 <BalooRJ> So what is considered a decently hardened Linux distro to use for better security
20:48:37 <TheJollyRoger> It's... it's a little weird. I think when people on those circles say "Linux Phones" they mean porting the desktop stack (perimeter based security model, etc) to a mobile device.
20:49:29 <mxnorvak[m]> <MadCamel "in my personal opinion windows i"> Does this require you to be very knowledgeable or can a normal guided user start to make these adjustments and not have to worry about further modifications and possibly breaking stuff?
20:49:35 <TheJollyRoger> Porting the desktop stack to a mobile device is... argh. I think that's a doomed exercise because the desktop security model is supposed to allow applications unlimited interoperability and to communicate with each other.
20:49:45 <TheJollyRoger> But that's the exact opposite of what we want to do for security.
20:49:54 <TheJollyRoger> c3po[m]: glad I could help!
20:51:52 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "It's... it's a little weird. I t"> So the linux kernel used in android is a different compared the ones used in linux desktop distros?
20:52:07 <MadCamel> mxnorvak[m]: You have to be somewhat a nerd :) But if you haven't tried linux yet I would suggest you do. It may not be extrodinarily secure but nothing is. It's good enough for casual/personal use.
20:53:10 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: if I recall right, the SoC used by the phones need a specific LTS version of the kernel, and then security fixes from upstream are backported to it.
20:53:36 <TheJollyRoger> (Long Term Support)
20:53:40 <TheJollyRoger> But otherwise it's still Linux underneath.
20:55:30 <TheJollyRoger> The rest of the software stack is different though. The libraries for Android is Bionic. On the desktop, usually you see glibc and (rarely) musl libc. The design of the stack is also going to be different because of this.
20:55:33 <MadCamel> mxnorvak[m]: we're all privacy/security nuts here so when we say something isn't secure we mean it has issues that make us uncomfortable. We don't mean that it's not generally considered mostly safe to use.
20:56:26 <TheJollyRoger> MadCamel: I love that quote.
20:56:50 <mxnorvak[m]> <MadCamel "mxnorvak: You have to be somewha"> Well tbh i too was convinced based on the over hyped linux community that linux is the future and everyone should switch and finally be in control and stuff, spending some time in here made me question that belief but i got confused as the users who used it were talking about it not being secure and a MacOS and windows being far better ,but yeah i like to try it
20:58:53 <TheJollyRoger> There's also some nuances to it: some distributions (not going to name-and-shame right off the bat, though!) have prioritized things like usabilitiy, feature-richness, and accessibility over security. Often there's not enough time to do review of code or the packages from their upstream providers. Some don't even ship those updates at all, and that's where certain distros indeed become
20:58:56 <TheJollyRoger> horrifying dumpster fires.
20:59:54 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: if I recall right, the"> that's nice to know, Does GrapheneOS also make any security adjustments or hardening to the kernel?
21:00:07 <TheJollyRoger> Again, I don't want to name-and-shame, but there have been instances in the past where meddling around with packages and settings, and especially code from upstream in the name of usability and convenience has resulted in Very Bad Things Happening
21:00:12 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: yes.
21:01:03 <TheJollyRoger> The sources for the hardened Bionic LibC and the kernel patches are in the Github, but unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly what they do, I'm not pro enough for that just yet :P.
21:02:51 <mxnorvak[m]> <MadCamel "mxnorvak: we're all privacy/secu"> Haha well it was kinda hard to tell for me , thanks for clearing that up
21:03:08 <hitchhooker[m]> how you folks sync images between profiles?
21:10:31 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "There's also some nuances to it:"> But can you name a few good ones?
21:12:13 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: currently, Fedora.
21:13:25 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The sources for the hardened Bio"> It's really nice to know the project does care about all aspects of a secure phone
21:14:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! Actual, meaningful security with clear, defined threat models are what the project strives for, much more than "Advanced Security Centers" or "Advanced Privacy Shield Settings" or theatrics, knobs, buttons and tunables.
21:15:35 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: currently, Fedora."> Thanks, is it a good ditro to start with as someone who hasn't had any experience with linux ?
21:15:41 <TheJollyRoger> VERY good.
21:15:55 <TheJollyRoger> What I love about Fedora...
21:16:52 <TheJollyRoger> First off, the defaults when it comes to security are usually set very conservatively while they still allow you to do more or less what you want and not interfere with what /we usually expect out of/ a desktop.
21:17:35 <TheJollyRoger> Stuff is up to date, and they don't futz around too much with stuff from upstream or try to hold out on old versions.
21:18:27 <TheJollyRoger> I would absolutely recommend it as a starter distribution:
21:18:42 <propertype> If only silverblue would be stable by now.
21:19:20 <TheJollyRoger> It's got an all-graphical installer that will warn you in *plain English* if it believes you're making a mistake. While it won't stop you from doing what you want, if you believe you know better, if it thinks you're making a mistake, it'll go "hey, stop, did you think of this?"
21:20:06 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yep! Actual, meaningful security"> Yeah ,this clear defined threat models with reasonable and realistic answers to em like some that can be found in FAQ is what makes it stand out for a normal user like me compared to others that want you to believe their product is the only thing you need for 100% security and privacy
21:21:07 <TheJollyRoger> Once you get the operating installed, many of the administration tools for it, are in fact, graphical! Obtaining software updates, changing basic settings, all of that can usually be done on Fedora via point-and-click UIs, rather than having to delve into .config files in a text editor or through the console.
21:21:36 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: yarr! :)
21:23:26 <TheJollyRoger> Last but certainly not least I've found Fedora's hardware support to be very good, even on things like laptops.
21:24:02 <TheJollyRoger> So if you need wifi, usually Fedora packs everything you need to get started.
21:25:26 <blacktwig[m]> So, somewhat in the same vein, when y'all say that Firefox is insecure, should that also be understood in the context of a reaction to Reddit echo chambers, or should its alleged vulnerabilities really make it unusable for even an average, not incredibly techy user?
21:26:02 <TheJollyRoger> Well, legitimately, Firefox on Android doesn't utilize sandboxing.
21:26:16 <TheJollyRoger> Not to the same extent Chromium does.

21:32:13 <TheJollyRoger> There is one really awesome feature Fedora does have though that won't be accessible in a virtual machine, but if you don't need it or don't install it, you won't notice it's there: Fedora includes support for KVM and virt-manager, so you won't need any third party virtualization software if you want to run virtual machines on Fedora at a later date.

21:51:35 <TheJollyRoger> jacksonpollock19: just hurrying back to see if I can help you out... I can't see that screenshot very well, can you get me a better image? At first glance, if you're getting a CERTIFICATE INVALID error, can you check your clock and make sure it's correct?
21:53:15 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: yeah, KVM/QEMU and libvirt and virt-manager is if you want to use Fedora as a host, or to access and manage virtual machines on another host.
21:54:59 <TheJollyRoger> If it's enough days out of whack, then it may cause a "Certificate not Valid" error and refuse to connect. All connections to and from GrapheneOS.org are made over TLS via HTTP Strict Transport Security, so if your operating system's clock/date and GrapheneOS.org's clock/date don't agree, and the difference is larger than the lifetime of the SSL certificate, they won't connect.
21:55:26 <TheJollyRoger> I think YouTube is the same way.
21:57:25 <TheJollyRoger> Wonder if your mobile service provider is also not allowing you to connect because of a clock mismatch.

22:55:18 <strcat[m]> organella: there is a 'sub-contact-list' feature
22:55:33 <strcat[m]> organella: apps don't have to be implemented using the Contacts permission
22:56:11 <strcat[m]> it's a similar issue as the Storage permission where the Storage permission has been removed for modern apps because it was used instead of case-by-case selection by the user which has been fully supported for many years
22:56:31 <strcat[m]> don't confuse apps choosing to do things in an invasive way with the OS not supporting a good way to do it
22:57:20 <strcat[m]> also we can't make features that overly complex / confusing and hard to use correctly, people ALREADY struggle to use the existing systems
22:58:32 <strcat[m]> so having some Settings menu to configure which subset of information is exposed to each app granted a bulk access permission is not really a viable approach especially since people will need to keep going there and editing it - which is something they never needed to do outside GrapheneOS, etc.
22:58:38 <strcat[m]> it's not a viable approach
22:59:03 <strcat[m]> not intuitive that it needs to be done and people will keep asking us questions when it doesn't work as they expect
22:59:45 <strcat[m]> there is already support for apps to pick contacts without needing the Contacts permission - and we are not really in a position to force apps to do things better
23:00:00 <strcat[m]> like the Storage permission
23:00:19 <strcat[m]> and note even though we could have enabled Scoped Storage for every app already via the emulation support we haven't due to lack of contributions
