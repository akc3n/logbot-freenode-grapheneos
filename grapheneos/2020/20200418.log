00:00:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <dkms "https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy"> 2.1 and 2.2 are quite valid points, IMO (tl;dr Don't use iCloud, hope Apple doesn't pull private data to iCloud servers against your will, and don't use apps from bad actors like FB/Insta/WhatsApp). The rest is far less heavy-hitting. dkms, be slightly less combative & willing to learn, bud. You'll be glad you dude.
00:04:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Also, to whoever was asking why PWAs aren't used "anymore", it's because everyone got sold on the "native code is better" line when web 2.0 glossy components were new, lol
00:05:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> More to the point, slightly harder for corps to make them collect user data/it's usually more transparent.
00:06:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Between that, walled gardens like App Store/Google Play not pushing them super hard because they cant get their ~30% of all upfront/IAP costs, and average users barely understanding concept of a browser...PWAs use has been slow to grow.
00:07:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Watching this carefully, because as soon as PWAs are "true first class citizens" on one or both platforms, I plan to publish one for my business.

08:03:56 <TheJollyRoger> I haven't tried it yet, heh.
08:04:42 <rutxonboard[m]> Interesting, thinking of switching. Sounds paranoid, but I don't want Spotify collecting all my music and metadata and selling it
08:06:26 <TheJollyRoger> Oh hey right on. I've never used spotify or streaming before, I'm kinda old fashioned.
08:06:45 <rutxonboard[m]> That's wise. I can't afford to build a library
08:07:39 <TheJollyRoger> Well, it wasn't really a deliberate choice, just more force of habit. I used to trade CDs.

08:31:44 <rutxonboard[m]> Complete*
08:32:16 <rutxonboard[m]> It's limited in helpfulness due to reliance on external code and not being in security critical parts
08:32:33 <rutxonboard[m]> The main issue with Firefox is the lack of exploit mitigation
08:32:49 <rutxonboard[m]> The malloc sucks and the lack of real sandboxing is bad

08:32:57 <rutxonboard[m]> Firefox has a lot of work cut out
08:33:45 <rutxonboard[m]> The other thing is you already have to run Chromium on Android in WebView. If you use Firefox to browse as well now you can get hit with Gecko and Chromium exploits
08:34:10 <rutxonboard[m]> That makes life easier for your adversary
08:34:25 <rutxonboard[m]> Firefox has decent sandboxing on Windows
08:34:28 <rutxonboard[m]> But that is it
08:34:38 <rutxonboard[m]> Linux is very bad and Android is worse
08:34:50 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "The other thing is you already h"> Yeah I dont use Firefox on my phone, but I use it everywhere else.
08:35:05 <rutxonboard[m]> You probably shouldn't it is very poor security
08:35:42 <rutxonboard[m]> And running on a desktop OS which is a security nightmare anyway. Chromium is the first line of defence and actually well done keeping desktops pretty safe
08:35:49 <rutxonboard[m]> Firefox just isn't there
08:37:48 <rutxonboard[m]> If you want to support an alternative engine by Apple products. Android and Chrome are both gunning for a massive world wide control. Apple is the last line of defence. 1/20th of web traffic is from Firefox. It's not making a difference
08:38:04 <rutxonboard[m]> Or just be like normal people and don't worry about it
08:38:14 <rutxonboard[m]> 😋
08:39:04 <rutxonboard[m]> Here are some sources and more info https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html
08:39:12 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "You probably shouldn't it is ver"> The reason I use FF is that I dont want to give Google more power to decide how the majority use the internet. They want to get rid of the address bar, which means that they want everything to go through their servers.

08:39:43 <rutxonboard[m]> They are the only group doing anything to meaningfully protect you beside Google
08:40:11 <rutxonboard[m]> If Android and Chrome super majority concern you then Apple is the ecosystem for you
08:41:27 <rutxonboard[m]> Safari is a very good browser. Not Chromium tier, but it is has better security and privacy compared to Firefox by a longshot

08:43:58 <rutxonboard[m]> No Apple is way more secure for many reasons. iPhone and iOS are comareable to GrapheneOS
08:44:22 <rutxonboard[m]> Samsung is not even close to either
08:44:39 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Here are some sources and more i"> Nice! Ill taka a closer look
08:44:47 <rutxonboard[m]> Android exploits are usually universal
08:45:11 <rutxonboard[m]> Google devices are just better protected since they actually patch well and on time and have all security features
08:46:19 <rutxonboard[m]> iOS and iPhones are very solid and have excellent privacy features out of the box
08:46:23 <joshman[m]> Having apple ID (even a non-KYCed one) is what is inferior in apples case against Graphene
08:46:28 <rutxonboard[m]> They are also insanely hard to fingerprint
08:47:00 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Samsung is not even close to eit"> Samsung was just an example of a brand doing Android phones. I think they are absolutely disgusting. Didn’t they get caught that they just updated the security patch date without really applying any patches? Like with many other Android brands. Thats fucked up imo.
08:48:05 <rutxonboard[m]> > > <@rutxonboard:matrix.org> Samsung is not even close to either

08:48:06 <rutxonboard[m]> That might have been a mistake in the study. Samsung is bad though and so are the others
08:48:10 <joshman[m]> The good thing about Samsung it is made in Korea unlike Google, Apple and friends
08:48:22 <rutxonboard[m]> Google and Apple are the only companies to trust at all for security
08:49:16 <rutxonboard[m]> > The good thing about Samsung it is made in Korea unlike Google, Apple and friends
08:49:17 <rutxonboard[m]> They have closed firmware from America from Qualcomm and such. They also have Google code which is too big to audit fully
08:49:23 <rutxonboard[m]> I don't think that matters one bit
08:49:30 <rutxonboard[m]> Samsung just sucks
08:50:16 <joshman[m]> It does I agree
08:50:37 <rutxonboard[m]> On the one hand the App Store needing an Apple ID is bad. On the other hand Android has no secure store option yet
08:50:54 <rutxonboard[m]> Aurora leaks a ton of data to Google and it is placing a lot of trust in them. Also F-Droid is horribly insecure
08:50:57 <joshman[m]> Though I was unable to convince my friend from buying one. Samsung flagships are just so appealing to nontech folks
08:51:20 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Google and Apple are the only co"> I just dont like that for example, on iOS you have to go out of your way to truly disable wifi and bluetooth. They just go to ”sleep” for some time if you disable them through the action panel or whatever it’s called. Then it never telss me about app updates or even OS updates. I have to manually check both and yes, I have the default ”check updates automaticall

08:54:16 <rutxonboard[m]> That's concerning, what iOS version?
08:54:46 <joshman[m]> There are many shady things going on on iOS devices which we will never audit

08:56:13 <rutxonboard[m]> > Why do I have Signal background activity notification ON constantly?? Is it ok?

08:59:28 <rutxonboard[m]> I don't really remember how iCloud worked on it
09:03:20 <rutxonboard[m]> GrapheneOS and iOS in my view are closer to equals right now. I wouldn't trust any other OS. GrapheneOS is my choice since I like Google's commitment to open source and their amazing tech. I don't trust any other device maker beside Apple(which I don't use)
09:04:07 <rutxonboard[m]> Google is doing a great job, but other devices don't have the same standards for SELinux rules, patch timing, or years of monthly support
09:04:15 <rutxonboard[m]> None
09:05:08 <nhscm[m]> Lol I was a huge Android fanboy, but after what happened to COS and the shitty choices I have outside of Pixels, I decided to try iOS. I was hugely disappointed. Mainly for the reasons above and just that I was more at home with how Android did things and after more than a year in iOS, I still dont like it. I actually recently booted my old Nexus 5X that had the latest COS (before the keys were wiped, I believe) and it
09:05:08 <nhscm[m]> felt really light and snappy :D.
09:05:52 <rutxonboard[m]> I hear you on that
09:07:31 <rutxonboard[m]> Apple requires trusting less companies and they also don't share security patches with tons of companies ahead of time (which I'm sure gets passed to feds eventually). They also have a good store option. GrapheneOS has a better browser, a freer stack, better isolation, and way more freedom
09:07:39 <rutxonboard[m]> There is no clear winner for me
09:08:26 <rutxonboard[m]> Apple making their own hardware is a huge security boon
09:08:49 <rutxonboard[m]> It's a mix. iPhone is probably best for most people and Graphene for the ultra technical

09:27:55 <rutxonboard[m]> Or buy a $300 Pixel 3a and still run circles around the Bittium
09:28:11 <limitless0[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Seriously nothing comes close be"> Very true
09:28:18 <limitless0[m]> Nothing commercial anyway
09:28:19 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Android 10 is old hat and Daniel"> I would then buy Pixel 3a from Daniel to support the project, but I cant
09:28:31 <rutxonboard[m]> Why not?
09:28:37 <rutxonboard[m]> Oh
09:28:44 <rutxonboard[m]> I see what you mean
09:29:00 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Don't use Bittium buy a new Pixe"> Ok maybe Ill just do that
09:29:02 <rutxonboard[m]> Buy a GrapheneOS phone and donate money you'll do way better
09:29:07 <rutxonboard[m]> I promise you
09:29:17 <renlord> nhscm[m]: yea, buy the pixel, then donate money
09:30:00 <rutxonboard[m]> $300 for a Pixel 3a donate $1100 to Graphene and then you just saved money
09:30:06 <rutxonboard[m]> Got something way better
09:33:02 <rutxonboard[m]> Bittium is so bad, that a Stock Pixel is better
09:34:25 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "$300 for a Pixel 3a donate $1100"> I need to start looking at those Pixels then.
09:34:34 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Bittium is so bad, that a Stock "> Why is that?
09:35:00 <rutxonboard[m]> Android 10/11 support. They have basically all the same features. The Pixel has the Titan M
09:35:30 <rutxonboard[m]> The Pixel has better hardening

09:37:50 <rutxonboard[m]> > rutxonboard: so whats the deal with netguard that can be bypassed by trackers?
09:37:50 <rutxonboard[m]> There are a ton of ways. Android has such advanced inter app communication
09:38:04 <rutxonboard[m]> Also it's a race to who starts up first
09:38:17 <rutxonboard[m]> If your VPN goes down for even a second your apps can upload everything
09:38:29 <rutxonboard[m]> Don't run untrusted software on your machine
09:38:55 <rutxonboard[m]> Intents to a browser and the custom tabs and such can all go work too
09:39:02 <rutxonboard[m]> Firewalls just don't work on Android
09:39:31 <rutxonboard[m]> Or even anything
09:39:48 <rutxonboard[m]> Firewalls don't keep bad apps from phoning home it's misleading and dangerous to assume that
09:40:20 <joshman[m]> I use VPN Killswitch all day everyday. Fun fact: somehow Twitter sells me adds for my original location. I asked my VPN provider what's the deal of course they didn't help
09:40:38 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Android 10/11 support. They have"> Does Bittium not have Titan?
09:40:40 <rutxonboard[m]> The network toggle on GrapheneOS is decent, even then it has a warning
09:40:55 <joshman[m]> Firewalls are crap. I'm disappointed. Though I like Lockdown on iOS. It makes system run better
09:41:06 <rutxonboard[m]> > I use VPN Killswitch all day everyday. Fun fact: somehow Twitter sells me adds for my original location. I asked my VPN provider what's the deal of course they didn't help
09:41:06 <rutxonboard[m]> You can get local ip if you run an app
09:41:14 <rutxonboard[m]> That's how browsers can ip leak
09:41:22 <rutxonboard[m]> VPNs don't protect you from apps
09:41:37 <rutxonboard[m]> PWAs are the only way to run untrusted apps
09:41:45 <rutxonboard[m]> User Profiles are okay
09:41:50 <joshman[m]> I use SlimSocial. Is that the case?
09:41:54 <rutxonboard[m]> But still doesn't stop ip leaks
09:42:00 <rutxonboard[m]> > I use SlimSocial. Is that the case?
09:42:00 <rutxonboard[m]> Do you trust the app?
09:42:17 <rutxonboard[m]> Does your WebView stop WebRTC leaks?
09:42:39 <nhscm[m]> <joshman[m] "I use SlimSocial. Is that the ca"> Why not the Twitter PWA?
09:42:52 <joshman[m]> Ofc my VPN provider never agreed apps leaked my IP.
09:43:19 <rutxonboard[m]> > Ofc my VPN provider never agreed apps leaked my IP.
09:43:19 <rutxonboard[m]> VPNs are marketing machines
09:44:02 <rutxonboard[m]> I can write an app that gets a ton of data from no user facing permissions. It's easy to fingerprint your setup or leak important data
09:44:07 <rutxonboard[m]> It's easy
09:44:30 <joshman[m]> <nhscm[m] "Why not the Twitter PWA?"> How does it work. I never used that b4. A shortcut in Vanadium?

09:45:22 <rutxonboard[m]> And private
09:45:25 <rutxonboard[m]> Not even close

09:59:20 <rutxonboard[m]> I don't see why in a world of $400 iPhone SE and $300 Pixel 3a why anyone would entertain either of these. But I will go into it
09:59:21 <cx2[m]> i'm here for the learning exerience / make donations....
09:59:26 <hitchhooker[m]> Librems security model is built around, when your phone is already owned. PureOS is quite crap security wise
10:00:17 <rutxonboard[m]> Basically Bittium has verified boot and sandboxing and no processes with unrestricted root since it is standard Android. Librem has none of that
10:00:48 <rutxonboard[m]> SELinux does a ton of heavy lifting on Android
10:00:58 <rutxonboard[m]> They both have closed source firmware
10:01:17 <rutxonboard[m]> Bittium has a Snapdragon which is well audited and designed for security and isolation
10:02:04 <nhscm[m]> I thought about getting the Librem 5, but comparing it against any Android, its absolutely horrible in security wise. I read Daniels and I think Madaidans comments about Android in Reddit and those have convinced me that AOSP is a really good OS.
10:02:32 <rutxonboard[m]> Yes AOSP is very good iOS and GrapheneOS are better though
10:02:56 <rutxonboard[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/index.html
10:02:57 <nhscm[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Yes AOSP is very good iOS and Gr"> Yeah
10:03:06 <rutxonboard[m]> Check out the Linux phone section
10:03:15 <cx2[m]> Well let me ask you this, given Librems Roll-out model... and the fact that they *seem* to be relatively transparent about the fact that their phone is sort of shit at the moment, do you believe that they are legit trying to move in the right direction? Or is it misguided? Both?
10:03:15 <cx2[m]> Ive read a bit about the guys, listened to a few talks. and it seems they have poured a fair amount of money into an idea idea that on the surface seems pretty novel.
10:03:20 <rutxonboard[m]> Librem and PinePhone are truly nightmare tier

10:03:58 <rutxonboard[m]> They admit it is shit, but from what I can tell not in the security regard. Which is an issue for me
10:04:15 <rutxonboard[m]> The lack of transparency on security is understandable
10:04:26 <rutxonboard[m]> I wouldn't be shouting that
10:04:48 <rutxonboard[m]> At least Librem updates their product themselves unlike PinePhone
10:04:55 <cx2[m]> gotcha

10:21:19 <cx2[m]> Of course. I plan on (again with a mountain of time on my hands) attempting to host my own instance.

10:22:55 <rutxonboard[m]> Yeah that's a good idea
10:23:15 <cx2[m]> in theory all of my own traffic through a VPN should be obscured, yeah?

10:41:15 <cx2[m]> At that point, "trust" really only becomes the tie-breaker

10:53:41 <nhscm[m]> You have some options. 1. Use Dynamic DNS service. 2. Get the cheapest VPS with a dedicated ip and setup a VPN tunnel from home to the VPS 3. Use Cloudflares offerings.

12:06:51 <cx2[m]> <bseeinu[m] "Does strongbox auto-copy TOTP ti"> not sure... i wouldn't recommend storing TOTP with your passwords... defeats the "Two Factor" purpose
12:07:40 <cx2[m]> I will say that the FaceID + Pin unlock is the ONE feature that pushed me over the edge into purchasing it.... Otherwise there are other PW managers that handle .kdbx files just as well.
12:08:21 <cx2[m]> Strongbox is also a bit slow to load which is somewhat annoying.
12:08:21 <bseeinu[m]> As long as I can sync via something like FTP and cross platform
12:08:49 <bseeinu[m]> Say iOS + Graphene + MacOS
12:09:58 <bseeinu[m]> Oh strongbox only does iCloud :/
12:10:34 <cx2[m]> haven't tried FTP on ipad..... Syncthing is absolutely clutch....need to find something that works with iPad
12:11:02 <bseeinu[m]> Sftp
12:11:23 <cx2[m]> <bseeinu[m] "Oh strongbox only does iCloud :/"> No, you can point it to a file.... and as long as that file is being synced you should be good
12:12:10 <cx2[m]> currently use syncthing between macOS and GOS for PW database sync
12:12:24 <cx2[m]> so far works flawlessly
12:12:35 <bseeinu[m]> So external file browser that adds SFTP to the system, periodic sync, then strongbox updates
12:13:11 <joshman[m]> Split screen works great on 3xl. Gotta luv Graphene

But the utility of the file format used for KeePass type databases cannot be understated. As long as you take care to create backups, and keep those backups safe, I think there are some enormous upsides to using KeePass.
12:29:48 <cx2[m]> Plus, bitwarden has been somewhat hit or miss for me on GOS for some reasons. At times I was able to login just fine, but then my database wouldnt' load at all "database empty".
12:29:56 <cx2[m]> Other times it would load just fine.
12:30:53 <cx2[m]> Haven't had a single issue with the current setup using Syncthing for Android + .kdbx

16:18:19 <brenneke[m]> So hearing FF not a secure browser for desktop, and always heard (but don't know) that Chromium is basically Google spyware, what about Brave? Any other recommended?
16:19:17 <madaidan[m]> <brenneke[m] "So hearing FF not a secure brows"> Chromium isn't spyware.
16:20:13 <madaidan[m]> Brave is alright imo but strcat dislikes it because it uses DRM to enforce BAT ad viewing among other things.
16:22:57 <Zenithium[m]> madaidan.: what do you think about using Tor Browser on Highest (JS disabled), doesn't that mitigate a lot of it's security problems? Routing ungoogled-chromium through Tor leads to a unique fingerprint
16:23:21 <Zenithium[m]> Not that I'm saying Firefox should be supported, disabling JS is more of a bandaid fix but I'm curious
16:26:34 <joshman[m]> Reddit no PWA 😭
16:28:17 <brenneke[m]> <Zenithium[m] "Not that I'm saying Firefox shou"> Breaks many sites does it not?
16:28:19 <cx2[m]> josh.man: can at least add it to your home screen from Vanadium
16:28:30 <cx2[m]> Kind of the middle ground
16:29:40 <madaidan[m]> <Zenithium[m] "madaidan.: what do you think abo"> That's what I use. It doesn't add any security features but the lack of JS makes it far harder to exploit.
16:36:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <Zenithium[m] "They have their own repo on F-Dr"> Bromite has a repo *for use with* F-Droid and forks, they do not have a repo on F-Droid.org, to be clear for the reader at home. Huge distinction, IMO
16:37:42 <brenneke[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Bromite has a repo *for use with"> Bromite looks same as Vanadium, no apparent other features.
16:38:50 <Zenithium[m]> <brenneke[m] "Breaks many sites does it not?"> Whether that is a problem depends on what sites you visit :P
16:42:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <joshman[m] "Reddit no PWA 😭"> There are plenty of open source mobile apps if using old.reddit in mobile browser isn't good enough for you

17:20:07 <IzumiSenaSora[m4> * Need some Opinion about nextcloud! I mean is it good for self hosting ..... Or something else which is better in security and privacy?
17:20:19 <coltigore[m]> Nextcloud is pretty neat, I like using it for storing my photos, contacts, and calendars.
17:21:51 <IzumiSenaSora[m4> <coltigore[m] "Nextcloud is pretty neat, I like"> Yup same opinion.....
17:23:39 <coltigore[m]> Just curious, what device do y'all use for GrapheneOS? I have a Galaxy note 9 right now but I hate it, I was thinking about a pixel 4a when it comes out, but I know the pixel 4 isn't supported right now, so I was wondering if it woulde be better to get a pixel 3 or a 3a

17:27:38 <rutxonboard[m]> 3 is faster, has a better camera, a more premium build. 3a is still very good and has 2 years guaranteed support (1.5 for the 3)
17:28:15 <coltigore[m]> Do you know which has a better battery?
17:28:52 <manamex[m]> <coltigore[m] "Do you know which has a better b"> 3a
17:29:30 <coltigore[m]> Sweet! I think I'll go with a 3a when I actually upgrade in October lol
17:30:20 <Zenithium[m]> Just want to add that 3a has headphone jack :P
17:49:16 <manamex[m]> <Zenithium[m] "Just want to add that 3a has hea"> Yes!

18:02:33 <brenneke[m]> <brenneke[m] "Good to know, thanks."> I did not authorize the app, works now. Good to see they are updating this app!
18:10:10 <brenneke[m]> Really missing Root explorer now that am on GrapheneOS and not rooted.....any suggestions for good file explorer other than Files?
18:40:48 <cx2[m]> Throwing some serious shade over in the "cybersecurity overview" room......yikes.
18:40:55 <cx2[m]> those are some haters.
18:45:04 <Zenithium[m]> I left that room a while ago, so toxic
18:45:15 <Zenithium[m]> What are they saying?
18:48:06 <cx2[m]> Daniel Micay is a highly toxic unstable aggressive and destructive creature who should never be trusted, despite having gathered support from poor unfortunate naievé souls.  ***S***him's fort seems to be in coding and self-imploding, and trying to destroy anything ***X***e touches.  Either bow to ***X***im and kiss ***X***ir's ring or ***S***him will break stuff and throw a hissy fit.  Never let ***S***him near your
18:48:07 <cx2[m]> unguarded data, and of course **ALWAYS BACKUP**.  Never let ***S***him in your cyberspace as ***X***e will attempt to compromise your cybersecurity, or at least ***troll teh mostest***.
18:48:42 <cx2[m]> I'll just leave this right here....
18:52:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <brenneke[m] "Really missing Root explorer now"> Probably would help to mention what features you're seeking/missing =]
18:55:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > Daniel Micay is a highly toxic unstable aggressive and destructive creature who should never be trusted,
18:55:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> pfffftahahahahaha....the only part of this that approaches truth is the aggressive part. Which, is earned, and, in many cases, deserved. The BEST authorities in any space have to be forceful in their speech, it seems.
18:55:28 <Zenithium[m]> <cx2[m] "Daniel Micay is a highly toxic u"> I can't take that seriously, it must be sarcasm
18:55:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Also, what the fuck even is the rest of that rant? Specifically the pronoun bullshit, tf?
18:55:56 <cx2[m]> Oh they seem serious AF
18:57:51 <cx2[m]> lots of reference to the firefox debate
19:01:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It was quite jarring to hear Firefox flamed when I started hanging around, but, any research shows the points on Gecko etc to be valid.
19:01:40 <Zenithium[m]> Someone's upset that their favorite browser got shat on lol
19:02:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Nobody likes being told they were/are wrong. Will not go off-topic, but, I struggle with the same thing discussing the darker side of geopolitics.
19:03:15 <Zenithium[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Nobody likes being told they wer"> I like being *proven* that I'm wrong :^)
19:03:47 <Zenithium[m]> I mean, I like arguing as long as it's rational and doesn't include ad hominems
19:04:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > I like being proven that I'm wrong :^)
19:04:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Same - because I'll probably never be wrong abou that again. It's an exciting time for me, where it's an ego-shattering moment for the less-logical. Anyway, enough masturbation for me ;D
19:05:09 <Zenithium[m]> People don't like Daniel because he be spitting straight facts
19:05:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Sometimes aggressively! And that's okay. People get pissed about Torvalds' attitude, sometimes, too. But, well, fuck them
19:06:45 <cx2[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Sometimes aggressively! And that"> Speaking of a guy that has not a single fuck to give... Yikes.
19:08:33 <Zenithium[m]> He has to be aggresive when he has to deal with people that don't know what they're talking about all the time. I mean, obviously almost no one is a OpSec expert, but people talk like they are.
19:14:09 <madaidan[m]> It's hard not to be aggressive when people constantly spread bullshit and act like they're experts
19:14:21 <majorasparagus0[> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Nobody likes being told they wer"> Is there a forum where you WILL go off topic in this way?

21:05:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Hmm...so looking like I need to use ADB to disable SIM Toolkit, if I'm not mistaken?
21:13:12 <cx2[m]> goin HAM on GOS in that chat right now....geezus
21:13:25 <cx2[m]> well, more specifically Daniel
21:32:58 <Zenithium[m]> Oh this is the mod of that room, yeah he's a lunatic
21:33:04 <Zenithium[m]> You can see it by the way he types
21:34:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, if they start discussing GrapheneOS code having issues, I might tune in. Until then, waste of air/space, etc
21:44:34 <dazinism> Milkman is a total lunatic, also power crazed / authoritarian
21:46:37 <dazinism> He set up loads of matrix rooms about popular topics. Also sadly got given that very popular cybersecurity room
21:47:47 <dazinism> Once stuff got busy he became increasingly aggressive to folks. Got loads of strange pet hates - like Daniel, XMPP, the whole matrix dev team
21:49:39 <cx2[m]> sounds like a solid change to passively flex some XMPP.... i DO like a good pot stiring
21:53:00 <Zenithium[m]> From the way he talks about Daniel and COS I assume he's one of James's buddies, he's saying how he was in the COS IRC and saw Daniel "troll" and ruin everything
21:53:47 <dazinism> I watched him start on matrix and set up rooms for fdroid, copperhead, meshnets then be extremely antisocial in them, while  being extremely harsh on anyone else.
21:54:31 <dazinism> He had the copperheados room on matrix, James bridges the copperhead IRC to it
21:56:10 <dazinism> MM decided Daniel was in the wrong, that the company was right and slowly started his aggressive shit at anyone that questioned James, spoke up for Daniel, banning folks erc
21:56:12 <dazinism> Etc
21:57:05 <dazinism> Eventually the matrix devs took the copperhead:matrix.org off him
21:58:11 <dazinism> Thats more or less why he hates Daniel
21:59:01 <Zenithium[m]> Did he always type like a schizo?
21:59:17 <dazinism> *harsh and antisocial,  while banning lots of folks who were being far less so, also anyone who questions him
21:59:51 <yzernik> Does anyone know if the Aurora store has all of the apps that are in the play store?
21:59:54 <dazinism> Likes to think everyone who disagrees with him is a sockpuppet of someone he's fallen out with previously
22:00:07 <yzernik> I can't find one app that I'm looking for
22:00:11 <JTL> I must be strcat /s
22:00:37 <cx2[m]> It's actually pretty tough to read... and I"m not up on some of the lingo.... what the fuck is a Shim
22:00:46 <dazinism> yzernik: its just an alternative way to access the play storre
22:01:41 <yzernik> I'm trying to install one app that I have on my old phone and I don't see it in the aurora store
22:01:58 <dazinism> cx2: he's got a very strange comms style that gets very annoying
22:01:59 <yzernik> And I do see it in the play store
22:02:16 <dazinism> All that weird language
22:02:43 <dazinism> Glad I'm not in any room with him any more
22:03:03 <dazinism> Used to get a bit depressed about how he treated folks
22:03:20 <dazinism> I ended out calling him out on it and he banned me
22:03:56 <dazinism> Think that was after he banned someone for suggesting xmpp was good
22:04:09 <dazinism> ... or something like that
22:04:23 <yzernik> I'm thinking maybe the play store limits which apps you see based on location, and I am using anon account for Aurora store, so my location is different
22:04:29 <Zenithium[m]> All I've seen is that he removes entire conversations and then gets mad at users for not going to one of his other 50 rooms that are specifically on that topic even though they are a subset of "cybersecurity" and therefore not off-topic, and when I told him that removing conversations after they've already happened is unproductive he said I was "anti-moderation" or something like that
22:04:53 <cx2[m]> Yeah I"m going to save my banning moment keep the room silent.....
22:04:53 <cx2[m]> >keep your enemy close
22:05:23 <dazinism> Zenithium: yeah,  endless weird authoritarian bullshit, just leave his rooms
22:06:11 <rutxonboard[m]> Is EDS Lite secure? Someone here said to avoid it
22:06:14 <Zenithium[m]> I did, because the same as you I'm not really tolerant of his bullshit, I just joined back now to see what he was saying about Daniel because I haven't heard him mention him before
22:06:41 <Zenithium[m]> All of his rooms are dead anyway because he kicks bans and removes 95% of what people say
22:06:59 <dazinism> rutxonboard: don't recall that
22:07:02 <TheJollyRoger> rutxonboard[m]: If I recall right, I've often said to make sure that you never put EDS volumes on any cloud server.
22:07:31 <rutxonboard[m]> Right
22:07:33 <dazinism> Think jolly said don't use volumes on cloud storage
22:07:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
22:07:57 <rutxonboard[m]> No alternative for cloud?
22:08:51 <TheJollyRoger> Well... if you like I can try to explain why this is, but it's a tad bit offtopic: XTS mode is designed to only provide confidentiality *once*, and assumes that whoever gets ahold of the ciphertexts will not get a second copy of the ciphertexts at a later, altered state.
22:10:06 <TheJollyRoger> XTS is not designed to protect against traffic analysis attacks or tampering.
22:10:15 <rutxonboard[m]> Interesting, I assume this doesn't apple to VeraCrypt? I am an encryption novice
22:10:25 <dazinism> Its not great, but encrypted matrix room with just you in it?
22:10:35 <TheJollyRoger> It does apply to Veracrypt. It applies to any mode that uses XTS.
22:10:45 <JTL> hi FileVault
22:10:47 <TheJollyRoger> The reason for XTS's existence is... well,
22:10:47 <JTL> :p
22:10:54 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha XD
22:11:12 <rutxonboard[m]> Interesting, so is cloud storage encryption a lost cause?
22:11:45 <TheJollyRoger> Not quite, it's just the wrong too for the job. Give me a second... disks are sort of a difficult and finicky business to encrypt and there's a lot of delicate balancing acts involved in making sure that the ciphertexts you write out are exactly the same size as the plaintexts being decrypted.
22:12:10 <TheJollyRoger> As well as performance and speed, and resiliency against data corruption.
22:12:28 <TheJollyRoger> XTS mode is sort of a tradeoff of all of these requirements and security.
22:13:36 <TheJollyRoger> The threat model of an encrypted disk, like Veracrypt, GELI, Bitlocker, GELI is: "What if I leave my laptop in the back of my car at night, then someone smashes the window and grabs my laptop."
22:14:01 <TheJollyRoger> For that, the security of your data on the laptop's or phone's drive boils down to the strength of your password.
22:14:15 <TheJollyRoger> Your adversary is only getting to see the ciphertexts at *one* particular state.
22:14:21 <TheJollyRoger> And not going to see them again.
22:14:48 <TheJollyRoger> That's within Veracrypt's, EDS Lite's, GELI, Bitlocker's, LUKS, etc's threat model and they meet this threat model VERY VERY WELL
22:15:14 <JTL> I'm pretty see LUKS supports otehr ciphers but I haven't tested them
22:15:36 <TheJollyRoger> I've toyed around with it :D
22:15:50 <TheJollyRoger> Not all combinations are valid but I've tried some.
22:15:54 <rutxonboard[m]> > That's within Veracrypt's, EDS Lite's, GELI, Bitlocker's, LUKS, etc's threat model and they meet this threat model VERY VERY WELL
22:15:54 <rutxonboard[m]> So for a home hosted cloud it's perfect?
22:16:00 <rutxonboard[m]> But not online
22:16:04 <TheJollyRoger> Well, let me get to the next part...
22:17:53 <TheJollyRoger> XTS mode is not designed to protect confidentiality against traffic analysis. For each bit of plaintext that is changed, a very large number of ciphertext bits also need to get shuffled around a bit, and this means that as an attacker gets more snapshots of the ciphertext *as it changes* the better a picture they have of being able to guess at or reconstruct what the contents are.
22:18:56 <TheJollyRoger> Secondly, XTS is unauthenticated, and this is by design: to authenticate each sector of ciphertext prior to decryption would require insane amounts of CPU power.
22:19:27 <TheJollyRoger> And what's also difficult is that with some modes of authenticated encryption, some blocks depend on the ones that came before them, meaning that a single stray bit flip could /trash the entire drive/.
22:21:09 <rutxonboard[m]> Which is usually not worth the trade off
22:21:12 <TheJollyRoger> So, if you're running a home server and are worried that someday, someone's going to come to your home, grab the disks there, and make off with them, encrypt the drives of your home server. If you want to distrust the server, use something like age (Actually Good Encryption).
22:21:46 <TheJollyRoger> *like age on your client, so that the server only sees your ciphertexts.
22:24:12 <rutxonboard[m]> Very interesting, I'll look into age thanks
22:24:19 <rutxonboard[m]> I never knew that much about XTS
22:24:27 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
22:25:27 <cx2[m]> so what for the cloud then? Next you're going to tell me that Cryptomator is a bad idea
22:26:21 <TheJollyRoger> age (Actually Good Encryption)! ^_^
22:26:30 <TheJollyRoger> It's unfortunately not ported to mobile yet.
22:26:36 <TheJollyRoger> Just a sec though, I will be back shortly.
22:27:43 <cx2[m]> ....mobile -> Syncthing -> Machine -> AGE -> Cloud
22:45:52 <mxnorvak[m]> hi
22:52:12 <mxnorvak[m]> I've searched here before and have almost read all of Daniel's explanations on why LOS sucks privacy and security wise, however, being currently stuck with a xiaomi mi 9t pro, and really needing to degoogle everything but still caring about the security and privacy sides of things, is a there any option besides LOS? I've read that stock rom is better cuz i can lock the bootloader but again even using adb i can't
22:52:13 <mxnorvak[m]> degoogle it :/ just removing xiaomi junks, do u guys have any suggestions?
22:53:31 <dazinism> Isnt it possible to pm uninstall all Google stuff?
22:53:41 <dazinism> Via adb?
22:53:49 <dazinism> I've never tried
22:55:37 <dazinism> You'd then have to make alternative arrangements to get all the system components that are now updated via Play
22:55:45 <dazinism> Webview
22:56:22 <dazinism> ... and to they've been moving to do increasingly more that way, but I forget exactly what
22:57:20 <mxnorvak[m]> dazinism: I've never tried either, but as far as I've searched it's only xiaomi stock apps and features, but then again they're only unistalled for the current user and aren't completely removed cause that requires root access, and idk if for example updating the os would bring all those unistalled apps back again
23:00:46 <dazinism> Its the user(s) you are using you want them removed from. Would think/hope they wouldn't come back with an update, as they are always still on the phone, just not running in whichever user
23:01:13 <dazinism> Try creating a new user and removing everything?
23:01:39 <dazinism> Or do some web searching.... got to be folks out there doing this
23:02:36 <dazinism> My Android life has been Cyanogen > Copperhead > Lineage > GrapheneOS. Never had Play on a phone I've been using...

23:03:00 <rutxonboard[m]> There is a very good reason they aren't removed from the whole system. First these apps don't have root(unless they are incredibly stupid) and they have to be there to verify boot(main issue with LOS)
23:03:11 <rutxonboard[m]> If you remove the stock crap you are fine
