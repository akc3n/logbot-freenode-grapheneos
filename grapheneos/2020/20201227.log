01:53:17 <JS[m]> Graphene works on a Pixel 3, right?
01:55:10 <LinusSexTips[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
01:55:11 <LinusSexTips[m]> Yes
02:25:34 <ghost_matrix[m]> Im trying to unlock bootloader on pixel 4a but it wont detect phone when in fastboot mode but will detect normally in the computer.
02:25:41 <ghost_matrix[m]> I have folled the guide step by step
02:25:47 <ghost_matrix[m]>  * I have followed the guide step by step
02:29:20 <ghost_matrix[m]> I have OEM unlocking and usb debugging turned on and im using cable with data transfer.
02:29:58 <ghost_matrix[m]> Ive also turned on data transfer via USB settings.
02:31:38 <Liakdeuser[m]> What desktop OS are you flashing GrapheneOS?
02:32:03 <ghost_matrix[m]> Im using ubuntu 20.4
02:32:25 <ghost_matrix[m]> It detects the phone when not in fastboot though
02:33:06 <ghost_matrix[m]> But the moment i go to fastboot it just says this:
02:33:06 <ghost_matrix[m]> Waiting for any device.......
02:33:25 <ghost_matrix[m]> I even added fastboot to my $PATH

02:41:11 <strcat[m]> ghost_matrix: you missed the part that I'm quoting
02:41:14 <strcat[m]> read it
02:41:37 <strcat[m]> > android-sdk-platform-tools-common provides udev rules allowing fastboot and adb to work in local sessions without root
02:41:41 <strcat[m]> this sentence specifically
02:41:47 <strcat[m]> you don't have that, so it's not going to work without root
02:43:23 <ghost_matrix[m]> Ok so i need to get android-sdk-platform-tools-common.
02:43:23 <ghost_matrix[m]> Im not sure why it makes me download Standalone platform-tools via curl then?
02:45:07 <strcat> that doesn't provide platform-tools
02:45:18 <strcat> ghost_matrix[m]: you need to read what it has written there about Debian and Ubuntu
02:45:24 <strcat> read that paragraph
02:45:41 <strcat> answers your question and also explains why you need that and what you would need to do if you didn't install it
02:45:53 <strcat> > android-sdk-platform-tools-common provides udev rules allowing fastboot and adb to work in local sessions without root.
02:46:05 <strcat> i.e. the package provides the configuration needed to run those tools without root
02:46:12 <strcat> > The udev rules in Debian and Ubuntu are out-of-date, but it has the necessary entries for Pixel phones.
02:46:26 <strcat> a caveat for other devices (but it works for Pixels since they reused the same ids for each new device)
02:46:30 <strcat> > The adb and fastboot packages are currently both broken and far too out-of-date to be any use, so avoid those. The version check in the flashing script will prevent accidentally using these.
02:46:50 <germany420> I donated $15 XMR :)
02:46:53 <strcat> and it explains why you can't use their platform-tools / fastboot package
02:47:13 <germany420> Thanks Daniel
02:47:18 <strcat> you could also manually set up the latest udev rules but for Pixels their old package is good enough
02:47:21 <strcat> germany420: thanks
02:48:17 <ghost_matrix[m]> strcat: Ok so if im understanding correctly, need to get  android-sdk-platform-tools-common from package manager.
02:52:51 <ghost_matrix[m]> Ok it worked thanks strcat
02:57:43 <thoomp> I love Graphene, but is there a way to enable notifications from apps like Twitter and Discord without letting google into the house so to speak?
03:02:15 <Liakdeuser[m]> If an app is hard dependent on Play services to push notifications, there's no way it can have notifications without Play services in any AOSP-based OS
05:44:05 <hdksv7391[m]> CalyxOS with MicroG might be better for you if you really want thosethoomp
05:46:18 <strcat[m]> this isn't an appropriate place to advertise that
05:46:22 <Liakdeuser[m]> I won't suggest an OS that delays security patches, lacks proper privacy patches on Chromium, and having your notifications sent at Google servers
05:47:16 <Liakdeuser[m]> Not really appealing to sacrifice most of enhancements just for some notifications imho
05:47:26 <hdksv7391[m]> This gatekeeping is the reason I really hate this community xD
05:47:59 <hdksv7391[m]> Just said that there are other options too

08:33:19 <strcat> no need for adb to install an apk
08:37:26 <duggalsu[m]> Thanks! I had tried copying the apk and opening from the file manager but that had not worked so I was confused
08:38:08 <duggalsu[m]> Also,  do the keys of the secondary profile purge from memory on simply switching profiles?
08:38:22 <simpletech[m]> No, you need to reboot
08:38:42 <strcat> you don't need to reboot
08:38:49 <simpletech[m]> Don't?
08:38:54 <strcat> duggalsu[m]: simpletech[m]: read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
08:39:01 <strcat> GrapheneOS adds an end session option for secondary profiles
08:39:08 <simpletech[m]> Awesome. I'm sorry!
08:39:12 <strcat> switching users doesn't purge the encryption keys, end session does
08:39:30 <simpletech[m]> <strcat "switching users doesn't purge th"> Awesome! :3
08:39:38 <strcat> also apps can use keystore keys set to require that the device is unlocked - this is done by Molly
08:39:39 <duggalsu[m]> Got it, just wanted to be sure of that!
08:39:49 <strcat> that way they can keep data at rest when the device is locked
08:39:58 <strcat> even without requiring you to have another passphrase for the app, etc.
08:40:15 <strcat> but yes, normally, apps don't do that, and data doesn't become at rest until you end the login session or reboot

14:05:44 <ayaen_t[m]> woodenmo: this is helpful https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user
14:35:37 <RookieGuy> Do we ask questions here?
14:36:04 <ayaen_t[m]> about grapheneOS ? sure .
14:36:17 <RookieGuy> ok good
14:39:05 <RookieGuy> So I reached the final step where I run the flash-all script or write the flash-all.bat command but when I did that it said "waiting for any device" and my phone's (Google Pixel 4a) screen turned off and no download started for it and my phone won't turn on and I can't bring up fastboot mode either
14:40:09 <RookieGuy> (according to the cmd prompt no download started)
14:47:34 <RookieGuy> I'm just concerned if my device is still functional and would like to know if I can and maybe how I can go about bringing it back so it is operational for me to finish the process of installing GrapheneOS so that I may use it as my daily driver
14:50:24 <ayaen_t[m]> what does the device show on the screen?
14:50:48 <RookieGuy> Nothing
14:50:58 <ayaen_t[m]> did you follow the prescribed way to obtain platform tools?
14:51:05 <RookieGuy> yes
14:51:30 <RookieGuy> I even downloaded the whole android studio program for it
14:51:39 <ayaen_t[m]> oh boy!
14:51:46 <ayaen_t[m]> unnecesary
14:52:08 <ayaen_t[m]> android studio has fastboot and adb unnecesary complication
14:52:37 <ayaen_t[m]> you shouldve done this https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
14:52:41 <ayaen_t[m]> just this
14:54:24 <RookieGuy> I mainly got it for backing up my data and downloading a driver update because I was unable to unlock the bootloader without it
14:54:35 <ayaen_t[m]> * android studio has its own fastboot and adb and thja is an  unnecesary complication
14:55:32 <RookieGuy> I agree with it was useless backing my stuff up because I was able to do that with just to sdk tools
14:56:27 <RookieGuy> but I did focus on the platforms tools the only thing I did with it was updating the driver for my phone because was unable to unlock the bottloader before I did that
14:56:42 <nscnt> RookieGuy: I don't think you broke your phone in any way, but I can't comprehend what happened there. You should definitely be able to turn the device on and off etc.
14:57:41 <RookieGuy> nscnt that's reasuring but I can't turn it on
14:57:49 <eqex[m]> Hi everyone, so i have installed gos on my pixel 4a and i cant recieve sms, i have followed tip from unoficial wiki https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Common-problems , but that didnt resolve the isssue
14:58:58 <nscnt> RookieGuy: Pressing the power button/volume up/volume down doesn't do anything?
14:59:00 <ayaen_t[m]> thats weird.
15:00:00 <ayaen_t[m]> so what did you do to put your device in fastboot mode?
15:00:43 <marahelm[m]> I just pressed power on and volume down at the same time..
15:01:18 <RookieGuy> I tried something related to those actions several times the only thing that seems to do anything is when I hold the power button while connected to the computer I hear the windows sound of the device unconnecting followed by connecting it's as if my device is on but functionless
15:01:41 <ayaen_t[m]> power button +vol down?
15:02:02 <RookieGuy> I put my device into fastboot mode with the volume+power buttons and the adb reboot bootloader command
15:02:33 <ayaen_t[m]> that adb command wasnt necessary
15:02:44 <RookieGuy> I tried the power button + vol down and doesn't work
15:03:10 <marahelm[m]> Lookup online if someone else had same problem
15:03:43 <RookieGuy> I've tried to nothing so far do you have any suggestions for what I could search
15:03:44 <RookieGuy> ?
15:04:36 <marahelm[m]> "Pixel fastboot not working"
15:04:42 <ayaen_t[m]> RookieGuy: did you run the flashall.bat command? then it doesnt show anything right?
15:05:34 <RookieGuy> I ran the script after I pasted everything for graphene into the platform tools folder
15:05:48 <user73629[m]> Hey, not to derail the current discussion, does anyone know why memory management has been seemingly so terrible since Android base updated to 11? Prior to 11, if an app ran out of memory, it seemed it would always be only that app which would crash, and you could always exit, ect.
15:05:48 <user73629[m]> But now, it seems when an app such as Reddit runs out of memory, the whole system freezes completely, and the memory manager chooses to solve the problem not by closing the offending app or unused background tasks, but by killing your background notification systems from other apps. Anyone know what changed?
15:06:44 <ayaen_t[m]> RookieGuy: have you ever tried bringing up the fastboot mode before you tried flashing?
15:07:06 <RookieGuy> Yes I have
15:07:17 <ayaen_t[m]> aaand?....
15:07:46 <RookieGuy> What I did when I did oh I was trying unlock the bootloader
15:08:41 <ayaen_t[m]> RookieGuy: i dont understand.
15:09:23 <nscnt> RookieGuy: You shouldn't be in the platform-tools-folder if that's what you meant you did
15:09:50 <RookieGuy> I brought it up before multiple times in fastboot mode to unlock the bootloader
15:10:25 <ayaen_t[m]> were you in platdorm tools directory when you did flash-all
15:10:43 <RookieGuy> I had to update my driver because the fastboot flashing unlock command was registering for my phone
15:10:47 <RookieGuy> until I did that
15:11:13 <marahelm[m]> user73629: I see nobody gave you answer but dont know either..
15:11:22 <nscnt> RookieGuy: Are you on Windows 10?
15:11:27 <RookieGuy> yes I am
15:11:41 <user73629[m]> Are you experiencing it too marahelm ?
15:12:24 <ayaen_t[m]> RookieGuy: what directory were you in when you did.flash-all.bat
15:13:16 <RookieGuy> in the cmd prompt?
15:13:22 <nscnt> RookieGuy: Does your phone give you feedback again? I.e. Are you able to boot into the bootloader interface again?
15:13:28 <marahelm[m]> user73629: No because I only have 3 apps and dont do much on phone so cant run out of memory/space
15:13:40 <RookieGuy> nscnt no I cannot
15:13:47 <user73629[m]> F
15:13:54 <marahelm[m]> Sorry :(
15:13:55 <ayaen_t[m]> RookieGuy: yes in the cmd but wait/are you uaing cmd or powershell ?
15:15:00 <nscnt> ayaen_t[m]: Yes, he probably was in the wrong directory and the flash command didn't even work. But it doesn't matter as his phone doesn't give him feedback right now
15:15:13 <ayaen_t[m]> oh.
15:15:19 <nscnt> He first needs to figure that out
15:15:25 <RookieGuy> I used cmd for this I know PowerShell was recommended but I the tutorials used cmd No I wasn't in "platdorm tools directory when I did flash-all" I don't have anything like that in the platform tools folder
15:15:45 <nscnt> RookieGuy: Do not follow any tutorial
15:15:51 <RookieGuy> sorry oh?
15:15:52 <ayaen_t[m]> ok.
15:15:53 <nscnt> RookieGuy: Only use https://grapheneos.org/install
15:16:20 <nscnt> RookieGuy: If you've figured out your problem with your phone directly, just start over and follow closely. E.g. using PowerShell
15:16:31 <RookieGuy> I did use that and the tutorials
15:16:38 <RookieGuy> ok
15:16:41 <nscnt> RookieGuy: Do not follow any tutorials
15:16:46 <RookieGuy> ok
15:18:05 <nscnt> RookieGuy: PowerShell is needed to run the script. As you just saw, the tutorial caused unnecessary issues for you
15:18:15 <marahelm[m]> Would say that the official installing guide is kinda "messy" but cant because this room is communistic and will get kicked if you say something against the project
15:18:51 <RookieGuy> I don't think me not using PowerShell is was caused the problem
15:19:03 <nscnt> If you are saying it this way, probably. You could just have left out all the following words and it would be okay
15:19:31 <marahelm[m]> :D
15:19:33 <nscnt> RookieGuy: Yes, because you didn't even got to that point. But it wouldn't have worked
15:19:42 <ayaen_t[m]> marahelm: u are not helping
15:20:23 <nscnt> RookieGuy: Figure out what's wrong with your phone first. Don't even mess with anything else before
15:20:38 <nscnt> RookieGuy: Is it out of battery or something?
15:20:45 <RookieGuy> no
15:21:42 <nscnt> No command should have changed anything of the ability of booting your phone or similar. Just your bootloader is unlocked (if you got that already, not sure if you mentioned)
15:22:04 <RookieGuy> my bootloader was unlocked I can confirm
15:24:44 <RookieGuy> if I was stuck in fastboot mode would the screen for it be on display?
15:26:07 <RookieGuy> *The fastboot interface
15:26:31 <nscnt> *Bootloader interface? Not sure. Even if it gets blank after a while, pressing buttons should probably light it up again
15:27:56 <ayaen_t[m]> fastboot devices should give yoj some output
15:28:50 <ayaen_t[m]> and if youre confident that the windws drivers are ok then maybe we can rule out that device is even jn fastboot mode
15:29:04 <RookieGuy> yeah my screen's completely blank no bootloader interface
15:29:40 <ayaen_t[m]> what does fastboot devices -l give you?
15:29:54 <nscnt> RookieGuy: I don't know how I could assist you with this problem, sorry
15:30:10 <RookieGuy> ayaen_t[m] the adb command?
15:30:23 <ayaen_t[m]> no fastboot one
15:30:43 <RookieGuy> nscnt it's ok it's a very specific and odd problem I experiencing
15:30:54 <RookieGuy> ok
15:30:56 <ayaen_t[m]> sorry just type fastboot devices
15:31:01 <RookieGuy> ok
15:32:03 <RookieGuy> fastboot devices didn't do anything
15:32:06 <ayaen_t[m]> if it doesnt show device info somethings wrong on device end or the windows end
15:32:29 <nscnt> I wouldn't even proceed with anything but figuring out what's up with the phone itself
15:32:45 <ayaen_t[m]> have you used this setup of fastboot command succesfully
15:32:48 <ayaen_t[m]> before
15:33:03 <RookieGuy> yes I was able to unlock the bootloader with it
15:33:24 <RookieGuy> nscnt that is what I'm trying to do
15:33:40 <ayaen_t[m]> RookieGuy: then mostly device is not in fastboot mode
15:33:45 <RookieGuy> yea
15:34:21 <RookieGuy> I did use the "adb devices" command and that did try to bring up my device it's no listing any devices
15:35:08 <RookieGuy> *not listing my device because of the obvious problem I did do that before when it was on (normally)
15:35:20 <RookieGuy> *it did do that before
15:35:41 <ayaen_t[m]> RookieGuy: that works only when  adb server is runing on device
15:35:44 <nscnt> This command is not needed anyway. Do not follow any tutorial
15:36:23 <ayaen_t[m]> is there anyway he xould drain the battery?
15:36:33 <RookieGuy> hmmm
15:36:49 <RookieGuy> could I remove the battery?
15:38:42 <ayaen_t[m]> dont think so . and as nscnt sahs dknt try anything crazy im sure you know better.
15:38:53 <ayaen_t[m]> * dont think so . and as nscnt says dont try anything crazy im sure you know better.
15:39:29 <RookieGuy> trust me I've got no room to at this moment
15:39:50 <ayaen_t[m]> kay.
15:39:54 <RookieGuy> ok I won't try that
15:40:16 <ayaen_t[m]> wont try what?
15:40:25 <RookieGuy> removing the battery
15:40:37 <ayaen_t[m]> k
15:41:11 <RookieGuy> Well... any suggestions for what I should do now?
15:42:13 <ayaen_t[m]> https://support.google.com/pixelphone ..... quiet lame on my part but better than any further messing...
15:42:47 <whatisthematrix[> <RookieGuy "I did use the "adb devices" comm"> So might be bad advice. I had to run the command as root user to see devices.
15:42:51 <whatisthematrix[> Had no issues after thsy
15:43:46 <RookieGuy> ok I'll see I can bounce something off of that
15:43:58 <ayaen_t[m]> oh yeah ... you coukd try fastboot devixes as admin
15:44:08 <nscnt> He's on Windows
15:44:13 <nscnt> There's no need for that
15:44:21 <ayaen_t[m]> ok
15:45:59 <RookieGuy> oh is that why fastboot device doesn't do anything for me? Sorry I guess I should've made that I'm on windows more clear
15:46:00 <nscnt> It doesn't make sense trying to hack through with typing whatever commands if the phone itself is nonresponsive from the beginning
15:46:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> RookieGuy: install the Google usb driver
15:46:38 <RookieGuy> i did
15:47:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> System restore to remove it then
15:48:33 <RookieGuy> my problem is with the final step where I run the flash-all script or write the flash-all.bat command but when I did that it said "waiting for any device" and my phone's (Google Pixel 4a) screen turned off and no download started for it and my phone won't turn on and I can't bring up fastboot mode either (according to the cmd prompt no download
15:48:34 <RookieGuy> started)
15:58:21 <nscnt> You can easily restart the process of flashing (while only using the official guide), but I don't know what happened with the phone getting blank and nonresponsive
16:06:18 <RookieGuy> :(
16:07:01 <ayaen_t[m]> hey RookieGuy  try https://support.google.com/pixelphone
16:07:13 <RookieGuy> that's what I'm doin
16:07:29 <ayaen_t[m]> all the best .
16:08:18 <ayaen_t[m]> youll get it to work , dont worry
16:09:09 <ayaen_t[m]> but just try plugging it and charging and then try restarting...
16:09:31 <ayaen_t[m]> if you havent already put it on charging.
16:15:17 <RookieGuy> I contacted their support they told me to consider warranty as soon I told them I couldn't bring up the bootloader interface
16:15:18 <RookieGuy> :(
16:17:07 <ayaen_t[m]> (lame advice) tried putting on charging and checking power button?
16:18:56 <ayaen_t[m]> im sure you tried it , just check once more.
16:19:16 <ayaen_t[m]> * im sure you tried it , just checking....in case
16:21:55 <RookieGuy> Yep I tried it
16:29:06 <RookieGuy> *didn't work
16:29:56 <marahelm[m]> Is there easier/faster way switching between profiles/Users?
16:33:44 <nscnt> marahelm[m]: Swipe down (twice) to show the Quick settings menu. There is an icon for Users & guests
16:35:32 <marahelm[m]> Thanks
16:36:48 <RookieGuy> Welp they weren't able to help me fix my issue
16:37:07 <RookieGuy> but I got a full understanding of my warranty options
16:37:59 <ayaen_t[m]> alright so do you get to exchange?
16:38:27 <RookieGuy> replace, fix, or something
16:39:21 <RookieGuy> Anyways thanks everyone trying to help me sorry that In won't be joining the graphene family as soon as I thought
16:40:30 <RookieGuy> Next time I try again I will for sure be here at least and I will try to fall as much of the install guide on the official graphene guide
16:41:19 <ayaen_t[m]> RookieGuy: sure we all look forward to you coming back
16:41:40 <RookieGuy> thank you see you hopefully soon
16:45:31 <ayaen_t[m]> sad for him.
16:49:23 <brenneke[m]> <thestranger "I still want the admin profile t"> But wouldn't someone trained (border agent etc.) know to look for multiple users?
16:53:13 <ayaen_t[m]> brenneke: any user of modern android devices savvy enough , could.
16:55:10 <Liakdeuser[m]> Getting a little off topic there, threat models better redirected at #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
16:55:51 <ayaen_t[m]> Lia (kde user): sure sorry
16:56:22 <Liakdeuser[m]> Nah, it's cool, just a desirable redirection
17:56:29 <pixelfan[m]> Hi everyone, thanks for the work you are doing! Can i ask if someone know if is possible to install grapheneos through a pixelbook? (I guess no cause VM?) or there is a way? thank you a lot for the help
18:00:37 <ayaen_t[m]> pixelfan: you are best off following the official guide.
18:00:38 <ayaen_t[m]> Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited memory and storage space.
18:00:44 <louipc> maybe.. but it's not supported
18:01:18 <ayaen_t[m]> * pixelfan: you are best off following the official guide.
18:01:18 <ayaen_t[m]> 'Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited memory and storage space.'
18:02:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> pixelfan: if you can get fastboot devices to show up on thew pixelbook, maybe
18:02:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> \
18:02:22 <anupritaisno1[m]>  * pixelfan: if you can get fastboot devices to show the device on the pixelbook, maybe
18:02:30 <pixelfan[m]> ty take, yes i read the faq i ask for that, if someone know a way :P
18:03:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> pm me if you manage to get adb and fastrboot to see the device
18:03:23 <pixelfan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "pm me if you manage to get adb a"> will try, ty a lot
18:03:28 <anupritaisno1[m]>  * pm me if you manage to get adb and fastboot to see the device
18:04:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> just know that you are doing something unsupported so don't really expect developer support
18:05:04 <pixelfan[m]> yes,ty. i only ask, maybe someone try it before me, never know :P
18:05:59 <ayaen_t[m]> pixelfan:  have some fun!
18:11:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> pixelfan: just remember that if there are problems later on you have used an unofficial install method, even if a developer wrote it for you
18:12:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> So you do accept the risks
18:13:04 <Cann0n> Risky
18:18:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Cann0n: it's not like he's going to end up with a dead device
18:20:33 <ayaen_t[m]> just might have to reflash
18:36:24 <organicpumpkin[m> <pixelfan[m] "Hi everyone, thanks for the work"> Shouldn't installing through crostini work? Let me check.
19:02:15 <dar_gomml[m]> are there any known problems with adaptive brightness on 4a? i often have to readjust manually brightness seems not to change even if i am in complete darkness.
19:12:59 <nscnt> dar_gomml[m]: My Pixel 3a doesn't turn it down to the fullest in total darkness and I need to adjust it manually as well if I don't wanna be blinded. Not sure if that's just how adaptive brightness handles it
19:40:10 <malicoye[m]> Adaptive brightness has always been crap for me on all Androids. I don't understand how apple can do better even in such a tiny but highly useful feature
19:40:59 <LinusSexTips[m]> nscnt: same thing happens to me 3aXL, pitch black in my room and adaptive brightness still only brings it down to about 15%
19:41:47 <LinusSexTips[m]>  * nscnt: same thing happens to me with my 3aXL, pitch black in my room and adaptive brightness still only brings it down to about 15%
19:48:48 <brenneke[m]> Does adaptive brightness not learn over time from your manual corrections?
20:04:55 <Cann0n> Ya same here
20:05:53 <Cann0n> Any one else close one eye while in the dark to preserve their night vision?
20:06:29 <Cann0n> Pirates used eye patches specifically because it was dark down in the hull
20:06:48 <marahelm[m]> Seems off topic
20:08:38 <dar_gomml[m]> <brenneke[m] "Does adaptive brightness not lea"> if it does, it is quite a slow learner 😀
20:12:21 <nscnt> I have the feeling it never goes under 15 % and over 85 % automatically (even if "learned")
20:22:10 <LinusSexTips[m]> <brenneke[m] "Does adaptive brightness not lea"> No, I change it manually almost every day when I get up in the morning
20:44:37 <dakotah[m]> I think it learning is a google service
20:48:44 <casaouuii[m]> Guys, when u need whatsapp
20:49:01 <casaouuii[m]> Is it better to use it in isolated profile on grapheneos
20:49:09 <casaouuii[m]> Or something like shelters
20:49:17 <casaouuii[m]> Apps with a lot of trackers and google maps also ?
20:49:22 <casaouuii[m]> For full privacy ?
20:53:55 <jpds> casaouuii[m]: Profiles are the recommended way to separate things on graphene
21:08:35 <Cann0n> How do you set up profile?
21:11:40 <jpds> Cann0n: Simply create a new user in the settings
21:13:09 <Cann0n> Is there a specific place I can find that?
21:13:58 <jpds> Type: "users" into the settings searxg
21:17:28 <Cann0n> Ah. Users. Not actual profiles
21:32:15 <LinusSexTips[m]> you can also do it from the quick settings/tiles UI
21:38:13 <the5000[m]> Is it best to use Android 11 with graphene?
21:38:21 <the5000[m]> I still have Android 10
21:39:35 <nscnt> the5000[m]: It is always best to be up to date
21:45:14 <the5000[m]> So get Android 11 then
21:50:28 <hazel[m]> you should update your phone to the latest version of android before flashing graphene
22:02:44 <the5000[m]> Okay so get Android 11 then flash graphene I have a pixel 3
23:13:20 <sb13x[m]> casaouuii: if you want prompt notifications then you need to use shelter/work profile, if you don't then use an alternate profile as you need to be in a profile to receive the notifications.
