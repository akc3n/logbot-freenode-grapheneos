00:33:52 <bseeinu[m]> Does anyone use/know a solution to set battery Charging limit, to extend the battery lifespan?
00:34:03 <strcat> does it automatically by itself
00:34:11 <strcat> and throttles charging as it approaches 100%
00:34:13 <strcat> to a super slow rate
00:34:25 <JTL> What's the point of limiting the charging manually?
00:34:35 <bseeinu[m]> Fantastic, thanks
00:34:43 <bseeinu[m]> None since it already does
00:34:50 <JTL> ah right
00:34:56 <strcat> you'll notice going 20%-80% is super fast
00:35:02 <strcat> and then it gets slower as it approaches '100%'
00:35:10 <strcat> and '100%' doesn't mean 'max rated capacity of battery' really anyway
00:35:18 <bseeinu[m]> Well, possibly limiting to 90% maybe it would? Sony's android Walkman devices offer that option
00:35:27 <lg[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "Is there a way to confirm thats "> If you are on Ubuntu, you can keep something like activity monitor open while compiling to see what is happening with your resources.
00:41:07 <bseeinu[m]> They have a toggle called "Battery care" that limits charging to 90%.
00:42:20 <bseeinu[m]> Which apparently is also on some Xperia phones
00:55:30 <brenneke[m]> <strcat "and throttles charging as it app"> Is that a GrapheneOS feature or Android?
00:56:39 <strcat> device-specific
01:17:43 <aeonsolution[m]> Hey lg, on Manjaro I used GParted to watch the memory run out. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction yesterday!
01:18:02 <aeonsolution[m]> Very appreciated.
01:20:36 <strcat[m]> gparted is storage though
01:21:05 <aeonsolution[m]> I kept refreshing and watching the unused swap go down until it ran out
01:21:30 <aeonsolution[m]> not the most efficient way to check
01:22:01 <aeonsolution[m]> but i confirmed that's what was the issue
01:22:17 <strcat[m]> in a terminal, run `watch free -m`
01:23:02 <aeonsolution[m]> Will do
01:23:54 <strcat[m]> or `watch cat /proc/meminfo` if you really want an information overload
01:33:25 <brenneke[m]> <strcat "device-specific"> Is this the case for Pixel 2 XL then also?
01:37:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> bseeinu: said feature is pretty stupid
01:38:07 <strcat[m]> brenneke: yes
01:38:10 <strcat[m]> it might be more aggressive on newer devices
01:38:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> And implementing it properly means changing significant parts of android
01:38:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember that android sets off most maintenance operations only at 100%
01:38:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'd not only have to add a limit you'd need to also modify code to make sure maintenance isn't skipped
01:39:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise stuff like f2fs gc will cause issues
01:39:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is way simpler to just let your phone charge to 100%
01:41:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> (Not to add the claims that charging to 90% extend battery life seem unfounded)
01:41:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): btw what's wrong with unlp
01:51:42 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: doesn't meet our privacy/security expectations and is way too bloated
01:52:13 <strcat> we want a simple, minimal implementation that's not arbitrarily extensible with third party apps, etc.
01:52:27 <strcat> and without assorted security issues that I identified in that
01:52:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh
01:52:32 <strcat> just not going to bundle it
01:52:43 <strcat> and geocoding should be a separate app
01:52:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> What kind?
01:52:55 <strcat> and any remote services should be optional / off-by-default
01:53:02 <strcat> but I'd rather just use local databases
01:53:08 <strcat> including for geocoding
04:23:42 <miniblue[m]> GrapheneOS is not flashy enough for me. Where are the security sliders? Where's the branding? Has strcat ever said "privacy, redefined" or "we take the privacy of our customers very seriously"? No? Didn't think so. Ever heard of Firefox? Now that's the shit, everyone. Firefox has everything. I mean, toggles! Sliders! Get your shit together people.
04:24:38 <rgeturk[m]> lol
04:24:42 <strcat[m]> a long time ago there was actually a security slider but I wrote a new hardened_malloc where all those security features and more could just be enabled by default with better performance
04:28:17 <aeonsolution[m]> Hey strcat, I finished building the kernel and setting up the OS environment. I'm lost on what to do next.
04:28:45 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: https://grapheneos.org/build#extracting-vendor-files-for-pixel-devices
04:28:54 <miniblue[m]> See? There you go.
04:29:09 <aeonsolution[m]> Thanks strcat!
04:29:11 <miniblue[m]> :P
04:31:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> miniblue: Firefox also has a really shit sandbox
04:31:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Should grapheneos do that too?
04:31:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: what you need help with?
04:31:20 <aeonsolution[m]> Hey if there is someone that uses the Pixel 3a and has done some of this already, I'd love to collaborate with you!

04:31:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: just tell me what you need help with
04:32:21 <aeonsolution[m]> I'm trying to figure out the workflow. Right now, I'm building graphene-10 for testing
04:32:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> So where exactly do you need help
04:34:08 <miniblue[m]> anupritaisno1: ?
04:34:08 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat pointed me to the next step so I think I'm good right now unless I get stuck and wanted to signal to people that have worked on this that'd I would like to get to know them and work on this
04:34:45 <miniblue[m]> What is this... sandbox you speak of?
04:34:45 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: I appreciate the help!
04:38:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "anupritaisno1: I appreciate the "> If you need a reference for building the kernel
04:38:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: what kernel version is yours on?
04:40:07 <miniblue[m]> Daniel made me switch to Ungoogled Chromium awhile back on desktop out of fear. While I don't like the stranglehold that Google has on the market it's definitely more secure then Firefox and, at this point, a lot less bloated.
04:40:25 <miniblue[m]> Mozilla is a shitty company at this point.
04:40:28 <aeonsolution[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "aeonsolution: what kernel versio"> anupritaisno1: is there an easy way to check, I'm just following the instructions; I still haven't got all the information loaded in my head yet

04:40:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Note that you can use all llvm tools except for the assembler

05:02:53 <JTL> Security slider in the context of malloc implementation, or other things as well?
05:03:20 <strcat[m]> it only impacted malloc but it was generic
05:03:25 <strcat[m]> performance vs. security slider
05:03:30 <JTL> right
05:03:37 <JTL> Assumed as much
05:15:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): I think
05:15:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> It can be reimplemented
05:15:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why not use it to configure kernel lockdown mode?
05:16:00 <strcat[m]> what does that have to do with it?
05:16:13 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: we don't need that, SELinux provides everything and more
05:16:22 <strcat[m]> and I don't know what a slider has to do with it
05:18:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just a shot in the dark
05:45:20 <AnotherHacker> I have a stupid question, because this is a security OS, there was discussion yesterday about which apps have clipboard access in Android 10, particularly that they need to to be active and focused.
05:46:22 <AnotherHacker> >cdesai>foreground services need to have a notification, so you'll be able to see those too, unless you've hidden the notification
05:47:54 <AnotherHacker> So would running a "live backdrop" like 4D backdrop, which needs to run an active service to work, be a very very bad idea for security and privacy
05:53:31 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. Hey guys, I'm trying to fetch --nohooks android at this moment to fetch the Chromium sources and finding that fetch seems to be hanging. Do I need to force it to use Python3?
05:55:22 <JTL> uh TheJollyRoger
05:55:25 <JTL> Let me check my setup later
05:55:58 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: If i remmber right it did appear to be stuck for quite awhile, but it seemed to be doing something judging by CPU usage
05:56:09 <TheJollyRoger> Oh!
05:56:11 <TheJollyRoger> OKay!
05:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
05:56:27 <TheJollyRoger> Right now I'm uh... tormenting my poor connection and my poor ryzen box.
05:56:43 <JTL> Still faster then my systems
05:56:55 <JTL> (well my connection is better then yours, but I'll get a new workstation eventaully(tm))
05:57:16 <TheJollyRoger> Right now my ryzen is looking at my T2 and going "WHY THE HELL AREN'T YOU DOING ANY WORK" and my T2 is going "Why the hell are you getting all MY work?!"
05:57:21 <TheJollyRoger> X3.
05:57:28 <JTL> Ahahaha
05:58:35 <TheJollyRoger> It's a very bizarre day when I'm using the T2 for playing Xonotic and the Ryzen for... building
05:59:36 <JTL> :D
06:18:59 <TheJollyRoger> `top` is showing something like twenty instances of curl and git.
06:19:36 <JTL> Sounds like it's working
06:20:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe well... I'm also running repo sync for the GrapheneOS manifest... I'm redownloading the source (or tryingto) and I'm going to try to see if I can follow aeonsolution[m] in getting it built again!
06:47:27 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: You know where to find me
06:47:55 <JTL> Starting a Vanadium build before I sleep, than AOSP when I wake up
06:49:21 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Thanks man, I'm downloading the source now.
06:54:12 <AnotherHacker>  Approx what is the build time for Vandium and GrapheneOS ?
06:56:15 <JTL> 6 hours to build GrapheneOS on Skylake era quad core Xeon based server
06:56:26 <JTL> Also about that much for Vanadium I think
06:56:40 <JTL> Hopefully I'll get a better workstation/server in the near future
06:59:25 <TheJollyRoger> Hi AnotherHacker, not counting the time it takes to download the source code, it takes me around 2-1/2 hours to build the operating system and kernel on a Ryzen 2600X with 32GB of RAM and 3-1/2 hours to build Vanadium.
07:00:04 <JTL> Yes, Vanadium was longer for me too
07:00:14 <TheJollyRoger> Downloading the source code is the bigger probelm for me, since I have to write the TCP request on a parchment paper, wait until the crew empty one of the rum barrels, then put the TCP request in a barrel and put that over the side of the ship.
07:00:33 <JTL> At least you don't live in Australia
07:00:50 <JTL> It's that plus a kangaroo by ship
07:00:59 <TheJollyRoger> Then I have to wait until it washes up on the shore of Mexico, where someone will hopefully recognize its significance, and then transcribe the request...
07:01:02 <TheJollyRoger> OH GOOD GRAVY
07:01:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yes IP over Message in a Bottle is definitely faster than IP over Kangaroo!
07:04:35 <zoraver[m]> Offtopic, but Lineage's infrastructure was compromised earlier today
07:04:53 <TheJollyRoger> Hey zoraver[m] woah. What happened...?
07:05:08 <JTL> zoraver[m]: I wouldn't say offotpic, as it relates to Android and security
07:05:17 <JTL> I'm sure TheJollyRoger could agree with that reasoning in a way
07:05:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah I'd say so too!
07:05:37 <AnotherHacker> 🤣
07:05:51 <zoraver[m]> https://status.lineageos.org/
07:06:55 <JTL> Oops, they didn't patch saltstack
07:07:03 <JTL> Oops
07:07:21 <TheJollyRoger> Well at least no signing keys were compromised.
07:07:35 <JTL> They say
07:07:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... we hope...
07:08:06 <TheJollyRoger> Cripes man. Now I want to include complimentary smartcards in every debugging cable I send.
07:08:21 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah.
07:08:35 <JTL> https://www.zdnet.com/article/saltstack-salt-critical-bugs-allow-data-center-cloud-server-hijacking-as-root/
07:09:06 <JTL> > By April 23, the developers alerted community members (.PDF) to an incoming patch and urged users to make sure their Salt masters were not exposed to the Internet. Fixes for the critical flaws, published in software versions 2019.2.4 and 3000.2, were released on April 29.
07:09:11 <JTL> Should've listened to the warning :|
07:09:21 <JTL> I heard about this earlier
07:10:03 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow. I did not even hear about this.
07:15:41 <JTL> https://labs.f-secure.com/advisories/saltstack-authorization-bypass
07:21:02 <TheJollyRoger> Holy shit.
07:21:43 <JTL> What's funny is they changed their Python crypto libraries before annoucing this and someone was speculating that was related, but that's not mentioned in the article
07:21:57 <JTL> Doesn't seem to be, but I'll look through the commits later
07:24:11 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Only a few days ago.
07:24:35 <TheJollyRoger> How much time does it take to backport a security fix, I wonder?
07:24:50 <TheJollyRoger> I'm asking this as a rhetorical question because I'm now thinking about Debian.
07:25:49 <JTL> I haven't looked into Debian and saltstack lol
07:26:01 <JTL> The answer there is "A round tuit"
07:27:39 * TheJollyRoger now imagines the Debian developers bailing out the ship while they're up to their necks.
07:27:55 <TheJollyRoger> And like, their buckets are not even getting above the surface of the water.
07:30:02 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows
07:32:22 <zoraver[m]> If I am reading the Debian changelog correctly, salt hasn't been updated in stable for a bit less than a year
07:32:30 <JTL> Jesus fuck

07:33:12 * TheJollyRoger suddenly turns green, has his cheeks bulge, and he runs for the railing.
07:35:08 <TheJollyRoger> My chatting VM is running Bullseye because I just needed something that worked and worked fast... I'm gonna try to get void to run again in a bit. Cripes. Aaargh seems like I can barely stay on top of things for my own systems at times.
07:35:23 <TheJollyRoger> I relapsed :(
07:35:29 <TheJollyRoger> Relapsed into Debianism :(
07:35:38 <TheJollyRoger> Which goes hand in hand with alcoholism.
07:36:02 <zoraver[m]> It looks like it is fixed on Bullseye
07:36:16 <TheJollyRoger> OH THANK GOODNESS
07:38:24 <TheJollyRoger> Well... I have to go drink myself into unconsciousne-- I mean catch some sleep.

12:01:19 <Cyrinux[m]>  * Hi folks, do you know a way to got several profile like "work" ? I mean, a true profile is complicated to use, if i want only to jail an IM for example
12:05:13 <seaclown> Settings - system - advanced - multiple users
12:23:06 <mischling[m]> or get shelter from fdroid and activate the work profile side by side without needing to switch
12:30:14 <Cyrinux[m]> with multiple user we need to switch user, and configure the full profile, its slow, ok, very splitted, but i search a mix of this
12:30:15 <Cyrinux[m]> i understand this doesnt exists sadly
12:38:15 <seaclown> Try shelter as mischling suggested

16:07:10 <cx2[m]> With regard to attempting to help here, which would be the right choice... Promise I will quit asking. haha
16:07:10 <cx2[m]> Manjaro or Fedora?
16:07:26 <aeonsolution[m]> there is no right choice I'm afraid
16:07:28 <nscnt> cx2[m]: If you want to help here, no doubt Fedora.
16:07:40 <cx2[m]> Done
16:08:12 <nscnt> The learning curve would be too much, in my opinion.
16:08:19 <nscnt> (If choosing Arch)
16:08:42 <nscnt> Don't know if Manjaro is "easier"
16:08:51 <cx2[m]> Any tips on "hardening" for Fedora? Prefer a link to point to so that I'm not hijacking the room
16:09:17 <cx2[m]> <nscnt "The learning curve would be too "> Agreed.... The first step: Know oneself and seek self improvement.
16:09:57 <nscnt> cx2[m]: I don't do "hardening", idk about it.
16:09:58 <Zenithium[m]> <nscnt "Don't know if Manjaro is "easier"> There's nothing "hard" about Manjaro, it's fully set up out-of-the-box
16:10:46 <aeonsolution[m]> <nscnt "Don't know if Manjaro is "easier"> The installer is similar to Fedora. Everything gets setup for you \o/ but for sure does not have as much support as Fedora
16:10:46 <nscnt> Zenithium[m]: Right, I forgot.
16:11:27 <aeonsolution[m]> but everything for Arch applies to Manjaro as far as I've seen
16:11:31 <aeonsolution[m]> so pros and cons
16:12:01 <cx2[m]> thanks for the help folks. Much appreciated. Fedora it is, will have it up in running here in a bit.
16:12:17 <cx2[m]> Think I should just swap out macOS for Fedora??
16:12:51 <aeonsolution[m]> thats up to you, a lot of software development is good in macOS if you have the specs for it
16:12:52 <nscnt> cx2[m]: What do you mean?

16:13:29 <nscnt> You meant installing Fedora on your Mac? lol
16:13:43 <cx2[m]> I have a few older macbooks..... replaced the OS on those with an Ubuntu flavored Distro..... works perfect.
16:14:36 <nickcalyx[m]> The macbook 2,1 can be flashed with coreboot
16:14:52 <cx2[m]> But the Linux REALLY hates the retina display.... .only a handful of distros supported it, at least from what I could tell. And especially on this new machine.... Ubuntu is one of the few that I would have expected to have no issues.... and at least in VM, it was trash.
16:16:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > But the Linux REALLY hates the retina display.... .only a handful of distros supported it
16:16:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Did Apple release Linux drivers for it? If not, you should be thankful someone did the reverse engineering work to support the closed source shit at all.
16:18:40 <cx2[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: I really wouldn't know. I would almost be certain that this machine would poor display with linux.... but my 2017 Worked with at least : Mint, Ubuntu, and Parrot
16:20:23 <cx2[m]> No matter the case, it's a windows machine that will be getting the Fedora makeover here in a second.
16:33:54 <brenneke[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Remember that android sets off m"> Is this true, the lesser of two evils is really to allow phone to charge to 100 percent?
16:39:26 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: it doesn't need special drivers
16:39:33 <strcat> it's just a HiDPI screen
16:39:49 <strcat> Apple took a really cheesy approach to HiDPI enabled by their control over hardware
16:44:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat "Apple took a really cheesy appro"> I was gonna say, they must have done somethin "special" to where it's not recognized as a normal display
16:45:02 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: it is treated as a normal display
16:45:21 <strcat> I use 27 inch 4k monitors which are 161 dpi
16:45:56 <strcat> it's a lot more than 96 dpi even though it's not retina
16:46:23 <strcat> and my laptop is an XPS 13 with a 4k screen
16:46:30 <strcat> which is definitely very high DPI
16:46:53 <strcat> and yes lots of windows and linux applications struggle to look good on it
16:47:25 <strcat> chromium works fine, gtk3 and qt5 apps work fine
16:47:32 <strcat> unless they screw it up
16:47:48 <strcat> the only gtk2 application I have is gimp and I use krita anyway
16:48:01 <strcat> gimp is so fucking terrible and I'd rather just remove it once krita can do a few more things
16:48:57 <strcat> the problem with gimp is it was made by reptilian aliens, not humans, so the UX is not designed for usage by humans
16:49:00 <strcat> similar to Git
16:49:49 <cdesai> lol
16:49:52 <madaidan[m]> Krita is so good
16:51:48 <strcat> yeah removing gimp and seeing if I can get by with just krita again
16:52:10 <strcat> goodbye gtk2 and.... luajit
16:52:11 <Zenithium[m]> I don't see much benefit to a 4K 13" screen, it just drains the battery unnecessarily
16:52:14 <Zenithium[m]> The XPS 13 is pretty nice though
16:52:25 <Zenithium[m]> strcat: Did you get the developer edition?
16:52:43 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: no because at the time it was behind by a year
16:52:51 <strcat> but I did get it on sale
16:54:24 <strcat>  /home/strcat/projects/openbsd-ports/books/grokking-the-gimp
16:54:35 <strcat> I literally have a book about gimp wasting space
16:54:40 <cx2[m]> <strcat "and yes lots of windows and linu"> just for knowledge sake, can you tell me the reasoning behind this? I have found myself a few times spending far too long trying to tweak Virtual Box, or a full install, only to find out that really the OS just has a hard time looking good on that display.
16:54:41 <strcat> was just deleting all the config files it left in ~
16:55:30 <strcat> cx2[m]: lack of high dpi support?
16:55:45 <strcat> so, traditionally, everything used hard-wired pixel amounts, fixed-size fonts and bitmap graphics
16:56:01 <strcat> everything would ideally be all vector design
16:56:05 <strcat> no pixel widths
16:56:41 <strcat> if there are units for lengths they should scale equally with everything else
16:57:02 <strcat> nowadays fixed size fonts are dead, essentially, and they look terrible on modern screens too
16:57:34 <cx2[m]> So it ISN'T a driver issue....just a general high dpi issue. Got it.
16:57:34 <cx2[m]> Good thing this windows machine is not one of those..... I don't think. Some giant MSI something or another..... bout to get Fedora jammed in side
16:57:50 <strcat> cx2[m]: apple approached high dpi support by making the screen 2x or 4x denser, etc.
16:58:00 <strcat> and then all legacy stuff can be rendered 2x or 4x bigger
16:58:03 <strcat> with no loss from scaling
16:58:19 <strcat> since 1 pixel just becomes 4 or 16
16:58:34 <strcat> and also they're good at forcing the whole ecosystem to update
16:58:45 <strcat> all their own hardware is high dpi
16:58:56 <strcat> for laptops
16:59:34 <strcat> and imacs now too I guess
16:59:40 <strcat> not quite as much
16:59:59 <strcat> cx2[m]: anyway on linux and windows there is no set of things you have to support
17:00:05 <strcat> the dpi is arbitrary
17:00:10 <strcat> and most devs don't have high dpi screens
17:00:34 <strcat> cx2[m]: also gtk2, X11, etc. don't have working high dpi support
17:00:38 <strcat> they just can't handle it right
17:00:43 <strcat> X11 can't handle screens with different DPIs
17:01:08 <strcat> cx2[m]: on android this all works fine since it was designed for it from the start, it has multi-monitor support with proper high dpi support etc
17:01:27 <strcat> see chromeos which uses an android container with android's free form window management turned on
17:01:38 <cx2[m]> <strcat "and most devs don't have high dp"> assuming because a large amount of work is done in bash?
17:02:18 <cx2[m]> <strcat "cx2: also gtk2, X11, etc. don't "> Oh good.... so my Gimp Download on this macbook pro 16" was not a great choice haha.
17:02:24 <cx2[m]> seemed to work ok the other day?
17:03:13 <cx2[m]> more of an on topic question.. So once I finish this fedora setup, I am going begin some CTS runs based off of TJR's guide.
17:03:13 <cx2[m]> I have a few handsets...... 3, 3a, 3XL, is it useful to the devs to just keep running and reporting?
17:03:22 <strcat[m]> cx2: gimp has tried to work around it, poorly
17:03:26 <strcat[m]> it doesn't work well though
17:03:59 <strcat[m]> the way it works on android is they defined a bunch of densities from the start, so all devices built to run it need to use one of those
17:04:07 <strcat[m]> and it can use those to support arbitrary hardware
17:04:17 <strcat[m]> a bit like apple's way but more flexible since it has more variants
17:04:28 <strcat[m]> and it encourages using vector graphics
17:05:32 <strcat[m]> the non-legacy launcher icon format is vector only afaik
17:08:55 <cx2[m]> Well, I'm realllly trying to stay away from having to snag another photoshop copy. Creative Cloud is such a fucking waste for folks like me that do a fiar amount of photo editing, but as a hobby, and not professionally
17:10:33 <strcat> just use krita?
17:10:57 <strcat> sucks a lot less than gimp as long as it supports what you're doing which it probably does
17:11:37 <strcat> gimp is just ALIEN
17:13:06 <nscnt> GIMP is fine in imo
17:15:57 <madaidan[m]> <nscnt "GIMP is fine in imo"> Ding dong your opinion is wrong
17:16:06 <nscnt> ;(
17:17:27 <strcat> if you introduce anyone to both krita and gimp at the same time
17:17:42 <strcat> any human is going to pick krita and won't understand gimp's way of doing things
17:18:00 <strcat> it takes ages of dealing with it to have your mind broken and reshaped into a gimped one
17:18:40 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "any human is going to pick krita"> Except masochists
17:18:44 <cx2[m]> hahaha..... point taken... i'll give Krita a shot. Does it have Wacom Tablet support?
17:18:46 <strcat> of course if you're the right species of reptilian alien gimp is designed for then maybe it works well from the start
17:18:49 <strcat> cx2[m]: tes
17:19:07 <strcat> cx2[m]: it's a digital painting app first, really, editing second, but it's way easier to use for editing than gimp anyway
17:20:01 <strcat> if you want a bunch of silly filters install gmic's krita plugin
17:20:04 <strcat> since it doesn't come with that many
17:20:18 <cx2[m]> Ill give it a whirl.... do you still get things like the pen tool / paths?
17:20:21 <cx2[m]> Eh,....you dont' need to answer, i'll figure it out
17:20:40 <strcat> cx2[m]: yes you can draw paths / curves
17:20:42 <strcat> it's better at that
17:20:55 <strcat> the ONLY thing it wasn't good at was fonts but I think that's resolved and it's probably better at that too now
17:21:05 <cx2[m]> awesome! added to the list.
17:21:11 <strcat> cx2[m]: https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/tools.html
17:21:29 <strcat> cx2[m]: it has far better wacom support
17:21:34 <strcat> and paint brush support
17:22:14 <strcat> cx2[m]: krita's focus is digital painting and it's extremely good at that
17:22:27 <strcat> so brushes, tablet support, etc. is all far better than gimp, night and day
17:22:38 <strcat> but in general it's better at editing, etc. too as long as it has what you want and it probably does
17:22:44 <strcat> way more intuitive and sane
17:22:52 <strcat> gimp is a waste of time struggling with the stupidity of how it's designed
17:23:09 <cx2[m]> Custom brushes as well? It's starting to sound like Krita is to Gimp as Gimp is to PS
17:23:20 <strcat> cx2[m]: yes it has really good paint brushes
17:24:03 <strcat> cx2[m]: glance at a video of someone using it
17:24:13 <cx2[m]> yeah i'm definitely going to snag it up and give it a shot.
17:24:23 <cx2[m]> already on it.
17:24:39 <strcat> cx2[m]: https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/brushes/brush_settings/tablet_sensors.html
17:24:49 <strcat> it's designed for painting with a stylus that has pressure and angle sensors
17:24:54 <Zenithium[m]> My impression was always that GIMP is better for photo editing and Krita is better for drawing
17:24:55 <strcat> it's the core functionality
17:25:03 <strcat> Zenithium[m]: well in theory gimp is for editing, krita is not
17:25:07 <strcat> but I'd far rather use krita for editing
17:25:17 <strcat> because it actually makes sense and I don't have to waste time trying to make it do what I want
17:25:20 <strcat> or figuring out how to do something
17:25:27 <strcat> it's obvious and intuitive and the tools each have a better UI
17:25:45 <strcat> I see no reason to use gimp aside from something that's missing in krita and chances are you won't be missing anything
17:25:45 <nscnt> They are two (different) tools, nothing else.
17:26:07 <strcat> but krita does do editing (quite well, better than gimp imo) and gimp does do painting (horribly)
17:26:20 <cx2[m]> Yeah back to my original point, I wish photoshop was more accessible.... just couldn't bring myself to continue use when it went to creative cloud.
17:33:24 <nscnt> Good thing that there are other tools on the market. Photoshop isn't excessively good, it's just widely used and people are used to it.
17:40:05 <strcat> https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/tools/magnetic_select.html#magnetic-selection-tool works really well for example
17:40:26 <strcat> it USED to be that krita wasn't a great photo editor but it definitely is one now
17:49:38 <strcat> is anyone on macOS? can you type tar --version?
17:49:55 <strcat> I want to know if they use bsdtar as tar
17:50:19 <strcat> going to stop telling people to use the unzip command because it hasn't been updated since 2009 and bsdtar (libarchive) can unzip
17:50:28 <strcat> and windows 10 has bsdtar (as 'tar')
17:53:54 <nscnt> strcat: Yes, bsdtar on latest macOS.
17:55:32 <strcat> nscnt: as 'tar' command?
17:55:35 <strcat> or as a 'bsdtar' command
17:55:38 <strcat> or both
17:55:38 <cx2[m]> `bsdtar 3.3.2 - libarchive 3.3.2 zlib/1.2.11 liblzma/5.0.5 bz2lib/1.0.6`
17:55:38 <nscnt> strcat: tar
17:55:41 <strcat> kk
17:55:55 <strcat> so the annoyance here is linux distros
17:56:02 <strcat> using shitty gnu tar as tar
17:56:25 <strcat> so I think I will tell people to use tar and then special case distros using GNU tar
17:58:10 <cx2[m]> strcat: Asked earlier.... I have a few of each: 3, 3a, 3aXL......what is a useful frequency for CTS?
17:58:21 <strcat> don't know what you mean
17:59:00 <cx2[m]> strcat: and would you care to even see anything from Pixel 2s.... I have one of those available as well.
17:59:03 <strcat> if you want to run the CTS and keep track of results it involves more than just running it and posting the results
17:59:21 <strcat> you need to learn how to run the CTS and handle the results
17:59:58 <strcat> talk to TheJollyRoger
18:00:47 <zxwayland> oh its you daniel
18:01:00 <cx2[m]> Done and done. That's what I wasn't unclear of.... talked with TheJollyRoger about it. But I came away not knowing what would be useful.... is it once per update, once per week, etc.
18:02:30 <fujita_[m]> Noob question: this question is base on reading the  description of these 2 apps which seems similar (haven't fully under stand how "work profile" on shelter works)
18:02:30 <fujita_[m]> Hi guys, I was just wonder what's the difference between using shelter for apps like WhatsApp & Instagram compared to using webapps  for pwa
18:04:06 <strcat> too broad / vague of a question
18:04:28 <strcat> PWAs are just an alternate UI for web pages, they run in the browser
18:04:48 <strcat> need to be more specific with the question
18:12:33 <strcat[m]> https://www.libarchive.org/
18:12:40 <strcat[m]> so this is tar on freebsd, windows, macos
18:13:17 <strcat[m]> curious if any linux distributions use it instead of gnu tar
18:15:00 <nscnt> but muh gnu
18:15:43 <strcat[m]> it's nice having a unified syntax for handling zip, rar, etc. via the tar command
18:15:50 <strcat[m]> I can't stand commands like unrar / unzip
18:16:36 <fujita_[m]> Currently, I need WhatsApp Instagram to keep in touch with friends and families.
18:16:36 <fujita_[m]>  
18:16:36 <fujita_[m]> I was wondering what is the difference with Webapp which from what I understand uses pwa and "run in its own sandbox" and using shelter which runs the app inside the isolated profile
18:17:46 <nscnt> Right click, 'Extract here'
18:18:11 <nscnt> :D
18:18:27 <strcat[m]> PWAs are just web pages with a fancy UI that makes them look like an app
18:18:45 <strcat[m]> nscnt: I always look at what they are going to extract first...
18:18:57 <strcat[m]> I don't want to end up with 1000 files mixed in with other things
18:19:17 <strcat[m]> tar tf foo.rar; tar xf foo.rar
18:19:22 <strcat[m]> alias tar=bsdtar ofc
18:19:44 <nscnt> wowow you computer nerd?
18:19:55 <nscnt> jk
18:22:04 <nscnt> I honestly don't use the terminal for such stuff. And it's really annoying that some compressions get immediately extracted
18:22:16 <madaidan[m]> <nscnt "wowow you computer nerd?"> Everyone here probably is
18:22:16 <nscnt> ... when double clicking on it
18:22:23 <strcat> I don't have a file manager
18:22:40 <nscnt> Yea, I'm lazy
18:22:47 <strcat> I'm too lazy to use a file manager...
18:22:51 <strcat> too much effort / trouble
18:23:21 <nscnt> Do you use lf or something?
18:23:43 <strcat> dunno what you mean
18:23:43 <nscnt> Or just "nothing"
18:23:56 <madaidan[m]> `ls` is the only file manager I need
18:24:34 <nscnt> I actually meant lf btw
18:24:39 <nscnt> no typo
18:24:58 <nscnt> https://github.com/gokcehan/lf
18:25:09 <strcat> I use zsh with ls, cd, rm, mv, rename, etc.
18:25:13 <strcat> nscnt: I don't want a file manager
18:25:26 <strcat> if I was going to use a file manager I wouldn't want a console UI
18:26:58 <nscnt> I understand
18:27:44 <strcat> for browsing images I use sxiv -t
18:28:21 <strcat> https://github.com/muennich/sxiv unfortunately doesn't do svg
18:29:28 <nscnt> I use it, too
18:31:23 <nscnt> But by clicking on it lol
18:38:50 <strcat[m]> nscnt: you can click on them in that...
18:40:32 <nscnt> mh? I meant I use the file manager and click on the picture to open it with sxiv
18:41:52 <nscnt> ah wait. I probably didn't undertand the thumbnail mode
18:48:54 <nscnt> I never used thumbnail mode. It's nice, but is there a way to open all pics of a directory?
18:49:32 <nscnt> well * works with error messages for everything else lol
18:53:36 <strcat> nscnt: if you pass it a directory it opens everything in it
18:53:46 <strcat> -r for recursive
18:54:24 <strcat> sxiv -tr images
18:56:45 <yzernik> has anyone figured out a way to forward SMS from Google Fi to a grapheneos phone?
19:03:05 <cx2[m]> Sooo attempting to install Fedora and ran into a snag..... This machine has two hard drives. Would I install it on the SSD as the other drive is presumably for storage only?
19:03:57 <nscnt> cx2[m]: Probably.
19:05:04 <cx2[m]> that's what I figured too.... fuck it. The computer is just sitting around doing nothing anyway.... what's the worst that could happen?
19:05:48 <nscnt> strcat: Oh, you can open a directory. I thought one would need to specify the images. It shows I don't use it much from the terminal
19:06:10 <cx2[m]> Nevermind.... I can select both
19:06:58 <nscnt> cx2[m]: You can free up space for both hard disks, but installing?
19:08:21 <cx2[m]> I can select both disk..... looks like I need to do some digging.... it somes someone has partitioned the shit out of this computer.... weird
19:08:58 <nscnt> cx2[m]: Choose your SSD and select free up space. Click 'free all' or smth when the dialog pops up.
19:09:55 <cx2[m]> I just went in an deleted the partitions.... Fedora is now automatically partitioning/using both
19:10:17 <nscnt> I've never tried that
19:10:47 <cx2[m]> actually worked out really well. I completely forgot this thing had drives.
19:16:35 <yekip[m]> is there any way to connect a pixel to ethernet rather than wifi?
19:17:11 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <yekip[m] "is there any way to connect a pi"> USB-C to RJ-45 adapter?
19:17:31 <yekip[m]> they exist?
19:17:47 <yekip[m]> cool if so. will have a look thx
19:18:00 <nickcalyx[m]> Snowden swears by them
19:18:02 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <yekip[m] "they exist? "> Yes they're a thing
19:18:03 <M0xC0ncord[m]> No idea if it works on GrapheneOS though
19:18:51 <yekip[m]> nice, thanks. anyone in here tried one?
19:19:11 <yekip[m]> i would assumesome settings need doing, not just plug n play
19:40:14 <tentbot[m]> <yekip[m] "nice, thanks. anyone in here tri"> Just tested it for you and my adapter was plug and play
19:42:23 <miniblue[m]> Lineage's servers getting hacked because of a Salt vulnerability still cracks me up.
19:43:46 <yekip[m]> <tentbot[m] "Just tested it for you and my ad"> wow. Thank you
19:43:46 <yekip[m]> so i just need a USB-C to Ethernet. and if you plug it in, you're just connected like with a laptop?
19:44:15 <yekip[m]> <miniblue[m] "Lineage's servers getting hacked"> It's a bit more funny for graphene users I suspect :D
19:44:43 <mxnorvak[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Snowden swears by them"> How reliable of a story teller and security adviser do u find him to be? Not on this subject ,in general
19:44:56 <miniblue[m]> Ya. I mean obvious my it sucks to get hacked but I mean come on.
19:45:09 <miniblue[m]> *obviously
19:48:48 <miniblue[m]> I mean I like Snowden but I don't know how reliable of a security advisor he is. He's living in Russia and is an enemy of the state, basically, so it's unlikely that he's on the bleeding edge of cyber security, so to speak. I mean he's probably more qualified than the average person but he's just that, a person. He's not a god, nor should he be considered the unadulterated source of truth or reliable information.
19:49:10 <tentbot[m]> <yekip[m] "so i just need a USB-C to Ethern"> Simple as that
19:49:34 <miniblue[m]> Even if he's right, vary your sources and all that.
19:51:47 <mxnorvak[m]> <miniblue[m] "Even if he's right, vary your so"> You know it's really hard to find someone who knows what he's talking about,specially if you know less than em and cant validate the information they're spreading
20:13:41 <minoas[m]> is there a way to share file between default and work profile. there is a "switch to work profile" option in the share menu but no option to save the file to memory
20:14:04 <minoas[m]> * is there a way to share file between default and work profile? there is a "switch to work profile" option in the share menu but no option to save the file to memory
20:14:18 <minoas[m]> * is there a way to share a file between default and work profile? there is a "switch to work profile" option in the share menu but no option to save the file to memory
20:28:24 <nickcalyx[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "How reliable of a story teller a"> I'm not saying he's the end-all be all of security opinions.. mainly just saying I know they work because he uses them
20:29:22 <nickcalyx[m]> they being usb->ethernet adapters for android
20:29:58 <nickcalyx[m]> as to whether he's an "enemy of the state" well.. that's just your opinion :)
20:30:50 <mxnorvak[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "as to whether he's an "enemy of "> Agreed
20:31:19 <mxnorvak[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "I'm not saying he's the end-all "> Yeah i know ,i was just asking for your opinion on him in general
20:33:37 <nickcalyx[m]> ok, well personally I think he's a patriot and he did the right thing blowing the whistle.  I think he tried to run it up the chain of command and was ignored and the chain of command was breaking the law and the constitution and he should have gone to the media
20:34:30 <nickcalyx[m]> I know other former NSA people who just left over it, retired early, which is another way to handle it.. and its up to each person
20:56:39 <mxnorvak[m]> Yea,i think its important how you view what he did because it directly effects what you consider to be a threat and what you consider normal and ok and in the world of technology and specially for those who are in the security and privacy sector ,their work kinda represents their standards and stance and well its not all 1s and 0s ,it has many gray areas but its still important to be on the good side
21:13:36 <mxnorvak[m]> <miniblue[m] "Even if he's right, vary your so"> Btw im asking for your guys opinions on his technical advises as the "other sources" of confirmation
21:24:27 <dazinism> >is there a way to share a file between default and work profile? there is a "switch to work profile" option in the share menu but no option to save the file to memory
21:25:04 <dazinism> minoas: you need an app in the other profile that can receive a shared file.
21:26:02 <dazinism> All the apps listed under https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/storage#Storage_providers will work
21:27:31 <miniblue[m]> He's an enemy of the State. As in, the people in power, is what I meant. He may be a patriot but that doesn't change the fact that the people in power did not, and do not, like him all that much.
21:29:00 <miniblue[m]> Though I might have my definitions of state fucked up. I can't remember which is nation and which is state.
21:29:20 <aeonsolution[m]> ?
21:29:24 <miniblue[m]> Hence nation-state
21:30:01 <aeonsolution[m]> What point are you trying to make?
21:30:09 <miniblue[m]> The nation I think is the population/people and this State is the government/ruling power or something?
21:30:26 <miniblue[m]> Oh no it's just linguistic terminology
21:30:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat "Danny@WorkOrderPro: it is treate"> Then I'm not sure what trouble cx2 was having with it, haha
21:31:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat "and yes lots of windows and linu"> Ah, just caught this - that makes sense.
21:33:10 <aeonsolution[m]> Any conversations on security brought in the spotlight are good ones to have regardless of someones level of knowledge or expertise miniblue.
21:33:41 <miniblue[m]> Agree. Hence why Snowden was so important.
21:35:42 <miniblue[m]> I was not arguing against anyone I was simply trying to get my terms right so I could say something like "friend of the nation, enemy of the state" and I was also coming at it from the angle of "take anyone's words with a grain of salt regardless of how credible they are".
21:36:27 <miniblue[m]> I even try to do the same with Daniel even though he obviously knows his shit.
21:37:05 <miniblue[m]> If that makes sense.
21:40:16 <nickcalyx[m]> like I said, I was only using him as an example of someone using usb->ethernet :)
21:40:46 <nickcalyx[m]> I've also used them as well, though I had to use a usbc -> usba converter and a ethernet -> usbA
21:44:04 <cdesai> that makes me wonder if any of the usb-c docks would work. no display ports, but usb ports and ethernet and maybe charging could be useful.
21:48:57 <aeonsolution[m]> miniblue: I see the point you're trying to make but it wasn't adding anything to the ethernet conversation. Glad you cleared it up though.
21:50:34 <miniblue[m]> Yeah I didn't realize it was strictly a conversation about Ethernet, lol.
21:50:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cx2[m] "Yeah back to my original point, "> use an older version?
21:53:24 <cx2[m]> Well sure, but doesn't that present security issues?
21:53:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nickcalyx[m] "ok, well personally I think he's"> Same with Binney and the other fellas. Their story needs to be told more as well. IMO, it's almost heavier-hitting than the Snowden one, for me.
21:55:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cx2[m] "Well sure, but doesn't that pres"> Would not know, haven't had heavy enough needs to ever use. Surely nothing VMs/sandboxing etc couldn't overcome?
21:56:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cdesai "that makes me wonder if any of t"> Let me know what you find out, I'd almost want to trust a random dock more than I'd trust a Linksys et al USB-A adapter, haha
21:57:10 <cdesai> DannyWorkOrderPr: I'd trust the one in the phone box. not sure if they're available separately though.
21:58:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Buying most of my gear second-hand, I'd be interested to know if anyone's found one that works/they trust in some way

22:13:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Also, sometimes it just decides not to save/import the PSK from the conf, so, if it's fucked, double-check that.
22:14:26 <cx2[m]> Yeah I tried that....it doesn't like the config apparently.
22:15:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Try importing it by hand?
22:15:43 <cx2[m]> I've also heard there are some downsides to network manager.
22:15:43 <cx2[m]> Don't really care at the  moment.... I'd rather Saudi...erhmm....the country in which I'm stuck's government from snooping in on me
22:16:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, this'd be a good time for me to ask - anyone use anything besides Network Manager?
22:16:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I...can't stand it, and it does not give me strong trust signals at all
22:17:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Used to use WICD back in 'nam, lol - anything like that kicking around that anyone'd vouch for?
22:18:10 <cx2[m]> This is one of the few places that I've had to deal with this.
22:18:10 <cx2[m]> Its usually easy, download through a connection that's already using a VPN, copy file to machine. Install......if only fedora were that easy.
22:18:29 <cx2[m]> I have the mullvad rpm....could you help with that?
22:18:59 <cx2[m]> Because I can't seem to get it to install
22:19:11 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Not a ton of experience with RPMs, but might be able to talk you through something. What's the error/result?
22:19:41 <cx2[m]> Missing a dependency....I'll recreate it.
22:21:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Know which one? Or is that your issue?
22:21:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If so, check the manpage for the packagage install command; adding a -v or a similar to it so you can get more verbose logging of the command may help
22:23:08 <cx2[m]> Haha...yeah....this is the RPM that I pulled from mullvads webpage....and I'm getting
22:23:08 <cx2[m]> `lubnsl is needed by mullvad-vpn-2020.4.0_beta3-1.x86_64`
22:26:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Sure it's not libnsl?
22:27:19 <cx2[m]> Apparently lib....typo
22:27:35 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Theirs? Do you have libnsl?
22:28:37 <cx2[m]> Not that I'm aware of....but my understand was that mullvad needed to be packaged with it. And I don't know how to package it....I guest I could try installing?
22:29:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Are you sure you don't just need to independently install it into Fedora with package manager?
22:29:34 <cx2[m]> Hmmmm....installed. I'm going to feel like a dumbass when this works.
22:29:45 <cx2[m]> Then I owe you a beer.
22:30:00 <cx2[m]> Too bad they don't have fucking beer here
22:30:45 <cx2[m]> That worked.
22:31:18 <cx2[m]> But next issue....its apparently a CLI version......learning is occurring.

22:47:07 <BrokenCog> during the build, from the #build steps the instructions show usig 'choosecombo' ... is there any reason for not using 'lunch' instead?
22:49:31 <cx2[m]> @dannyknoll:matrix.org: Last question then I'll set of to learn on my own...now that mullvad is running, the WiFi indicator has a question mark. Still connected though. Any reason for that?
22:51:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Pretty sure that's network manager saying "Not sure if we have internet (WAN vs LAN) connectivity"
22:51:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Whatever it pings to check that may be too latent, or simply blocked altogether by Mullvand, intentionally or otherwise.
22:53:37 <BrokenCog> During the "Extract Vendor Files" step for Pixel's, what is the BUILD_ID value?  where does that come from?
22:53:57 <aeonsolution[m]> give me a second, I can help with that
22:54:31 <BrokenCog> I'm GUESSING that "DEVICE" is aosp_bonito??
22:54:48 <aeonsolution[m]> what device you have
22:54:57 <aeonsolution[m]> pixel 3a is sargo
22:55:18 <BrokenCog> 3aXL
22:55:24 <BrokenCog> bonito
22:55:38 <aeonsolution[m]> then for DEVICE you put bonito
22:55:55 <aeonsolution[m]> let me remember find the other part for you give me a sec
22:57:18 <aeonsolution[m]> QQ2A.200405.005
22:57:34 <BrokenCog> ahhh okay, I know where to get that from the device list.  thanks.
22:57:35 <aeonsolution[m]> let me remember where we pull that from on your source tree
22:57:49 <aeonsolution[m]> oh nice
22:58:56 <BrokenCog> and aosp_bonito is the DEVICE value?
22:58:59 <BrokenCog> or just bonito?
22:59:16 <aeonsolution[m]> no just bonito
22:59:25 <aeonsolution[m]> aosp_bonito goes in another step
22:59:52 <BrokenCog> okay. thanks.
23:00:03 * BrokenCog proceeding with build!
23:00:05 <aeonsolution[m]> in the choosecombo command
23:00:19 <BrokenCog> right.
23:01:05 <BrokenCog> some I"m going to use https://grapheneos.org/releases#bonito-stable for pixel3aXL,  which would be a BUILD_ID of QQ2A.200405.005.2020.04.14.23
23:01:09 <BrokenCog> seems legit?
23:03:10 <BrokenCog> arg.  build script error ...
23:03:13 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah but when you pull the files theres a way to check your tree
23:03:25 <aeonsolution[m]> whats the error
23:03:35 <BrokenCog> https://termbin.com/h5dd
23:04:40 <rgeturk[m]> i think the actual BUILD_ID to use is listed after running the choosecombo command
23:04:51 <BrokenCog> oh, that makes sense.  I'll rretry.
23:05:22 <BrokenCog> oh, it gives the BUILD_ID also!
23:05:33 <BrokenCog> but, not the build.
23:06:01 <BrokenCog> er, I mean not the DEVICE
23:06:08 <JTL> > 15:53 <BrokenCog> During the "Extract Vendor Files" step for Pixel's, what is the BUILD_ID value?  where does that come from?
23:06:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> ^  ^ forgot to tag cx2
23:06:10 <JTL> I think you can crosscheck it with the Google factory images page as well
23:06:12 <JTL> https://developers.google.com/android/images
23:06:31 <BrokenCog> DannyWorkOrderPr: what does that mean exactlY?
23:06:56 <aeonsolution[m]> <rgeturk[m] "i think the actual BUILD_ID to u"> thats right, thank you for that
23:07:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <BrokenCog "Danny@WorkOrderPro: what does th"> It means I was going back and forth with user cx2  and forgot to tag him in my last response so he sees. Sorry to interrupt, ha
23:07:17 <rgeturk[m]> when you run `choosecombo release aosp_bonito userdebug` or whatever, it will also give the BUILD_ID there
23:08:10 <BrokenCog> yeah, using that rather than the Version from the releases page works.
23:08:29 <BrokenCog> the releases page has additional char's it seems inthe Version string.
23:20:59 <aeonsolution[m]> BrokenCog: if you need help with any errors at that step you can message me and I can help you out with what I've trired with troubleshooting
23:21:09 <BrokenCog> okay, the script gives the same error
23:21:27 <BrokenCog> it did download stuff, but then errored at the same EULA ackonwlegement.
23:22:44 <aeonsolution[m]> do you get this message at the end: [*] All actions completed successfully
23:24:24 <aeonsolution[m]> can you message me the command, maybe theres something from the steps before that was not completed
23:28:42 <BrokenCog> no, I got the same as that previous error above.
23:30:16 <aeonsolution[m]> the build id is wrong
23:31:07 <aeonsolution[m]> it should be up to qq2a.200405.005 not the full qq2a.200405.005.2020.04.14.23
23:32:53 <BrokenCog> right.  giving it hte  orrect build_id the download started, it didn't with the wrong id, but afterwards the same error
23:33:06 <aeonsolution[m]> you can confirm the build id like rgeturk suggested by using the choosecombo command; the build id is listed after running that command for future reference
23:33:10 <BrokenCog> ./vendor/android-prepare-vendor/execute-all.sh -d bonito -b QQ2A.200405.005   -o vendor/android-prepare-vendor
23:33:39 <BrokenCog> yeah, that's where I got the correct shorter ID
23:34:48 <rgeturk[m]> try using lowercase in the build_id in the command
23:35:04 <BrokenCog> one sec
23:35:18 <rgeturk[m]> qq2a.200405.005 instead of QQ2A.200405.005
