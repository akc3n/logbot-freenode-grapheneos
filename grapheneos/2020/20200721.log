00:41:32 <aeonsolution[m]> <grindlefang[m] "Is building Vanadium still broke"> yes, some of us are still working on it
00:42:51 <aeonsolution[m]> <cdesai "strcat: https://chromium.googles"> thanks for finding this, going to read up
01:15:32 <aeonsolution[m]> grindlefang: if you aren't building a production build of GOS, you can set is_official_build to false
01:15:47 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/10/args.gn
01:16:33 <aeonsolution[m]> cdesai figured out that this is related to the issue with the new version not working
01:16:43 <aeonsolution[m]> its still unclear what is the root cause
01:31:29 <sushiman[m]> so grapheneOS has profiles in its OS...
01:31:44 <sushiman[m]> are these profiles 100% sandboxed from each other?
01:34:27 <textmate> Wow
01:34:31 <textmate> lots of users here
01:35:23 <textmate> Ah I see its probably because of matrix
01:35:36 <textmate> im going to sleep. I will talk tomorrow
01:39:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Good night then
01:43:43 <aeonsolution[m]> <sushiman[m] "are these profiles 100% sandboxe"> yes, checkout <https://freenode.logbot.info/?ch=grapheneos&q=profiles> for more details
01:44:01 <sushiman[m]> ty
02:08:03 <cn3m[m]> <sushiman[m] "are these profiles 100% sandboxe"> Apps installs are really the only things not fully isolated. Though this is almost never an issue
02:08:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> App installs from what I know are shared
02:09:00 <cn3m[m]> if you had a v1 exploit you could use it to backdoor F-Droid and all subsequent updates for F-Droid apps across profiles, but Android 11 is fixing that
02:09:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> If one user installs an app and another installs it android will just reuse the old one
02:09:06 <LinusSexTips[m]> virgin Shelter vs CHAD multiple user profiles
02:09:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> But give it a separate data
02:09:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "if you had a v1 exploit you coul"> How so?
02:09:35 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "How so?"> well when I played with Janus
02:09:50 <cn3m[m]> you could make someone install an apk that looks like something else
02:09:52 <cn3m[m]> they would feel safe since it is in another profile
02:10:00 <cn3m[m]> it could then replace F-Droid for instance
02:10:27 <cn3m[m]> then F-Droid could use the v1 exploit against all updates for apps or new installs
02:10:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
02:10:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah you're right
02:11:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: should we make a system like tails then?
02:11:02 <cn3m[m]> would be a complicated attack
02:11:29 <cn3m[m]> gives you persistent access to any F-Droid app like the password manager and authentication tokens for example
02:11:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Essentially an android phone that loses all data on reboot
02:11:40 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "cn3m: should we make a system li"> doesn't that already exist and Android isn't using it?
02:11:45 <cn3m[m]> DSU loader
02:12:12 <cn3m[m]> would be nice to add to GrapheneOS to remove the need for dev devices anyway
02:12:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> No actually have a clean data partition every boot
02:12:33 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "No actually have a clean data pa"> that could be very interesting
02:12:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> All you have to do is mount a blank f2fs with checkpoint=disable:0
02:12:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> The moment you shut down
02:13:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> F2fs will erase all data
02:13:26 <cn3m[m]> Yeah if you had a signing bypass
02:13:32 <cn3m[m]> you could even backdoor the normally very strong Guest mode
02:13:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Set a session lock screen and on the next boot even the encryption key will be lost
02:13:39 <cn3m[m]> it would have to work on v2 signing of course
02:13:49 <cn3m[m]> but if you replaced Vanadium for example
02:13:57 <cn3m[m]> even Guest mode(which denies app installs)
02:14:08 <cn3m[m]> would still verify the fake Vanadium
02:14:49 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Set a session lock screen and on"> would be cool at least as a proof of concept
02:15:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> I accidentally implemented this on op7pro
02:16:32 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I accidentally implemented this "> oh yeah? blank f2fs checkpoint disabled?
02:16:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a glassrom build that wipes your data off every boot and as long as you set a password it will not even be recoverable
02:17:46 <cn3m[m]> you probably could modify it to do so automatically

03:52:01 <cn3m[m]> it is not
03:52:22 <cn3m[m]> unless they completely screwed it up
03:52:30 <cn3m[m]> extremely unlikely
04:06:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <theultron[m] "Not recoverable using specialize"> No
04:07:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since the key that was used for encryption itself is lost there is no recovery possible
04:08:30 <theultron[m]> But those file recovery solutions still can recover some deleted decrypted data?
04:09:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nothing is decrypted
04:09:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even the metadata key is hardware wrapped
06:05:00 <infiniteape[m]> I am trying to run ADB on Arch linux.  Do I need drivers?
06:05:21 <infiniteape[m]> is there a package for that on pacman? Or I would manually have to install this
06:08:34 <infiniteape[m]> Ive only ever done this on windows but id like to learn how to on linux
06:23:57 <broda721[m]> Quick question, what is the maximum amount of user profiles one can make?
06:28:24 <cn3m[m]> <broda721[m] "Quick question, what is the maxi"> 16
06:28:37 <broda721[m]> Ah
06:28:46 <broda721[m]> Is there any reason for the limit?
06:29:24 <broda721[m]> * Is there any specific reason for the limit?
06:37:23 <cn3m[m]> doubt it
06:37:26 <cn3m[m]> probably UX
06:52:50 <fll[m]> Hey cn3m, just saw that long reddit thread and I admire your patience. Thanks for the effort you put into that!
06:56:04 <cn3m[m]> fll: thank you :)
07:01:49 <cn3m[m]> I have a habit of letting posts through if I get asked them a lot and the usual go to Matrix instead doesn't work. That one was a huge time sap though I probably spent a good 4+ hours on that threat
07:01:49 <cn3m[m]> thread*
07:19:01 <fll[m]> Yeah, I imagined that was time consuming. But you provided a lot of good information that hopefully many people can read up on
07:23:04 <fll[m]> It might make some question the false "open automatically = good" stance they've been taught in so many places
07:26:06 <cn3m[m]> welcome librethinker
07:26:37 <takama02[m]> Sorry for a dumb question but in instructions when i verify images with signature there is this command line only for a .sig file
07:28:29 <takama02[m]> Does that suffice if I'll be flashing the image from the other file?
07:29:19 <cn3m[m]> thanks that is my goal
07:29:27 <cn3m[m]> I don't like misinformation especially about GrapheneOS
07:30:21 <cn3m[m]> The main challenge is getting over Dunning Kruger's and on top of that having enough patience
07:31:22 <cn3m[m]> yeah, open source is probably a 10% factor imo fll:
07:31:36 <cn3m[m]> absolutely a good thing
07:31:59 <cn3m[m]> that is how the verification works if I am understanding you correctly yes
07:32:03 <cn3m[m]> takama02:
07:34:27 <takama02[m]> <cn3m[m] "that is how the verification wor"> thank you
07:34:51 <cn3m[m]> and btw don't bother verifying unless you have trusted repos like on linux
07:35:18 <cn3m[m]> the website is better protected than installing a random verification tool off the net
07:38:40 <takama02[m]> actually i do reinstall with verification after i switched to linux. gos opened a gate of foss for me :D

11:34:14 <tvg[m]> They do! Thank you very much
11:34:51 <tvg[m]> And I will be able to succesfully install GrapheneOS on my Pixel 3a if I buy it from Belsimpel?
11:36:59 <Metro[m]> <tvg[m] "And I will be able to succesfull"> I bought a pixel4 and am a happy camper with my GrepheneOS installed on it. üòÉ
11:38:46 <tvg[m]> That's great to hear! Thank you so much for the assistence x
12:43:18 <ura[m]> Is belsimpel the retailer?
12:43:32 <ura[m]> oh well, seems like I'm an h late
12:52:55 <anonhat[m]1> How is app startup lag on the 3 compared to the 3a?
12:58:04 <ura[m]> Better, I'd guess. I'd not base a purchasing descision on that tho. Firstly, do you need a headphone jack? If yes, you need to pick the 3a anyways
13:01:00 <anonhat[m]1> üòü
13:02:16 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Also depends if support time is important for you
13:02:35 <ura[m]> oh yeah. almost forgot that
13:02:51 <ura[m]> 3a will have longer support, right?
13:03:04 <ura[m]> may 2022
13:03:07 <homesteadhacker[> Hello all, a complete noob here.  I'm sure this is a FAQ, but I can't find it on grapheneos.org or reddit.  I just purchased an unlocked Pixel 3.  I want to activate it on Spectrum.  Do I need to wait until the SIM card arrives, activate it with vanilla android?  Or can I go ahead and install Graphineos on it now, and pop in the sim/activate it?
13:03:09 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> 3a's startup lag is tolerable enough
13:03:48 <ura[m]> spectrum is your carrier?
13:04:01 <homesteadhacker[> yes, I think it's resold Verizon
13:06:27 <ura[m]> You should be able to activate it with graphene installed, tho I'd wait for a second opinion on this. I'm not fully sure about the process of unlocking a SIM in your country. In my country (germany), I couldn't reasonably unlock a SIM on a custom ROM. Need to download an app called POSTIDENT and show my passport to some callcenter guy
13:16:38 <SchismXL[m]> Anyone having problems with outgoing and incoming calls? Normal calls, not using other apps
13:16:46 <SchismXL[m]> Internet is working etc.
13:17:22 <SchismXL[m]> 4XL btw.
13:17:25 <strcat[m]> cdesai: they aren't going to accept a change removing the bundle since it's what they use
13:19:49 <homesteadhacker[> ura: thanks, maybe someone who has done this in the US with Verizon or Spectrum has some experience with this.  Do you think I'll get another unsolicited opinion, from my original question, or should I just pop in every now and then and re-ask ?
13:21:11 <ura[m]> pop in every now and then and re-ask I'd say. Also be prepared to get other less helpful answers like mine as well before eventually getting useful info
13:21:15 <cdesai[m]> strcat: I know, I mainly put it for feedback, and already left a comment saying that a separate target could be added if they‚Äôd accept it
13:21:42 <cdesai[m]> I was going to do that but this was much easier and faster for now, and we don‚Äôt have a use for the bundles anyway
13:21:55 <cdesai[m]> Apk is half the size now too
13:27:48 <strcat> cdesai[m]: huh why is the apk so much smaller
13:27:53 <strcat> are we generating the apk from bundle wrong?
13:30:21 <strcat[m]> tvg: afaik the only locked variant is the Verizon one
13:34:09 <SchismXL[m]> No worries, fixed the calls. I had "4G" selected instead of "4G (Recommended)" on the Preferred Network Type.
13:39:10 <strcat[m]> you mean "4G only" right
13:41:24 <SchismXL[m]> No, on 4G Recommended
13:41:40 <strcat[m]> I'm talking about how you're saying "4G" above
13:41:49 * SchismXL[m] uploaded an image: 4742f3aa-9326-4080-921c-c70ea354ef4f.png (46KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/JVjcsAwvCOgpWhChLJkSBDLJ >
13:41:57 <strcat[m]> yes so as I said
13:42:13 <strcat[m]> you had it on "4G only"
13:42:21 <strcat[m]> not "4G"
13:42:26 <SchismXL[m]> Ah, yes, sorry!
13:43:00 <SchismXL[m]> Yeah, on 4G only, there's no calls. But on the recommended, there are calls.
13:43:15 <strcat[m]> so you probably don't have VoLTE support
13:43:30 <strcat[m]> in which case you need 2G/3G support to use traditional voice calls
13:43:40 <strcat[m]> since you don't have calls over 4G
13:43:59 <SchismXL[m]> üéª :(
13:44:02 <strcat[m]> eventually carriers will drop 2G/3G
13:44:12 <SchismXL[m]> Thanks, though. That makes perfect sense
13:44:16 <strcat[m]> but will take a while
13:45:36 <strcat[m]> cdesai: it would be good to open an issue about API 30 support early BTW
13:45:53 <strcat[m]> cdesai: they promised to do better this year but I seriously doubt they will especially when they broke Trichrome's public build
13:46:11 <strcat[m]> cdesai: so should open an issue about landing API 30 support for Android 11 early
13:46:30 <strcat[m]> cdesai: maybe email the person we talked to last year

14:37:34 <ura[m]> I can only recommend the simpletools suite. sandelinos does darkmode work with the default application?
14:37:46 <sandelinos[m]> I wonder why there even is a seperate contacts app when the contacts section in the dialer is almost exactly the same
14:38:08 <sandelinos[m]> There is no dark mode in the Contacts or Phone apps
14:39:00 <crabman[m]> So simpletools has a dark mode?
14:39:20 <sandelinos[m]> Simple Dialer is dark by default
14:39:46 <sandelinos[m]> I'm not sure about how secure or functional it is though
14:39:51 <ura[m]> simple tools have darkmode but it has to be set on a one by one basis in the settings
14:40:16 <ura[m]> not sure about functionality either. I can only attest to simple gallery and simple music player

18:36:10 <homesteadhacker[> Heyo.  anyone in the states have experience activating on Spectrum (Verizon) ?  I have a SIM card on the way and wondering if I should activate my unlocked Pixel 3 before, or after installing GrapheneOS?
18:45:53 <crixtnn[m]> i've signed in my google account on vanadium and it shows the phone model. how can a web page know that?
18:49:03 <cdesai> aeonsolution[m]: sure, but it's non trivial due to the amount of resources, and adding debugging to aapt didn't help
19:10:31 <minz3[m]> I want to help but my english is not good
19:10:59 <aragorndr[m]> Did you bought it from Verizon?
19:11:30 <userrioter[m]> And did you unlock developer mode?
19:14:00 <userrioter[m]> If you can‚Äôt figure it out, try commenting it under TechLore‚Äôs installation troubleshooting video and maybe send him a direct message in his Telegram channel

19:20:59 <userrioter[m]> You can sell it on Swappa (albeit you have to pay about $40 to Swappa and $40 to PayPal if I recall correctly) or post it on LetGo and Facebook Marketplace. You‚Äôll likely sell it at a better price locally
19:21:09 <aragorndr[m]> Try returning it, and if you can't, resell it
19:22:08 <userrioter[m]> You can also probably find a Pixel 4 XL for about $320+ locally if you check on the aforementioned sites or bid on eBay
19:23:12 <userrioter[m]> I also got a T-Mobile variant and it works fine in Graphene OS (given I haven‚Äôt tried actually using it with an active SIM card though)
19:23:31 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <userrioter[m] "You can also probably find a Pix"> Gotta avoid Verizon, they ruin Google Pixel's openness

19:25:14 <SchismXL[m]> Even with heavy use, it lasts all day.

19:26:47 <SchismXL[m]> Here's today's usage. Went up a bit when I was in the car, but you can see.
19:31:46 <crixtnn[m]> how many hours of screen on time? the face unlock works well? (eyes closed thing) other bugs?
19:33:45 <SchismXL[m]> 4.5 hours since full charge with now 60% left. Face unlock is flawless. Closed eyes thing works well.
19:33:45 <SchismXL[m]> There are some bugs.
19:34:58 <SchismXL[m]> One is the 90hz screen issue, where there is a green hue at low brightness. That isn't GrapheneOS' fault, but a Google fault. It has been fixed by Google, but we have yet to see that fix on the 4XL. I would do it myself if I had the knowhow.
19:35:09 <userrioter[m]> <SchismXL[m] "One is the 90hz screen issue, wh"> What are the bugs?
19:35:30 <SchismXL[m]> Previous comment, userrioter
19:36:36 <SchismXL[m]> I also had trouble with a WiFi memory leak, where every time I turned the WiFi on, my phone would reboot. However, a reflash of GrapheneOS fixed that.
19:37:59 <SchismXL[m]> The green flicker can be avoided in low light if you're happy to put the phone in battery saving mode. That is because the battery saving mode uses 60hz instead of 90hz.
19:38:17 <userrioter[m]> I haven‚Äôt had the green hue nor WiFi issues. I guess it‚Äôs a case case basis
19:38:58 <crixtnn[m]> does the 90hz impacts battery life much?
19:39:11 <SchismXL[m]> Yeah, case by case, but it is known and there have been multiple posts about it
19:39:20 <SchismXL[m]> <crixtnn[m] "does the 90hz impacts battery li"> No, because it is default.
19:39:52 <SchismXL[m]> 90hz all the time, unless you put your phone to battery saving mode. Haven't seen any option in the settings to set it to 60hz all the time
19:45:53 <crixtnn[m]> thanks for the info. my 3a xl sometimes feels a bit sluggish and I'm in doubts as to get the 4xl or wait for the 4a xl. got used to the fingerprint reader. didn't quite got that, it unlocks with the eyes closed or not?
19:47:17 <blacklight447[m]> <crixtnn[m] "thanks for the info. my 3a xl so"> Doesnt the 4a have a fingerprint reader?
19:48:03 <SchismXL[m]> <crixtnn[m] "thanks for the info. my 3a xl so"> Just tested it. It works perfectly. If eyes are closed, it won't unlock.
19:48:56 <crixtnn[m]> blacklight447 4a yes. 4 and 4 xl no.
19:49:55 <crixtnn[m]> I'm not very sure of the privacy implications of face scan.
19:50:26 <SchismXL[m]> As an aside, I was also used to the fingerprint reader on my OP6, but after couple of weeks of use on GrapheneOS, I find it weird when I pick up my OP6 and it isn't unlocking (also not a fan of how cheap it feels in comparison to the 4XL now).
19:53:37 <crixtnn[m]> how about the soli radar? song skipping? other usefe functions/apps?
19:53:42 <SchismXL[m]> You don't have to set face unlock, if you don't want to. If someone wanted to get into your phone using your face, I'm sure they'd force your eyes open. Fingerprints have also been known to be cloned, so you could be out of luck there, too. If it is for privacy, just use a long password.
19:53:42 <SchismXL[m]> Also, all of the data for your face are kept locally and are encrypted (iirc), so no one could get access to them anyways.
19:54:01 <crixtnn[m]> * how about the soli radar? song skipping? other useful functions/apps?
19:54:43 <blacklight447[m]> <crixtnn[m] "blacklight447 4a yes. 4 and 4 xl"> Few

19:58:08 <blacklight447[m]> Comes down to what you think is worse personally
19:59:20 <blacklight447[m]> That part on the site mostly addresses the fact that NOT doing something is also part of your fingerprint
19:59:30 <crixtnn[m]> i guess the  ideal unlock would be a privacy screen protector + long pin + pin scrambling
19:59:39 <blacklight447[m]> Which in this case, would be not using google as the connectivity check
20:00:01 <SchismXL[m]> <unknown-losser[m "See this :-"> As it says, it isn't desirable to stand out from the crowd. That is, if you disable the feature, you are singling yourself out, as others wouldn't have it switched off.

20:08:58 <blacklight447[m]> And even then, the amount of data is negligible

I'm using Shelter, which uses a single work profile,  so the apps all land in the same single work profile. Would it be preferable to use one profile per app instead?
