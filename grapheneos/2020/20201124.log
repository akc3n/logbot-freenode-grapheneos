00:11:29 <codebam> where is the release key?
00:11:39 <codebam> I want to `gpg --verify` the file I'm downloading
00:12:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> codebam: use signify
00:12:15 <codebam> okay
00:12:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> gpg is not recommended for usage and isn't very secure
00:12:40 <codebam> okay
00:13:07 <codebam> where do I get signify?
00:13:36 <TheJollyRoger> codebam: what operating system are you running?
00:13:44 <codebam> TheJollyRoger: Solus Linux
00:14:36 <TheJollyRoger> codebam: Check your repositories, but if it's not in your operating system repositories then use Auditor post-install.
00:14:53 <codebam> I might just install a different OS
00:15:01 <codebam> I wanted to try Fedora Silverblue anyways so now I can
00:18:16 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. If Fedora don't package Signify for you, then just use Auditor.
00:19:14 <codebam> I don't know if they package it but yeah I'll use Auditor
00:19:25 <codebam> Auditor is the app that's installed after you boot to verify the build?
00:19:29 <codebam> how does that actually work?
00:19:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, it's included with the operating system -
00:19:41 <codebam> do I need 2 phones for that?
00:20:02 <TheJollyRoger> That's one way of doing it, or the other way is to use the project's own attestation server at https://attestation.app
00:20:13 <codebam> oh okay cool
00:20:34 <TheJollyRoger> Auditor's pretty neat: Phones that shipped with Android 8 are capable of Remote Attestation.
00:21:25 <codebam> oh cool, I'm excited to try it out
00:21:36 <codebam> is it safe to just lock my bootloader after flashing?
00:21:44 <TheJollyRoger> If the phone's bootloader is locked, this allows a phone to cryptographically attest to the boot hash. The initial pairing is backed up with a validate it with a certificate that's validated by your batch, which is validated by your OEM, which is then validated by Google's self-signed Root.
00:21:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, it is.
00:21:53 <codebam> awesome
00:22:13 <codebam> I think I asked this a while back, but does eSIM work on grapheneos?
00:22:30 <codebam> on Calyx it worked right away after I enabled d2ds so I'll try that
00:22:33 <TheJollyRoger> So the interesting thing about Auditor... even if the operating system itself tries to lie about its own authenticity, remote attestation was actually designed to check if the verified boot hash is legit and actually was signed by the release key.
00:23:12 <codebam> oh wow that's really cool
00:23:15 <TheJollyRoger> If it isn't, then Auditor can actually catch it -- Auditor can even do some very bizarre things like detect the presence of programs that try to mask themselves like Magisk, which can even lie to ADB.
00:23:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it's really neat.
00:24:23 <TheJollyRoger> Since the in-house attestation server has genuine copies of those keys, if say, someone gave you a phony system image and provisioned their own keys in the bootloader while you weren't looking during the installation, Auditor can actually catch that.
00:24:57 <TheJollyRoger> codebam: I don't think eSIM is supported at this point in time, unfortunately.
00:26:57 <TheJollyRoger> Auditor is GrapheneOS' secret weapon when it comes to making sure the phone operating system's image is legitimate. It's pretty simple to use, if you have another phone you should take that approach and pair those phones, that's probably the safest. But if you don't or need something to start the chain of trust, then use the Attestation server, and use another device you trust to display the
00:26:59 <TheJollyRoger> audit data.
00:27:06 <codebam> that's okay. I'm upgrading to a new device soon anyways
00:27:17 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
00:29:21 <strcat[m]> the main way that Auditor works is from pinning the generated key and the attestation chain for it
00:29:30 <strcat[m]> but it does have very basic authentication of the initial result via the root
00:29:45 <strcat[m]> after that it's paired and the root doesn't actually play a role
00:29:53 * TheJollyRoger blushes.
00:30:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw guys we need help to counter FUD and misinformation being spread against graphene by james, copperhead and a few other people who have been misled by them
00:30:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please pm me if you would like to help us
00:30:05 <TheJollyRoger> Ack!
00:30:09 <codebam> eSIM works btw TheJollyRoger
00:30:18 <codebam> I did the same as in Calyx
00:30:27 <TheJollyRoger> Oh it does?
00:30:30 <codebam> I don't think the setup wizard works, but I just enabled D2DS and rebooted
00:30:31 <TheJollyRoger> Well splice the mainbrace!
00:30:37 <TheJollyRoger> \o/ Awesome.
00:30:42 <codebam> yeah it restores already saved eSIM cards
00:30:48 <TheJollyRoger> Beautiful.
00:31:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also if you have a record of donations or have archives of source code from 2014 onwards please get in touch with strcat
00:31:15 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: what we're missing for eSIM is an app to set it up, basically
00:31:21 <TheJollyRoger> Ohhhh
00:31:23 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: all the infrastructure for it in the OS is there and works
00:31:26 <strcat[m]> we're missing the setup
00:31:26 <TheJollyRoger> Oh but the backend is supported?
00:31:30 <strcat[m]> yeah
00:31:34 <strcat[m]> we are missing activation / setup
00:31:36 <TheJollyRoger> OH huh. That makes sense.
00:31:40 <strcat[m]> we're just missing an app for it
00:31:46 <strcat[m]> we need our own implementation I guess
00:31:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ack, got it o.O.
00:31:54 <strcat[m]> someone has to make it
00:32:27 <TheJollyRoger> I see, I see... ack.
00:34:03 <codebam> the correct way to use grapheneos is no apps right?
00:34:19 <codebam> I can probably live with webapps
00:34:58 <TheJollyRoger> codebam: you can install apps! Just a little catch:
00:35:35 <TheJollyRoger> The first one is that at the present time GrapheneOS lacks a first-party app store of specially curated, apps chosen for their security properties and by necessity and with co-operation from upstream developers.
00:36:00 <TheJollyRoger> So in interim, you'll have to find, and update the applications yourself.
00:36:01 <codebam> can/should I use f-droid?
00:37:10 <TheJollyRoger> The second catch is that GrapheneOS doesn't have Google Play and many apps have hard dependencies on Google Play and may experience strange behaviour when their developers don't code their apps to handle phones without it. This could take the form of apps crashing on launch or whenever trying to request functionality that is provided by Google, finding nothing, and not having any
00:37:12 <TheJollyRoger> exception-handling capability.
00:37:43 <TheJollyRoger> Or in some cases, needing to run in the foreground and display a "app is running" icon.
00:37:50 <TheJollyRoger> or running but not sending notifications.
00:38:03 <TheJollyRoger> codebam: F-Droid is a tad bit controversial in this chat room, I'll try to explain both sides as best I can...
00:38:42 <strcat[m]> codebam: it makes sense to use F-Droid + Aurora Store
00:38:43 <TheJollyRoger> On one hand, some people do have it because it offers the lowest barrier to quickly and readily grab lots of readily available apps from the same place.
00:38:44 <strcat[m]> codebam: we're just not going to bundle either
00:38:56 <codebam> okay that's fine. I'll use those
00:39:02 <TheJollyRoger> whew. Okay!
00:39:14 <codebam> I need to verify the F-Droid APK first though and for that I need a proper desktop OS
00:39:34 <codebam> If you don't mind me asking, what desktop OS's do you guys use?
00:40:05 <codebam> I was going to use Fedora Silverblue because I realized I can't trust my OS if I'm using sudo all the time
00:40:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> codebam: OT chat
00:40:29 <codebam> okay, sorry
00:40:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hi codebam, non-GrapheneOS operating systems aren't really covered here-- ha, beat me to it anu.
00:41:02 <codebam> asked in ot chat
00:52:19 <Dylanger[m]> Is it possible to remove the ability for apps to directly access certificates of other apps?
00:52:19 <Dylanger[m]> The Play Services client lib gets the cert for Play Services/GMS via PackageManager
00:52:19 <Dylanger[m]> I wonder if it's possible to not allow that
00:52:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: this is already not allowed
00:53:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> On the stock ROM there is an overlay that contains a string array of apps
00:54:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> This array has a list of whitelisted apps that any other app can query the signature for
00:54:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> And GMS is one of those
00:57:15 <Dylanger[m]> Ah thank you
00:57:20 <Dylanger[m]> I was wondering how that was working
01:04:45 <Dylanger[m]> `frameworks/base/data/etc/hiddenapi-package-whitelist.xml`
01:13:26 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: they can do it if they have QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES or w/e it's called
01:14:18 <Dylanger[m]> https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES
01:16:54 <Dylanger[m]> I'm trying to locate this whitelist
01:28:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: no there's an exception on stock
01:28:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can get signature for play services and a few other whitelisted apps without ever needing that permission
01:28:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> The whitelist is quite small, only 2-3 apps can be queried without the permission
01:29:18 <strcat[m]> just saying that any app can do that with that permission
01:30:34 <ruddo[m]> <codebam "If you don't mind me asking, wha"> Qubes.

01:49:07 <Dylanger[m]> Don't know how that would fit with the 'ye must blend in' ethos
01:49:33 <Dylanger[m]> But I'd rather not have this API be available to apps
01:54:07 <Dylanger[m]> https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-get-users-installed-apps-in-android-11-b4a4d2754286
01:54:08 <Dylanger[m]> > There is one loophole that I noticed while exploring the <queries> element if you add android.intent.action.MAIN as the action element in the intent filter, you can see almost all the apps of the user without adding the permission since almost all apps would have this element in the AndroidManifest.
01:54:09 <Dylanger[m]> 🙃
01:56:03 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: that's how it's supposed to work
01:56:06 <strcat[m]> apps have to declare what they use
01:56:20 <strcat[m]> so it can be statically determined what they can see
01:56:35 <strcat[m]> they can add whatever they want to queries though
02:00:11 <Dylanger[m]> Hm, I'm gonna neuter this API and see how it goes
02:02:06 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: it will break Auditor without changing it
02:02:09 <strcat[m]> or giving it an exception
02:02:25 <strcat[m]> also will break apps that use it unnecessarily too
02:02:40 <strcat[m]> sure they could generally do things properly if they aren't intended to actually scan for apps for some reason (like Auditor)
02:02:50 <Dylanger[m]> I'll find a good exception
02:02:51 <strcat[m]> but if they used that, not much can be done about it without breaking them
02:03:06 <strcat[m]> and you can do essentially the same thing with queries just more manually
02:03:15 <Dylanger[m]> It's a trade off I'm willing to live with
02:03:20 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah I'll look at that as well
02:04:31 <strcat[m]> there is no Samsung 970 Pro 2TB and the 980 Pro 2TB isn't out yet?
02:04:33 <strcat[m]> what...

02:30:10 <MattV111[m]> Since most recent update my alarm turns itself off pixel 4 xl
02:37:15 <RanAwayNow> This is probably a rather naive question, but I couldn't find an answer - does GrapheneOS encrypt the phone by default and also is the password still limited to 16 characters?

03:07:48 <Dylanger[m]> Still not totally sure what it does, I can't locate the whitelist mentioned above
03:08:00 <Dylanger[m]> There are apps in Location Providers
03:08:34 <strcat[m]> Lia: queries and QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES are useful for forcing apps to statically declare which other apps they can query and directly contact
03:09:05 <strcat[m]> Lia: it is not supposed to restrict what apps are allowed to do but rather have them declare what they do in the static manifest instead of not having a way to statically determine it
03:09:24 <strcat[m]> Lia: that's the purpose of the low-level, non-dangerous permissions in general, they are not user-facing
03:09:33 <strcat[m]> they're for opportunistic attack surface reduction and static analysis of apps
03:10:03 <strcat[m]> it's a lot easier to judge whether an app is doing sketchy things based on static, declarative rules that are enforced by the OS

05:47:39 <strcat> Lia[m]: it does stop them from doing that
05:47:51 <strcat> Lia[m]: they have to declare the permission and then they can do it
05:47:57 <strcat> or declare broad queries parameters
05:48:36 <strcat> I don't see how declaring queries parameters is any different than the low-level permission, it's not a bypass, you have to declare it either way
05:48:39 <strcat> that's the point
05:48:47 <strcat> there is no toggle for the permission, it's not user-facing
05:49:14 <strcat> it works like iOS now
05:49:29 <strcat> an app can be rejected in review based on what it declares it can query
05:49:35 <strcat> that's the same approach as iOS
05:50:02 <strcat> it's not a runtime thing (it's not a runtime permission, it's not user-facing)
05:53:50 <irmbrady[m]> Hi guys, is there any way to disable the 'you have a different OS installed' warning message on boot? This is on a 4a
05:54:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy irmbrady[m] on Pixel 4as that cannot be disabled; that's a, very important security feature and it's a part of the qualcomm bootloader.
05:56:50 <TheJollyRoger> Theoretically, we could "fix" this problem... by paying an OEM, Google and Qualcomm some great big fat stacks of cash to get our own hardware, but they wouldn't be pixels anymore at that point and I do not think anyone here would pay the price that they would likely be asking.
05:57:19 <irmbrady[m]> Thanks for confirming TheJollyRoger ! I was initially worried I goofed the install.
05:57:19 <irmbrady[m]> Got my 4a yesterday and happily running GOS now
05:57:34 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, welcome aboard the ship, shipmate!
05:58:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, if you see that sign, that's a *good* sign, because it means your bootloader is locked, and the Verified Boot is now enforcing and doing its job as we expect it to. You can check via remote attestation that it's verifying to the correct Android Verified Boot keying by using Auditor and https://attestation.app via remote attestation.
05:59:09 <TheJollyRoger> It does mean you aren't running the Google operating system, but in our case, this is what we want.
06:00:07 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if it turns orange and gives you an ominous message about "Software Integrity is Not Guaranteed. Do not store anything personal on this device." that you have to worry.
06:00:55 <irmbrady[m]> Great stuff. I'll check out attestation. Thanks again!
06:00:59 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
06:12:36 <poizn[m]> I've got this weird issue on the Pixel 3a. Sometimes the phone only notifies me that I've received an SMS only if i unlock/turn the screen on. Just now it happened again, the SMS was time-stamped being received 17 mins ago. Yesterday there was one with 32mins. Why is this happening?
06:13:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: signal

06:17:41 <CarpeDiem[m]> <poizn[m] "I've got this weird issue on the"> Same on 3aXL.
06:22:10 <poizn[m]> It's almost like battery optimisations are used for some processes that handle receiving SMS
06:23:35 <poizn[m]> And there's the alarm that has some similar behavior, it rings but a few minutes late
06:24:31 <strcat[m]> the clock has a battery optimization exception
06:24:34 <strcat[m]> are you up-to-date?
06:27:05 <Dylanger[m]> Is is possible to disable IMS?

06:36:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: you can remove it in your builds

06:59:39 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy CarpeDiem[m], no problem, we can walk you through it, but likely the first thing you'll want to do is make sure you check only the official instructions on https://grapheneos.org/install and make sure if you've taken knowledge from any other guides on the internet, to disregard everything they say.
07:00:36 <TheJollyRoger> Since a few of them are dangerously out of date, and one even recommended disabling an important safety check that prevents devices from having the incorrect partition written to.
07:00:57 <TheJollyRoger> correction: Since many of them are unsafe or dangerously out of date,
07:01:21 <CarpeDiem[m]> I'll always go off the official install instructions posted on the graphene website, YouTube tutorials are known to be shonky at the best of times
07:01:27 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
07:01:42 <TheJollyRoger> You may find it easiest to simply use Windows 10. When you do, be sure to use POWERSHELL, and not cmd.
07:02:10 <TheJollyRoger> If you do use cmd, it will give you the "fastboot too old" error regardless of anything you do, you will need to use Powershell.

08:57:01 <Lia[m]> Maybe reporting this in releases.grapheneos.org issue tracker will help
08:57:41 <Dylanger[m]> huh
08:57:41 * Dylanger[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nAIONdSFTGfAoAwwBZipeSYu/message.txt >
08:59:17 <NewGrapheneUser> I'll open an issue on Github. What's the best way for me to proceed?
09:00:11 <zyxt128[m]> Every link in https://grapheneos.org/releases returns a 403
09:00:11 <zyxt128[m]> Maybe there is a pending deploy?
09:00:22 <Lia[m]> <NewGrapheneUser "I'll open an issue on Github. Wh"> Make an account, tell how to reproduce issue,m
09:01:15 <NewGrapheneUser> I will do that, thank yu

09:01:59 <Lia[m]> Probably
09:05:09 <NewGrapheneUser> Thanks for the help. I'll give it some time and give it another go later today
09:16:28 <strcat[m]> zyxt128: it's fixed now
09:16:29 <strcat[m]> there was an in-progress change
09:16:49 <strcat[m]> adjusting stuff to deal with repeated denial of service attacks
09:19:47 <Lia[m]> Want to ask how to fix this issue in building Chromium: (not sure what went wrong here)
09:19:58 * Lia[m] posted a file: failed_ninja_build_chromium.txt (26KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/the-apothecary.club/7572e7094d78fae8a4238d7ed7e6e5578428e0ab/failed_ninja_build_chromium.txt >
09:31:35 <strcat[m]> Lia: do you have the latest Vanadium patches applied?
09:32:54 <strcat[m]> Lia: it looks like you don't, seems they are only partially applied or something
09:33:01 <strcat[m]> reset to the upstream revision and reapply patches

10:46:38 <strcat[m]> Lia: well don't see any way that could happen with the patches properly applied
10:46:39 <strcat[m]> think you're doing something wrong
10:47:33 <Lia[m]> <strcat[m] "Lia: well don't see any way that"> Should I execute the command on strings manually?
10:48:56 <strcat[m]> no
10:49:05 <strcat[m]> you're supposed to apply all the patches with the provided command
10:49:11 <strcat[m]> you don't appear to have done that
10:49:54 <strcat[m]> reset back to the upstream code, sync it fully
10:50:23 <strcat[m]> apply the patches via the provided command
10:50:27 <strcat[m]> are you applying them manually or something? I don't see how you could end up with them partially applied
10:51:05 <Lia[m]> <strcat[m] "you don't appear to have done th"> Been building Chromium for a while and I always use
10:51:49 <strcat[m]> and are you using the latest patches and the correct Vanadium version?
10:51:52 <Lia[m]> And it is the first time the build broke. Maybe will try again with old instructions
10:51:54 <Dylanger[m]> Anyone have any views on disabling IMS as part of a security model?
10:51:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: no not really
10:52:05 <strcat[m]> Lia: are you forgetting to clear out/ ?
10:52:14 <Lia[m]> <strcat[m] "and are you using the latest pat"> Yes
10:52:27 <Lia[m]> wait let me check...
10:52:43 <Lia[m]> Ah, I forgot
10:53:03 <Lia[m]> Probably that's the problem. I'll wait for the next stable release to try again
10:53:50 <Dylanger[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Dylanger: no not really "> Aw you should mayne, it's attack surface
10:55:18 <strcat[m]> we can't just outright disable support for traditional calls / texts for everyone
10:55:23 <strcat[m]> we need the OS to be usable
10:55:28 <strcat[m]> we want to support the same stuff AOSP does
10:55:43 <strcat[m]> there can be toggles to enable/disable features but we can't just outright disable traditional call support
10:55:48 <strcat[m]> carriers are dropping 2G/3G
10:55:57 <strcat[m]> the only way to get traditional calls etc. will be via IMS
10:56:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: fastboot erase boot_a; fastboot erase boot_b
10:56:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Attack surface: 0
10:56:29 <Dylanger[m]> anupritaisno1: wat
10:57:13 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "there can be toggles to enable/d"> Fair enough, I'm gonna see if there's something in NV I can disable, I'd like nothing at all to handle anything IMS
10:57:35 <Dylanger[m]> For my usecase (Data only) I don't need to have code handling IMS
10:57:39 <Dylanger[m]> Modem or AP
10:58:08 <Dylanger[m]> If there's nothing something I can toggle in the modem, I'll try patch qc-libril
10:59:05 <Lia[m]> Try flashing bramble with sunfish bootloader, zero attack surface
11:07:55 <strcat[m]> gonna work on DoS mitigation a bit more
11:08:00 <strcat[m]> servers are under attack a lot lately
11:08:32 <Dylanger[m]> <Lia[m] "Try flashing bramble with sunfis"> Lol 😆
11:08:45 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "servers are under attack a lot l"> What are you using currently?
11:08:54 <Dylanger[m]> For hosting
11:09:03 <strcat[m]> nginx
11:09:17 <strcat[m]> probably need to massively increase the # of allowed connections
11:09:20 <strcat[m]> and lower timeouts
11:09:25 <strcat[m]> just don't want to break anything
11:09:27 <Dylanger[m]> Oh you have a doc somewhere
11:09:30 <Dylanger[m]> I remember reading it
11:10:02 <strcat[m]> it's too bad nginx doesn't support io_uring yet
11:10:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: how good/bad is nginx, #ot
11:10:08 <strcat[m]> could enable thread-based aio for releases server
11:10:25 <strcat[m]> well it really annoys me that nginx has paywalled features
11:10:34 <strcat[m]> they have a closed source version of it
11:10:37 <strcat[m]> with extra features
11:10:41 <strcat[m]> but they paywall some really basic stuff
11:11:01 <strcat[m]> so, for example, you can define upstream servers in blocks with various configuration to use as backends
11:11:08 <strcat[m]> you can set max # of connections allowed to them etc.
11:11:57 <strcat[m]> but in order to enable a queue when the # of connections goes above that, rather than just dropping them, you have to have the paid nginx plus
11:12:06 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "they have a closed source versio"> Wooooooow
11:12:11 <strcat[m]> http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#queue paywalled basic configuration option that I need
11:12:14 <strcat[m]> it's probably simple to implement too
11:12:45 <wunderharke[m]> <Dylanger[m] "Lol 😆"> Hello guys, I'm new here :) so that's not a great idea? I'm getting a brumble this week and would really love to see grapheneos running on there
11:12:50 <strcat[m]> I don't really understand how they can paywall queue
11:12:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: they call it nginx plus
11:12:55 <strcat[m]> it's such a basic thing
11:12:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> wunderharke: there is no progress on bramble
11:13:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have a volunteer maintaining redfin and I'm going to do redfin
11:13:20 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1:  a lot less bad than apache
11:13:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Bramble will be easy to support after redfin is doing but somebody needs to have a device
11:13:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even then there is no timeline
11:13:52 <strcat[m]> but it's still a big pile of C code with some memory corruption bugs found occasionally
11:14:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a lot of stuff that needs to be done and somebody needs to volunteer to help
11:14:08 <Dylanger[m]> You could do a unikernel if you wanted to, or even use something like ipfs
11:14:30 <wunderharke[m]> I can do testing but my knowledge is by far not advanced enough to do a port myself
11:14:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: how do I go about finding those?
11:15:09 <strcat[m]> finding what?
11:15:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> I ran hardened malloc, asan, boundsan and a couple other sanitizers on public servers for months
11:15:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Never had a crash in nginx
11:15:58 <strcat[m]> wouldn't expect to find bugs like that with regular input with any battle tested software
11:16:34 <strcat[m]> it's pretty embarrassing for software to have bugs found by ASan when running their own test suite
11:16:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah I just left it for users to access
11:16:38 <strcat[m]> shows a lot of negligence
11:16:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> There was no experienced attacker attacking it
11:16:40 <strcat[m]>  * it's pretty embarrassing for software to have bugs found by ASan when running their own test suite or during regular usage
11:16:59 <strcat[m]> not about 'experience'
11:21:16 <strcat[m]> nginx has some weird stuff paywalled
11:21:31 <strcat[m]> for example they paywall configuring the Server header to a custom value but you could just change it in the source
11:21:38 <strcat[m]> and queue seems to simple to reimplement
11:21:53 <strcat[m]> wonder if there's a fork adding this basic stuff that's well maintained
11:23:49 <jpds> There won't - all the people working on it will probably be working for Nginx Inc.
11:24:15 <zyxt128[m]> Are you aware of HAProxy?
11:24:39 <jpds> zyxt128[m]: Similiarly seems to have an enterprise version now
11:24:41 <zyxt128[m]> it can be helpful for your DoS issues
11:26:32 <strcat[m]> zyxt128: nginx should work well for this main issue is queue being paywalled
11:26:37 <strcat[m]> for upstream servers
11:44:06 <Golli[m]> Use NGINX and have a ratelimit setup. Easy.
11:45:08 <strcat[m]> Golli: rate limiting based on IP isn't going to accomplish much
11:45:32 <strcat[m]> and also thanks to carrier grade NAT many users can be behind 1 IPv4 address
11:46:12 <Golli[m]> My bad, thought someone was attacking the site.
11:47:16 <strcat[m]> they are, regularly
11:47:59 <strcat[m]> I really need that queue feature for upstreams
11:48:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Which is why we need help guys
11:48:48 <Golli[m]> Who's the upstream?
11:49:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please pm me. james, copperhead and others are spreading misinformation and people are believing it
11:49:15 <renlord> strcat[m]: what are you queuing exactly?
11:49:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please pm me if you can help
11:49:27 <renlord> http requests?
11:49:32 <strcat[m]> Golli: a backend server
11:49:37 <strcat[m]> renlord: well that's what I need
11:49:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also if I don't accept your pm within 1 second of you inviting me
11:50:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just be patient
11:50:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can't really be on matrix all the time
11:50:30 <renlord> so weird, in C its just one line listen(sock, queuesize)
11:50:44 <renlord> lol
11:50:46 <Golli[m]> So is the hosting at its limits then? strcat
11:51:43 <renlord> does it not already queue by default?
11:51:56 <renlord> i'd assume sane implementations have a default queue size
11:52:39 <strcat[m]> renlord: I'm not talking about the accept queue
11:52:53 <strcat[m]> Golli: no, the issue is DDoS attacks on the site
11:52:57 <strcat[m]> people being really annoying
11:53:09 <strcat[m]>  * Golli: no, the issue is DDoS attacks on the services
11:53:32 <jpds> There's only one way to deal with a DDoS, and that's to talk to your ISP
11:53:45 <strcat[m]> for multiple servers
11:53:47 <strcat[m]> OVH detects some of it and sends me emails about DoS mitigation starting and ending but I have no clue what they do
11:54:22 <Golli[m]> Then rate limiting would solve the majority of it, if it's http/s.
11:54:26 <renlord> pay CF to take care of it for you
11:54:55 <renlord> does not cost much
11:55:03 <renlord> and saves you engineering headache
11:55:19 <jpds> Yeah, or stick it in static S3 site hosting
11:55:20 <Golli[m]> If it's l4, then either get a host who handles DDoS protection better, or use a protection service.
11:55:58 <renlord> CF will throw annoying captchas at your adversaries on behalf of you
11:55:59 <strcat[m]> renlord: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#queue
11:55:59 <renlord> kek
11:56:00 <strcat[m]> this is what I need
11:56:11 <strcat[m]> cloudflare isn't an option
11:56:19 <strcat[m]> it breaks the services for the actual users
11:56:30 <strcat[m]> Auditor and Updater don't know how to answer a captcha
11:56:54 <jpds> strcat[m]: Surely you can host that bit separately?
11:57:07 <strcat[m]> jpds: that bit is the main issue
11:57:17 <strcat[m]> that's why I need this queue feature
11:57:20 <Golli[m]> In that case, run the rate limiting and what not on another server, and just use round robin (upstream) for whatever servers you have in the back.

12:00:45 <renlord> https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/7460
13:04:48 <hozz> Hello
15:20:42 <nscnt> asdssd
15:20:59 <nscnt> whoops :D
16:40:11 <TheLynx> A question I have wanted to ask for quite a while. Not sure if it belongs more in offtopic. A few years ago there were some attempts to build secure phones (OpenMoko). The phone back then even had its own hardware platform (OpenHardware). One of the main reasons for this was the baseband modem, because practically all GSM chips come from one country. Even from more or less only one manufacturer. In
16:40:17 <TheLynx> addition, there were already baseband vulnerabilities in the past. But since the baseband modem has direct memory access in most cases, in case of an exploit, this would be a game over. OpenMoko solved this problem with a baseband firewall. The question is now:
16:40:21 <TheLynx> Is there a similar solution or a hardening of baseband exploits in GrapheneOS on e.g. Pixel 3a to protect against baseband exploits or is it possible to prevent baseband exploits by running it in '4G only' mode?
16:40:39 <TheLynx> I know very particular question ^^
16:58:49 <madaidan[m]> <TheLynx "addition, there were already bas"> Any half-decent phone not manufactured in the ice age already isolates the baseband via an IOMMU. It does not have direct memory access.
17:23:10 <TheJollyRoger> Hello TheLynx, to build on that, all modern handsets already isolate the modem via system memory management (IOMMU on ARM). System Memory Management was implemented in a draft form in 2011, the year the OpenMoko Freerunner stopped shipping. The Pixels are chosen because they have the best in class modem isolation. The drivers for the Pixels are open source and the modem is only allowed to write
17:23:11 <TheJollyRoger> to or read from the host memory that the driver in the kernel explicitly allows it to.
17:23:36 <TheJollyRoger> Baseband exploits might have been all the craze many years ago, but technology has moved on.
19:50:58 <dar_gomml[m]> an recommendation regarding password managers?
19:51:11 <dar_gomml[m]> * any recommendations regarding password managers?
19:52:26 <TheJollyRoger> hi dar_gomml[m], third-party apps are offtopic here and you're likely to find more help in the -offtopic channel. Nevertheless, I can confirm that KeePassDroid will work with and open KeePass2 database files created on the desktop, but I have no other information.
19:53:02 <TheJollyRoger> I think if you want more information and more detail than that, you're likely to find it in the #grapheneos-offtopic channel.
20:00:33 <alzxjm[m]> dar_gomml: KeepassDX works great on GrapheneOS, including Biometric unlock.
20:00:54 <dar_gomml[m]> ups sorry, thought I switched to the correct channel, wanted to post there :/
20:01:58 <alzxjm[m]> dar_gomml: KeepassDX on GrapheneOS with keyfile. Database syncs with Nextcloud just fine and autofill works either via the auto-fill API or with the KeepassDX keyboard.
21:34:02 <Coffee[m]1> Is GrapheneOS coming to Pixel 4a 5g or Pixel 5 anytime soon?
21:34:21 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Coffee[m]1, it's not on our roadmap until we have more available maintainers.
21:35:09 <Coffee[m]1> Aww, bummer! I guess I will buy just the regular 4a for now so I can at least explore the OS
21:35:21 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! That's probably the best course of action.
21:35:37 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS has a policy that official releases will only be made if they can be made sustainable, with enough maintainers to support them, with full production-quality releases.
21:36:18 <TheJollyRoger> So as a result, the attitude taken by the GrapheneOS developers is extremely pragmatic, it's to avoid spreading developer time too thin.
21:36:57 <Coffee[m]1> I see
21:36:58 <TheJollyRoger> A good rule of thumb is to imagine for each device family, another full-time maintainer is needed to keep them viable.
21:37:58 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixel 4a5G may *look* like a regular 4a, but it's not. I believe that while the phones may look the same, and act the same, the chip underneath is very different, meaning that the 4a5G will require an entirely different kernel, entirely different drivers, and entirely different work to maintain releases up to GrapheneOS' standards.
21:37:59 <Coffee[m]1> What skills must one know to maintain a device for this OS?
21:39:25 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to be very familiar with viewing, applying, and merging patches. Some programming skills are definitely a strong asset; the kernel and the drivers are written in C, much of the Android Ecosystem is in Java and Kotlin.
21:40:17 <TheJollyRoger> More importantly though, is the time committment; the devices are expected to remain in service for around three years, which is the amount of time Qualcomm commits to releasing firmware updates for the SoC powering those phones.
21:40:33 <TheJollyRoger> A maintainer must be able to commit to doing the job for that length of time.
21:41:24 <Coffee[m]1> Wow, that's a lot of work. I'd be willing to help fund this project to help with the maintenance
21:41:54 <TheJollyRoger> That definitely helps! Donations fund the project and it helps the maintainers cover costs, especially where equipment and servers is concerned.
21:43:40 <Coffee[m]1> I will donate to help keep this project alive. I've been wanting to switch over since I first learned about Copperhead years ago
21:44:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr! Donations are much appreciated! The developers do accept Bitcoins if you want to keep your donations anonymous: https://grapheneos.org/donate although Github sponsorship is the best way to do recurring donations since that goes directly to the lead developer.
21:46:13 <TheJollyRoger> (The Github donation matching plan has ended though, so they no longer match donations.)
21:48:17 <Coffee[m]1> Would Pixel 4a be the best current device for Graphene, or would I be better off with the flagship 4 or 4 xl? Or perhaps a 3 or 3a?
21:49:08 <TheJollyRoger> The 4a is sort of at this moment your "best value for the money" option. The 4 and 4XL are sort of premium, but the 4a is newer and offers some features such as fingerprint sensor and headphones that the 4 and 4XL don't.
21:49:37 <TheJollyRoger> On the other hand, the 4 and 4XL do have some other features of their own that aren't present on the 4a, such as facial recognition unlock.
21:50:11 <TheJollyRoger> I unfortunately cannot comment on the camera differences between the 4/4XL and 4a since I don't have those two devices.
21:50:42 <Coffee[m]1> 4a it is then!
21:50:49 <TheJollyRoger> The 3 and 3a I would say if you have one already, do so, but if not, I would not spend the money on one because you're likely to end up with a Verizon Locked one if you purchase secondhand at this point in time.
21:51:45 <TheJollyRoger> What typically happens is just before the phones end up being pulled from the Google Store, Verizon vendors often will bail their unwanted handsets to try to be rid of them as quickly as possible, flooding the market with Verizon Locked handsets. These cannot have GrapheneOS installed to them because Verizon asks Google to set a Carrier ID which prevents bootloader unlocking.
21:52:50 <TheJollyRoger> From time to time, someone gets tricked into buying one because they often end up seeing that the prices are low, and the seller may confuse "carrier unlocked" with "bootloader unlocked". It often appears as a bargain but these phones cannot run GrapheneOS because they cannot be unlocked, save with exploits, which could stop working at any moment.
21:56:58 <TheJollyRoger> I have to step off the computer for a little bit, but if you have any more questions, just ping me and I'll try to get back to you.
22:00:44 <freelon[m]> I'm a web developer, and I'd certainly be interested in trying to collaborate to maintain for the Pixel 5. I'm relatively inexperienced and as such I don't have a lot of skill to offer, but I'm willing to devote time and commit for the long term and learn what I can.
22:00:44 <freelon[m]> If there are people experienced in Android dev who are interested I'd certainly love to speak with them.
22:06:49 <arisu[m]1> i'd definitely buy 5a when it's out, 4a isn't so much of a big upgrade from 3a
22:07:39 <arisu[m]1> otherwise yes, 4a is the best rn
22:08:00 <arisu[m]1> (cool codename as well)
22:12:27 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy freelon[m]! The developers (including the lead developer!) are mostly in this channel! Activity tends to be sporadic though, so catching them here sometimes can require a little bit of luck and good timing. I do have some notes I've taken about setting up your host for android development, if you like I can show them to you.
22:12:52 <TheJollyRoger> hi arisu[m]1, yeah, I am definitely interested in the next generation of phones, I'm not sure when I'll be able to penny up and buy one but I would like to sometime.
22:15:47 <TheJollyRoger> freelon[m]: I've got the start of setting up your host operating system for GrapheneOS development and testing, let me gather a few links for you. A few of my notes are a tad bit out of date since I've been away for a while but I could polish them up a bit...
22:16:07 <TheJollyRoger> In interim though, I have some notes about what you'll need to set up a work environment for doing GrapheneOS building. https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/For%20Maintainers/Setting-Up-Your-Host.md
22:16:54 <TheJollyRoger> I also have some notes for running the Android Compatibility Test Suite. This tutorial is fairly old since it was written for Android 10, you'll need the 11 compatibility test suite: https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/For%20Testers/The-Compatibility-Test-Suite.md
22:41:11 <lallerx[m]> My 4a is perfect
22:41:26 <TheJollyRoger> lallerx[m]: woohoo!
22:42:10 <lallerx[m]> My only problem is maps. Openstreetmaps is not accurate nere in south Italy :(
22:42:21 <TheJollyRoger> Aw, crud!
22:42:22 <lallerx[m]> Here*
22:44:58 <freelon[m]> TheJollyRoger  Perfect  thank you! I'll dig into them a bit, start scoping it out.
22:45:46 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome!
22:46:07 <TheJollyRoger> freelon[m], you rock! Let me know if there's any resources I can start digging up for you. I've been wanting to learn how to do this myself.
22:46:08 <jpds> lallerx[m]: Edit the map
22:46:49 <TheJollyRoger> What I've learned about computers has been mostly part and piecemeal, so my knowledge unfortunately is extremely patchwork and incomplete.
22:47:51 <lallerx[m]> <jpds "lallerx: Edit the map"> Maybe yes
22:48:07 <jpds> I've found it a great way to pass some time
22:49:48 <makingaliasesisa> lallerx: yeah on osmand+ you can help map out the streets by activating some setting.
22:51:53 <jpds> arisu[m]1: As someone that went from a 3a to 4a, I am so happy I did it
22:52:37 <makingaliasesisa> I went from a one plus 7 pro to 4a lol
22:52:57 <TheJollyRoger> I went from a 3 to a 4. The 4 is a nice phone in its own ways, but I actually find I really miss the fingerprint scanner, because the facial recognition doesn't work very well in the dark (this is not specific to GrapheneOS, the regular Android has this issue too.)
22:53:01 <makingaliasesisa> Mainly because I broke the charger connection
22:53:08 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yikes, you too?
22:53:33 <makingaliasesisa> And it is the biggest pain to replace it.
22:53:38 <TheJollyRoger> yeah.
22:53:51 <Dylanger[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I went from a 3 to a 4. The 4 is"> I can't go back to 60Hz from 90, it's just too smooth
22:53:52 <lallerx[m]> <makingaliasesisa "lallerx: yeah on osmand+ you can"> Thanks, I LL try to contribute for sure
22:54:05 <Dylanger[m]> Was going to from 4 to 4a, but need dat 90Hz
22:54:35 <TheJollyRoger> Oh huh. I should check this out a bit more then. I didn't quite notice the difference.
22:56:45 <makingaliasesisa> I miss 90Hz but my next phone I get might be a more expensive one in the future but I am happy with my 4a and then I would miss the fingerprint scanner and the headphone Jack.
22:57:01 <lallerx[m]> My prev was a mi9t, removing more than 40 packages of amazon, facebook, shit and miui analytics with adb was sufficient for the mind
22:57:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. For the 3 and the 4 I have to make do with one of those little bluetooth dongles.
22:57:27 <lallerx[m]> Grapheneos is so mind relaxing
22:58:30 <lallerx[m]> * My prev was a mi9t, removing more than 40 packages of amazon, facebook, shit and miui analytics with adb was not sufficient for the mind
22:58:45 <makingaliasesisa> If they ever do a *a series phone with 90 Hz I would think of buying it but not in the next year atleast.
22:59:02 <makingaliasesisa> > Grapheneos is so mind relaxing
22:59:02 <makingaliasesisa> Yeah I agree
23:00:45 <arisu[m]1> <jpds "arisu: As someone that went from"> well give me 350€ then i'll buy it ahah
23:01:17 <makingaliasesisa> Lol
23:03:04 <unnotchslayer[m]> What do y’all think of calyxosv
23:03:10 <unnotchslayer[m]> * What do y’all think of calyxos?
23:04:21 <makingaliasesisa> I liked it for what it was but I just liked having the stronger security of grapheneOS
23:05:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hey unnotchslayer[m], non-GrapheneOS operating systems are kinda offtopic here so I'd like to direct you to the #grapheneos-offtopic channel.
23:06:18 <unnotchslayer[m]> Well that’s a completely separate room
23:06:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
23:06:43 <TheJollyRoger> I forget how to join different channels on Matrix >_<.
23:14:50 <Aldous[m]> <nazgulc[m] "Screenshot_20201122-214219.png"> If u use open streetmap or Google maps, is the location working ?
23:44:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Help is needed
23:44:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> @unnotchslayer:matrix.org is spreading misinformation about grapheneos and slandering strcat in other chats
23:44:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you see him, please stop him
23:45:11 <louipc> any news
23:45:56 * Lia[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/OuGLzmSVCknxPaiUazyWnUZE/message.txt >
23:46:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lia: yes but we need help with this
23:46:47 <Lia[m]> Some people don't want to be corrected or already bringing some mindset that doesn't wanted to be changed
23:47:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't want more people spreading bullshit
23:48:14 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/MGWDnnDDsqhAZIdWbOdGowfh/message.txt >
23:48:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not confirmed BTW
23:48:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just my intuition
23:51:14 <YaoiFangirl420[m> I'm not, but yeah hearing about people getting accused of spreading misinformation does make me curious about what the actual information is
23:51:34 <YaoiFangirl420[m> I'm also broadly interested in alternate android builds
23:51:45 <YaoiFangirl420[m> I've been using lineage on my own phone for a while
23:53:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> YaoiFangirl420: join in OT for discussions on alternative OSes
23:53:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you want to know what happened with the other guy, pm me
23:54:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Getting banned off here is quite hard unless you really cross a limit and ignore multiple warnings
23:54:44 <YaoiFangirl420[m> well maybe a topical question here is what, if anything, makes graphene a better choice for an android os than any of the several other ones that exist?
23:54:51 <YaoiFangirl420[m> I've just only ever used lineage myself
23:55:29 <makingaliasesisa> Security is the biggest one :)
23:55:49 <YaoiFangirl420[m> I've found it a pain to actually get alternate builds installed on my phone, which discourages experimentation. I don't want to risk bricking my only phone that I use daily
23:56:16 <renlord> YaoiFangirl420[m: how do phones even get bricked
23:56:23 <renlord> (shrugs)
23:56:54 <makingaliasesisa> A big con for most though is you require a pixel device
23:56:59 <makingaliasesisa> As of rn
23:57:09 <YaoiFangirl420[m> ah, don't have one of those
23:57:11 <renlord> nobody knows how to brick a pixel devices
23:57:42 <renlord> a brickable device sounds like a defect to me tbh
23:58:21 <makingaliasesisa> renlord: you can forget your password and disable OEM unlocking and USB debugging.
23:58:51 <makingaliasesisa> And then the phone is useless to everyone
23:59:02 <renlord> makingaliasesisa: that's fine though
23:59:09 <renlord> it is working as intended.
23:59:35 <makingaliasesisa> Yeah it is
