00:00:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> That said
00:01:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is really hard to get CAF merged especially after changes from the manufacturer as well
00:08:04 <cdesai[m]> Which in turn makes it even easier to make mistakes when merging things.
00:08:58 <cdesai[m]> And it definitely isn't unrelated, not having matching versions could lead to issues down the road.
00:10:00 <cdesai[m]> There's pros and cons to merging caf, but they're vastly different on the pixels compared to any other device.
00:16:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Alright
00:16:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> We should stop now before this becomes an argument
00:16:57 <cdesai[m]> Yes

01:23:07 <Jeff[m]1> <Jeff[m]1 "Anyone know why the primary Riot"> No worries, as I know this isn't a specific Graphene issue. Ill figure it out. Hope you all have a nice weekend!
01:30:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Jeff: Other devices are having this issue?
01:32:16 <Jeff[m]1> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Jeff: Other devices are having t"> Not sure tbh
01:38:17 <fll[m]> Jeff: no idea, but the last update fails for me too
01:46:36 <fluoridatedsheep> Hey if the pixel was used with google fi, is it still unlockable? im very ignorant to anything about goog fi
01:47:25 <cn3m[m]> <fluoridatedsheep "Hey if the pixel was used with g"> yeah just avoid Verizon, T-mo, and Sprint
01:47:50 <fluoridatedsheep> <cn3m[m] "yeah just avoid Verizon, T-mo, a"> awesome, about to do a quick bid
01:48:54 <Jeff[m]1> <fll[m] "Jeff: no idea, but the last upda"> Thanks for confirming.
01:51:44 <fll[m]> T-mo pixels from Germany work though
02:34:39 <fluoridatedsheep> Hey if i have the pixel IMEI, can anyone validate if its verizon or not? it does start with 35
02:35:25 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <fluoridatedsheep "Hey if i have the pixel IMEI, ca"> DM it to me and I can check it for you.
02:36:25 <bulletproofman[m> Hello
02:37:46 <cn3m[m]> hi
02:38:04 <Bulletproofman> hello guys
02:38:25 <cn3m[m]> hey
02:39:30 <Bulletproofman> hello cn3m, do i get to keep my freenode nickname?
02:39:45 <cn3m[m]> looks like it
02:40:32 <Bulletproofman> I'm confused because the chats appear on riot too
02:42:40 <cn3m[m]> ah, the chats are only like that here
02:43:08 <Bulletproofman> I'll stick to using the Riot side then
02:43:36 <bulletproofman[m> Riot makes it possible to see if the messages are seen by someone
02:43:43 <bulletproofman[m> kinda cool in a way
02:46:59 <bulletproofman[m> hello are people still existing
02:48:35 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "hello are people still existing"> what?
02:48:51 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: 😇
02:51:34 <bulletproofman[m> Guys i've been thinking to switch to the apple eco-system for production
02:51:49 <bulletproofman[m> is it worth it? I'm not really sure about it when it comes to privacy
02:51:59 <bulletproofman[m> It sort of worries me.
02:52:31 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org Apple is fine you might need to change some settings
02:52:37 <cn3m[m]> they are reliable for privacy and security
02:53:21 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: How so ? I get very confused. People in r/privacy say horrible things about apple and i'm just very confused.
02:53:58 <cn3m[m]> don't read Reddit for privacy and security
02:54:08 <cn3m[m]> especially not that place
02:54:20 <cn3m[m]> stick to Twitter
02:54:47 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Okay but who am I supposed to follow on twitter aside frol snowden and daniel micay
02:55:01 <cn3m[m]> check who micay follows
02:55:16 <cn3m[m]> follow all the infosec (most)
02:55:58 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org I'm a former ad tech developer for mobile and an MITM tester
02:56:10 <cn3m[m]> Apple really isn't abusing your data
02:56:25 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: What about the PRISM stuff?
02:56:49 <Jeff[m]1> <bulletproofman[m "cn3m: How so ? I get very confus"> I think most people have an issue with Apple's proprietary system, as we basically have to take them at their word that they are privacy-focused. No yo mention that Snowden's revelations showed they were complying with NSA requests
02:57:11 <cn3m[m]> so Google spent 5x as much time with PRISM
02:57:26 <cn3m[m]> and you can turn off data sending much easier and effectively than Google
02:57:28 <Jeff[m]1> * I think most people have an issue with Apple's proprietary system, as we basically have to take them at their word that they are privacy-focused. Not to mention that Snowden's revelations showed they were complying with NSA requests
02:57:50 <cn3m[m]> Also Google shares vulnerabilities a month in advance to the government
02:58:02 <Jeff[m]1> <cn3m[m] "and you can turn off data sendin"> You also have yo trust that google isn't still harvesting
02:58:11 <cn3m[m]> you're screwed with Android and Linux if the government wants to exploit you
02:58:17 <Jeff[m]1> * You also have to trust that google isn't still harvesting
02:58:27 <cn3m[m]> Google almost lies fairly often
02:58:30 <cn3m[m]> yeah
02:58:39 <cn3m[m]> like advertising id
02:58:45 <bulletproofman[m> Wait you said linux what isn't linux secure ?
02:58:51 <cn3m[m]> limit ad tracking on iOS works on Android it's a joke
02:59:08 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "Wait you said linux what isn't l"> no, but not because the government. Linux has no real security model
02:59:16 <cn3m[m]> this has been written about in depth by Micay and the Whonix Project
02:59:16 <bulletproofman[m> <Jeff[m]1 "You also have yo trust that goog"> Yes i know google ignores settings all the time.
02:59:30 <cn3m[m]> the security is 10-20 years behind Windows and macOS
02:59:51 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "the security is 10-20 years behi"> What about Qubes? snowden uses it and it's linux
02:59:57 <bulletproofman[m> He also uses Tails
03:00:09 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org https://forums.whonix.org/t/fixing-the-desktop-linux-security-model/9172
03:00:14 <cn3m[m]> Qubes has notable issues, but less
03:00:29 <cn3m[m]> the guests are very insecure(often worse than Arch or something) and the package trust is way too high
03:00:35 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] " @bulletproofman:matrix.org http"> Thank you for the link
03:00:51 <Jeff[m]1> <bulletproofman[m "Yes i know google ignores settin"> Or they trick users into thinking they are turning things off when they are not. It's so frustrating
03:01:08 <cn3m[m]> The advertising ID pissed me off
03:01:19 <Jeff[m]1> <cn3m[m] "The advertising ID pissed me off"> Yeah. Totally
03:01:23 <cn3m[m]> Apple I'm cut off from collecting if someone Limits ad tracking
03:01:25 <cn3m[m]> Google it makes no difference
03:01:44 <cn3m[m]> Apple is 10-50x better in some studies and I agree with that on personal experience working with both
03:02:05 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is good since it is one of the few ROMs that tries to fix the broken permission model
03:02:23 <cn3m[m]> it is years ahead of Android usually
03:03:08 <bulletproofman[m> Okay thank you guys for all the information. and you seem to know a lot about technical stuff (i'm a noob and thinking of studying computer science next year) Can i ask you guys what do you use OSes and Apps/services wise? I'm trying to learn more about which projects are safer for privacy and security
03:04:35 <cn3m[m]> I use GrapheneOS and Windows 10 Enterprise
03:04:46 <cn3m[m]> I use Edge Chromium (WDAG) and Vanadium
03:05:12 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "I use GrapheneOS and Windows 10 "> Holy moly windows 10 O___O that's a huuge surprise um that thing literally logs Everythinnng
03:05:50 <cn3m[m]> It is more transparent about how much data your update system gets on you which is worth noting
03:05:53 <cn3m[m]> it looks worse than it is
03:06:43 <cn3m[m]> I don't have much traffic it's not getting anything personal. I've checked
03:06:54 <bulletproofman[m> I have windows 10 LTSC on my other machine for school things, but i have to use things like windowsspyblocker and debotnet and w10privacy and just pray to god nothing gets sent
03:07:13 <cn3m[m]> you just need to go into group policy
03:07:23 <cn3m[m]> set diagnostics to security only
03:07:45 <cn3m[m]> turn off smart screen
03:07:52 <cn3m[m]> then I tweak some hardening feature
03:08:17 <bulletproofman[m> Why not use macos? or qubes ?
03:08:45 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 LTSC is meant for privacy critical industries
03:08:50 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "Why not use macos? or qubes ?"> i can't afford a macOS
03:09:05 <cn3m[m]> and Qubes has more issues imo with security
03:09:12 <cn3m[m]> it also isn't very usable
03:09:17 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 makes a lot of sense for me
03:10:05 <bulletproofman[m> Well i understand then. You have a point it's just hard to trust windows 10 even if it's LTSC.
03:10:35 <bulletproofman[m> I heard it uploads the content of your ram every 5 or 30 minutes to MS
03:10:42 <cn3m[m]> I understand that, learning MITM really helps though
03:10:48 <bulletproofman[m> it scans usb firmware or smth
03:10:55 <cn3m[m]> 100%
03:10:58 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "I heard it uploads the content o"> that's bullshit
03:11:09 <bulletproofman[m> scans all the binaries and sends them to ms all kinds of creepy
03:11:30 <cn3m[m]> no it's not
03:11:30 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "that's bullshit "> I really hope so that's very creepy
03:12:20 <cn3m[m]> so it does check your programs, but do keep in mind your ISP sees this and your system does check for updates which shows your installed apps
03:12:24 <cn3m[m]> it's for security
03:12:27 <cn3m[m]> it can be easily turned off
03:13:24 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 is not a privacy issue. They are very reasonable lately
03:14:24 <bulletproofman[m> "Windows 10 is not a privacy issue. They are very reasonable lately" is a bold statement that requires many explanations
03:14:35 <bulletproofman[m> btw i'm pretty sure i'm being annoying, i'm really sorry but I'm just really eager to learn
03:14:46 <cn3m[m]> it asks all the major concerning settings on sign up clearly
03:15:01 <cn3m[m]> it's very transparent
03:16:03 <bulletproofman[m> But i heard lately it stopped letting you create a local account off the bat
03:16:15 <bulletproofman[m> instead you're gonna have to login, then create a local account
03:16:31 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org turn off your net you have the option
03:16:37 <cn3m[m]> that's only on new installs ashtray
03:16:38 <cn3m[m]> anyway*
03:16:51 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "instead you're gonna have to log"> nope
03:17:15 <cn3m[m]> No desktop OS is perfect
03:17:30 <cn3m[m]> macOS is the closest
03:17:54 <cn3m[m]> sure, but Windows 10 is pretty reasonable compared to the privacy issues of Linux due to no real access restrictions
03:18:07 <madaidan[m]> s/macOS/ChromeOS/
03:18:11 -SEdbot[m]- > <@cn3m:privacytools.io> macOS is the closest
03:18:12 -SEdbot[m]- ChromeOS is the closest
03:18:36 <madaidan[m]> Based bot
03:18:43 <bulletproofman[m> Oh but chrome os that's a whole other issue. Again because i just don't trust google to respect our ptivcy
03:19:16 <cn3m[m]> ChromeOS isn't bad the Google implementation is all open source and you can control it
03:19:30 <madaidan[m]> Purely for security, ChromeOS is great. Not that great for privacy though.
03:19:53 <fll[m]> ChromiumOS would be nice :P
03:20:00 <cn3m[m]> macOS is best for privacy and security out of the box
03:20:05 <cn3m[m]> there's nothing quite like it
03:20:16 <cn3m[m]> KickSecure if madaidan gets off his ass ;-P
03:20:36 <bulletproofman[m> My concern is both security and privacy. That's why i like graphene OS,
03:20:51 <bulletproofman[m> you guys i think it makes sense when it comes to apple now that i think about it
03:20:54 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "My concern is both security and "> GrapheneOS and macOS make the best combo then likely
03:21:40 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "KickSecure if madaidan gets off "> I'm working on it :(
03:21:44 <cn3m[m]> follow the money. Apple abuses your money with right to repair shit. Others abuse your data for money
03:22:19 <bulletproofman[m> I mean, i was going thru a list, and all the high profile people are for some reason using apple products. It's like jeff bezoz and elon musk and even all celebrities and many politicians..
03:22:45 <cn3m[m]> Except the president he uses Samsung since they are easier to break into so they should be rewarded
03:23:40 <bulletproofman[m> Not to be political but trump is kinda weird in his head. i just never understood the guy but that's besides the point. Let's stick to security and privacy >:O
03:24:09 <cn3m[m]> haha
03:24:54 <cn3m[m]> Apple is probably the best way of protecting the average person if you're super tech savvy GrapheneOS and Windows 10 win imo
03:25:45 <bulletproofman[m> I trust Graphene is good enough
03:26:06 <cn3m[m]> yeah I'd love a grapheneOS PC sadly the only one isn't great
03:26:19 <bulletproofman[m> I do think that qubes is worth it tbh
03:26:28 <bulletproofman[m> i'm not getting a mac anytime soon ☹︎
03:26:40 <cn3m[m]> I don't it still has a lot of issues like very insecure guests
03:26:49 <cn3m[m]> I think the trust model is screwed
03:26:54 <cn3m[m]> the packages are a mess for that
03:27:01 <cn3m[m]> however, I do see the appeal
03:27:05 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "yeah I'd love a grapheneOS PC sa"> Like a chromium os?
03:28:18 <cn3m[m]> HiKey which isn't really secure a good deal or stable
03:28:25 <cn3m[m]> ChromiumOS does exist btw
03:31:55 <bulletproofman[m> yes i just searched it apparently it's the base of chrome os
03:32:54 <cn3m[m]> yes, it's pretty good
03:34:36 <bulletproofman[m> my internet is being funny i'm back
03:35:12 <bulletproofman[m> is it true that apps on macos are sandboxed?
03:36:29 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "is it true that apps on macos ar"> generally no
03:36:54 <cn3m[m]> they don't install as root which is a feature unique to macOS making isolation in user profiles pretty reasonable
03:37:39 <bulletproofman[m> That's pretty cool. it's kind of like linux
03:37:43 <bulletproofman[m> it's becaause they are both unix lright?
03:39:35 <cn3m[m]> it's a relative of BSD
03:40:26 <bulletproofman[m> oh i get it now
03:40:30 <bulletproofman[m> thank you.
03:40:38 <cn3m[m]> it's very similar for development purposes
03:40:46 <cn3m[m]> btw
03:41:22 <cn3m[m]> hackintosh advertises verified boot and it's technically true, but it's enforced by the bootloader which isn't that solid for security
03:42:20 <bulletproofman[m> I would rather use macos on macbook rather than hackintosh tbh
03:42:39 <cn3m[m]> 100%
03:43:07 <bulletproofman[m> OK guys a question about VPN. thoughts? recommendations? i'm using riseup rn
03:44:01 <cn3m[m]> ProtonVPN just to blend in imo
03:44:27 <bulletproofman[m> John mcaffee says protonmail is CIA and there is this thing
03:44:55 <cn3m[m]> dude where do you get your news?
03:45:12 <bulletproofman[m> https://privacy-watchdog.io/
03:45:19 <bulletproofman[m> i'm serious john macaffee himself said that for real
03:45:38 <cn3m[m]> oh is that the site I'm thinking of.
03:45:44 <cn3m[m]> no I'm saying those are terrible sources
03:45:49 <bulletproofman[m> protonmail is not really e2ee someone proved that mathematically
03:46:19 <aeonsolution[m]> did you verify that source?
03:46:30 <cn3m[m]> that's bullshit
03:46:31 <cn3m[m]> I saw that math
03:46:47 <bulletproofman[m> here it is btw https://privacy-watchdog.io/truth-about-protonmail/
03:47:06 <bulletproofman[m> I SUCK at math
03:47:09 <cn3m[m]> that's a fully refuted article
03:47:14 <bulletproofman[m> just making it clear
03:47:41 <bulletproofman[m> explain to me oh knowledgable ones
03:48:05 <aeonsolution[m]> i think it would be helpful if you taught yourself some opsec stuff first before you believe everything you read on the internet
03:48:15 <cn3m[m]> yeah there's a lot to go over
03:48:29 <bulletproofman[m> I'm very new to this privacy stuff i'm sorry
03:48:29 <aeonsolution[m]> its noone's responsibility to teach you when you haven't done research beyond sharing a link
03:48:40 <aeonsolution[m]> thats totally understandable
03:48:41 <cn3m[m]> read Daniel's post and focus on verifying something is good before trusting it
03:49:17 <aeonsolution[m]> its important that you do that basic research stuff on your own before you become a victim of spreading misinformation
03:49:19 <cn3m[m]> generally the bigger projects are more trustworthy. ProtonMail is the only ones up to Gmail and Outlook encryption standards fully that I know of
03:49:22 <cn3m[m]> at least closely tracking it
03:49:46 <yolotrolo[m]> the whole website is about shitting on protonmail lmao
03:50:07 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "at least closely tracking it "> What about tutanota ?
03:50:11 <cn3m[m]> that website is stupid and refuted
03:50:24 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/quTXKetWIDkWxvLmWyfFaLzx >
03:50:42 <cn3m[m]> PGP is a standard on the web despite it's flaws
03:51:01 <cn3m[m]> you can use it with AnonAddy, Facebook, and a lot of developers
03:51:23 <bulletproofman[m> Mailbox uses PGP right? isaw it ontheir website
03:51:40 <cn3m[m]> yes, I hate PGP and I hate email
03:51:48 <cn3m[m]> I recommend just using Gmail for most people
03:51:58 <cn3m[m]> for almost nothing
03:52:26 <cn3m[m]> Google isn't going to get hacked or sell you out or hack your accounts
03:52:29 <cn3m[m]> you never know with these random projects
03:52:33 <cn3m[m]> email is the keys to kingdom
03:52:53 <cn3m[m]> it's naive to rush out to find some obscure provider
03:53:37 <aeonsolution[m]> thats honestly a good place to start
03:53:58 <aeonsolution[m]> research end to end encryption bulletproofman
03:53:59 <bulletproofman[m> I know Gmail is top notch when it comes to security but it scans your e-mails for ads
03:54:15 <cn3m[m]> Google stopped that in 2017
03:54:25 <aeonsolution[m]> theres plenty on the web on that subject
03:54:25 <bulletproofman[m> <aeonsolution[m] "research end to end encryption b"> Okay then E2E it is
03:54:34 <cn3m[m]> they switched the privacy policy on Gmail to the Gsuite one
03:54:56 <cn3m[m]> Gmail used as little as you can with PGP when available is the least shitty option right now
03:55:13 <aeonsolution[m]> learn about symmetric and asymmetric encryption plus the pros and cons of both
03:55:35 <aeonsolution[m]> good luck!
03:55:49 <yolotrolo[m]> the website have been posting articles only from august 2019 and september 2019, and 6 out of the 9 articles are attacking protonmail, seems legit..
03:55:53 <bulletproofman[m> <aeonsolution[m] "good luck!"> Okay thank you :)
03:55:58 <cn3m[m]> And for the love of all that is holy never get security and privacy news from /r/privacy
03:56:32 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "And for the love of all that is "> It has 800k i just got into this stuff a month ago
03:56:52 <bulletproofman[m> all the knowledge i have on security and privacy is from there
03:58:07 <cn3m[m]> If you must use Reddit only read /r/GrapheneOS, /u/DanielMicay, and /r/netsec(this one isn't amazing, but it's passable)
03:58:11 <cn3m[m]> follow Daniel and who he follows on Twitter
03:58:26 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "all the knowledge i have on secu"> that's not knowledge that's FUD
03:58:42 <bulletproofman[m> I don't know but judging from what you guys seem to know you guys are very tech saavy i'm hardly savvy on security or privacy.
03:58:42 <cn3m[m]> the people there are usually 13-25 and they don't have any real world knowledge or critical thinking of how this stuff works
03:58:46 <bulletproofman[m> what is FUD ?
03:58:56 <cn3m[m]> Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt
03:59:09 <bulletproofman[m> Oh alright thanks
03:59:44 <cn3m[m]> I really recommend grapheneos site over a few times even the build guide
03:59:45 <cn3m[m]> 3-5 times
04:00:01 <cn3m[m]> then read all you can of his Reddit post history
04:00:16 <cn3m[m]> then follow his Twitter followings
04:00:38 <cn3m[m]> that's the path I followed. Helps that this spy stuff was my job for a while

04:03:27 <bulletproofman[m> that makes sense.
04:03:39 <bulletproofman[m> Btw what do you guys think of brave?
04:03:58 <bulletproofman[m> I love it tbh
04:04:06 <bulletproofman[m> it's just so good out of the box
04:04:14 <bulletproofman[m> it blocks all the creepy things

04:06:31 <furofuro_01[m]> Especially for people who has Google as threat modell
04:06:37 <fishingtackle[m]> Why is Tutanota suck?
04:07:40 <cn3m[m]>  @furofuro_01:matrix.org email is the keys to your kingdom. Who is least likely to get hacked, bought out, or try to log into your accounts? That's Google
04:07:59 <cn3m[m]> use it as little as possible
04:08:44 <bulletproofman[m> John mcaffee uses gmail istg i saw this one i forgot where but it's true because of this security but he uses it pseudoanonymously
04:09:09 <fishingtackle[m]> How?

04:10:55 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] " @furofuro_01:matrix.org email i"> Makes sense. I prefer isolating and making more emails on various services. When it is hacked, less likely to access everything.
04:11:27 <cn3m[m]> though account chaining to compromise by abusing the customer support is a real threat
04:11:57 <furofuro_01[m]> Right...
04:12:05 <cn3m[m]> in some ways I would feel safer with everything being in Google or Microsoft's email. They are the least likely to go full horror story on me
04:13:07 <cn3m[m]> iCloud can be an option too it's a little tacky, but let's you fake everything
04:14:01 <furofuro_01[m]> This is harder than I thought. Pseudonyms may help, I guess. School for school, personal is separated as well... Or maybe temporary mails for temporary purposes
04:14:23 <cn3m[m]> iCloud might be the middle ground if you have any iThings
04:14:33 <bulletproofman[m> I think that compartmentalizing makes the most sense. Emails and browsers
04:14:44 <cn3m[m]> multiple browsers is bad for security
04:14:53 <cn3m[m]> more trust and more attack surface
04:15:19 <furofuro_01[m]> Profiles in one browser then?
04:15:24 <furofuro_01[m]> For PC
04:15:26 <cn3m[m]> you could
04:15:35 <bulletproofman[m> I disagree
04:15:37 <cn3m[m]> I use multiple UC profiles sometimes
04:15:49 <bulletproofman[m> fingerprint varies from browser to browser
04:16:05 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org fingerprinting is a joke
04:16:17 <bulletproofman[m> what
04:16:24 <bulletproofman[m> no are you serious
04:16:26 <cn3m[m]> Mozilla found 3.5% of sites use fingerprinting and it is only canvas the vast majority of the time
04:16:56 <cn3m[m]> if someone really tried they could state fingerprint and you would be a little screwed
04:17:24 <cn3m[m]> fingerprinting is not something you should worry about too much
04:18:13 <furofuro_01[m]> Should ISP mask through VPN must be more of priority than fingerprint resist?
04:18:27 <bulletproofman[m> That is just very confusing. Fingerprinting is how google chains your ID with the machine you are using
04:18:32 <bulletproofman[m> facebook too
04:18:40 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org cookies mostly
04:18:42 <cn3m[m]> and maybe canvas in some cases
04:18:46 <cn3m[m]> it's highly overrated
04:19:02 <cn3m[m]> both of those are blocked by adblockers anyway
04:19:10 <bulletproofman[m> how do yoiu know this
04:19:18 <cn3m[m]>  @furofuro_01:matrix.org /shrug
04:19:20 <cn3m[m]> if you want real privacy use Whonix
04:19:31 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "how do yoiu know this"> check the code
04:19:49 <bulletproofman[m> Okay then.
04:20:05 <cn3m[m]> Tor Browser has a good effort on anti fingerprinting even on the state level
04:20:12 <bulletproofman[m> Whonix does work on qubes
04:20:17 <bulletproofman[m> yes that's why i love tor
04:20:31 <cn3m[m]> Whonix works on anything
04:20:31 <bulletproofman[m> it makes everyone look the same <3
04:20:47 <cn3m[m]> Tor Browser is incredibly flawed
04:20:52 <cn3m[m]> especially with security
04:20:53 <cn3m[m]> it's just better than most
04:21:01 <bulletproofman[m> gecko's fault
04:21:11 <bulletproofman[m> if tor was based on chromium
04:21:22 <cn3m[m]> read the usage guide on GrapheneOS for a high level overview
04:21:24 <bulletproofman[m> would it be better technically speaking
04:21:26 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "if tor was based on chromium"> that would actually be worse
04:21:40 <cn3m[m]> Chromium has issues with proxy leaking
04:21:55 <cn3m[m]> that's why they don't use it
04:22:11 <cn3m[m]> Chromium is good for everything but For
04:22:21 <cn3m[m]> Tor*
04:22:22 <bulletproofman[m> guess i'll stick with whonis for porn u_u
04:22:36 <cn3m[m]> porn just watch with chromium and a VPN
04:22:37 <cn3m[m]> it's fine
04:22:52 <cn3m[m]> adblocker and vpn foils most real world issues
04:23:02 <nickcalyx[m]> <bulletproofman[m "if tor was based on chromium"> the thing is, firefox funds Tor majorly.. doubles donations to them, and works with them very tightly on development.  This is done at the organizational level.  Every Tor developer meeting has a dozen firefox staff there.   I doubt Google would support Tor's mission like that
04:23:29 <nickcalyx[m]> I mean, I know Google wouldn't and doesn't and never has
04:23:49 <cn3m[m]> Mozilla needs Tor so they can falsely sell themselves as a privacy friendly company
04:24:05 <cn3m[m]> it's an unhealthy relationship, but Tor needs the proxy support
04:24:31 <bulletproofman[m> Speaking of privacy friendly company , what search engine do u use
04:24:44 <cn3m[m]> DuckDuckGo
04:24:51 <nickcalyx[m]> how much more privacy friendly could Mozilla be than to give hundreds of thousands in cash to Tor and probably millions in worker-hours
04:25:10 <nickcalyx[m]> I don't see how Mozilla could be said to be not privacy friendly
04:25:34 <fluoridatedsheep> duck duck goose i assume, but we will never know how the search ends due to their privacy model
04:25:36 <furofuro_01[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "how much more privacy friendly c"> Privacy-friendly configuration out of the box
04:25:52 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "how much more privacy friendly c"> they have worse differential privacy than Chrome. They have tons of hidden telemetry even to Google you can't block easily. They have shipped ads. They also engage is privacy theater
04:25:59 <furofuro_01[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "how much more privacy friendly c"> Removing unnecessary telemetry and default-browser checking
04:26:00 <nickcalyx[m]> what's not privacy friendly about firefox's configuratoin
04:26:02 <cn3m[m]> they invest in Tor since it pays in reputation
04:26:42 <nickcalyx[m]> I don't think almost anyone in the general public knows that Mozilla funds Tor
04:26:42 <cn3m[m]> Firefox has extremely poor privacy out of the box
04:26:42 <fluoridatedsheep> That is the scary thing about privacy. money talks. and blank checks talk even more
04:26:46 <nickcalyx[m]> if they are doing that for PR reasons then they are getting ripped off
04:26:51 <cn3m[m]> and makes it hard to fix
04:26:51 <cn3m[m]> even PTIO guide doesn't fix it
04:27:02 <cn3m[m]> Mozilla just wants market share
04:27:18 <cn3m[m]> I don't know, they get a lot of credit in the media
04:27:19 <nickcalyx[m]> <cn3m[m] "Mozilla just wants market share "> and what, google doesn't ?
04:27:30 <cn3m[m]> it helps
04:27:36 <fluoridatedsheep> SecBrowser is the best option for clearnet searching imo. but obv isnt perfect. I did configure chromium finally though
04:27:47 <cn3m[m]> Mozilla is using privacy to get that
04:27:47 <cn3m[m]> privacy theater*
04:28:21 <cn3m[m]> Google is just making a good browser and being upfront about how it works
04:29:28 <cn3m[m]> their telemetry data is more identifying than Chrome's and harder to turn off
04:29:48 <cn3m[m]> that's a very low bar
04:31:17 <fluoridatedsheep> so you think all telemetry is actually removed from chromium?
04:31:26 <fluoridatedsheep> given proper setting config
04:31:28 <cn3m[m]> you can check it yourself
04:31:42 <cn3m[m]> I have
04:32:15 <fluoridatedsheep> with proxies?
04:33:30 <cn3m[m]> mitm proxy works or even you can just look at traffic on an empty page open
04:34:19 <fluoridatedsheep> fair point, ill give it due dilligence. you a fan of brave or chromium better?
04:34:42 <cn3m[m]> Ungoogled Chromium is what I build
04:35:08 <cn3m[m]> Brave is the best out of the box
04:35:10 <cn3m[m]> it has issues though
04:36:17 <fluoridatedsheep> you compile from source? or is that available to dl?
04:36:32 <cn3m[m]> they don't do official builds
04:37:03 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: do you know iridium browser is based on chromium too
04:37:13 <cn3m[m]> ungoogled chromium is usually more popular with the untrusting types

05:26:37 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "someone use that vulnerability"> a vulnerability is not a backdoor
05:26:38 <cn3m[m]> everything has flaws
05:26:59 <cn3m[m]> IME and PSP are fine. x86 has much bigger issues s
05:27:03 <bulletproofman[m> let's just say they wer eable to track websites using tor on a vm
05:27:10 <bulletproofman[m> it's scary
05:27:34 <bulletproofman[m> i saw a demonstration and i was mind blown
05:28:00 <cn3m[m]> IME and PSP have some creative uses. IME is powering the anti evil maid(not directly). You also have microcode(which is in a very privledged position)
05:28:19 <cn3m[m]> however microcode is super important for security
05:28:33 <cn3m[m]> You can see dangerous companies like Purism screw this up for marketing
05:28:52 <bulletproofman[m> Yes i saw that daniel spoke about it
05:29:04 <cn3m[m]> they ship without updating microcode so it doesn't get "spyware" updates
05:29:04 <bulletproofman[m> man i was so excited for the librem
05:29:17 <cn3m[m]> and they don't sign firmware
05:29:20 <cn3m[m]> their laptops suck
05:29:23 <bulletproofman[m> wait a sec what laptops do u ppl use
05:29:37 <cn3m[m]> they can be intercepted and backdoored easily
05:30:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hey bulletproofman[m, if you're curious about really open hardware, check out the Talos II, or the Blackbird or Talos Lite. You'll get full schematics, full source code right down to the self boot engine and the BMC.
05:30:25 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "wait a sec what laptops do u ppl"> I'm looking forward to ARM MacBooks. HP/Dell Workstations are solid too.
05:30:41 <bulletproofman[m> I was considering a System76 / Starlabs for Qubes but i'm not really sure. I'm not knowledgable about hardwar
05:30:58 <bulletproofman[m> <TheJollyRoger "Hey bulletproofman, if you're cu"> aren't those like SUPER expensive.
05:31:33 <TheJollyRoger> bulletproofman[m: not really. I was one of the early adopters and I wanted to rice mine up a lot (I'm the captain of the famous "Morgan's Revenge"), so I paid a lot of money for mine but back then the Blackbird wasn't available;
05:31:54 <cn3m[m]> I would get a petty normal laptop tbh
05:32:01 <TheJollyRoger> If you already have a case, chassis, and PSU and monitor and keyboard, you could probably put together a Blackbird system for about the price of a gaming laptop.
05:32:14 <cn3m[m]> Pixelbook is impressive if you don't mind the OS
05:32:29 <TheJollyRoger> And it'll last longer, be more upgradeable, and these things are built like frickin' tanks. I expect to have mine for the next decade at least.
05:32:48 <bulletproofman[m> <TheJollyRoger "If you already have a case, chas"> I want to do photoshop and 3D work
05:33:36 <TheJollyRoger> My Talos II runs Blender, GIMP (yeah yeah, I know... not the greatest), LibreCAD, and Inkscape very well.
05:34:05 <JTL> What about Krita?
05:34:08 <TheJollyRoger> Before I switched operating systems I even had Unreal Tournament 4 running on it.
05:34:16 <bulletproofman[m> <TheJollyRoger "My Talos II runs Blender, GIMP ("> Blender, man i love blender. But that pricetag i'm gonna have to sell myself to the devil and never get it :'(
05:34:16 <JTL> I'll probably wait for the Talos III myself
05:34:18 <TheJollyRoger> Krita I haven't built yet. I can try merging that later though!
05:34:29 <JTL> :D
05:34:36 <JTL> I find it better than GIMP for some things
05:34:40 <TheJollyRoger> I bet XP.
05:34:54 <bulletproofman[m> Krita is for drawing tho
05:35:45 <TheJollyRoger> Something you may find kinda funny... at one point I had three graphics cards in the Morgan's Revenge, but there was just one issue and that's that CrossFireX is not supported anymore.
05:35:51 <TheJollyRoger> So I couldn't get them to work like that.
05:36:08 <JTL> CrossFire was always hit and miss
05:36:17 <bulletproofman[m> i'm more of an oline gamer myself. i haven't played in a lonnng time because of school
05:36:22 <TheJollyRoger> But I could've at least run ten monitors :P.
05:36:34 <JTL> I wanted to try it about 10 years ago but I've had terrible luck with single GPU setups anyways
05:36:36 <JTL> lol
05:36:36 <TheJollyRoger> (Unfortunately, I didn't have enough to do that)
05:37:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... I've run SLI before, back in ~2012 but... I found it to be really not worth the bricks of cash I dumped into it.
05:37:43 <TheJollyRoger> I used to think "If you have two times the amount of computer chips, you will have two times the amount of compute!" but it didn't turn out that way.
05:38:25 <JTL> See also, what happened with Bulldozer
05:38:34 <JTL> Same concept
05:39:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
05:39:27 <TheJollyRoger> Although I have noticed that having two CPUs is actually really nice.
05:39:52 <bulletproofman[m> guys i saw this thing called grsecurity, snowden recommends it. anybody has any idea about the technicallities
05:39:56 <TheJollyRoger> Since now I can multitask a lot more :P.

05:46:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... P.-(
05:47:05 <zaxxa[m]> TheJollyRoger
05:47:57 <zaxxa[m]> Do you remember the discussion you shared about using veracrypt to encrypt files and then put into the cloud?
05:48:38 <zaxxa[m]> Does that issue also apply to putting keypassxc backups onto the cloud?
05:48:59 <cn3m[m]> Daniel Micay is really the only guy making alternatives

05:49:51 <zaxxa[m]> Ok thanks
05:50:11 <cn3m[m]> linux-hardened and hardened_malloc is a pretty good combo
05:52:02 <cn3m[m]> I had an arch server with those
05:52:11 <cn3m[m]> baller security
05:52:14 <bulletproofman[m> Funny i just had problems
05:52:22 <bulletproofman[m> My fckin vpn is screwing me over
05:52:32 <bulletproofman[m> I just got riot for phone
05:52:37 <bulletproofman[m> Called it a day
05:53:05 <bulletproofman[m> My wifi adapter suddenly stoped working
05:53:10 <bulletproofman[m> I don't get it
05:53:17 <bulletproofman[m> Like literally just stopped
05:53:32 <bulletproofman[m> It shows no connections available lol
05:56:56 <bulletproofman[m> Is it me
05:57:01 <bulletproofman[m> Or no one's talking
05:57:08 <TheJollyRoger> hey bulletproofman[m nope you're still here.
05:57:16 <TheJollyRoger> At least on the IRC side, I can see you.
05:57:19 <bulletproofman[m> Off thank god. Arr!
05:57:54 <TheJollyRoger> Ehehe ^_^. Shiver me timbers though, this ship has had quality of service issues with Matrix before, I daresay...
05:58:02 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m:  You said Linux-Hardneded now waht
05:58:40 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: This ship is bewitched !
05:58:57 <cn3m[m]> it's Daniel's kernel for GrapheneOS
05:59:00 <cn3m[m]> it can be used anywhere
05:59:02 <cn3m[m]> still better to use Windows or macOS or ChromeOS
05:59:15 <cn3m[m]> no desktop security model for Linux
05:59:29 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Well, when I save money i'll get me a macos.
05:59:44 <bulletproofman[m> For now, guess i'm just gonna stick to windows...
05:59:47 <jalb66> Google delays the Android 11 Beta announcement as protests roil US cities: https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21275399/google-delays-android-11-beta-announcement-protests-george-floyd
05:59:55 <bulletproofman[m> Boy it irks me so bad
06:00:23 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 looks good
06:00:34 <bulletproofman[m> What does it add ?
06:00:37 <cn3m[m]> I might switch to it
06:00:52 <jalb66> bulletproofman[m, more security
06:01:16 <cn3m[m]> better scoped storage, some limits on reading the package list, and various tweaks
06:01:19 <bulletproofman[m> I know android 10 thanks to daniel has many privavy features particularly restrictions for unchangeable Identifiers access
06:01:52 <zaxxa[m]> Android 10 system wide dark mode was pretty sweet too..
06:02:06 <cn3m[m]> Android 7 and 9 were huge security jumps
06:02:18 <cn3m[m]> 8,10,11 are big privacy jumps
06:02:47 <bulletproofman[m> This is exciting 😁😁
06:03:26 <cn3m[m]> Android is trying hard to catch-up to iOS and GrapheneOS
06:03:44 <bulletproofman[m> Oh
06:03:51 <bulletproofman[m> I just remembered something
06:03:56 <bulletproofman[m> SMART TVs
06:03:59 <bulletproofman[m> What about em?
06:04:20 <cn3m[m]> I dunno
06:04:26 <chani> bulletproofman[m: an oxymoron
06:04:27 <cn3m[m]> I don't really care
06:04:34 <cn3m[m]> I would just disconnect them
06:04:42 <bulletproofman[m> That-s not enough
06:04:55 <bulletproofman[m> Samsung TVs connect to nearby open wifis
06:05:05 <bulletproofman[m> Some don't work without interner connection
06:05:09 <bulletproofman[m> There is ACR
06:05:16 <bulletproofman[m> So many privacy issues
06:05:23 <bulletproofman[m> Acr is automatic content recognition
06:05:26 <cn3m[m]> then be careful what you buy and how you use it
06:05:44 <bulletproofman[m> I was thinking an apple tv
06:05:48 <bulletproofman[m> Would make sense
06:06:04 <cn3m[m]> I dunno I use a desktop monitor
06:06:18 <cn3m[m]> that's not spying on me thank goodness
06:06:19 <bulletproofman[m> I want that big 4k tv with all the fun stuff
06:06:28 <bulletproofman[m> There are spectre tvs
06:06:33 <bulletproofman[m> Dumb 4k tvs
06:09:12 <yolotrolo[m]> zaxxa was u speaking about the problem of uploading multiples copies of an encrypted files using the same password? because keepass isn't affected by that you can read more on their website

06:09:34 <bulletproofman[m> Oh yeah veracrypt i use it sometimes
06:09:59 <bulletproofman[m> But wouldn-t be more convenient to use something like Tresorit cloud
06:10:10 <bulletproofman[m> Or maybe hetzner with nextcloud
06:11:14 <jalb66> I only use a gpg command

06:13:46 <TheJollyRoger> yolotrolo[m]: yeah, that's the one. Thanks, glad to hear!
06:13:51 <zaxxa[m]> >  * zaxxa was u speaking about the problem of uploading multiples copies of an encrypted file using the same password? because keepass isn't affected by that you can read more on their website
06:13:52 <zaxxa[m]> Just uploading one copy but the cloud backup service making several copies of that, therefore weakening the encryption(I think?) that veracrypt uses. But it was explained that vetacrypt wasn't designed to be used for this purpose anyway.
06:14:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's outside the threat model of XTS mode.
06:14:10 * yolotrolo[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/fVpAfBaYZxNZXMrFRCsBcUoK >
06:14:25 <yolotrolo[m]>  * ok here the answer: https://keepass.info/help/base/security.html#secencrypt "An initialization vector (IV) is generated randomly each time a database is saved. Thus, multiple databases encrypted with the same
06:14:25 <yolotrolo[m]> master key (e.g. backups) are no problem."
06:14:36 <TheJollyRoger> beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
06:14:44 <zaxxa[m]> <yolotrolo[m] " * zaxxa was u speaking about th"> > yolotrolo: yeah, that's the one. Thanks, glad to hear!
06:14:45 <bulletproofman[m> Wouldn-t using cryptomator make sense ?
06:14:59 <TheJollyRoger> bulletproofman[m: I prefer to use age now, it uses AES in GCM.
06:15:09 <TheJollyRoger> Which is an AEAD mode of functioning!
06:15:29 <bulletproofman[m> AES is quantum resistant right
06:16:12 <TheJollyRoger> bulletproofman[m: with a preshared key, yes. With keys established via key exchange done via diffie hellman or RSA key exchange, no.
06:16:34 <zaxxa[m]> yolotrolo: would the same apply to keypassXC?
06:16:52 <yolotrolo[m]> yea i guess so
06:17:09 <TheJollyRoger> So data encrypted with a password will remain safe.
06:17:19 <TheJollyRoger> (Assuming your password's good.)
06:19:21 <TheJollyRoger> But if the key exchange is broken, then someone who breaks the key agreement or key exchange algorithm can simply obtain the keys, without breaking the cipher.
06:22:02 <bulletproofman[m> Alright thanks
06:22:08 <bulletproofman[m> Guys what hour is it in usa
06:22:35 <yolotrolo[m]> usa have multiples timezones
06:22:48 <TheJollyRoger> If you're on the east coast, it's probably around half past three in the morning. If you're on the west it's probably getting close to midnight or so.
06:23:01 <TheJollyRoger> Everywhere inbetween, between those two.
06:23:08 <bulletproofman[m> Oh shit it's very late there
06:23:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
06:23:21 <bulletproofman[m> It's 7:23 here
06:23:34 <bulletproofman[m> G'bye sleep
06:27:43 <bulletproofman[m> Wait
06:27:51 <bulletproofman[m> I still want to ask about OpenBSD
06:27:53 <bulletproofman[m> Fml
06:28:03 <bulletproofman[m> Anybody still alive ?
06:28:07 <TheJollyRoger> I'm still here!
06:28:17 <bulletproofman[m> Arrr !
06:28:22 <TheJollyRoger> P.-)
06:28:53 <bulletproofman[m> So captain, what do you think of the OpenBSD ship
06:29:25 <TheJollyRoger> I run OpenBSD on my Hardware Monitoring Console, but the reason I run it might surprise you: it's because it comes with the utilities I need off the bat. The HMC actually isn't connected to the internet, I removed its speakers and wireless card.
06:29:57 <bulletproofman[m> Is it better than linux?
06:30:07 <TheJollyRoger> I think OpenBSD's contributions to the open source community can't be denied. But its security model is contingent upon only running trusted code.
06:30:17 <cn3m[m]> OpenBSD is terrible for desktp
06:30:36 <cn3m[m]> beside that it's pretty decent
06:30:59 <bulletproofman[m> Huh that's interesting..is it because of hardware sumport
06:31:04 <bulletproofman[m> Support ?
06:31:09 <TheJollyRoger> It doesn't have any of the exploit mitigations, mandatory access controls, or ways to contain untrustworthy applications and mitigate exploits.
06:31:32 <bulletproofman[m> Oh i see
06:31:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, it has Pledge and Unveil... but remember that in order to use Pledge and Unveil, the programs /need to be coded to be aware of them/.
06:31:54 <bulletproofman[m> What about Arch, didn't daniel contribute to.it.smth
06:32:36 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "Huh that's interesting..is it be"> no there's no sandboxing
06:32:39 <TheJollyRoger> Arch is nice because it's got opinionated defaults, but remains close to upstream as the upstream authors intended their software to be used.
06:32:56 <cn3m[m]> Arch is okay
06:33:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Again, OpenBSD makes the assumption that you are only running trustworthy code.
06:33:11 <bulletproofman[m> So arch is like a good linux ?
06:33:16 <TheJollyRoger> And that you won't ever run anyone else's programs.
06:33:49 <TheJollyRoger> When people talk about "OpenBSD Security" they tend to forget this assumption.
06:33:50 <cn3m[m]> Arch isn't that much better
06:33:50 <bulletproofman[m> <TheJollyRoger "And that you won't ever run anyo"> So it has a flaw premise. Got it.
06:33:55 <cn3m[m]> it still is a decade or more behind
06:34:17 <bulletproofman[m> But- But Arch is like cool and studf
06:34:25 <bulletproofman[m> Besides you can use Manjaro
06:34:53 <cn3m[m]> Manjaro has a terrible update script
06:34:57 <cn3m[m]> they are well behind too
06:34:59 <cn3m[m]> just don't bother
06:34:59 <TheJollyRoger> bulletproofman[m: well, I wouldn't say it's a flawed premise, it's more that OpenBSD considers security of your applications to be beyond the scope of their project. It's not something that's their responsibility.
06:35:33 <bulletproofman[m> <TheJollyRoger "bulletproofman: well, I wouldn't"> Imo that's a flawed approach but yeah
06:35:53 * TheJollyRoger grimaces.
06:35:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
06:36:01 <bulletproofman[m> Aw man :( no linux for me i guess
06:36:19 <yolotrolo[m]> i hate the rolling release distros, there is always something that break and you have to fix it manually
06:36:20 <cn3m[m]> Linux and BSD aren't well off right now
06:36:54 * TheJollyRoger cackles.
06:36:55 <bulletproofman[m> It's why i use ubuntu. But well i'm going back.to.windows.
06:37:08 <TheJollyRoger> Oh man, don't I know it... heh, I usually end up breaking my system pretty often ahahahahaha
06:37:37 <TheJollyRoger> Then again I guess that's what I get for adding the test  keywords to everything :D
06:39:01 <bulletproofman[m> I physically
06:39:07 <bulletproofman[m> Break everything
06:39:10 <bulletproofman[m> I'm clumsy af
06:39:33 <bulletproofman[m> Both my laptops are broken in someway and my.phone screen is crackes the House.
06:39:39 <TheJollyRoger> Oh noooo :(
06:39:47 <bulletproofman[m> My phone fell sooo many times
06:39:55 <bulletproofman[m> I'm surprised it still functions
06:40:02 <TheJollyRoger> To be honest I wouldn't feel bad about going back to Windows, from Ubuntu. I would much rather use Windows than Ubuntu.
06:40:18 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: But it's smooth and fast
06:40:35 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: How come
06:40:50 <bulletproofman[m> Even my old 3 gig core duo machine runs ubuntu fine
06:40:56 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, I'm terrified of dropping my phone too; I keep it in a large UAG case with thick bumpers and have a glass screen protector on it, it's saved my phone before.
06:41:03 <bulletproofman[m> That's one of the main things why i like linux.
06:41:28 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: A good tip for my future phone. Whicb will hopefully be graphene
06:41:52 <TheJollyRoger> bulletproofman[m: partially, it's that because Debian is the upstream provider for Ubuntu, this means that what they do is they freeze packages in time and then backport security fixes for them if they become aware of the availability of those fixes.
06:42:30 <chani> TheJollyRoger: I've always used otterboxes, is there an advantage to the UAG cases?
06:42:36 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: All of the distros ran fasr af
06:42:42 <TheJollyRoger> This might seem great in theory, but what happens in practice tends to be that this is contingent upon them becoming aware of the problems and being able to backport them.
06:42:58 <TheJollyRoger> It also depends on maintainer attentiveness and diligence, and there's an ugly side to this:
06:43:10 <zaxxa[m]> My pixel 3a has a Spigen case
06:43:18 <TheJollyRoger> chani: they look nice! That's why I picked them :D
06:43:32 <chani> TheJollyRoger: a good enough reason
06:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> That ugly side is, as time goes on, they begin to drift further and further and further away from upstream, and this means missing out on fixes that upstream has. In fact, this can actually /cause/ vulnerabilities, as we've seen before with Debian, OpenSSL, and even Firefox ESR.
06:44:36 <chani> I was a little surprised when I got the 3a that the otterbox for it doesn't have a screen cover.
06:44:38 <zaxxa[m]> You guys have permanently scared me of Linux for life in desktops lol
06:44:47 <chani> zaxxa[m]: what do you think of it?
06:44:48 <zaxxa[m]> Off*
06:44:57 <TheJollyRoger> So add that to that now Ubuntu is /further/ adding more cruft onto that, and using packages from the testing and unstable repositories as well...
06:45:23 <TheJollyRoger> The adage "the crap flows downstream" starts to really rear its ugly head.
06:45:28 <zaxxa[m]> Yeah I like my case a lot but it may not be suitable for everyone since it's a little bulky
06:45:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I actually ended up ordering two cases by mistake, one of which was a Spigen (I forgot to erase it from my cart).
06:45:56 <TheJollyRoger> I like the spigen one because it's slimmer!
06:46:17 <TheJollyRoger> Something else that may surprise you...
06:46:27 <zaxxa[m]> I got the "tough armour" one
06:46:27 <jalb66> zaxxa[m], I never had problems with GNU/Linux in many many years and at least they don't send information about me out there when I start. I know it's not secure and the kernel is horrible with bugs, but...
06:46:32 <cn3m[m]> I have some links on Linux issues if anyone is interested
06:46:48 <chani> I drop my phone a lot (I have a terrible case of the butterfingers) and I've never damaged a phone in an otterbox
06:46:57 <bulletproofman[m> Just ducked the Uag case
06:46:58 <TheJollyRoger> Windows has been moving more and more in the direction to mitigate exploits and have some amount of security model: for instance, around the time of Vista, Microsoft were experimenting with graphical interface isolation.
06:47:03 <bulletproofman[m> It looks so sexy
06:47:04 <zaxxa[m]> Yes, I am interested
06:47:08 <chani> but it drives me nuts that the rubber outer part wears out over time and you have to replace it
06:47:09 <TheJollyRoger> So when you type your password into the UAC prompt, other applications can't read it.
06:47:13 <bulletproofman[m> I love it
06:47:45 <chani> TheJollyRoger: i involuntarily shuddered when you mentioned vista
06:48:07 <TheJollyRoger> On Linux, X11 by design allows the windows to share keystrokes. This includes the browser that's running random ass javascript off the internet.
06:48:07 <cn3m[m]> https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation#Setting_up_a_fake_sudo
06:48:36 <cn3m[m]> https://forums.whonix.org/t/fixing-the-desktop-linux-security-model/9172
06:48:42 <TheJollyRoger> chani: heh, yeah, I know what you mean... I was one of the unfortunate souls that had an Nvidia graphics card at the launch. My laptop exploded, and I had to buy a new one at just the moment Vista launched.
06:48:48 <TheJollyRoger> So that was pretty rocky.
06:48:51 <chani> ooooh
06:48:55 <chani> bad timing
06:48:56 <bulletproofman[m> I miss Windows 7 so much.
06:48:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
06:49:08 <bulletproofman[m> I'm feeling emotional.
06:49:09 <chani> I was working in tech support when vista was rolled out
06:49:11 <bulletproofman[m> Nostalgic.
06:49:12 <bulletproofman[m> Hurt.
06:49:12 <chani> it was a nightmare
06:49:25 <TheJollyRoger> Until Service Pack 1 came out and NVIDIA fixed their drivers, I had to run my computer in Safe Mode :(
06:49:28 <zaxxa[m]> > zaxxa, I never had problems with GNU/Linux in many many years and at least they don't send information about me out there when I start. I know it's not secure and the kernel is horrible with bugs, but...
06:49:28 <zaxxa[m]> I used a raspberry pi as my first experience, primarily to learn programming. Inkscape was buggy, the browser was outdated and the software I needed was there but did not have the plugin support
06:49:33 <TheJollyRoger> chani: oh good gravy.
06:49:36 * TheJollyRoger offers rum!
06:49:36 <bulletproofman[m> Gone are the days of Windows 7.
06:49:51 <bulletproofman[m> Oh Windows 7, I will never forget you.
06:50:00 * TheJollyRoger takes off his hat.
06:50:03 <TheJollyRoger> P.-(
06:50:07 <bulletproofman[m> You will always have a special place in my heart'
06:50:15 <bulletproofman[m> ❤
06:50:41 <chani> TheJollyRoger: the shop I worked at had to institute a policy that we would not support downgrading from Vista to XP. We couldn't keep up with the demand
06:51:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yipes.
06:51:20 <JTL> I think Vista could've been a decent OS, it's main issues were out of date drivers intersecting with the rapid evolution of technology (Moores law)
06:51:34 <JTL> "Why does it take 10 minutes to boot on my old Pentium III from 2000?"
06:52:10 <bulletproofman[m> Wtf my texts lagged
06:52:11 <bulletproofman[m> Sorry guys i'm lagging bad
06:52:32 <bulletproofman[m> I'm lagging really bad brb'
06:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> JTL argh, yeah I agree :(
06:53:59 <TheJollyRoger> Once SP1 and Nvidia got their rear in gear and fixed the drivers, things improved a bit, although unfortunately by that point my crappy Compaq laptop was starting to fall apart at the seams.
06:54:38 <TheJollyRoger> I swear they make those things to fail just out of warranty, so now I go by the mantra of "buy nice, or buy twice."
06:55:52 <chani> TheJollyRoger: i think you're right, I constantly saw hp/compaqs around that time frame that failed earlier than it seemed like they should have
06:56:28 <chani> I had a thinkpad with an nvidia gpu then, and I remember that darn thing gave me trouble on vista until the day i got rid of it
07:00:01 <bulletproofman[m> I never asked about Kali linux
07:01:39 <jalb66> bulletproofman[m, = questionman 😀 😉
07:02:59 <bulletproofman[m> Because i only recently had these revelations. I used to think that iOS is the devil and linux is the most secure thing ever
07:03:17 <TheJollyRoger> chani: sheesh, yikes >_<.
07:03:24 <cn3m[m]> iOS is the devil to advertisers
07:03:26 <bulletproofman[m> It's a slap to my face. So now i'm just questionning everything
07:03:32 <cn3m[m]> source: me
07:03:46 <jalb66> cn3m[m] posted some links before 🙂
07:03:46 <bulletproofman[m> What if everything i thought was wrong.
07:04:32 <bulletproofman[m> That-s why i'm asking too many questions. I know i can come off as very annoying but i genuinely want to know the truth. Because it makes me feel safe.
07:05:05 <jalb66> bulletproofman[m, it was a joke about your nickname 😉
07:05:10 <TheJollyRoger> It's no problem :)! We all start somewhere! I always consider myself to be a learner behind the keyboard.
07:05:37 <bulletproofman[m> jalb66: should've rolled with that instead lol
07:05:42 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "That-s why i'm asking too many q"> you're not asking too many questions
07:05:53 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: thanks cap. Arr!
07:05:57 <jalb66> bulletproofman[m, lol
07:06:19 <dazinism> hypokeimenon: you know much about Shiftphones? They not so well known outside Germany, I've had half an eye on them.
07:06:25 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: thanks man. I appreciate all the help you guys are giving for real.
07:06:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ye be welcome! :D
07:07:33 <jalb66> bulletproofman[m, we are all learning every day, me too, and asking questions 😉
07:07:54 <bulletproofman[m> jalb66👍
07:08:30 <bulletproofman[m> dazinism: They're like fairphones right ?
07:09:42 <dazinism> After a bit of research I got a Unicorn Beetle case for my Nexus 6P, was pretty happy with it. Came with a 'holder' you could clip it into which I never really used
07:10:21 <dazinism> I got one for my Pixel 3XL
07:11:30 <dazinism> With this can snap the phone in the holder screen facing in or out
07:12:04 <cn3m[m]> yeah I just learned that Xiaomi has Clang_CFI I wouldn't be surprised if they fucked it up, but they do
07:12:14 <cn3m[m]> I ate crow on that one
07:12:49 <dazinism> Worked out I could pop out a switch blank in my truck cab and it clips in secure - best phone mount I've had in a vehicle
07:12:53 <zaxxa[m]> Why does whonix have a "user freedom" mode, like if you didn't want those protections why would you wouldn't use whonix anyway?
07:13:12 <cn3m[m]> <zaxxa[m] "Why does whonix have a "user fre"> ask @madaidan.:matrix.org
07:14:21 <dazinism> bulletproofman: yeah, except they appear to get devices out quicker
07:17:01 <bulletproofman[m> My to buy list is Massive. I need a new phone either pixel 3a or iPhone SE 2. And a faraday. I also need a new laptop fuuuuuuuckkkk
07:17:37 <bulletproofman[m> Oh and camera covers toi
07:17:46 <bulletproofman[m> Too*
07:18:13 <dazinism> They are doing some convergence (phone/desktop) duel boot windows/android device.
07:18:30 <cn3m[m]> I'd go iPhone if you're starting out
07:18:35 <zaxxa[m]> A bit of foil tape can work
07:19:05 <cn3m[m]> only 2% of privacy people use Android without gapps
07:19:13 <cn3m[m]> it's hard I guess
07:19:33 <dazinism> I'm imaging its likely to be doing unspeakable things to verified boot and the filesystem sandbox
07:20:03 <dazinism> Maybe I'd be surprised
07:20:10 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: ur right. I think starting out with an iPhone makes sense. The more saavy i become i'll try out a pixel. I'm still following graphene's development and Android generally sleaking
07:20:46 <bulletproofman[m> Silent Pocket's faradays have good reviews
07:20:57 <zaxxa[m]> Just use airplane mode
07:21:22 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS would be cool to get on an old Pixel used especially if you want to develop
07:21:25 <bulletproofman[m> zaxxa: It's not enough foe location
07:21:58 <bulletproofman[m> Thinks like wifi triangulation
07:22:21 <cn3m[m]> that's false
07:22:34 <cn3m[m]> airplane mode is good
07:22:41 <cn3m[m]> Google and Apple at least
07:22:41 <dazinism> bulletproofman: WiFi is properly randomised/anonymous on Pixels
07:23:00 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: if you're on graphene sure but not iqphone
07:23:04 <bulletproofman[m> iPhone***
07:23:16 <dazinism> If you have to / like to leave it on
07:23:40 <zaxxa[m]> You need data for signal anyway..
07:23:51 <dazinism> Its entirely possible this isnt the case for other devices
07:24:12 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org out works for both
07:24:13 <zaxxa[m]> The main point of a phone is communication, so buying a Faraday cage, if it does work, defeats that purpose
07:24:22 <cn3m[m]> you're fine
07:25:10 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Does airplane mode really stop all the signals from going akd the location tracking both drom iPhone & Graphene?
07:25:10 <cn3m[m]> Google, Qualcomm, Apple don't want your device to lie about Airplane mode
07:25:18 <cn3m[m]> it hurts the battery and would hurt their reputation
07:25:32 <cn3m[m]> and your privacy
07:25:37 <cn3m[m]> they aren't going to let that happen
07:25:43 <dazinism> Not just GrapheneOS was developed for the Pixel 1 (IIRC) Nexus 5x got it also as it used the smart WiFi hardware
07:26:02 <dazinism> *same WiFi hardware
07:26:15 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Can you please elaborate more details
07:26:43 <bulletproofman[m> The issue for me is location tracking and if it can be stopped woth airplanr mdoe
07:26:45 <cn3m[m]> it's pretty simple they lock those down hard and won't let the modem talk
07:27:01 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org it will be stopped by airplane mode
07:27:16 <cn3m[m]> if it's not you have far larger issues
07:27:39 <dazinism> bulletproofman: its never been proven airplane mode doesnt work, and pretty sure a fair few folks have looked.
07:28:18 <dazinism> It was also a safety requirement
07:28:22 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: tbh I thought the location probes only lessened with iPhone is on standby
07:30:00 <cn3m[m]> let me guess /r/privacy?
07:30:17 <dazinism> Not very hard to check. Put a phone on airplane and drive about with a radio scanner, see if it transmits
07:30:29 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Actually a guy called Rob Braxman Tech on YT he does a lot of privacy and security things
07:30:44 <dazinism> Someone would have proved it
07:31:23 <bulletproofman[m> Does anybody here know Rob Braxman Tech on YouTube tbh i think his content is good
07:31:41 <bulletproofman[m> dazinism: thanks for the tips !
07:32:26 <bulletproofman[m> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmoJrLfk5fE
07:33:07 <zaxxa[m]> Seems to talk nonsense, I mean just listen to his intro on fdroid
07:33:58 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org oh Lord have mercy
07:33:58 <cn3m[m]> he's horrible
07:34:16 <cn3m[m]> he's a clown
07:34:32 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: You saw his content before ?
07:34:32 <cn3m[m]> I would debate him anytime any place
07:34:56 <cn3m[m]> yes
07:34:58 <cn3m[m]> it's a joke
07:34:59 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: That is BOLD. Elaborate. I watched many of his videos and live streams.
07:34:59 <cn3m[m]> he's terrible
07:35:44 <cn3m[m]> He pushes completely insecure crap that's totally unsupported and has no practical privacy
07:35:51 <cn3m[m]> think Linux Phones
07:35:53 <cn3m[m]> even Lineage is bad and he highly recommends that
07:36:36 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: What else exactly other than those ?
07:37:00 <cn3m[m]> he has bizarre claims about little details
07:37:09 <cn3m[m]> almost everything is a little bit wrong
07:37:10 <dazinism> Loads of folks like LineageOS and Linux phones
07:37:21 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Like what?
07:37:31 <zaxxa[m]> He sounds like a random guy who browsed r/privacy and then just made videos based on content he read there :/
07:37:52 <JTL> NEED THAT MARKOV BOT
07:37:54 <dazinism> I guess most of them dont understand the security issues
07:38:23 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Loads of folks like LineageOS an"> sure but they both break privacy and security measures and don't have vendor support
07:39:04 <dazinism> For most people LineageOS is the best way, that they know of, to get something like an AOSP phone
07:39:14 <cn3m[m]> Lineage patch levels are actively falsified across the board
07:39:18 <JTL> A semblance of an AOSP phone
07:39:33 <dazinism> Or that they can afford
07:39:48 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "For most people LineageOS is the"> Disable all Google apps and stock bloat and install Launcher3
07:40:08 <cn3m[m]> you keep security features and have the privacy
07:40:32 <cn3m[m]> Stock is almost always better debloated
07:40:37 <dazinism> Guess some people know about the security issues of Linux phone vs. Android, but like the idea of Linux phones for other reasons
07:41:19 <cn3m[m]> Linux phones have no meaningful sandboxing, WiFi privacy, or fingerprinting protection
07:41:54 <cn3m[m]> the security issues are extremely bad...
07:42:14 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: You have a point. Tbh I want to subscribe to some good channels
07:42:15 <dazinism> Many cheaper phones have spyware built into system components that break everything if you disable them (eg system file browser)
07:42:32 <bulletproofman[m> Currently subscribed to black hat, null byte and security now
07:42:44 <cn3m[m]> avoid security now
07:43:06 <JTL> I don't listne to many "mainstream" security people for these reasons
07:43:12 <JTL> I'll just leave it at that
07:43:40 <cn3m[m]> I'd only follow Black Hat and RSA Conference
07:44:01 <bulletproofman[m> Ok give me your top youtube channels and blogs/websites about security and privacy
07:44:05 <dazinism> Two security podcasts I like, Smashing Security & Risky Business dont think they stream video
07:44:19 <JTL> Risky Business is competent
07:44:25 <JTL> Co-host is (ex) pentester
07:44:53 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org I would use respected conferences mostly
07:45:07 <cn3m[m]> Twitter and Conferences is all I follow mostly
07:45:07 <dazinism> Smashing security is a good laugh. I like how they dont try and be all deadly serious / tough
07:45:39 <dazinism> JTL: think he still working
07:45:52 <JTL> Ah okay
07:45:58 <JTL> hence the ()
07:46:08 <JTL> (I was unsure)
07:46:13 <dazinism> 😃
07:46:14 <bulletproofman[m> What about michael bezzel
07:46:35 <dazinism> Michael often makes me cringe
07:47:02 <cn3m[m]> I would stick to Twitter when starting out
07:47:26 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: I'll make a twitter account soon.
07:47:44 <bulletproofman[m> But what's wrong with michael bazzel
07:47:58 <bulletproofman[m> I think his podcast is good
07:48:47 <dazinism> Not all his advise is that great
07:49:19 <JTL> and I dislike how people treat him as a "gospel" of sorts
07:49:29 <JTL> as in "the final reference"
07:49:32 <dazinism> Some stuff is interesting
07:49:33 <JTL> if you catch my drift
07:49:37 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: thoughts?
07:49:50 <cn3m[m]> yeah just avoid him
07:50:29 <JTL> Although I feel he's called out "certain communities" in a subtle manner in the past
07:50:36 <JTL> I'll just leave it at that
07:51:19 <bulletproofman[m> Alright I need a huge reform then.
07:51:29 <zaxxa[m]> Lol
07:51:51 <cn3m[m]> really start with mastering everything Daniel has every said ha
07:51:53 <dazinism> Think recent advise for best secure /private desktop was Ubuntu?
07:52:07 <cn3m[m]> read the site 3-5 times in it's entirety
07:52:08 <dazinism> (Michael )
07:52:12 <JTL> Yeah I disagree there
07:52:14 <zaxxa[m]> That reddit was the main source of misinformation for me
07:52:17 <cn3m[m]> then read his Reddit
07:52:26 <JTL> Ubuntu had Amazon ad tracking in the past
07:52:28 <JTL> </checkmate>
07:52:37 <zaxxa[m]> Once you get off there and read chats here you learn a lot more
07:52:37 <JTL> or some crap like that
07:53:14 <dazinism> Also....like...downstream from Debian
07:53:25 <zaxxa[m]> I'm referring to /r/privacy and also privacytools
07:53:31 <cn3m[m]> Debian is crap
07:53:32 <dazinism> Yeah they had Amazon
07:53:47 <JTL> dazinism: Yeah. I was going to get into that, but busy with other things atm :P
07:53:49 <cn3m[m]> /r/privacytoolsio is getting better
07:53:58 <cn3m[m]> I mean I comment more than everyone combined so
07:54:09 <cn3m[m]> I am biased
07:54:15 <dazinism> lol
07:54:17 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Afuck
07:54:34 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: I was gonna sk you about privacytools.io
07:55:30 <cn3m[m]> I would consider myself apart of that community
07:55:33 <cn3m[m]> I wouldn't recommend it though
07:56:19 <cn3m[m]> the site is alright beside recommending Firefox throws up a little and Lineage
07:57:19 <cn3m[m]> the provider and services recommendations are solid and we'll thought through
07:57:22 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > /r/privacytoolsio is getting better
07:57:22 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > I mean I comment more than everyone combined so
07:57:22 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Connection? *I think sooooo*
07:58:12 <dazinism> JTL: called out communities.... interesting,  not been an avid listener
07:58:27 <bulletproofman[m> They recommend qubes, fedora, debian, tails, arch, trisquel, whonix
07:58:38 <bulletproofman[m> And openbsd
07:58:50 <cn3m[m]> yeah ignore the software sections
07:59:08 <cn3m[m]> it's all pretty bad the services and providers are excellent though
08:00:01 <bulletproofman[m> Keybase was bought by zoom?
08:00:15 <JTL> Yeah, a few weeks ago
08:01:51 <dazinism> Would like to say, think theres some valid arguments to using Linux desktop, but security isn't one of them.
08:02:37 <bulletproofman[m> Wait a moment, they recommend Mullvad. I used to want to get TorGuard VPN.
08:02:56 <cn3m[m]> TorGuard lul
08:03:26 <dazinism> Mainly to do with the (somewhat) open development model and crucial decisions being shared by more than one big corp
08:03:40 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: what now :(
08:06:37 <dazinism> Think its not great for humanity to have the development of the (end user) operating systems on which so much depends largely done by three massive US corps
08:08:46 <cn3m[m]> Sure, but that doesn't excuse their complete disregard for the safety of their users
08:08:46 <dazinism> Thats some centralisation of power, that I dont think is healthy
08:09:46 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: What's wrong with TorGuard? Should i just use mullvad. I really like the idea behind it. But i like how TorGuard has many features.
08:11:19 <cn3m[m]> I'll get you some resources
08:11:57 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: i'm anticipating 🙂
08:13:34 <dazinism> cn3m: I dont know that its a complete disregard. Just pretty difficult (impossible?) for anyone to keep up with the huge resources being poured into security by Apple / Microsoft / Google
08:14:21 <dazinism> It wasnt many years ago Android was (somewhat correctly compared to iPhones) considered a joke OS
08:14:22 <zaxxa[m]> Does anyone find that they get extra white space on the right and bottom of all pdf documents when you zoom out fully with secure pdf viewer?
08:14:54 <dazinism> security wise
08:14:55 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "It wasnt many years ago Android "> non Pixels that's still true
08:16:00 <cn3m[m]> And privacy wise
08:16:04 <dazinism> So writing everything off completely because they dont match now, doesnt give a chance for anything to match in the future
08:16:26 <cn3m[m]> even GrapheneOS which is worlds ahead still has some minor weaknesses compared to a tweaked iOS for privacy
08:16:51 <cn3m[m]> Privacy and security Android has deep rooted issues
08:16:54 <dazinism> Although I'm obv liking the GrapheneOS model. Build from the best of open source
08:17:11 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS and Pixels do excellent work
08:17:24 <cn3m[m]> it's highly underated
08:17:41 <dazinism> Takes time
08:17:54 <dazinism> For people to realise
08:18:13 <bulletproofman[m> I used to read Nakedsecurity blog it's pretty nice what do you guys think ?
08:18:17 <cn3m[m]> true, Google only forces 1 year of quartlies
08:18:31 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "I used to read Nakedsecurity blo"> it's fine

08:19:54 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "I wouldn't recommend it really"> Why tho?
08:20:21 <cn3m[m]> they have some privacy and security theater
08:20:21 <cn3m[m]> like DoT
08:21:18 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: oh got it. What about bruce shcneier's blog
08:22:14 <JTL> Speaking of which
08:22:15 <JTL> https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/05/bogus_security_.html
08:22:22 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org The biggest things with TorGuard is aggressive marketing. Trying to find the YouTuber's name that's in question. They also take advantage of the Tor name imo
08:22:24 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org he's more theoretical and I like his way of thinking
08:22:27 <JTL> a 128MB USB stick. And I'll leave it at that
08:23:34 <cn3m[m]> honestly
08:23:52 <cn3m[m]> you have a ton of resources from reading Daniel's writings
08:23:55 <cn3m[m]> I'd just crank that out
08:24:31 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: The torguard thing i saw Tom Spark Reviews that's why i was interested in him.
08:24:55 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: guess i'm sticking to mullvad.
08:25:17 <cn3m[m]> Tom Spark
08:25:21 <cn3m[m]> yeah he's terrible
08:25:23 <cn3m[m]> he's a huge sellout
08:25:25 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Yes, I will be making a Twitter account soooon.
08:25:27 <cn3m[m]> Techlore(not that I am a fan) has had real issues with hi.
08:25:48 <cn3m[m]> read the grapheneos website over 5 times
08:26:00 <cn3m[m]> even the build guide
08:26:01 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Tom Spark was doxxed by proton though.
08:26:01 <cn3m[m]> that's huge resource
08:26:09 <cn3m[m]> and his Reddit is excellent
08:26:22 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: I will jeez. I read the FAQ and usage already.
08:26:49 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: I've yet to go thru his entire reddit post. Boy it get heated up.
08:27:12 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Techlore uses graphene too
08:28:19 <cn3m[m]>   @bulletproofman:matrix.org https://nm.reddit.com/user/DanielMicay/comments/?sort=top
08:28:40 <cn3m[m]> just start with his top posts
08:29:18 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m:Alright, i'll put it on my notes app. Btw Is mullvad good i really wanna use it. It's afffordable
08:30:14 <cn3m[m]> sure
08:30:16 <cn3m[m]> I just use ProtonVPN free
08:30:22 <cn3m[m]> blending in

08:33:16 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: hold on
08:43:20 <bulletproofman[m> Ok i have no idea where that came from but watch this from minute 5:00 it has some other claims https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR8w4SsdFZQ

08:59:15 <bulletproofman[m> Are you guys still here ?
08:59:40 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m did you see the video?
09:01:26 <cn3m[m]> I just finished it
09:01:42 <cn3m[m]> there was nothing substantial (at least that hasn't been debunked)
09:01:50 <cn3m[m]> Also have to consider the messenger
09:02:32 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Like what ?
09:03:58 <cn3m[m]> What is the claim you think is so damaging?
09:04:39 <jalb66> bulletproofman[m, Mullvad is great
09:07:57 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: tbh it's the e2e one and the real time monitoring claim and the claims by restoreprivacy
09:12:10 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org that site is known to be bought and sold just like Tom Sparks
09:12:12 <cn3m[m]> check PTIO
09:12:13 <dlm-johannes[m]> What is the best browser on regular Android
09:12:28 <jalb66> Do you know if it's possible to install GOS (even if it's not supported) in an Android One smartphone?. If I'm not wrong I read about GOs installed in other devices but without the protection Pixels have. Another term is how to install it in a Nokia phone and if it will get a verified boot or not
09:12:33 <cn3m[m]> they have debunked them consistently
09:12:37 <cn3m[m]>  @dlm-johannes:matrix.org you mean non Vanadium?
09:12:50 <cn3m[m]> Bromite is the only other recommended browser
09:12:54 <zaxxa[m]> dlm-johannes  Vanadium, then bromite
09:13:11 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: PTIO ? What is it
09:13:15 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "Do you know if it's possible to "> Nokia phones have a locked bootloader. Just disable gapps and you're set
09:13:29 <zaxxa[m]> PTIO is privacytoolsio
09:13:32 <cn3m[m]> it's poor man's GrapheneOS and it's good enough imo
09:13:33 <dlm-johannes[m]> Ok. Can i get it on a regular phone? I didnt find it on f droid
09:13:41 <jalb66> cn3m[m], do yoiu know if HMD Global let users to unlock it?
09:13:51 <cn3m[m]> Bromite is the only option on a regular phone
09:14:05 <jalb66> Yes, i did that in the past. Just asking if it's possible or if you know about HMD Global
09:14:08 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "cn3m, do yoiu know if HMD Global"> from my understanding not
09:14:10 <cn3m[m]> if you can it doesn't support custom keys
09:14:22 <jalb66> cn3m[m], thanks
09:14:34 <cn3m[m]> the only Android One phones remotely considerable are the X4 and A2, but they are both too old
09:15:27 <cn3m[m]> X4 and A2 weren't good choices compared to the Pixels
09:15:29 <jalb66> ok
09:15:31 <cn3m[m]> also no one was interested
09:15:48 <cn3m[m]> the expectation with GrapheneOS is you buy a device for it
09:15:52 <cn3m[m]> or multiple if you want to develop seriously
09:16:29 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Is it the restoreprivacy site that is bought or was it the spiegel site
09:16:57 <dlm-johannes[m]> Where do i get bromite

09:22:09 <bulletproofman[m> I'm gonna assume The Hated One is out of the question.
09:22:22 <cn3m[m]> you really should only trust PTIO for services
09:22:47 <cn3m[m]> I wouldn't bother
09:23:31 <cn3m[m]> PTIO software recommendations are utter crap usually
09:24:06 <cn3m[m]> however they have an extremely transparent and excellent system for services recommendation
09:24:30 <cn3m[m]> they also have some excellent transparency moves in the works

09:28:25 <cn3m[m]> I consider it hostile

09:29:00 <furofuro_01[m]> Alright... Doesnt seem to be much of concern, although I plan to use VPN and DNS
09:29:31 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "if it's your VPN and DNS maybe t"> Which is I am considering right now. Probably will use ProtonVPN free or Mullvad VPN, and some ad-blcoking DNS

10:11:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <furofuro_01[m] "Not exactly. I don't mind it, as"> What else do you get in this fashion there? Super intriguing.
10:11:20 <furofuro_01[m]> Phones.
10:11:42 <furofuro_01[m]> I got the phone I am using right now on that certain online store.
10:12:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But from who? & who delivers/collects/forwards payment?
10:12:07 <furofuro_01[m]> Ok
10:12:21 <furofuro_01[m]> Surprisingly cheaper for iPhone 8 welp...
10:12:48 <cn3m[m]> iPhone 8 ain't that bag
10:12:50 <cn3m[m]> bad*
10:13:08 <furofuro_01[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "But from who? & who delivers/col"> First party packages it, third party delivers/ships it (some delivery services)
10:13:20 <cn3m[m]> it's pretty fast and has 2.5-4.5 years left
10:13:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> furofuro_01: And they also forward the payment back to first party? Huh. Yeah, don't think that's a thing in North America.
10:14:53 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "it's pretty fast and has 2.5-4.5"> As much as I love support, I kinda hate losing freedom to transfer files.
10:15:42 <furofuro_01[m]> There is something that stops me from using an iPhone, perhaps due to myself being an Android user since the start (lol)
10:15:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> furofuro_01: No Syncthing for iOS?
10:15:43 <cn3m[m]> that's not an issue anymore
10:16:12 <cn3m[m]> 12 and 13 rehauled the thingies for files
10:16:12 <furofuro_01[m]> Btw, it was a (used) 3a XL (that costs ~$400)
10:16:29 <furofuro_01[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "furofuro_01: No Syncthing for iO"> Oh yeah, maybe that can work, now I have a somehow stable net
10:16:43 <cn3m[m]> agh
10:16:59 <cn3m[m]> NextCloud works
10:17:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> furofuro_01: Oh, dang...I think I can beat that!!
10:17:05 <cn3m[m]> plugging into a PC works
10:17:15 <cn3m[m]> SMB works out of the box
10:17:19 <cn3m[m]> iOS file transfering is really easy
10:17:27 <furofuro_01[m]> Pixel 2 is a lot cheaper here though, however tempting, it is near its EoL
10:17:34 <yolotrolo[m]> <furofuro_01[m] "Btw, it was a (used) 3a XL (that"> a brand new 3A xl is 329€ in google store,; not sure how much in dollars
10:17:35 <cn3m[m]> SMB is something I use a lot so file transfers win hands down on iOS
10:17:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cn3m[m] "SMB works out of the box "> No shit? Wonder how hole-y/backwards compatible their Samba implementation is..
10:18:01 <yolotrolo[m]> oh i missed a part of the sentence i think hmm
10:18:15 <cn3m[m]>  @dannyknoll:matrix.org it's not that bad at all
10:18:21 <cn3m[m]> it's pretty decent
10:18:29 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Talking security-wise =]
10:18:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Not UX
10:18:53 <cn3m[m]> oh well it's rock solid stable I haven't tested it much
10:19:09 <cn3m[m]> not sure how it plays on older versions
10:20:11 <furofuro_01[m]> <yolotrolo[m] "a brand new 3A xl is 329€ in goo"> Way cheaper than a refurbished 3a welp...
10:20:48 <furofuro_01[m]> Im getting bamboozled on price tbh
10:20:49 <cn3m[m]> you should just move to America
10:21:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <yolotrolo[m] "a brand new 3A xl is 329€ in goo"> Do they ship to third-world (user's phrasing, not mine) Asia?
10:21:54 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "you should just move to America"> Nope nope, I love my privacy haha
10:22:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> cn3m: Which major cities aren't on fire yet? lol
10:22:12 <furofuro_01[m]> Also, no thanks, I hate surveillance
10:22:16 <cn3m[m]> well for now we have great privacy laws
10:22:40 <cn3m[m]> section 215 expired and mass surveillance is currently toast

10:32:07 <furofuro_01[m]> But no grapheneos as of now
10:33:34 <furofuro_01[m]> How risky it is to keep a grapheneos-powered pixel that is beyond EoL?
10:33:57 <furofuro_01[m]> (Example: Pixel 2)
10:38:12 <zaxxa[m]> Just buy a cheapphone on the android one program, maybe it won't run super fast but it will serve your needs until you can afford something better. Sometimes you just gotta compromise. I was on a moto g phone for nearly 7 years so imagine how that felt lol
10:40:12 <yolotrolo[m]> <cn3m[m] "4a isn't going to get GrapheneOS"> yea i will wait for that, maybe forever, but i can't stand the bezels of pixels 3's or the slow storage of the 3a and the delay when you launch apps. i just hope that they have not canceled the XL model as it was reported
10:41:58 <furofuro_01[m]> <zaxxa[m] "Just buy a cheapphone on the and"> Yeah lol
10:42:30 <furofuro_01[m]> I kinda get what you mean, well I am just asking though, my apologies
10:48:31 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "I just use ProtonVPN free"> About ProtonVPN, I heard some criminal was caught by realtime feed to bypass logging. How feasible and possible is this?
10:49:48 <furofuro_01[m]> As much as they say, they do not log, but not to the point they will let themself waste their resources to get arrested for somebody else's illegal act.
10:49:48 <furofuro_01[m]> Is it possibly a work of metadata instead?
10:52:57 <furofuro_01[m]> I dont fully trust what a certain user on reddit has said, I am only merely delivering this info (could be false) and try to cross-examine this
10:53:35 <DannyWorkOrderPr> furofuro_01: If they were to be FISA-compelled into giving a live stream of traffic, it would be more than metadata

14:13:23 <nickcalyx[m]> Yeah they broke.something
14:16:20 <dazinism> Theres a build that works on their github
14:17:23 <dazinism> Uses the same security cert (probably the same builds) as the ones from their Fdroid repo.
14:19:26 <dazinism> can you try the direct APK first: here is the direct APK link to the latest: https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-16.2.0-RC-1-tor-0.4.2.7-1-geed732a3-fullperm-arm64-v8a-release.apk
14:19:59 <dazinism> That works fine for me on GrapheneOS on 3XL
14:20:59 <dazinism> Can update from that via their Fdroid, or from the Fdroid version with that, as its signed with the same cert
14:35:28 <dazinism> The orbot cert fingerprint in case anyone wants to download that apk and check.
14:35:30 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Orbot
14:43:56 <dazinism> Ah, got a bit confused, they released a version which didnt work on some devices (including GraphneOS) not sure if it went out via their Fdroid.
14:44:53 <dazinism> Dont really need the cert fingerprint if you already have a version downloaded from their Fdroid and trust what you have
14:45:15 <dazinism> Can just download from that link and it will update as its the same cert
14:45:35 <dazinism> If it want the update would fail
14:47:07 <dazinism> I just said all that in a really confusing way. lol

15:41:14 <bulletproofman[m> There you go 😑 now why is that?
15:42:05 <fluoridatedsheep> privacy will NEVER be won through legislature. All governmental institutions do is act in a way that aggrandizes their own power. It is and will always be a power grab. That's the nature of the industrial technological system
15:43:19 <fluoridatedsheep> The only way privacy can be won is through actions that circumvent authority and exploit loopholes
15:44:09 <BalooRJ> So basically you just don't believe in govt and think the citizen knows better all the time
15:44:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> tbh legislature is one of primary ways to win privacy back in combination with a culture change and genpop pressure/protest
15:44:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> <fluoridatedsheep "The only way privacy can be won "> This is only accessible to techies and enthisiasts
15:45:33 <fluoridatedsheep> Im saying from a pragmatic and historical point of view, governments do not seek to limit their own power, and collectives do not defend individual liberty.

15:49:41 <fluoridatedsheep> <hypokeimenon[m] "Interestingly, those in technica"> Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. Quoting Thoreau here, " What is the price-current of an honest man and patriot today? They hesitate, and they regret, and sometimes they petition; but they do nothing in earnest and with effect. They will wait, well disposed, for others to remedy the evil, that they may no longer have it to regret. At most, they give only
15:49:41 <fluoridatedsheep> a cheap vote, and a feeble countenance and God-speed, to the right, as it goes by them. There are nine hundred and ninety-nine patrons of virtue to one virtuous man. But it is easier to deal with the real possessor of a thing than with the temporary guardian of it."

15:54:46 <dazinism> Governments do sometimes have enough power to stand up to corps and at times do so.
15:55:35 <dazinism> Obv there is much corporate capture of gov power, the revolving doors between the top of gov and corps spin at a blur
15:57:36 <fluoridatedsheep> <bulletproofman[m "fluoridated sheeple: I've always"> The absolute core of man has insurmountable levels of guilt and a thing called creature inferiority. We fear the idea of our base soul being locked up in a dark box forever. We innately strive to self-perpetuate our existence. Everything we pursue is an attempt to overcome our own mortality. People are enchanted by political leaders. I say enchanted because it
15:57:36 <fluoridatedsheep> is literally the process of mystification. Speaking in bold words, symbolism that gets people wrapped up in lies.
15:58:57 <fluoridatedsheep> As an individual, people feel inferior. As a collective, they feel less inferior and believe that the overall society will perpetuate their existence, so they hedge their bets with the collective. Admit it or not. There lies the culture issue

16:13:37 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <hiya "Is secure boot basic version of "> If I understand it correct, secure boot is only a fraction of what is needed for full verified boot. Secure boot stops after the EFI or BIOS verifies the signature of the boot payload, usually the bootloader. Whatever the bootloader decides to do after is beyond the scope of what secure boot can provide.
16:14:20 <hiya> hmm
16:14:22 <hiya> Thanks
16:14:29 <hiya> M0xC0ncord[m]: are you 100% sure?
16:14:31 <bulletproofman[m> Does anyone here watch
16:14:37 <bulletproofman[m> Rene Ritchie on YT
16:14:47 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Trusted boot is a step beyond, where every stage in the boot chain is verified by the program before it. Verified boot is an "upgraded" version of that that provides things like rollback protection and communicating to the user that the system's integrity is vetted.
16:15:01 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <hiya "concord: are you 100% sure?"> On the secure boot part, yes.
16:15:12 <hiya> M0xC0ncord[m]: Ok Sir
16:15:22 <hiya> You explain in such a beautiful manner
16:15:27 <M0xC0ncord[m]> On EFI systems it just means loading a certificate into the keystore that's used to check the signature of the verified bootloader.
16:15:30 <hiya> You must a tutor
16:15:42 <M0xC0ncord[m]> I enjoy teaching but it's not what I do.

16:40:27 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Though if you can get into the habit, turning off NFC when you don't need it is reducing attack surface, but I don't imagine by much.
16:40:40 <M0xC0ncord[m]> It's the same as turning off WiFi or Bluetooth when you don't need it.
16:40:58 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Except WiFi and BT have much wider range of potential attacks.

16:47:57 <TheJollyRoger> They work.
16:48:27 <TheJollyRoger> However, the U2F implementation in Android is currently dependent on something in Play Services, so we need some help in adding that missing code.
16:48:42 <TheJollyRoger> Since obviously, we don't include Play Services.

16:49:42 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "However, the U2F implementation "> Good you mentioned that thanks.

18:01:59 <TheJollyRoger> bulletproofman[m: ah! Okay!
18:03:21 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: TheJollyRoger What browser other than Brave and Safari are available
18:03:28 <TheJollyRoger> I might pick up an iPhone in the future, just to try it out and as a second device for convenience, and so I can take some cues from its design.
18:03:39 <cn3m[m]> Safari is the best
18:03:59 <TheJollyRoger> I'm really not sure. I've never used an iPhone before, but I would probably avoid Brave and just use Safari, so you end up looking like every other Safari user out there.
18:04:48 <TheJollyRoger> I've become mighty skeptical of these other "privacy enhanced" browsers, because most of them severely lag behind upstream in terms of security patches and exploit mitigations, and this is a Very Bad Thing.
18:05:38 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: Yes but I really need an extra browser or two that are privacy friendly, open-source and secure
18:06:18 <TheJollyRoger> Your Browser handles all sorts of attacker controlled inputs and while in a mobile operating system the app is sandboxed, you definitely don't want to have an exploit do things like try to hoover up your browser data from other sites you visit (cross site attacks) and that sorta thing.
18:06:31 <TheJollyRoger> bulletproofman[m: do you code or can you read code?
18:07:02 <TheJollyRoger> When you install updates, do you read the code you're going to run, examine it for backdoors via fuzzing then painstaking manual inspection, prior to compiling it?
18:07:06 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: I know very basiv things. I'm thinking on enrolling Computer Science in college next year.
18:07:08 <TheJollyRoger> Or do you just do what I do and run emerge?
18:07:18 <TheJollyRoger> *and just run emerge, and hope to god it's safe?
18:09:04 <TheJollyRoger> The value of open source is indispensable, but people who know only enough to be dangerous end up seeing it as a be-all-end-all when really all it's doing is lowering the barriers to analysis.
18:09:42 <TheJollyRoger> If you want secure you definitely don't want Brave, or any of those "privasey-enhansed!!11" Chromium shitforks.
18:11:11 <TheJollyRoger> Because I definitely don't think that holding back security patches from upstream and saying "not a problem" and then tacking on a whole lot of theatre is going to be doing anything for your privacy when a simple bug that was patched in upstream allows a malicious site to break the process isolation and then start hoovering up the cache from other sites.
18:13:25 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "However, the U2F implementation "> So what is required then to make Yubikey work?
18:15:35 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: someone will need to likely enable U2F functionality in Vanadium directly, the way it is done on the desktop, and add it as a patch to the Vanadium patchset, or design and build a handler to take the place of the functionality provided by play services.
18:17:37 <brenneke[m]> OK, so it doesn't work then...as is.
18:18:05 <TheJollyRoger> For now. I think it might be possible to get it to work via WebUSB but I've been trying to figure that out for myself.
18:19:14 <TheJollyRoger> Reference code is available from the FIDO2 alliance, I hope that once I get better at programming/building, it's on my wishlist but there aren't enough hours in the day... *sigh*
18:20:01 <brenneke[m]> OK, kinda looking for the sure thing. Authenticator app recommended then or just have a good strong pw in pw manager?
18:20:26 <cn3m[m]> so I started going to /r/privacy to fight misinfo

19:18:49 <bulletproofman[m> Any thoughts on Tresorit?
19:22:53 <joshman[m]> Why not use nextcloud? I found swiss services too expensive
19:23:02 <joshman[m]> * Why not use nextcloud? I find swiss services too expensive
19:24:54 <bulletproofman[m> josh.man: I will self host in the future but for more personal data. I want to try tresorit because of the features.
19:25:19 <bulletproofman[m> They say they have zero knowkedge encryption
19:25:47 <cn3m[m]> it's better than nothing
19:26:57 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Do you have any oponion on Tresorit in particular? It seems really good to me. I heard many great reviews about it-s securiry and privacy
19:28:53 <cn3m[m]> it's probably just fine
19:28:54 <cn3m[m]> it's expensive
19:29:13 <cn3m[m]> Tresorit Send is awesome
19:36:22 <cn3m[m]> what Reddit app on Android has support for modmail? I missed an important mod mail for Graphene
19:51:23 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: is it the discord thing?
19:56:21 <cn3m[m]> ?
19:59:49 <overheadscallop[> cn3m: I think slide has support for moderator actions like banning and viewing modmail https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.ccrama.redditslide/
20:00:26 <cn3m[m]> I'll switch to that
20:00:26 <cn3m[m]> thanks
20:00:42 <cn3m[m]> I missed a lot of modmail sorry to anyone to posted to the sub

20:06:46 <bulletproofman[m> madaidan.: How come he doesn't participate in the chat?
20:08:46 <TheJollyRoger> He does, but he has a life of his own to live. We can't expect him to be here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
20:09:28 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: Yeah, you have a point.
20:09:34 <zaxxa[m]> On the grapheme developer page, why is it suggested to avoid using inheretance in your programs?
20:10:50 <strcat[m]> class inheritance
20:11:26 <zaxxa[m]> Yes
20:11:59 <bulletproofman[m> zaxxa: I think due to exploits
20:12:25 <TheJollyRoger> o7
20:18:07 <bulletproofman[m> I'm actually curious too.now that u asked about it

20:24:41 <mxnorvak[m]> Techlore did another video

20:25:07 <bulletproofman[m> <mxnorvak[m] ":/"> why the sad face
20:25:22 <bulletproofman[m> I mean he's just testing the camera what's wrong?

20:28:10 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, indeed :P.
20:28:30 <mxnorvak[m]> <bulletproofman[m "why the sad face"> Well because of how his what was happening in his Matrix room regarding Graphene a while back
20:28:40 <mxnorvak[m]> Because of what *
20:29:06 <bulletproofman[m> mxnorvak: I'm very new.sir i joined yesterday
20:30:49 <mxnorvak[m]> <bulletproofman[m "mxnorvak: I'm very new.sir i joi"> I didn't join the room to be able to tell you the exact thing that was happening but from what i gathered they were kinda attacking the project and also Daniel which was weird
20:32:10 <bulletproofman[m> mxnorvak: Isn't that like a regular thing at this point?
20:34:42 <TheJollyRoger> The video itself doesn't seem to be attacking GrapheneOS. He concludes it with that while there are many things that GCam does better, including stabilization and controlling exposure and contrast, there are actually some shots where OpenCamera actually does a better job.
20:34:56 <cn3m[m]> Why do people feel the need to crosspost everywhere?
20:34:57 <mxnorvak[m]> From someone that made 2 videos about GrapheneOS and how its the best option when it comes to privacy and security and that hi himself uses it, yea it was weird
20:34:57 <TheJollyRoger> He then wrapped it up with saying "So, these are just comparisons with the default settings, you should be the judge."
20:36:21 <bulletproofman[m> Tbh my issue is when people get tribal about tools and projects.
20:36:22 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know. If need be I can reach out for clarification but I don't want to immediately assume bad faith right off the bat. This video itself doesn't strike me as attacking the project.
20:36:36 <bulletproofman[m> I just want the facts.
20:36:50 <bulletproofman[m> What is actually, REALLY good for privacy and security
20:37:30 <bulletproofman[m> Idc about what ideology the person holds, i just want the truth that will benefit us as privacy consious users who care about security.
20:37:34 <TheJollyRoger> It looks like he's just comparing side by side shots using the factory operating system and GrapheneOS, while using an iPad Pro as a control.
20:37:44 <mxnorvak[m]> Yea  i didn't mean to say the video has anything bad to say about the OS, just that i was confused about how the videos are all positive and the room for that while wasn't
20:37:54 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe he just had a bad day...?
20:37:58 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: Yeah.
20:38:06 <bulletproofman[m> mxnorvak: Maybe he changed his mind.
20:38:09 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know. I'd prefer to reach out than assume bad faith.
20:38:54 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] "Why do people feel the need to c"> Hmm because it had GrapheneOS in it :D
20:39:31 <mxnorvak[m]> <bulletproofman[m "mxnorvak: Maybe he changed his m"> Yea maybe ,don't care about him anyway
20:40:26 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I don't know. I'd prefer to reac"> Yea i agree
20:40:48 <EssentialChaos[m> You are all overthinking this, imo
20:41:51 <TheJollyRoger> Besides. It looked pretty positive.
20:42:56 <bulletproofman[m> Speaking of youtubers and yt
20:43:14 <bulletproofman[m> Anything like NewPipe for iOS
20:43:34 <bulletproofman[m> Honestly, I LOVE newpipe over the original,client
20:43:56 <bulletproofman[m> It's just so convenient and has many features
20:46:51 <cn3m[m]> use invidio.us with an RSS feed
20:46:59 <cn3m[m]> on some mirrors you do get downloads
20:49:02 <jalb66> feeder app with snopyta instance (invidious)
20:49:27 <jalb66> You don't contact Google that way
20:49:38 <EssentialChaos[m> What RSS app would you recommend?
20:53:49 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "What RSS app would you recommend"> Feeder for Android is what I am using

21:25:53 <bulletproofman[m> Danny@WorkOrderPro: It's cause ur late xD
21:26:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Gotcha, lol
21:30:13 <cn3m[m]> is it just me or is the default camera app much better than Open Camera on my 3a?
21:30:57 <orge_td[m]> They le both a bit crappy imo
21:32:13 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: 3a doesn't have visual core
21:32:31 <bulletproofman[m> According to daniel. I've read the FAQ u_u
21:34:37 <jcpicard32[m]> 3a doesn't have visual core
21:34:42 <jcpicard32[m]> If you're using OpenCamera make sure you enable the camera2 api in settings
21:34:46 <cn3m[m]> I like the stock camera app better
21:35:11 <spaceinfinite[m]> cn3m: if i download an app that has something like 10 trackers, what can or do those trackers. Do they just track how im interacting with THAT app or what else do they see ?
21:35:18 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: It's the extra software stuff that google does isn't it
21:35:22 <jcpicard32[m]> I've had good results with OC + Camera2. YMMV
21:38:01 <cn3m[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "cn3m: if i download an app that "> that's a very long topic, but it depends
21:38:13 <cn3m[m]> you don't have an ad id
21:38:38 <cn3m[m]> however some rare apps will see your installed apps list which easily identifies you
21:38:39 <cn3m[m]> Especially on GrapheneOS
21:38:54 <spaceinfinite[m]> cn3m: there are a few apps i want to download but they are full of trackers.
21:39:30 <spaceinfinite[m]> I read somewhere that they can be stripped of trackers via apk editor but too much husle
21:39:43 <jcpicard32[m]> spaceinfinite: Have you considered running the apps with trackers in a separate profile/work profile?
21:39:48 <cn3m[m]> that's not worthwhile
21:40:02 <cn3m[m]> extra profiles is the best option
21:40:23 <spaceinfinite[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "spaceinfinite: Have you consider"> Yes but still the ip and connecting yo facebook and whatnot else
21:41:10 <cn3m[m]> use webapps whenever possible
21:41:23 <spaceinfinite[m]> <cn3m[m] "extra profiles is the best optio"> I thought of that ,best outcome would be work profile in order to get notifications from normal apps
21:42:33 <spaceinfinite[m]> <cn3m[m] "use webapps whenever possible "> See some people say that sometimes apps are safer cos they only have an api instead of browsers
21:42:48 <spaceinfinite[m]> Confusing
21:43:49 <bulletproofman[m> spaceinfinite: My biggest problem is the fb trackers. Idc much about things like crashlytics and firebase. But the FB travkers can fck off. I wanted to use this app called Atmosphere (it's a sound, relaxation app, ambiance and suff) but found it full of trackers and gave it up. Even tho it was really a nice app.
21:45:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <spaceinfinite[m] "See some people say that sometim"> They're talking about open source apps that are replacing the "official" AIDS apps, for example, Facebook viewers
21:46:27 <spaceinfinite[m]> I read that it doesnt matter trackers or cos the app developer can still send the traffic over to fb or else.but still those trackers are designed to track a lot
21:46:39 <spaceinfinite[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "They're talking about open sourc"> Aids apps?
21:46:54 <cn3m[m]> wok profile has serious issues
21:46:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <spaceinfinite[m] "Aids apps?"> Yeah, apps with trackers, or other bad behavior.
21:47:18 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/rPUpGoHcIAtgVSNBLJwDkEXE >
21:47:25 <spaceinfinite[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Yeah, apps with trackers, or oth"> So apps with trackers then its best to use in web if possible?
21:47:30 <cn3m[m]> the restrictions in a browser are much better

21:48:14 <spaceinfinite[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Usually."> Thx
21:49:30 <spaceinfinite[m]> I searched around of ehat can trackers exactly see and do and couldnt find proper answers
21:49:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> ^With a browser that has good security/privacy features, of course
21:49:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Vanadium, Bromite, Safari on iOS
21:50:03 <cn3m[m]> Rob Braxman's app has Firebase ha
21:50:10 <spaceinfinite[m]> If they track outside the dowloaded app or just inside it
21:51:00 <cn3m[m]> it doesn't even run
21:51:24 <cn3m[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "If they track outside the dowloa"> they definitely can
21:51:27 <cn3m[m]> privacy breacher is a basic example of it
21:51:39 <cn3m[m]> there's a lot more that could be shown off in that very basic app
21:52:40 <spaceinfinite[m]> Yea its no hope its even getting worse now the trackers are moving yo first party server soon
21:53:37 <cn3m[m]> not really with apps that's not super practical

21:59:07 <cx2[m]> I have....it has a Brave feel do it with even more toggles....seems legit, but I wouldn't really know how to verify that.
21:59:07 <cx2[m]> https://github.com/snowhaze/SnowHaze-iOS
21:59:08 <cn3m[m]> it also has clipboard access which might not be ideal
21:59:08 <bulletproofman[m> Shelter never worked on my phone because i downloaded another Firmware and installed it via odin.
21:59:27 <spaceinfinite[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "So shelter has issues?"> I know user profiles are the way to do it.but for convinience shelter seems easier at least better than installing on main profile
21:59:31 <bulletproofman[m> cx2: I'm curious about this snowhaze too
21:59:56 <cx2[m]> @dannyknoll:matrix.org: it has a brave like feel
22:00:37 <bulletproofman[m> Tbh all i care about is the privacy and security aspects
22:05:44 <bulletproofman[m> cx2: is it close source?
22:09:47 <bulletproofman[m> Ok i checked on alternativeto.net
22:10:00 <cn3m[m]> Has anyone verified user profiles isolate root certs?
22:10:01 <bulletproofman[m> Apprently it's a freemium open-source
22:10:40 <TheJollyRoger> Hi cn3m[m] give me a moment.
22:10:52 <cn3m[m]> Safari is recommended here
22:10:59 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org thanks
22:12:26 <TheJollyRoger> Ok so I think I got a plan: I'm going to mint some random-ass self-signed certificates, one as "Treasure Island Trusted SSL" as a root CA to my primary user profile, and I'll disable one of the built in certificates I don't need.
22:12:33 <TheJollyRoger> Then I'll change profiles and see if my changes carry over.
22:13:37 <cn3m[m]> thanks so much!
22:14:31 <TheJollyRoger> this might take a moment, since I never get along will with OpenSSL...
22:14:42 <TheJollyRoger> I'll check the preexisting root CAs first.
22:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hey check this out. Work profiles use separate CA stores.
22:15:48 <TheJollyRoger> OK I'm gonna just disable ACCV first since it's near the top and then create another User profile. No effect on the Work profile.
22:16:45 <cn3m[m]> thanks!
22:17:53 <cn3m[m]> I didn't think about trying it that way. I don't have my PC nearby with my CA
22:18:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hey interesting, looks like the separate user profiles don't have "Encryption and credentials" listed in their settings.
22:18:27 <TheJollyRoger> Only the owner profile and work profile does.
22:20:06 <cn3m[m]> Interesting. I saw an app that has a free setup for MITM that's meant to be really easy to use. I highly doubt it is trustworthy
22:20:08 <cn3m[m]> I wonder if that means it won't work
22:20:12 <cn3m[m]> I guess it shouldn't hurt to try
22:20:22 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger are you like a hacker or a security researcher ?
22:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. I don't know. Let me try seeing if I can add a certificate.
22:20:30 <cn3m[m]> MITM seems to hard for most people
22:21:02 <TheJollyRoger> bulletproofman[m: ahahaha no, neither. I'm actually a sheet metal/plastics mold designer by trade that's wanting to switch career paths. Just something of an enthusiast at this point you could say.
22:22:05 <cn3m[m]> TheJollyRoger is a pirate
22:22:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr :D
22:22:53 <TheJollyRoger> I took to piracy after our ship was raided, and the captain said "Ye can join our crew of scurrrvy dogs or be sent to Davey Jones' Locker, with a yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!"
22:22:55 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org just don't be a demon like me to get into the field
22:23:03 <TheJollyRoger> Oh man. What happened?

22:26:43 <TheJollyRoger> X3.
22:28:08 <TheJollyRoger> Okay, I gotta test this then need to run for a sec... but I got the certificate...
22:29:13 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Ya dun goofed up boi
22:29:14 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, cn3m[m] it looks like I can install Treasure Island Trusted SSL's root CA for the owner profile, but it does not install for the work profile.
22:29:31 <cn3m[m]> thanks  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org
22:29:32 <TheJollyRoger> The other user profiles don't show me whether or not credentials are or aren't trusted.
22:29:37 <TheJollyRoger> So!
22:30:03 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "cn3m: Ya dun goofed up boi"> I dunno it helps me understand it a lot better and it's good for the people I can help. It's a mix
22:30:10 <JTL> I'd still test it with a server, but that's an encouraging sign
22:30:19 <TheJollyRoger> I think this gives me a theory; in a future date when GrapheneOS is in better health it might be possible to expose more of this profile isolation to the user! It'll really depend though.
22:30:23 <TheJollyRoger> JTL: got it!
22:30:30 <TheJollyRoger> I have to go for a bit but I will return later tonight!

22:47:48 <blacklight447[m]> .privacytools
22:49:04 <JTL> cn3m[m]: https://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs//main/s/salt/salt_2018.3.4+dfsg1-6+deb10u1_changelog
22:49:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hey cn3m[m], if I recall correctly work profiles are supposed to be managed by something else but I've never looked into it further. The user profiles might share the same CA store as the owner CA store, but I don't know that yet.
22:50:29 <JTL> blacklight447[m]: link?
22:52:02 <blacklight447[m]> https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/N-sdPP2G-MUCqCfxnEKSZs9h/
22:52:28 <blacklight447[m]> Im soon opening an issue on our github to propose delisting it you see
22:52:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <TheJollyRoger "Hey cn3m, if I recall correctly "> Keep us posted, very interesting. Would love to have certain apps away from those.
22:53:14 <blacklight447[m]> And as you know , the foss community can be rather , ehm, "passionate" about their distro of choice, especially with a distro the size of debian
22:53:25 <cn3m[m]> yes signify is a problem too
22:54:20 <blacklight447[m]> So i expect its gonna cause a shit storm, so me having a strong starter with lots of evidence/arguments about why debian out of most distros is particularly bad security wise would help a great deal you see :)
22:58:16 <blacklight447[m]> <blacklight447[m] "https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/"> JTL
23:01:58 <bulletproofman[m> So Arch and Fedora are like the better distros? 🤔🤔🤔
23:07:51 <tsul[m]> just reading now - looking to get debian delisted from privacytools?
23:08:04 <blacklight447[m]> Security wise, yes.
23:08:12 <blacklight447[m]> Still linux, but less sucky linux
23:09:49 <tsul[m]> hmm, interested to watch the cryptpad be built out - in the absence of qubes, is fedora reigning king then?
23:09:51 <blacklight447[m]> <tsul[m] "just reading now - looking to ge"> Yes
23:09:59 <TheJollyRoger> I think the rule seems to be "crap collects downstream."
23:10:50 <TheJollyRoger> So as you get further and further away from your upstream providers, you're using software that's been increasingly divergent from your upstream providers and it ends up becoming increasingly messy, hacky, or out of date.
23:11:26 <blacklight447[m]> Whats nice with fedora is that it sticks fairly close to up stream
23:11:43 <blacklight447[m]> Newer kernel and such
23:12:11 <blacklight447[m]> They also ship with selinux (sure it doesnt do a ton in itd current state but its better then nothing)
23:12:41 <blacklight447[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Whats nice with fedora is that i"> But its far enough from bleeding edge to be stable enough for an average user
23:12:57 <cn3m[m]> yeah very true
23:13:22 <cn3m[m]> the Wayland work isn't horrible either useless, but it has the best support
23:15:41 <cn3m[m]> If anyone huge fixes Linux Desktop at some point it will be Fedora
23:16:57 <blacklight447[m]> Fedora uses wayland by default
23:17:00 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: So Arch and Fedora are like the better distros? What about Kali isn't it used for pentest?
23:17:28 <blacklight447[m]> It also uses it for firefox i think
23:17:38 <bulletproofman[m> Also debian shows un on PTIO wtf are yall seeing
23:17:50 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "cn3m: So Arch and Fedora are lik"> Kali is extremely insecure
23:17:54 <cn3m[m]> it's useful thigh
23:17:57 <cn3m[m]> though*
23:19:22 <blacklight447[m]> Kali is made less secure on purpose
23:19:38 <blacklight447[m]> Makes it easier to run certain offensive tools
23:19:53 <blacklight447[m]> There is a reason why its encouraged to run as a live system
23:20:39 <blacklight447[m]> <bulletproofman[m "Also debian shows un on PTIO wtf"> Yes we are currently listing it, an im soon opening an issue to start the discussion tk delist
23:20:57 <cn3m[m]> I'm doing research right now
23:21:48 <cn3m[m]> I also asked madaidan as he works on a Debian distro
23:22:38 <bulletproofman[m> If you had to use linux, which distros would you use?
23:23:11 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "If you had to use linux, which d"> ChromiumOS
23:24:45 <tsul[m]> lol as the name suggests is that FOSS version of essentially a Chromebook?
23:25:20 <cn3m[m]> yes
23:25:35 <cn3m[m]> Chromebooks in general are extremely open source
23:25:45 <cn3m[m]> even down to the bootloader
23:26:39 <cn3m[m]> Kicksecure is looking promising
23:27:03 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: No no, mainland distros >:( which one/ones
23:27:03 <madaidan[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Kali is made less secure on purp"> It's not really less secure than any other distro. Sudo passwords are security theater anyway.
23:27:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hey madaidan[m], but doesn't kali just run everything as root on purpose because it just assumes you're going to be using it only for pentesting and it shouldn't get in your way?
23:27:56 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "cn3m: No no, mainland distros >:"> Arch with hardened-linux and hardened_malloc running Chromium only?
23:28:36 <cn3m[m]> the root password is trivial to steal is his point
23:28:40 <TheJollyRoger> In which case if your computer's shared or you have multiple logons, there's *some* amount of --
23:28:43 <TheJollyRoger> Ah. Yeah got it.
23:28:44 <cn3m[m]> running something as user is security theater
23:30:32 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: I just vitied the Kicksecure page. It's debian based
23:30:48 * TheJollyRoger winces.
23:31:09 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "cn3m: I just vitied the Kicksecu"> yes and that's absolutely terrible, but it's good enough in other ways that's it's better than the alternatives
23:31:58 <cn3m[m]> KickSecure has a lot of issues currently(it's a lot of work to catch-up being 10-20 years behind). it's pretty good
23:32:01 <cn3m[m]> which is better than most can say
23:32:39 <madaidan[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hey madaidan., but doesn't kali "> They changed that to running everything as an unprivileged user while allowing passwordless sudo access. It's not really any different though since an account exposed to sudo (whether using a password or not) is equivalent to root as there are tons of ways to keylog/intercept the passwords.
23:33:03 <TheJollyRoger> Eesh, yeek, I see what you mean now. X(
23:39:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "They changed that to running eve"> madaidan.: BTW I'm slightly successful in securing desktop Linux
23:39:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm making scripts to setup an arch install with dm-verity, writable home and others
23:39:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> No sudo binary
23:40:05 <bulletproofman[m> anupritaisno1: Explain
23:40:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need to write sepolicy
23:40:40 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I'm making scripts to setup an a"> That's only one part.
23:40:40 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m by the way. You said chromium OS is open-source. How come, we don't see derivatives of it like Chromium distros or something. Seriously. Why not.
23:40:57 <madaidan[m]> You should collaborate with Whonix.
23:41:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "You should collaborate with Whon"> I'll release all my stuff later
23:41:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> The updater is the hard part
23:42:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> I might want to modify update engine or write my own that uses a key based dm-verity verification
23:42:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Rollback protection is basically nonexistent. I'm not aware of how to do that
23:43:09 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "cn3m by the way. You said chromi"> CloudReady with secure boot that covers rootfs is a pretty interesting project
23:43:33 <cn3m[m]> they aren't able to verify as much as ChromeOS, but it's by far the best security Linux distro
23:43:46 <bulletproofman[m> anupritaisno1: Are you a security researcher?
23:44:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> No I just try 1000s of things
23:44:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> If I fail I learn from it
23:44:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> And if you do those many things at least 1-2 are going to be successful
23:45:46 <bulletproofman[m> Man this sub is full of cool knowledgable people i feel like a chimp
23:45:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Besides my cloud provider has a bit of a leeway on how many servers I can bring up
23:45:59 <TheJollyRoger> Don't worry :). We all start somewhere!
23:46:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> As long as I don't exceed my ram/disk quotas
23:48:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also strcat
23:48:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> I now have enough disk space to help with vanadium
23:49:04 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I'll release all my stuff later"> Hmmm. Might kang. dm-verity is on our TODO list.
23:50:11 <TheJollyRoger> Hey madaidan[m], sometime I'd like to see if I can get cryptsetup working in Petitboot, since I feel I can treat the firmware of my computer as a root of trust.
23:50:33 <bulletproofman[m> anupritaisno1: Hey mr! What cloud provider u use
23:50:34 <TheJollyRoger> Or at least the hostboot, which in turn treats the BMC as the root of trust.
23:51:10 <TheJollyRoger> Which in turn would utilize Flexver and the LPCGuard as a root of trust although that's not delivered yet.
23:53:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "Hmmm. Might kang. dm-verity is o"> Jokes on you I kanged it from AOSP
23:53:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <bulletproofman[m "anupritaisno1: Hey mr! What clou"> A private one
23:53:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> They don't openly sell
23:53:45 <bulletproofman[m> anupritaisno1: Like what?
23:53:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> No website either
23:54:07 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Jokes on you I kanged it from AO"> Open source is just a culture of kang
23:54:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> <bulletproofman[m "anupritaisno1: Like what?"> You basically get access to a bare metal running an L1 hypervisor
23:54:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're free to do anything on it
23:54:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk what the exact hardware is though
23:55:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's quite expensive BTW
23:56:28 <spaceinfinite[m]> <bulletproofman[m "Man this sub is full of cool kno"> If you are the most clever man in the room than you are in the wrong room.its a old saying
23:57:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway madaidan
23:57:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk how you can get dm-verity without copying it from AOSP
23:57:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> The upstream tools don't even support FEC correctly
23:58:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also the boot partition must be protected by secure boot
