03:03:27 <strcat[m]> going to push out the beta via stable tonight
03:03:34 <strcat[m]> only reported issue is direct boot not working with clock app which doesn't really matter
03:11:07 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Thanks for the update!
05:32:27 <CarpeDiem[m]> What kind of SOT are people getting with graphene on there 4XLs?
05:33:04 <CarpeDiem[m]> I'm getting around 9 hours, but if I'm lightly using the phone I get 2+ days
05:33:12 <CarpeDiem[m]> Sound about right ?
05:55:36 <ludicrous_speed[> Just installed on Pixel 4a, seems nice!
06:01:04 <TheJollyRoger> CarpeDiem[m]: yes, this sounds about right! The more your phone can sleep the more it'll ration the battery.
06:01:38 <TheJollyRoger> ludicrous_speed[: glad to hear you're liking it!
06:02:52 <ludicrous_speed[> I had calyxos on earlier
06:03:04 <TheJollyRoger> Hey right on!
06:03:27 <ludicrous_speed[> Their install script was ultra smooth
06:09:41 <ludicrous_speed[> TheJollyRoger: You a Monero guy?
06:10:07 <TheJollyRoger> Hey ludicrous_speed[, ah, sorry, I am not.
06:11:22 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not much of a cryptocurrency guy. I know that the developers can use and accept Bitcoin donations, but I don't know if they're set up for XMR/Monero yet.
06:12:55 <ludicrous_speed[> TheJollyRoger: Reason I ask is because there is some pirate guy in the Monero community
06:13:05 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, ha ha ha!
06:14:03 <TheJollyRoger> Naw that's probably not me...? I used to hang around in the IRC Channel but then I lost the bookmarks, gotta restore that sometime.
06:14:38 <TheJollyRoger> There are about five or six people with some variant of the name "Jolly Roger" on Freenode, if I recall correctly, it's a pretty common name.
06:14:56 <chise> hi, hava a person?
06:17:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hi chise, what do you need help with?
06:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, crud. Just saw the clock. I gotta scoot.
06:25:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> @freenode_chise:matrix.org yes
06:25:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> You shall have 1 person
06:25:50 <JTL> lol
06:36:56 <strcat[m]> help wanted with improving the Clock app including fixing Direct Boot support (might be broken by the API level increase)
06:37:05 <strcat[m]> possible we could switch to the one from master but it has more issues
06:56:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> JTL just 1
07:18:09 <cenapatop689[m]> is a system Update released yesterday? My system updated one Update
07:29:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> cenapatop689 yes
07:43:51 <cenapatop689[m]> how can i disable 90 hz refresh rate
10:34:22 <eglssm[m]> <strcat[m] "eglssm: unless you're going to s"> Where can we check this? ("What we want") in github I have only found the "branding" repo but it pretty much empty. Once we know what it is expected, we could have a look at it and see if what we deliver matches the project expectations and standards.
10:45:01 <NorbertTretkowsk> cenapatop689: adb shell settings put system max_refresh_rate 60.0
10:45:01 <NorbertTretkowsk> Should do the trick, but I haven't tested it
10:45:06 <NorbertTretkowsk>  * cenapatop689: adb shell settings put system max_refresh_rate 60.0
10:45:06 <NorbertTretkowsk> Should do the trick, but I haven't tested it yet on my Pixel 4
13:37:59 <pixel24> I have one more question. Is it possible to install microG on GrapheneOS?
13:38:33 <Knull[m]> > <@norbert:tretkowski.de> cenapatop689: adb shell settings put system max_refresh_rate 60.0
13:38:33 <Knull[m]> > Should do the trick, but I haven't tested it yet on my Pixel 4
13:38:33 <Knull[m]> I did that with min and max. Doesn't stop the flickering though (pixel 4 XL)
13:38:53 <jpds> pixel24: It's in the FAQ
13:41:53 <louipc> jpds: where?
13:43:37 <pixel24> if i search for gapps or microG in the FAQ i don't find anything. This is what I had done before I asked here
13:44:13 <louipc> grapheneos wouldnt support it anyways because it requires compromising security by signature spoofing
13:49:53 <pixel24> ok, thanks for the info
13:50:53 <jpds> pixel24: https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
13:52:25 <pixel24> ok, on the main page, not FAQ. Sorry, I should have searched there too
13:58:15 <pixel24> I have been looking for two days in the web how to realize an ActiveSync account under GrapheneOS. But I cannot find a solution :-(
13:59:11 <louipc> the microsoft app wont work?
13:59:40 <dar_gomml[m]> outlook does work
14:00:31 <dar_gomml[m]> however Server side  address books do not. contacts in your own account however are shown in outlook
14:01:20 <dar_gomml[m]> * however server side address books do not. contacts in your own account arre shown in outlook.
14:02:24 <dar_gomml[m]> and you cant search contacts in exchange in the systems contact app.
14:34:42 <r0tt0r[m]> related matrix, whwn i access channel media it says "host not in room"
14:35:08 <r0tt0r[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "related matrix, whwn i access ch"> is it something on my side wrong?
14:35:24 <r0tt0r[m]> * related matrix, when i access channel media it says "host not in room"
14:37:42 <pixel24> we have no Exchange server and no Outlook. Kopano server (Linux) with Z-Push. This server is addressed by the cell phone via ActiveSync
14:39:15 <dar_gomml[m]> maybe The outlook app can still connect to it?
14:39:35 <dar_gomml[m]> or try the stock gmail app?
14:41:34 <pixel24> Can I install the Stock GMail app? I thought this is part of GApps
14:47:36 <dar_gomml[m]> try it, it could work
14:48:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> pixel24 no
14:48:15 <cenapatop689[m]> I would use protonmail
14:48:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
14:49:22 <dar_gomml[m]> someone recommended me to try it however i was satisfied with outlook..
14:49:58 <dar_gomml[m]> someone in this channel ;)
14:50:36 <pixel24> ok, I'll just test it. Protonmail is a mail provider. We have our own server in the company and I need to access it.
14:53:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dar_gomml[m] "someone recommended me to try it"> Our general recommendation is not to trust so-called secure email providers
14:53:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Email is not a protocol built for security
15:01:39 <alzxjm[m]> anupritaisno1: there are good reasons other than raw security to prefer Protonmail over Gmail. Doesn't mean you have to trust PM any more than you trust Gmail
15:01:40 <louipc> or do you mean privacy?
15:02:56 <louipc> i guess email and/or exchange activesync discussion should be on #grapheneos-offtopic afterall
15:03:05 <alzxjm[m]> pixel24: This question is not really Graphene-specific and is probably more appropriate for the off-topic channel.
15:06:10 <cenapatop689[m]> Protonmail is just secure with PGP and double authentification
15:07:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> cenapatop689 no it is not

15:25:45 <Joeri[m]> hi everybody.
15:26:07 <Joeri[m]> I'm experiencing some issues with bluetooth when I switched from calyxos to graphene today
15:26:30 <Joeri[m]> I'm currently on the latest grapheneos with Android 11
15:28:25 <louipc> is that with november update? and which phone
15:31:09 <louipc> oy yea today would be latest :p
15:32:28 <Joeri[m]> it's on crosshatch. the 3xl
15:32:51 <Joeri[m]> I believe it's with the update. I don't see any new updates coming in
15:57:10 <louipc> Joeri[m]: can you make a detailed report here https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
16:12:28 <waverider[m]> Pixel 3: I can't turn on WiFi or Bluetooth after a couple hours or so of use. The connections seem to hold overnight at basically idle.  Streaming audio for a couple hours  drops both WiFi and Bluetooth and can't enable  either without shutting of the phone for a few minutes. Hardware failure? Seems to have started with Android 11.
16:20:29 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: PGP email is far from qualifying as secure
16:20:30 <strcat[m]> it is not a secure messaging platform
16:21:00 <strcat[m]> it has massive attack surface, incredibly poor systems for key management and trust with glaring security holes
16:21:06 <strcat[m]> legacy cryptography including sha1
16:21:18 <strcat[m]> lacks proper security properties for secure messaging like forward secrecy
16:21:46 <strcat[m]> and has major usability issues where without being an expert on everything deeply wrong with it and all the common gotchas, I don't see how you could use it securely
16:22:02 <strcat[m]> in general, PGP is legacy and should be phased out, not adopted for any new usage
16:22:09 <strcat[m]> use a real secure messaging protocol
16:23:52 <TheJollyRoger> waverider[m]: I haven't observed that failure on my Pixel 3 daily driver.
16:24:28 <nscnt> TheJollyRoger: HELLO
16:24:32 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
16:25:02 <nscnt> Thought you drowned or smth. I haven't seen you for a while
16:25:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr... real life and a whole bunch of other things got in the way, kinda. Sorry for the unexplained absence!
16:26:13 <nscnt> c:
16:29:06 <pear[m]> strcat: What is your opinion on Rust, the programming language?
16:29:07 <pear[m]> Or if this has been answered, anybody got a link?
16:29:58 <strcat[m]> it's not a strcat Q&A channel
16:31:04 <nscnt> pear[m]: It's in the scope of GrapheneOS as stated at https://grapheneos.org/build#programming-languages
16:51:02 <SamsungGalaxyS2U> All, I've got the latest update on Chromium and the November security patch. Already! That's amazingly quick.
16:52:35 <SamsungGalaxyS2U> Impressive work by the security team
17:10:07 <waverider[m]> <TheJollyRoger "waverider: I haven't observed th"> Thanks for the report
17:20:17 <ludicrous_speed[> Does Aurora store/apps not play well with graphene is?
17:20:44 <jpds> ludicrous_speed[: That's not an English sentence
17:21:10 <strcat> ludicrous_speed[: Aurora Store works fine
17:21:20 <jpds> The Aurora store works on Graphene and apps installed through it may or may not work
17:21:46 <strcat> apps with a hard dependency on Play services won't work, and some apps may have features missing that depend on it
17:22:17 <strcat> it's up to apps to implement handling of Play services not being present or functional (which can be the case on the stock OS too - Google services aren't always available)
17:23:03 <ludicrous_speed[> Hrmm, when I used calyxos I didn't seem to have many problems with apps. I may have to go back to calyxos I guess.
17:23:31 <strcat[m]> CalyxOS includes Google services
17:23:41 <strcat[m]> as specially privileged code hard-wired into the base OS
17:23:43 <strcat[m]> we don't
17:24:04 <ludicrous_speed[> OK, I understand.
17:24:13 <strcat[m]> they include microG - although that will only provide compatibility with apps using a tiny subset of Play services
17:24:41 <ludicrous_speed[> Fuck I hate google
17:24:55 <strcat[m]> some apps choose to have hard dependencies on Google services
17:25:18 <strcat[m]> that means they don't support Android (which does not include Google services in the baseline OS), only Android with Google apps and services bundled
17:25:46 <strcat[m]> there's an Android Compatibility Test Suite to verification of compatibility with apps and that doesn't include anything in Play services
17:26:03 <strcat[m]> unfortunately a lot of developers don't care about their app working for users on devices without it, including most users in China, etc.
17:26:25 <strcat[m]> you should take it up with app developers and push them to do better, the only way it is going to change is if users want it
17:26:36 <ludicrous_speed[> I just need a glucose/ketone app to work and Costco.  Oh well.
17:27:28 <lev[m]> huh, just had a hard crash using opencamera, I'll try to reproduce it
17:36:29 <waverider[m]> <ludicrous_speed[ "I just need a glucose/ketone app"> If you can find a cloud solution the vanadium "add to home screen" option can replace some apps very well.
17:38:23 <ludicrous_speed[> waverider: that's a good idea, I'll see if that can work
17:42:01 <r0tt0r[m]> for me most important and only gapp is needed is their camera and that does work :)
17:44:11 <strcat[m]> we need help with the Clock app, I asked for help with testing it when the release was in Beta but we didn't get adequate testing
17:44:27 <strcat[m]> now that it's in stable, we still need people to test the clock app including setting alarms, rebooting, and seeing if they work after a reboot without launching the clock app
17:44:45 <strcat[m]> this should have been handled in the beta channel but there wasn't enough interest in helping to test this
17:44:59 <strcat[m]> and we can't delay releases indefinitely without any clear reason
17:45:26 <strcat[m]> help is also needing with development work on it to resolve these issues - it really shouldn't be what we are focusing on, but unfortunately the current version in AOSP has issues
17:46:17 <strcat[m]> perhaps we should roll back the upstream fixes that were applied if the previous bugs were less problematic than the new issues these upstream changes introduced
17:46:46 <strcat[m]> needs testing with people describing what happens if they encounter problems in detail and without ambiguity
17:46:51 <strcat[m]> there's an issue open on the tracker
17:46:55 <ludicrous_speed[> strcat: so just fiddle with the clock app and report here?
17:46:55 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/384
17:47:17 <TheJollyRoger> Fiddling with the clock app now, then.
17:47:27 <strcat[m]> ludicrous_speed: yes, mostly try setting alarms in the future (a few hours perhaps) and make sure it works, especially when the device has been idle, or after a reboot (without launching the clock app after the reboot)
17:48:06 <TheJollyRoger> I'll try writing up a report and a table with what tests I ran and what results I get. Expect something from me tonight.
17:48:15 <strcat[m]> set an alarm 2 hours in the future, close the clock activity, reboot
17:48:21 <TheJollyRoger> Deleting all existing alarms now...
17:48:23 <strcat[m]> and login to the profile again
17:48:24 <strcat[m]> then wait
17:48:45 <strcat[m]> also if it's not clear I'm asking about testing the latest release, not earlier ones
17:48:59 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: set alarm 2 hours in the future, close clock activity, reboot, login to profile, wait and see if it goes off
17:49:04 <TheJollyRoger> Just updated today.
17:49:07 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
17:49:14 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: then do the same thing *without* logging into the profile after reboot
17:49:30 <strcat[m]> 2 different tests, if you have 2 devices you can test both at once
17:49:33 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. setting for 2 hours later and rebooting my cellphone.
17:49:38 <TheJollyRoger> Crap, I don't have two different devices anymore.
17:49:39 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: also leave the device idle while testing
17:49:48 <TheJollyRoger> Leave the device idle while testing... okay!
17:49:49 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: yes and for one test, login after reboot
17:49:52 <strcat[m]> for the 2nd test, don't do that
17:50:06 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: which device do you have
17:50:08 <strcat[m]> which model
17:50:42 <TheJollyRoger> It's the Pixel 3, (non-A, non-XL).
17:50:53 <TheJollyRoger> She's still in pretty good condition although I had to replace the USB slot after some water damage.
17:51:27 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, phone's set and just came back up. I'm going to put it aside and leave it sleep for the next two hours.
17:51:40 <TheJollyRoger> Battery is at 50%, should I let it charge or leave it as it is?
17:51:50 <strcat[m]> leave it
17:51:53 <strcat[m]> test without it plugged in
17:52:01 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Leaving it on my desk.
17:52:17 <TheJollyRoger> And now, we wait.
17:52:20 * TheJollyRoger watches paint dry.
17:52:43 <mrxx_0[m]> I am testing again with more delay between the reboot and time set on the alarm
17:52:54 <TheJollyRoger> If needed I can try to get my Pixel 4 back...
17:53:13 * TheJollyRoger winces.
17:54:18 <strcat[m]> we need to figure out what's wrong and why there are issues
17:54:25 <strcat[m]> and implement a fix or at least a workaround
17:54:35 <strcat[m]> it's quite important, help is needed with testing and development with this
17:54:58 <strcat[m]> there has been a lack of interest in fixing the Clock app issues so I applied a series of upstream changes and asked for help testing it in the beta release
17:55:11 <strcat[m]> wasn't much interest in testing it, and no major issues were identified
17:55:27 <strcat[m]> but it seems there are new issues from those upstream changes that need to be addressed promptly
17:56:53 <ludicrous_speed[> Just to be clear, you are talking latest stable for testing clock? strcat
17:57:00 <strcat[m]> yes
17:57:09 <ludicrous_speed[> K
17:59:05 <strcat[m]> and please keep in mind that the beta channel does no good if we don't get usable feedback for issues with releases in it
17:59:13 <strcat[m]> including responding to requests for additional info, etc.
18:02:23 <madaidan[m]> The alarm only vibrated the phone (3a) once for me. It didn't repeat or make any noise.
18:03:02 <mrxx_0[m]> <mrxx_0[m] "I am testing again with more del"> +10 minutes not working (first unlock made, but not opened the clock app)
18:06:12 <strcat[m]> mrxx_0: no need to test a longer one if it doesn't work already
18:06:32 <strcat[m]> mrxx_0: can you try adding a battery optimization exception and do the test again
18:06:39 <strcat[m]> for DeskClock
18:06:46 <mrxx_0[m]> <strcat[m] "mrxx_0: can you try adding a bat"> On my way
18:10:01 <dazinism> strcat: by 'close the activity' you mean swipe it from recent apps screen?
18:10:47 <strcat[m]> yes
18:11:49 <strcat[m]> and btw Pixel 2 and 2 XL extended support releases depend on finding a maintainer to work on that
18:11:54 <strcat[m]> so far, no maintainer
18:12:10 <mrxx_0[m]> strcat: With battery optimization exception it works after reboot, with and without first unlock  and without opening the app
18:12:17 <strcat[m]> I'm going to be focusing on fixing problems for the officially support devices like this
18:12:19 <strcat[m]> mrxx_0: okay
18:12:23 <strcat[m]> it's probably tied to API level
18:12:28 <strcat[m]> I'll do an update with that ASAP
18:13:15 <mrxx_0[m]> Don't hesitate to ping me
18:23:03 <strcat[m]> further testing appreciated to confirm this is the resolution for the issue

18:53:34 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
18:53:52 <TheJollyRoger> Cancelling the download at 82% now.
18:54:31 <Remu[m]> Confirm it does work... But there is quite a problem on the alarm sound
18:55:28 <strcat[m]> what problem?
18:55:41 <Remu[m]> Even on primary user, but regardless of user, the chosen alarm sound is not being played when the alarmed is triggered before first unlock.
18:56:06 <Remu[m]> There is like some other alarm sound being pl
18:56:55 <Remu[m]>  * There is like some other alarm sound being used regardless of user choice on the options, not accounting yet to "Add new" option.
18:57:46 <strcat[m]> that's normal
18:58:03 <strcat[m]> before the first unlock, the profile is encrypted, data in it can't be accessed
18:58:21 <strcat[m]> the clock app goes out of the way to use Direct Boot support / device encrypted data to make alarms work before the first unlock
18:58:24 <strcat[m]> but it doesn't have user settings accessible there
18:58:36 <strcat[m]> it would have to move the settings to device encrypted data and so on
18:58:40 <strcat[m]> which it doesn't do right now
18:58:42 <TheJollyRoger> Oh that makes sense.
18:58:56 <Remu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Oh that makes sense."> Same reaction here
18:59:01 <strcat[m]> the clock app is one of the only things using direct boot support
18:59:16 <strcat[m]> our Updater app is another (lets it update before unlock) and we moved the settings to device encrypted data
18:59:36 <strcat[m]> the downside to moving anything to device encrypted data is not having it protected by the credential-based encryption used for everything in the profile
18:59:44 <strcat[m]> so it needs to be done carefully
18:59:58 <strcat[m]> you have to explicitly ask for device encrypted storage and move stuff to it explicitly, one by one
19:00:27 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/blob/11/src/app/seamlessupdate/client/Settings.java#L20-L23
19:00:34 <strcat[m]> this is how Updater stores preferences there, for example
19:00:58 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/blob/11/AndroidManifest.xml
19:01:09 <strcat[m]> and you can see here `android:directBootAware="true"`
19:01:29 <strcat[m]> I think we could remove it from the Settings activity itself
19:01:32 <strcat[m]> but that's not important
19:04:15 <Remu[m]> It is not that important, but just a curious question if the "default" direct boot alarm sound is possible to be changed?
19:04:46 <Remu[m]> As in, by OS configuration/building? Not really by user settings
19:05:43 <strcat> yes we could change it
19:05:57 <strcat> it's just whatever the default is when nothing is set
19:06:03 <strcat> since settings aren't accessible
19:06:36 <strcat> in general, not much will function in Direct Boot mode
19:06:40 <strcat> only a couple things support it
19:06:48 <strcat> and that's a good thing overall - it needs to be done quite cautiously
19:07:27 <strcat> for example you won't receive notifications about emails from an email app and it *shouldn't* make that work because the credentials should definitely not be in device encrypted storage
19:07:32 <strcat> it's a tradeoff for some rare cases like alarms
19:07:36 <strcat> up to apps to decide though
19:08:12 <Remu[m]> <strcat "it's just whatever the default i"> About that, I found that the "default" Cesium is not the one playing... (And I can't find it in the alarm sound options).
19:08:27 <Remu[m]> <strcat "it's a tradeoff for some rare ca"> Yeah, it is.
19:11:27 <mrxx_0[m]> Why are all the repo on GrapheneOS project "Updated x minutes ago" ?
19:11:48 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, must've been a big push.
19:12:03 <Remu[m]> <mrxx_0[m] "Why are all the repo on Graphene"> Saw that earlier on platform_frameworks_base few hours ago
19:12:27 <Remu[m]> And I can't find an update on releases, pull request, commits
19:12:46 <madaidan[m]> <mrxx_0[m] "Why are all the repo on Graphene"> The repos are regularly rebased on newer versions
19:13:06 <strcat[m]> in this case it's from tagging a release
19:13:11 <strcat[m]> RP1A.201105.002.2020.11.05.18 tag
19:13:22 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense.
19:14:32 <dazinism> Set alarm about 5 mins in advance. Closed clock activity and then restarted my 3XL. Only worked 2nd time I tried with battery optimization off
19:15:42 <TheJollyRoger> ~Thirty minutes to go for me.
19:15:47 <Remu[m]> <dazinism "Set alarm about 5 mins in advanc"> What was the alarm sound like? Was it some interval of low-pitched sound?
19:16:21 <Remu[m]> (Asking out of curiosity)
19:16:35 <dazinism> Forgot to say I logged in both times
19:16:57 <mrxx_0[m]> <dazinism "Set alarm about 5 mins in advanc"> It only works with battery optimization off right ?
19:17:31 <dazinism> mrxx_0: yeah
19:18:07 <mrxx_0[m]>  Ok ! dazinism

19:22:37 <r0tt0r[m]> * anyone knows what is wrong?does my acc need an identserver?

19:25:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> brenneke  nothing

19:37:53 <Remu[m]> Looks like my remark applies only on a factory reset phone where the default alarm sound is not changed...
19:38:44 <Remu[m]> Quite a silly experiment, but it helps in case others need that info
19:40:37 <Remu[m]> Anyways, just hoping to see this project flourish in the future
19:41:16 <Remu[m]> Nice to have a choice other than Apple phones

20:29:52 <Partyush[m]> hello is camera2api has been removed from graphene os ?
20:30:40 <Partyush[m]> google camera with gcam provider in pixel 4a don't work. do your work ?
20:31:50 <TheJollyRoger> Partyush[m]: OpenCamera can use the Camera2 API if the hardware for it (Pixel Visual Core) is present.
20:32:09 <TheJollyRoger> It's not set by default so you'll need to check to make sure it's enabled.
20:39:19 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, time for testing the second scenario.
20:45:30 <r0tt0r[m]> <Partyush[m] "google camera with gcam provider"> yes theres an apk you need which provides most minimal stuff that gcam works

20:50:59 <louipc> what happens
20:51:03 <r0tt0r[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "r0tt0r you are just wrong "> huh?why
20:51:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> We do not recommend our users to install debug applications
20:51:29 <louipc> oh lol
20:52:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Moreover this app uses the name of a gms package without implementing everything expected to be there
20:52:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Apps might merely check for the existence of this package and crash
20:52:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Gcam at any point may start depending on more of gms
20:53:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> At that point it is only going to work against microg
20:53:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> You don't need signature spoofing for gcam, at least not yet
20:53:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Which is why installing microg and gcam in a separate user profile is a better option
20:54:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also it might break at any time. You will not get any support here if it does
20:54:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't support gcam or using microg
20:54:38 <r0tt0r[m]> ok thx for clarifying on this. though to just use gcam i find microg quiet overdose
20:54:45 <louipc> i wonder what amount of apps support there should be in grapheneos chans
20:55:20 <louipc> should it all be in offtopic?
20:55:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> No

21:23:24 <strcat[m]> most of that money was misused as company revenue by James against my wishes and then he stole all the remaining donations near the end, particularly all the Bitcoin donations worth > 100k (more now)
21:24:34 <r0tt0r[m]> woa thats a big oof from here, i wish you all the best for the outcome of this.
21:24:38 <strcat[m]> despite the company not claiming those as revenue or anything, he just stole them all when he pushed me out, I really shouldn't have trusted him to handle it and should have gotten him to regularly transfer it to me but it is what it is now and we have to deal with the theft

21:25:40 <strcat[m]> in a sense it's the people who donated that had their money stolen by him so it would be very helpful for anyone who sent Bitcoin donations in particular and who has a record of it to contact me and get in touch with my lawyer
21:26:09 <strcat[m]> he misused these donations as company revenue and personal income to him despite him never being involved as a developer or working on the open source project in any way

21:30:49 <strcat[m]> and past stuff I've written about this
21:31:03 <strcat[m]> Copperhead is escalating their attacks on the project
21:44:08 <Kurai> What is their endgame anyway? I thought that copperhead was using code from grapheneos to keep going, so getting this project to shipwreck sounds counterintuitive to me
21:44:17 <Kurai> but I may be wrong so I’m asking
21:46:47 <louipc> crush the competition, eliminate detractors, maximize profit, etc
21:46:54 <strcat[m]> Kurai: yes, they just rip off our code, including code from after the split
21:46:59 <strcat[m]> and fraudulently claim that they authored it and/or own it
21:47:08 <strcat[m]> they don't even understand the basics of what it does, or AOSP security
21:47:21 <strcat[m]> they don't have privacy or security experts working for them, that's not what they do
21:47:22 <louipc> Kurai: they are more about marketing than code though
21:47:34 <louipc> so I imagine it won't make a difference really
21:47:58 <strcat[m]> what they do is release an incredibly expensive branded build of AOSP with dubious 'hardening' and tracking in the Updater app for enforcing their expensive licensing scheme
21:48:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat pm
21:48:36 <strcat[m]> they primarily intend to sell devices through third party resellers, and they've worked with at least 2 resellers later arrested for involvement in organized crime
21:48:40 <strcat[m]> including MPC
21:48:52 <strcat[m]> this is a major part of why the split happened with the open source project
21:49:19 <strcat[m]> what they are trying to do is steal the reputation built by the open source project
21:49:21 <strcat[m]> with their closed source fork of it

23:34:34 <strcat[m]> he also recently made a ridiculous claim that we are 'cyberbullying' the Copperhead corporation by defending against their misinformation and attacks on us + talking about his actions truthfully
23:34:53 <strcat[m]> feel free to help counter the misinformation they're spreading across platforms
23:35:10 <strcat[m]> there are multiple people involved with Copperhead doing it across a bunch of platforms: Telegram, Matrix, Twitter, Reddit
23:35:16 <strcat[m]> they try editing Wikipedia pages to push misinformation too
23:35:46 <strcat[m]> they send press releases to journalists and bloggers to try to get their false claims laundered into a secondary source
23:36:00 <ludicrous_speed[> It sounds like garbage drama, which is almost always a waste of everybody's time. Sometimes you have to answer lawsuits though.
23:36:29 <strcat[m]> well, they're the ones that filed a baseless lawsuit based on a pile of false claims and dubious legal arguments
23:36:56 <strcat[m]> we're not just sitting still and playing defense, we're filing counterclaims and our own lawsuit(s)
23:37:21 <strcat[m]> and there will be a response to their continued spread of misinformation and attacks on GrapheneOS / myself
23:37:41 <strcat[m]> they're making a huge mistake by continuing to try escalating this fight, they are going to lose in court and they'll lose in the court of public opinion too
23:37:51 <strcat[m]> it's a desperate company
23:38:24 <strcat[m]> they could just stop trying to hurt us and try actually developing their own OS instead of ripping off our work
23:38:41 <strcat[m]> they'd rather keep trying to pretend to be the original project and wipe out the real one
23:38:54 <strcat[m]> rent seeking based on other people's work is their business model
23:39:20 <strcat[m]> and BTW I own have of this company, the person who hijacked the company for his own purposes just doesn't care one bit about actually acting in the interest of shareholders
23:39:22 <ludicrous_speed[> Obviously the copperhead OS team can't see the big picture here. Its all about empowering users of technology in light of companies like google, etc., who want to use people as data generating robots.
23:39:29 <strcat[m]> instead wages a self-destructive war against me based on a personal vendetta
23:39:41 <strcat[m]> ludicrous_speed: CopperheadOS is far worse than companies like Google
23:39:58 <strcat[m]> you don't see Google trying to wipe out open source projects and scam people out of their money to buy security theater products making them worse off
23:40:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hey at least google is open about what they are
23:40:39 <strcat[m]> also
23:40:45 <strcat[m]> a stock OS Pixel where you don't sign into a Google account
23:40:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Still works
23:41:12 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "I wouldn't expect their newer re"> https://mamushi.io/privacy-policy/
23:41:24 <strcat[m]> is in a better situation than buying a CopperheadOS phone where the Updater app identifies you to their server
23:41:34 <ludicrous_speed[> Well, keep your chin up and try to power through.
23:41:46 <strcat[m]> use stock + disable Play services and the other Google apps and you'd be better off than this expensive phone
23:41:59 <strcat[m]> or don't disable them
23:42:01 <strcat[m]> still better off
23:42:11 <num8[m]> yep
23:42:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "use stock + disable Play service"> No. Do NOT
23:42:23 <strcat[m]> just saying it's less bad than what they offer
23:42:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Afaik play services is responsible for system and apex updates
23:42:40 <num8[m]> I was quite shocked about the whole copperheados thing, frankly
23:42:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yeah, it is
23:42:54 <strcat[m]> you don't need APEX updates on Pixels though
23:43:09 <strcat[m]> so yeah, you need it for OTA updates
23:43:11 <strcat[m]> you could sideload them though
23:43:31 <strcat[m]> num8: it just gets worse and worse
23:43:39 <strcat[m]> there is so much that has to be addressed now
23:44:15 <ludicrous_speed[> People should be working together instead of this crap.  I've heard that calyx and grapheme sort of work together.
23:44:28 <num8[m]> <strcat[m] "there is so much that has to be "> yep, I see
23:44:48 <num8[m]> I litterally instantly wiped clean my 5x at the time
23:44:50 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Afaik play services is responsib"> You don't need to disable the play services app. A lot of the tracking specifically can be disabled within it. Not that I'd trust it all that much, considering how invasive it is.
23:49:08 <leadfoilcat> Hi! Please tell me, is it possible with GOS (or with Android in general) to get 2G/3G/4G communication using a reverse-tethering USB-dongle only (with Pixel's internal Wi-Fi and WWAN switched off)? And if it's possible what is required for this?
23:52:33 <strcat[m]> you can get internet via USB
23:52:46 <strcat[m]> you'd just have data though
23:53:28 <strcat[m]> it will be treated as USB ethernet AFAIK
23:53:53 <strcat[m]> don't know if you could somehow use VoLTE etc. through it
23:54:08 <strcat[m]> but I'd strongly recommend using encrypted, data-based messaging apps anyway
