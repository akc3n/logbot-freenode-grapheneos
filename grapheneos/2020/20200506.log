00:00:53 <demonMachina> aside from makig it a pain in the ass for devs...what are the user implications for scoped storage?
00:41:17 <jussa> hey  im back
00:43:29 <jussa> dann
00:43:32 <jussa> danny
00:44:01 <jussa> it seems impossible to get 3a or pixel 2 second hand in / shipped to fin
01:16:42 <demonMachina> jussa have you looked into a mail forwarding service?
01:17:13 <demonMachina> they definitely exist, I just don't know of one specifically
01:20:10 <sea2clowns> look harder jussa, must be out there ;)
01:24:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> jussa: Happy to send, but guarantee it'll be cheaper to find an org that does it for a living, haha
01:46:38 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderPr: on the subject of HSMs - currently I am very interested in solokeys, and backed their kickstarter. Got a few of 'em and hoping that soon I'll be able to update their firmware when support for things like age/gpg/ssh comes around.
01:47:03 <TheJollyRoger> Remembered I kinda left that hanging the other night.
01:47:19 <TheJollyRoger> But for now, really liking Trezor much better.
01:47:35 <TheJollyRoger> Simply because of the backup/restoration function.
01:48:17 <jussa> theyr too rare here
01:48:36 <jussa> ill reg
01:48:42 <jussa> and leets talk
01:49:49 <jussa> ups shouldnt be too xpensive
01:50:06 <renlord> strcat: how do you check if postfix is using DANE?
01:50:14 <jussa> if you live in la , my gf there can pay it and handle sendinf
01:50:27 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://havedane.net/
01:50:30 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's not on by default
01:50:45 <jussa> or bay area
01:50:57 <jussa> or new york
01:51:36 <strcat> renlord: https://paste.xinu.at/xKF TLS config
01:52:07 <renlord> how does it know to use unbound to resolve instead of systemd-resolve?
01:52:30 <strcat> renlord: set it up so unbound is the resolver on 127.0.0.1
01:52:37 <renlord> uh, such a stupid question, i should replace systemd-resolve with unbound
01:52:39 <renlord> lol
01:52:44 <strcat> and make that the resolver in /etc/resolv.conf and also stop dhclient or whatever from replacing it
01:53:14 * renlord brain farted
01:53:36 <strcat> renlord: https://paste.xinu.at/LEAL sample unbound config acting as a forwarding resolver (for better privacy rather than talking to the authoritative nameservers itself) with DNS-over-TLS
01:53:42 <strcat> + provides DNSSEC by default
01:54:08 <strcat> renlord: just need to point it at a trust anchor file which most distros set up
01:54:18 <strcat> auto-trust-anchor-file is recommended so it keeps it updated (has to be writable)
01:54:40 <renlord> what's the trust anchor file
01:54:51 <strcat> renlord: dnssec root
01:55:02 <strcat> renlord: distros mostly give you a default setup that works
01:55:20 <strcat> you only need to point it at tls certs and set up forwarding with DNS-over-TLS
01:55:37 <renlord> https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/any/dnssec-anchors/ ?
01:55:43 <renlord> at /etc/trusted-key.key?
01:55:52 <strcat> renlord: the arch unbound package has a really fucking weird setup
01:55:56 <strcat> the default config handles this
01:56:16 <strcat> renlord: the arch package uses chroot by default
01:56:19 <renlord> the arch wiki has a non-working config for postfix/dovecot also
01:56:23 <strcat> so unbound can't actually read /etc/trusted-key.key
01:56:31 <strcat> renlord: I can give you a working one
01:56:37 <strcat> sec
01:56:40 <renlord> i already got postfix/dovecot working now
01:56:42 <strcat> ah
01:56:49 <strcat> renlord: I'd recommend using dovecot for smtp auth too
01:56:50 <renlord> its just DANE/DNSSEC only
01:56:56 <renlord> ya i use SASL now
01:56:56 <strcat> there are a bunch of little things I figured out along the way
01:57:04 <renlord> as per your recommendation
01:57:12 <renlord> just using a passwd-static file now
01:57:16 <renlord> i probably use a db later on
01:57:19 <strcat> and I have opendkim + spf-engine + opendmarc for inbound mail verification
01:57:29 <renlord> the last remaining issue is opendmarc
01:57:38 <renlord> what permissions exactly on the UNIX socket
01:57:45 <renlord> 660 does not seem to work
01:57:49 <strcat> renlord: put it in postfix grp
01:57:53 <renlord> i did
01:58:00 <strcat> postfix runs in a chroot
01:58:01 <renlord> its opendmarc:postfix
01:58:03 <strcat> put it in the postfix dir
01:58:19 <strcat> in uhh
01:58:43 <renlord> but /var/run/opendkim/opendkim.sock is fine though
01:58:47 <renlord> @_@
01:58:53 <renlord> you sure its chroot-ed?
01:59:09 <renlord> can confirm emails are signed
02:00:47 <strcat> renlord: btw by default opendkim doesn't include length
02:00:49 <strcat> l=
02:00:54 <strcat> and it allows appending stuff to your emails
02:00:59 <renlord> wtf
02:01:00 <strcat> I haven't addressed this yet but I found it out
02:01:06 <strcat> renlord: email is fucking STUPID
02:01:23 <strcat> renlord: so it allows someone to take your email
02:01:24 <renlord> insane defaults
02:01:25 <strcat> append stuff to it
02:01:29 <strcat> and the signature still validates
02:01:32 <strcat> renlord: also it allows
02:01:34 <strcat> adding headers
02:01:41 <strcat> other than ones it forbids
02:01:41 <renlord> the headers i know
02:01:48 <strcat> it double includes some headers
02:01:50 <strcat> as signed
02:01:56 <strcat> which makes it forbid including more
02:02:02 <renlord> headers i probably must allow because im using a different domain to relay to my actual domain
02:02:07 <strcat> renlord: anyway you need to do something to add l=
02:02:18 <strcat> renlord: nah you don't need to allow it for most
02:02:22 <renlord> does l= only count body length or the whole email?
02:02:38 <strcat> renlord: the signed part I guess
02:02:41 <strcat> headers can still be added
02:02:56 <renlord> do you keep strict canonlization?
02:02:58 <renlord> lol
02:03:08 <renlord> what sort of funny business can happen if relaxed?
02:03:11 <strcat> strict/strict
02:03:36 <strcat[m]> allows inserting whitespace and shit?
02:03:45 <renlord> but that's kinda benign isnt it?
02:03:56 <strcat[m]> I don't consider it benign
02:03:58 <strcat[m]> just use strict doesn't break
02:04:04 <strcat[m]> and enable length check
02:04:11 <strcat[m]> and maybe double sign more headers
02:04:40 <strcat[m]> renlord: I made assorted other changes like having postfix filter out Received header for submission port
02:04:48 <strcat[m]> renlord: so it doesn't leak my ip
02:05:01 <renlord> ah yes, that's a goodidea
02:05:22 <renlord> how do i do that filter
02:09:04 <strcat[m]> renlord: sec busy for a bit
02:09:17 <strcat[m]> can check config bit later
02:09:27 <renlord> btw, beta update smooth
02:09:36 <renlord> boot up took much longer than usual though
02:30:41 <renlord> strcat[m]: i think there's a problem
02:31:01 <renlord> with this release
02:31:06 <strcat[m]> what problem?
02:31:13 <renlord> requestLayout() improperly called by com.android.keyguard.AlphaOptimizedLinearLayout{
02:31:18 <renlord> keeps getting spammed in logcat
02:31:21 <strcat[m]> in what
02:31:51 <renlord> com.android.systemui
02:32:04 <renlord> 05-06 12:31:59.189  2235  2235 W View    : requestLayout() improperly called by com.android.keyguard.AlphaOptimizedLinearLayout{
02:32:16 <renlord> every 500ms
03:05:25 <jussa> danny contribs. graphene , or is part of th4 team?
03:08:04 <jussa> hope he is
03:08:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Just a fan who's trying to help organize the community.
03:08:28 <jussa> ah still here
03:08:41 <jussa> cause i was thinkin if not
03:08:58 <jussa> then illl send out the both
03:09:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Just finished brushin my teeth, and about to tuck into bed, lol - I check chats beforehand, I'm mentally ill like that.
03:09:07 <jussa> :)
03:09:45 <jussa> or no need if your communitymwanager
03:09:57 <jussa> or well other for personal
03:10:09 <jussa> and other as don , symbolic one
03:10:52 <jussa> from the people who started it, the first device on the path . to the people carryin the flag
03:11:02 <jussa> people / project
03:11:45 <jussa> ill get some docs aswell from the deparment archives
03:12:42 <jussa> who knows could be also useful for theplatformm plans to have insider documentation and the actual device than just as an ornament
03:15:44 <jussa> well from my impression your a nice fit for community manager so hope theyll have you
03:18:35 <jussa> im gonna bribe them to it with my ornamental n900 special dev dept box all gadgets in double basically used couple or zero times , otherwise :D well i will anyways
03:19:07 <jussa> can u believe it i dont basically have access to buy pixl 3a in fin
03:19:34 <sea2clowns> nope
03:19:41 <jussa> nowhere on second hand stores
03:19:45 <jussa> not sold new
03:20:08 <jussa> reconditioned is way overpriced
03:20:41 <jussa> askin the original price
03:20:47 <jussa> pretty  much
03:21:14 <jussa> and yeyeye someone told me bout mail redirection services
03:22:28 <jussa> but i bet the service gets the price slongside shippin to 300 anywyas
03:22:35 <jussa> 300e
03:22:43 <jussa> n above
03:22:43 <strcat[m]> renlord: they did change stuff related to it
03:22:47 <strcat[m]> renlord: frameworks/base
03:22:52 <strcat[m]> renlord: I think I did the thing properly tho
03:23:50 <renlord> logcat is really noisy
03:23:57 <renlord> its impossible to see anything else
03:24:03 <renlord> with that spamming unless i filter it
03:25:07 <jussa> filter away
03:25:34 <jussa> so whos the project leader
03:25:49 <renlord> jussa: please, use the logs
03:25:56 <renlord> and read the landing page
03:27:17 <jussa> but its in your brain the info able to be inserted with speed of years of muscle memory
03:27:29 <renlord> jussa: would you like to get banned?
03:27:29 <jussa> like asap
03:27:38 <jussa> cant joke?
03:28:06 <renlord> you're probably too new here to joke.
03:28:28 <JTL> renlord: I think jussa is just a newbie who doesn't know how things work here
03:29:03 <jussa> yeah ehh
03:29:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/6ef8eb1835c57495283a05cde66831fddcc5a2ec
03:29:18 <jussa> such a warm community
03:29:29 <strcat[m]> renlord: there was a conflict there
03:29:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: so I had to deal with that
03:29:38 <strcat[m]> so I know they changed stuff
03:30:27 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/576c4d816c8efe8b9bf7dc88880d8ccde3beacee
03:32:26 <jussa> dont you think not bein so harsh on "newbies" and relaxin would improve probabilities of newbies of ability and asset to stay , on some like ridiculously small things.BUT
03:33:56 <sea2clowns> at the same time, you need to appreciate that they're trying to have a constructive conversation
03:33:59 <jussa> u know i can actually reflect you and finally see myself in a mirror heh, used to , now hiatus, lead 500-1000 person community from development to social aspects of community management
03:34:54 <jussa> but there harsness had its place i guess
03:35:14 <jussa> just though this is a liberal effort
03:35:48 <jussa> but yeeah sorry that...general channel has people wanting to talk other topics too
03:36:16 <jussa> or is this active development channe
03:36:56 <jussa> quite mixed seems
03:37:21 <jussa> out of 8 hours talkin n gettin my finger around the truth
03:41:48 <jussa> here im throwing romantic respectful compliments n then jokin due to nonsensical harshness out of simple casual question , not out of laziness if one assumes that, assume if person speaks alonefor quite many lines the questions intent is just to evoke atleast some response and engagement in social interaction with people here, of position and newbie nobodies like myself
03:42:32 <jussa> n asked if i want a ban
03:46:23 <jussa> unless someone is making money just seems irrational. i worked the project 9 years n felt like myself reacting to me there but i was makin tons of money. security privacy...freedom, liberaliam
03:47:35 <renlord> i dont think i was harsh when confronting a person who wants to waste other people's time
03:47:36 <jussa> but as said maybe just a newbie who doesnt know how things work round here
03:47:49 <jussa> how am i doig so
03:48:18 <renlord> you're asking repeated questions that have been answered many times and answers that can be found in the grapheneos landing page
03:48:36 <jussa> first time i asked that
03:48:58 <renlord> when told to do your own homework, you suggest that we should waste our time answering your question when the questions have already been fucking answered 1000 times
03:49:02 <jussa> didnt know was prohibited
03:49:17 <jussa> missed my eye the info on the page
03:49:37 <renlord> and now, you continuously proceed to defend your ignorance and refuse to the recommendations put forth to you
03:49:54 <renlord> *refuse to accept
03:50:03 <jussa> now i know hey
03:50:10 <jussa> your makin it clear
03:50:34 <renlord> OK, good that we cleared things up.
03:50:48 <jussa> your personal values atleast , which might not collision with mine
03:51:06 <jussa> doesnt matter tho we'r different
03:51:12 <renlord> i dont think its a personal value of mine, but wasting other people's time is general is extremely rude
03:51:13 <jussa> im bein honest
03:51:32 <jussa> one question
03:51:38 <jussa> ..
03:51:43 <TheJollyRoger> renlord: I'll take this one.
03:51:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yes?
03:51:52 <sea2clowns> jussa, just trolling...
03:52:07 <jussa> no i pointd
03:52:15 <TheJollyRoger> Because was that passive-aggressiveness that I heard?
03:52:15 <jussa> that i asked one question
03:53:03 <jussa> passive agr- met with the very same
03:53:17 <jussa> at max
03:54:12 <jussa> lol i just asked whos the leader
03:54:36 <TheJollyRoger> I'm pretty sure that you're just here to waste other people's time.
03:54:46 <jussa> point me where infos at sure ty but leave out the answer
03:55:17 <TheJollyRoger> The leader of this project is strcat.
03:55:42 <renlord> thanks
03:56:03 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about my tardiness >_<.
03:56:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, he's a troll, he's continuing to PM me.
03:56:42 <renlord> q/window bare
03:57:18 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Ahahaha
03:58:14 <renlord> strcat[m]: looks like many changes to keyguard
05:23:24 <bseeinu[m]> Did I dream seeing a new stable release today?
05:36:35 <strcat[m]> it's a new release, it's not in the stable channel yet
05:41:35 <renlord> strcat[m]: is ipv6 working for you on ovh?
05:41:52 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes but you have to set it up
05:42:01 <strcat[m]> they don't have dhcp or anything for ipv6
05:42:11 <renlord> what do you mean by setting up
05:42:20 <renlord> i have an assigned ipv6 address
05:42:25 <strcat> renlord: get the ipv6 ip and the ipv6 route
05:42:28 <strcat> from the web console
05:42:30 <strcat> and set up a static ip
05:42:32 <strcat> that's it
05:42:48 <renlord> oh i see
05:42:50 <renlord> on the box itself
05:42:56 <renlord> gotcha
05:42:58 <strcat> yes it works externallty
05:43:04 <strcat> it's just the OS is not set up
05:43:10 <strcat> since it expects dhcp regardless of what you pick
05:43:12 <strcat> or ipv6 magic
05:43:14 <strcat> they don't do that
05:43:16 <renlord> kek
05:43:35 <strcat> their ipv6 works but you only get 1 ip for a vps
05:43:42 <strcat> and it's static ip config only lol
05:44:20 <strcat> renlord: so yeah get the ip + route and set it up
05:44:35 <strcat> and you can set up reverse ip in their web console for ipv4 and ipv6
05:44:38 <strcat> their web console is really bad
05:44:50 <renlord> yeah i fixed that, had to use their backend api tool
05:44:59 <renlord> the frontend is broken
05:45:03 <strcat> the web console works
05:45:07 <strcat> the UI just doesn't show it worked
05:45:09 <renlord> no it doesnt for me
05:45:11 <strcat> for ipv6
05:45:19 <strcat> it says error but it works
05:45:26 <renlord> @_@
05:45:26 <strcat> this is ovh ui design
05:45:36 <strcat> also the monitoring stuff
05:45:38 <strcat> doesn't really work
05:45:42 <strcat> it will often say the vps is down
05:45:44 <strcat> but it's not
05:45:44 <renlord> how the fk am i suppose to confirm that it works.
05:45:53 <strcat> renlord: do reverse ip check
05:46:10 <strcat> for email
05:46:24 <strcat>     echo "test email" | s-nail -s "Test email" -r contact⊙aa check-auth⊙vpc
05:46:32 <strcat> -r is the email to send from
05:46:35 <strcat> so use a valid one
05:46:41 <strcat> checks DKIM / SPF / reverse IP
05:46:48 <strcat> or just check rev ip yourself
05:47:15 <renlord> funny
05:51:37 <strcat> renlord: I assume you got a VPS SSD right
05:51:40 <strcat> renlord: for something funny
05:51:44 <strcat> measure the drive speed with dd
05:51:50 <strcat> it's like 10MB/s
05:52:31 <renlord> 163MB/s
05:52:44 <strcat> renlord: bigger file
05:52:57 <strcat> or you got a really fast one
05:53:01 <strcat> some of mine are really slow
05:53:04 <strcat> time.grapheneos.org
05:53:06 <strcat> is so slow
05:53:31 <strcat> d if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 of=test
05:54:02 <renlord> yeah
05:54:04 <renlord> about 100MB/s
05:54:09 <strcat> wow a fast one
05:54:12 <renlord> you should complain lol
05:54:16 <strcat> time.grapheneos.org is 6MB/s
05:54:32 <renlord> they put you on a busy rack lol
05:54:55 <renlord> my box is in singapore
05:54:57 <strcat> grapheneos.org gets 100 ish
05:55:06 <strcat> renlord: mine are all at the montreal place
05:55:30 <strcat> that jusar guy is messaging me
05:55:39 <strcat> I don't think he's a troll just... odd
05:55:56 <renlord> i have +i on
05:56:02 <renlord> so i dont hear from non-registered users
05:56:08 <strcat> he's messaging me on reddit
05:56:16 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Uh...
05:56:24 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry >_<.
05:56:37 <strcat> he's just odd
05:56:54 <strcat> *shrug*
05:56:59 <TheJollyRoger> Ah well.
05:57:15 <strcat> weird way of typing
05:57:26 <strcat> not sure if the weird spelling/grammar is on purpose
05:58:21 <strcat> he wants to be unbanned lol
05:58:34 <strcat> called you guys authoritarians
05:58:41 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahaha
06:01:41 <TheJollyRoger> strcat, when you have a moment, could we chatter?
06:04:54 <renlord> me -- an authoritarian?
06:04:55 <renlord> LOL
06:05:11 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, well...
06:05:27 <TheJollyRoger> Normally I try to be pretty easygoing, just, argh.
06:58:20 <zxwayland> hey just got my pixel 3a from the google store. just turned it on and updated it. do i need to enable the T-Mobile USA enable unlock device app? not sure if its a trick lol
07:01:11 <TheJollyRoger> Hi zxwayland, I've never heard of anything like that before.
07:01:28 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think you'll have to. Just go to settings -> about phone and start the process to install.
07:01:34 <TheJollyRoger> If you need help, I'll walk you through it.
07:01:47 <TheJollyRoger> (You'll have to ping me to get my attention, since I'm a tad bit busy and may not respond immediately)
07:01:50 <zxwayland> Its supposely suppose to unlock my device. but i thought its already unlocked from google. i think it might be a trick from T-mobile, so they can carrier lock me in
07:02:12 <TheJollyRoger> Rrgh. Sounds like. Just skip it and go to your phone's settings.
07:02:27 <TheJollyRoger> Do you have wifi where you are?
07:02:51 <zxwayland> yeah
07:03:02 <zxwayland> wait a minute, i am going to take a shower
07:03:14 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Switch your phone's wifi on, ideally you should let it update fully before you start the process.
07:03:17 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
07:03:27 <zxwayland> yeah I already did that on my pixel 3a
07:03:33 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
07:03:38 <zxwayland> thats why it downloaded that weird t-mobile app
07:03:51 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Oh sheesh... yeah just ignore it.
07:04:12 <TheJollyRoger> If you run into any trouble and you don't get back before I head off for the night, PM me and I can walk you through the process, or you can ask around here for help.
07:04:30 <TheJollyRoger> *through the process tomorrow
07:04:39 <zxwayland> oh ok
07:05:58 <zxwayland> i am going to enable OEM unlocking, but first i am going to take a shower.
07:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
07:13:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
07:28:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yo-ho!
07:29:15 <zxwayland> hi
07:46:40 <zxwayland> you there?
07:52:26 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry! yes!@
07:52:28 <TheJollyRoger> one sec
07:53:46 <zxwayland> i unzipped fastboot
07:54:36 <zxwayland> not sure how to unlock bootloader and 'fastboot flashing unlock'
07:55:09 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about that, I was just running back and forth.
07:55:29 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! I'll give you a hand. First up, what operating system are you running (and distro, I think I recall you mentioning you run Linux, but I don't recall distro)
07:55:35 <TheJollyRoger> ?
07:55:52 <zxwayland> Debian buster
07:56:02 <TheJollyRoger> Since we'll need a few sanity checks to be made first, so you don't end up bric-- okay! Got it.
07:56:17 <zxwayland> ok
07:56:35 <TheJollyRoger> First things first... if you've installed adb or fastboot through apt, you're going to have to uninstall it first; the version in apt will likely give you a softbrick.
07:57:13 <TheJollyRoger> Older versions of adb are prone to do this if they don't support autodetection and this can cause your device to display a "no bootable image found" error when you turn it on.
07:57:36 <zxwayland> i got fasbtboot from grapheneos install part
07:57:47 <zxwayland> unzipped already
07:57:50 <TheJollyRoger> Good man!
07:58:22 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! So where's it saved? We can add it to your path now, you'll have to in order to run the script.
07:58:59 <zxwayland> in my /home
08:00:22 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, so `ls $HOME/platform-tools/fastboot` returns the fastboot executable? Just trying to get a picture.
08:01:19 <zxwayland> yup
08:01:25 <zxwayland> got it
08:01:34 <TheJollyRoger> Fantastic! Ok! You're going to want to do the following:
08:02:28 <TheJollyRoger> `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/platform-tools/` and hit return. It won't return anything if successful.
08:02:50 <TheJollyRoger> This will be good for /one session only/ so to ensure it happens every time, I'm going to ask you to add it to your .bashrc:
08:03:22 <TheJollyRoger> `echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/platform-tools/" >> ~/.bashrc`
08:03:39 <TheJollyRoger> This way it'll always append the command path from this point going forward.
08:03:48 <TheJollyRoger> The next thing we're going to need to do is fetch your udev rules.
08:03:59 <zxwayland> ok
08:05:34 <TheJollyRoger> whta you're going to want to do is obtain the android rules and move them to your udev rules directory by running: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/master/51-android.rules && sudo mv 51-android.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules`
08:05:52 <TheJollyRoger> If you want, you can just wget the android rules file first, look it over, and then move it to your udev rules.
08:07:21 <TheJollyRoger> It won't return any output.
08:08:45 <TheJollyRoger> The next thing you're going to need to do is reload the udev rules with `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`. I like to create and add my account to the adbusers group because I usually work remotely but you're probably not going to be doing that so don't worry about adding the group.
08:09:17 <TheJollyRoger> next up, another quick sanity check, can you type in `fastboot --version` and see if it returns something along the lines of 30.0.0?
08:09:42 <TheJollyRoger> As long as it says 30.0.something or 29.0.something, you're good.
08:10:42 <zxwayland> i can't so sudo
08:11:31 <TheJollyRoger> Hold up a moment, you can't su to root or aren't a part of the group "wheel?"
08:11:50 <zxwayland> in debian you do
08:11:52 <zxwayland> su -
08:11:58 <zxwayland> than your root password
08:14:08 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, you prefer to do it that way. No problem then, just run the commands marked with sudo as root.
08:14:20 <TheJollyRoger> But do NOT run wget as root.
08:14:33 <zxwayland> i logged in as root
08:14:51 <zxwayland> # mv 51-android.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
08:14:51 <zxwayland> mv: cannot stat '51-android.rules': No such file or directory
08:14:52 <zxwayland> root@debian:~# exit
08:15:59 <TheJollyRoger> as root:
08:16:21 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wait up.
08:16:56 <TheJollyRoger> You're going to need to get those udev rules: run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/master/51-android.rules`
08:17:06 <TheJollyRoger> Then move them.
08:17:50 <zxwayland> ok i already download from wget
08:18:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Then move 'em. When you su'd to root, did it change your working directory?
08:18:17 <TheJollyRoger> Also -- please don't run wget as root.
08:18:55 <zxwayland> i didn't
08:19:24 <zxwayland> its just ~$
08:19:32 <zxwayland> in /home
08:20:16 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Move that rules file to your /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory.
08:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to do it as root.
08:22:42 <zxwayland> ok done
08:22:55 <zxwayland> do i log out of root now?
08:23:24 <TheJollyRoger> Not yet. You'll need to do `udevadm control --reload-rules` or reboot your computer, otherwise you'll need to run fastboot as root.
08:24:04 <zxwayland> ok
08:24:08 <zxwayland> udevadm control --reload-rules
08:24:11 <zxwayland> as root
08:24:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
08:24:54 <zxwayland> cool
08:25:12 <TheJollyRoger> Next up we'll try a quick sanity check. Run `fastboot --version`
08:25:23 <TheJollyRoger> Tell me what you get.
08:25:40 <zxwayland> fastboot --version
08:25:41 <zxwayland> -bash: fastboot: command not found
08:25:51 <zxwayland> as root
08:25:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, as a regular user.
08:26:04 <zxwayland> ohh
08:26:16 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. As a regular user. It won't work for root because we've only aliased it for your regular account.
08:26:19 <zxwayland> got it
08:26:27 <zxwayland> its there
08:26:32 <TheJollyRoger> Which version?
08:26:35 <zxwayland> fastboot version 30.0.0-6374843
08:26:41 <TheJollyRoger> Excellent!
08:27:35 <TheJollyRoger> Okay. Next step's optional but recommended. Do you want to verify the payload prior to flashing, or do you just want to install GrapheneOS and use the attestation server to verify post-install?
08:27:57 <TheJollyRoger> I recommend doing both, but signify-openbsd may or may not be depreciated on Debian Buster.
08:27:57 <zxwayland> you mean sifnify-openbsd?
08:28:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
08:28:26 <zxwayland> i already verifyed it earlier when i pre-downloaded it
08:28:31 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, great.
08:28:58 <TheJollyRoger> Unpack it, and make sure your phone's plugged into your motherboard directly by a good-quality USB-A to USB-C cable. Don't use a front port on your PC case.
08:29:19 <zxwayland> i have a laptop lol
08:29:22 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot will use the full capabilities of USB, so it'll require full traces.
08:29:31 <TheJollyRoger> Ok well... ah crud. We'll have to hope for the best. Plug it in.
08:29:36 <zxwayland> ok
08:29:49 <TheJollyRoger> Is the phone OEM unlock set to "allow?"
08:30:55 <zxwayland> wait what you mean unpack it? you mean the phone?
08:31:08 <TheJollyRoger> Unpack the .zip file you verified.
08:31:49 <TheJollyRoger> It should give you a directory, within which you should see several things including another .zip file, and some other stuff, and also very importantly, a "flash-all.sh" script. We're going to need that in a couple minutes.
08:31:56 <zxwayland> yes, i clicked 7 times on build number, enable developer mode. enable OEM unlock on
08:32:50 <zxwayland> you mean the upzip the crosshatch-factory-2020.05.05.02.zip ?
08:32:55 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Ok. Switch your phone off, plug it in, and then I want you to press and hold the VOLUMEDOWN key. Keep it pressed down, then press and hold down the POWER key and wait until the phone starts to fastboot.
08:33:05 <TheJollyRoger> This could take up to seven or eight seconds.
08:35:56 <zxwayland> ok
08:36:06 <zxwayland> its in the bootloader
08:36:19 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Return to your computer and punch in `fastboot flashing unlock`
08:36:36 <TheJollyRoger> Give it a second and then return to looking at your phone.
08:37:01 <zxwayland> its there
08:37:14 <TheJollyRoger> It will ask you to confirm on the screen of the device using the volume keys and power keys. It'll freeze for a couple seconds and then eventually confirm it's been unlocked and it should return you to fastboot after a bit.
08:37:14 <zxwayland> Unlock bootloader
08:37:20 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
08:37:37 <zxwayland> great
08:37:46 <zxwayland> its uplocked. its a red text
08:37:51 <TheJollyRoger> Now comes the tricky part. You see that "flash-all.sh" script? cd to that location and execute "./flash-all.sh"
08:38:02 <TheJollyRoger> (Make sure it's at the fastboot screen!)
08:38:28 <TheJollyRoger> It may take a couple moments.
08:39:01 <zxwayland> you mean in platform-tools folder?
08:39:24 <TheJollyRoger> In where you unzipped the .zip file you downloaded and verified.
08:39:35 <TheJollyRoger> Since I don't know where you unzipped it to.
08:40:16 <zxwayland> do you mean
08:40:18 <zxwayland> cd crosshatch-factory-2020.05.05.02
08:40:36 <TheJollyRoger> Hold it!
08:40:42 <TheJollyRoger> You mentioned you had a 3a?
08:40:48 <zxwayland> yes
08:41:16 <zxwayland> pixel 3a
08:41:21 <TheJollyRoger> crosshatch is for the Pixel 3XL. You're going to need sargo-factory-2020.04.14.23.zip
08:41:42 <zxwayland> oh crap
08:42:13 <zxwayland> shall i do stable or beta?
08:42:49 <TheJollyRoger> Stable. If you plan to test releases with us, you'er going to want beta. You can always go to beta at anytime you want, but if you want to change back to stable, you'll have to wait a month.
08:43:12 <TheJollyRoger> So, use Stable.
08:43:26 <zxwayland> what are the known bugs in beta right now?
08:44:01 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know. It's not likely you'd encounter any, unless you were running the CTS.
08:44:05 <TheJollyRoger> Go with stable for onw.
08:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> *for now.
08:44:23 <TheJollyRoger> Like I said, you can change to beta anytime you want, but if you want to go back, you need to select stable then wait for a month.
08:44:32 <zxwayland> ok
08:44:43 <TheJollyRoger> Delete all the crosshatch stuff.
08:44:47 <TheJollyRoger> All of it.
08:45:07 <zxwayland> yeah i already did
08:45:12 <TheJollyRoger> I think there's a safety mechanism that prevents you from say, flashing the wrong bootloader onto the wrong device, but I don't like taking chances.
08:45:25 <TheJollyRoger> Especially not with expensive cellphones.
08:45:28 <zxwayland> lol thanks
08:45:43 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Go and download and verify Sargo!
08:45:58 <zxwayland> at 29%
08:46:32 <TheJollyRoger> Excellent! I'm going to have to pass out soon, but I'll get you through the rest of the process... once you download it, you're going to need to run that flash-all script with your phone on fastboot.
08:46:45 <zxwayland> ok thanks
08:46:53 <TheJollyRoger> Fastboot won't stay on forever. After a couple minutes of no action, it will eventually switch itself back off.
08:47:08 <TheJollyRoger> If that happens, just do the combo key we discussed, volume down + power on until fastboot starts.
08:47:10 <zxwayland> oh no
08:47:21 <zxwayland> okay thanks man
08:47:27 <TheJollyRoger> Don't worry. It won't do that while the phone is installing.
08:47:37 <TheJollyRoger> Just if you put it into fastboot and forget about it sitting there.
08:48:45 <TheJollyRoger> So the next step... you're going to need to run that ./flash-all.sh script. Once it completes, it's going to pause at a screen with "fastbootd" at the top in bright yellow letters. That's a GOOD SIGN, it means the flashing succeeded.
08:49:00 <TheJollyRoger> You're going to want to use the volume keys to select "Reboot to Bootloader."
08:49:05 <TheJollyRoger> And confirm with the power key.
08:49:42 <TheJollyRoger> This should return you to Fastboot, and once you get back there, you're going to reverse what you just did with `fastboot flashing lock` and confirm it the same way you did to unlock it earlier.
08:50:37 <TheJollyRoger> When you boot, the phone will always tell you that your device is loading a different operating system, in bright yellow letters. You can skip that screen by tapping and releasing the power key twice in succession.
08:50:42 <TheJollyRoger> If you see that screen, you did it right.
08:51:12 <zxwayland> okay has been verifyed
08:51:16 <TheJollyRoger> If you see an ominous "SOFTWARE INTEGRITY NOT GUARANTEED!" warning in bright orange letters, the bootloader's not locked so you'll have to go and do that step before you start using the phone.
08:51:26 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Unzip it someplace and run ./flash-all.sh
08:51:50 <TheJollyRoger> After that step, welcome aboard the ship.
08:52:27 <TheJollyRoger> You should go and turn off OEM unlocking in developer options. By default on a fresh GrapheneOS install, it will be set to "on" so just reenter the settings the same way you did and toggle it off.
08:52:45 <zxwayland> its doing it
08:52:50 <TheJollyRoger> Here we go!
08:52:50 <zxwayland> its kind of blinking
08:53:31 <zxwayland> it says fastbootd
08:53:48 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Put your hand on the volume down key and select "Reboot to bootloader."
08:53:51 <TheJollyRoger> POWER button to confirm.
08:54:17 <TheJollyRoger> Once you get back to that fastboot black screen, `fastboot flashing lock` and confirm.
08:54:35 <zxwayland> wait
08:54:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah?
08:54:43 <zxwayland> oh its done
08:55:16 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Bootloader's locked?
08:55:37 <zxwayland> i am in flashboot mode
08:55:43 <zxwayland> its unlocked
08:55:50 <TheJollyRoger> `fastboot flashing lock`
08:56:45 <zxwayland> great its locked
08:58:13 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Select "start" from fastboot.
08:58:30 <TheJollyRoger> You should see the yellow "You are loading a different operating system" screen.
08:58:45 <zxwayland> yeah
08:58:50 <zxwayland> passed that
08:59:02 <TheJollyRoger> If you see that screen, that's a good sign because it's there to let you know that the verified boot is enforcing as it is intended to, just it's enforcing to a different set of keys that aren't Google's.
08:59:06 <zxwayland> i see the graphene os logo, with the next button on the bottom
08:59:20 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship :).
08:59:26 <TheJollyRoger> Take a drink of rum!
09:00:14 <zxwayland> lol thanks
09:00:20 <zxwayland> but i don't have rum
09:00:27 <TheJollyRoger> ...! This must be fixed!
09:02:29 <zxwayland> lol
09:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> Welll, until then! For your maiden voyage, you can grab Signal at https://signal.org/android/apk . It will self-update and you won't need to do much else to it. If you'd like to have F-Droid, you can install it by visiting F-Droid in Vanadium and downloading it and installing the .apk. That's probably the most direct way to go about it.
09:05:35 <zxwayland> cool
09:05:42 <zxwayland> thanks for the help man
09:05:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, anytime, that be what I be here for, shipmate!
09:06:03 <zxwayland> lol
09:07:15 <TheJollyRoger> And... now I'd best be off. Sleep well, arr!
09:07:21 <zxwayland> bye

11:50:51 <mrkeithogs[m]> what version of ubuntu is best to make builds on 14.04 or 16
12:00:53 <propertype> why not use the newest version?
12:11:19 <mrkeithogs[m]> good point
12:12:27 <fujita_[m]> > would installing this shitty app I need for school on a seperate useraccount on grapheneos compromize my phone?
12:12:27 <fujita_[m]> You can download shelter and copy them to a work profile
12:20:50 <demonMachina> It's not recommended to use apps like shelter, et al. A better option is to use User Profiles.
12:21:20 <demonMachina> In this case, you would create a profile for school only type apps.
12:21:46 <demonMachina> switching between profiles is easy to do, and only takes a few seconds.
12:27:37 <joshman[m]> Anyone doing Google dependent apps on a separate profile? My concern is certain TV apps or a game. Nothing security sensitive. Could give Gcam a try as well.
12:31:45 <joshman[m]> * Anyone doing Google dependent apps on a separate profile? My concern is certain TV apps or a game. Nothing sensitive. Could give Gcam a try as well.
12:33:15 <demonMachina> Haven't tried... but I have tried a few non-free apps such as Garmin Connect, Spotify,  and a few others....they worked, but I am really tring to limit their use so I have slimmed them down quite a bit and put them in a seperate profile.
12:33:37 <demonMachina> spotify is just hard to get away from.... slowly building my music collecction to the point where I won't need it sooner than later.
12:36:51 <bseeinu[m]> I went back to a dedicated music player with uncompressed FLACs
12:37:04 <bseeinu[m]> (A Walkman) and IEM headphones
12:37:18 <bseeinu[m]> And now to RetroMusic player on Android
12:37:49 <bseeinu[m]> Which even works with Sonos. Took a while, but with the right meta tagging tools it's super worth it
12:39:17 <cx2[m]> where can you find retro music plater?
12:39:23 <cx2[m]> player
12:41:15 <bseeinu[m]> I got it from github

13:03:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): you can't
13:03:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'll basically miss mail if you do so

13:11:09 <bseeinu[m]> I don't rememeber why I set on Retro
13:51:29 <yekip[m]> I tried to use the Calendar on Graphene yesterday. Is it just me, or is there no way to add an item?! I am buggered if I can find a button to do anything except change the view :D
13:51:50 <yekip[m]> (not a big deal if it doesn't work, wasn't firm about using it, but just thought I would ask in case it is good old user error!)
13:54:25 <sea2clowns> hadn't used it previously but you're correct from what i see
13:55:43 <joeri_poeri[m]> > It's not recommended to use apps like shelter, et al. A better option is to use User Profiles.
13:55:43 <joeri_poeri[m]> thanks for the tip, I'll give that a go
13:58:38 * yekip[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GjuxmFaMzuGTXknemRKBZfBV >
13:58:54 <yekip[m]> <sea2clowns "hadn't used it previously but yo"> oh, good, so that reduces the chance of user error !
14:13:23 <dallemon[m]> <yekip[m] "I tried to use the Calendar on G"> I'm sure I saw someone mention that the calendar app is obsolete and broken, but needed for core functionality.
14:18:40 <yekip[m]> ah that would make sense. thanks
14:18:46 <yekip[m]> any suggested alternatives?
14:18:56 <yekip[m]> be nice to sync one with mac OS, if that wasn't a horrible suggestion!
14:20:07 <dallemon[m]> I don't have any personal suggestions, but I remember using Etar a while back
14:27:17 <yekip[m]> thanks.
14:29:19 <yekip[m]> I may just use OmniNotes which was a fantastic recommendation (as always) from the JollyRoger! Mainly for things like reminding me (with alarm) to wash my hair every month, things like that :D
14:31:18 <fujita_[m]> Is there anyway to enable widgets on etar?
14:32:52 <joeri_poeri[m]> > I don't have any personal suggestions, but I remember using Etar a while back
14:32:52 <joeri_poeri[m]> etar works great, I use it all the time, I use the Simple Calendar widget to add it to my home screen with a transparant background. but if I interact with the widget I've set all the defaults to open with Etar as the app works better
14:37:17 <yekip[m]> great thanks. so you can set recurring reminders, and get audible alerts etc?
14:37:36 <yekip[m]> I dont necessarily need to sync it, but it would be nice if i could find a way to sync with mac os. no probs if not though
14:39:42 <yekip[m]> I am just finally getting around to moving stuff from iphone to graphene. well, not actually moving, but finding replacements etc for various things I do need (not many really, but those that I do use are important). I don't think I have seen a list of popular apps used by graphene users. if anyone knows of such a list, please let me know. would love to see a list of all these great suggestions i sometimes catch in here
14:45:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: > I don't think he's a troll just... odd
14:45:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> +1
14:51:06 <sea2clowns> lol DannyWorkOrderPr... if not, needs to find an outlet for verbal diarrhea
14:52:12 <sea2clowns> yekip - you can start with looking for lists of good foss/fdroid/aurora store apps
14:52:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > strcat: not sure if the weird spelling/grammar is on purpose
14:52:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> That's one of the first things I asked when he showed up, he implied it's to avoid fingerprinting. He may just be an older Finnish dude with shit grammar, too, aha.
14:52:32 <sea2clowns> *aurora droid
14:54:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Wants someone to send him a Pixel, claims to have previous connections to the Maemo side of Nokia, some cool limited edition hardware and documentation that he wants to send you.
14:55:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Granted, it took hours of multi-line weird msgs to finally get to that, but...lmao..if he can get two other people interested in GrapheneOS, I'll try to get him to pay for sending him a Graphene Pixel.
14:59:10 <joeri_poeri[m]> yekip you can sync your calendar with nextcloud and get if from there, you don't even need to trust anyone with your cloud, you can host it yourself!
15:01:35 <joeri_poeri[m]> that would surely be the way forward I would recommend, people lose their phones all the time...
15:18:27 <DannyWorkOrderPr> sea2clowns: agreed, dude needs a blog. I'd read it, just not in chat form, aha
15:19:41 <nhscm[m]> What did Jussa want? Why does somebody need to send a Pixel 3a to him/her?
15:22:26 <sea2clowns> couldn't find one that would ship to finland apparently, asking questions which are on the site or in the logs and was generally just rambling on.  Did not get the hint when asked to refrain
15:22:33 * bseeinu[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/RetAKDMkYIoqnfRkDLoOFYrV >
15:24:00 <bseeinu[m]> :D
15:24:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> bseeinu Also told him that, haha. He's older, it seems. From back when people had to manually make those connections...not algorithmically.
15:24:04 <nhscm[m]> You can easily get a new Pixel 3a from one of the largest tech stores at Finland. https://www.verkkokauppa.com/product/57399/mjtrm/Google-Pixel-3a-Android-puhelin-64-Gt-valkoinen
15:24:44 <DannyWorkOrderPr> nhscm: What's that in USD?
15:25:52 <nhscm[m]> 429€ is $463
15:26:31 <bseeinu[m]> I got a new one shipping from eBay for $400
15:26:39 <bseeinu[m]> Took 2 weeks but hey
15:26:55 <yekip[m]> <joeri_poeri[m] "yekip you can sync your calendar"> yes I have looked at it, but I am not really up to self-hosting, and NextCloud seems massive and complex,just for syncing. and it looked paid to me but maybe not for personal users
15:27:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, nhscm, I can definitely send him one (with GrapheneOS on it) for cheaper/around that. Used, they're going for for ~1/4 or ⅓ of that.
15:28:43 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Although I'm not sure why he wouldn't want to flash it himself. May be trying to save as much money as possible, rough time globally with job situations and all.
15:29:01 <brenneke[m]> Does OEM unlocking need to be left on to be able to receive GrapheneOS updates?
15:29:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> brenneke Negative, and docs say to lock everything back up.
15:38:30 <mezzanine[m]> Wondering if it will be available to install the OS on pixel 4, any insights on that?
15:45:38 <propertype> <mezzanine[m] "Wondering if it will be availabl"> Look at https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices and https://grapheneos.org/faq#when-devices
15:46:28 <nhscm[m]> > Although I'm not sure why he wouldn't want to flash it himself. May be trying to save as much money as possible, rough time globally with job situations and all.
15:46:28 <nhscm[m]> Quickly looking around the cheapest new 3a in Finland seems to be around 380€ which is $412 and I think used ones are there as well. And being a guy that wants to avoid text fingerprinting, having another persons sending a pre-flashed GOS does not seem like something that kind of guy would do.
15:48:50 <mezzanine[m]> <propertype "Look at https://grapheneos.org/f">  Thanks, cap
15:56:06 <brenneke[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "brenneke Negative, and docs say "> Thanks.
15:57:03 <mxnorvak[m]> Is there an alternative app for Fing?
16:01:59 <propertype> https://alternativeto.net/software/fing/
16:11:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> brenneke: Friendly reminder: read the *hell* out of GrapheneOS.org. It's worth it. Don't just read the parts you think you "need", it's all pretty important and helpful.
16:15:07 <brenneke[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "brenneke: Friendly reminder: rea"> Good point.
16:58:33 <mxnorvak[m]> <propertype "https://alternativeto.net/softwa"> Thanks, there was only one android app and it missed the feature i was looking for, Fing can tell you which other devices are connected to the same wifi and gives the MAC and IP addresses of each device which i find very useful
17:24:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> mxnorvak: You need a command line on your phone, friend. Termux/T-UI launcher?
17:25:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> nmap -sn %IPaddress% does the same thing, without trusting an app you may not be capable of auditing.
17:34:18 <mxnorvak[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "nmap -sn %IPaddress% does the sa"> I wasn't aware it could be done via Termux, ill give a shot, yeah not trusting the app was the reason i wanted an alternative,the app is full of Facebook and Google trackers
17:43:08 <cx2[m]> same with Spotify  ☹︎
17:43:21 <cx2[m]> welp.... back to TBB I go!
17:52:48 <mxnorvak[m]> <cx2[m] "same with Spotify  ☹︎"> Not a fan of streaming music, prefer to have my music locally but yeah it sucks
17:54:05 <cx2[m]> agreed.
18:16:26 <mxnorvak[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "nmap -sn %IPaddress% does the sa"> Should be like nmap -sn %192.168.1.1% ?
18:16:34 <mxnorvak[m]> Should it*
18:22:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Read their documentation, you'll learn so much more out of it than me just throwing commands over the fence here
18:22:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But, to answer your question, no %
18:23:11 <mxnorvak[m]> Oh alright
18:23:16 <mxnorvak[m]> Tnx :)
18:28:28 <zxwayland> hello. i installed grapheneos last night with the help from TheJollyRoger

18:34:37 <zaxxa[m]> I download songs using newpipe and play playlists using vlc. its great because it doesnt need WiFi and runs as a background task so I use hardly any battery
18:52:47 <brenneke[m]> My first auto-update since installing GrapheneOS successful.....life is good when you get excited by little things!
18:54:57 <ransome[m]1> > My first auto-update since installing GrapheneOS successful.....life is good when you get excited by little things!
18:54:57 <ransome[m]1> same here :)
18:56:32 <ransome[m]1> everything runs so unbelievably seamless I really do hope this project will stay on for quite a while. And of course support my lovely Pixel 3a for at least 10 years ;)
18:56:51 <dazinism> Added a wiki page all about apps. Where to get them, what to consider etc.

19:03:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> You'll get some time out of it, though, and be able to sell it to someone else when you're done, for cash towards your next piece =]
19:08:37 <brenneke[m]> <ransome[m]1 "everything runs so unbelievably "> And for Pixel 2 XL also lol!
19:11:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> brenneke: Can't expect GrapheneOS to support what the phone manufacturer isn't pushing firmware updates for

19:15:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> =]
19:23:29 <mezzanine[m]> Newpipe doesn't download videos, any solutions?
19:24:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Never discuss a problem by sayin "it doesn't work". Say what happens instead, so it's useful information.
19:25:12 <leohopper[m]> > whta you're going to want to do is obtain the android rules and move them to your udev rules directory by running: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/master/51-android.rules && sudo mv 51-android.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules`
19:25:12 <leohopper[m]> hey TheJollyRoger - i read your walkthrough and could'nt figure out the cited step. on https://grapheneos.org/install this step is not mentioned. Could you explain?

19:26:53 <zxwayland> is there a way to ipmort my contacts? or do i have to in put each phone number/name on my contact list
19:26:56 <zxwayland> ?
19:28:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> DavX
19:29:08 <cx2[m]> I would recommend Installing and setting up EteSync. It's $24 /yr.
19:29:09 <cx2[m]> Then export your contacts -o .vcf
19:29:09 <cx2[m]> import into EteSync
19:29:28 <zxwayland> ahhh
19:30:40 <cx2[m]> SLIGHTLY more difficult to setup with Thunderbird as they don't have a native plugin just yet, but they are working on it. In the mean time, their workaround is pretty good.
19:30:48 <zxwayland> i have my contacts saved as .csv
19:31:01 <zxwayland> not sure if any apps would accept it
19:31:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <zxwayland "i have my contacts saved as .csv"> Look into Davx^5 (stupid name, great app), and DecSync

19:32:48 <sea2clowns> i have davx5 on my other android device, works great.  no contacts on graphene
19:33:27 <cx2[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "> <@cx2:matrix.org> I would reco"> It's the exact opposite. It's an E2EE Fork of DavX^5
19:35:44 <DannyWorkOrderPr> DavX is E2E, as well. At least, as E as the spec allows (which I believe relies on SSL)
19:37:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Ete is a cool offering, but, I always wonder how focused they are on upstream, compared to their revenue
19:37:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Haven't compared their commits with DavX, though
19:38:34 <nickcalyx[m]> Davx may allow.transport encryption but not encrypting the databases so the host can't access them.  Eteaync.client.side encrypts the contact and.calendars
19:39:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> On the server?
19:39:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr>  * Wait, how's that work, if there are apps reading your contacts & calendars?
19:40:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I didn't know they have self-hosting option. Is it free/kept patched like their own server, anyone know?
19:40:36 <nickcalyx[m]> it encrypts it before syncing to the server I mean
19:41:16 <nickcalyx[m]> they have a business model, but they are pretty cool.. I talked to the lead dev about a PR for it to work on calyx servers when on a calyxOS phone and they were fine with it because they support privacy in the big picture
19:41:42 <nickcalyx[m]> yeah the server side is free
19:43:03 <nickcalyx[m]> if a bit klunky
19:43:43 <bseeinu[m]> First background update ever for me
19:43:45 <bseeinu[m]> Worked great
19:44:02 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: transport encryption to a server and end-to-end encryption are different things
19:44:27 <strcat> end-to-end encryption means the server doesn't ever have unencrypted data because it's encrypted from client-to-client end-to-end
19:46:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: I do understand that distinction =] I was more wondering how EteSync actively decrypts the dbs for use by apps/when that happens.
19:46:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Is it only encrypted before sending to server, and decrypted after retrieving from server?
19:46:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Or is it encrypted at rest until one of the Contacts/Calendar apps attempts to read, and then Ete decrypts at that time?
19:46:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> nickcalyx
19:48:02 <nickcalyx[m]> AFAIK it's only encrypted before sending to the server.. on the phone it's not encrypted
19:48:20 <nickcalyx[m]> unless you count the normal android disk encryption
19:49:24 <nickcalyx[m]> I am not 100% sure but it probably communicates with the server with transport encryption also
19:49:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nickcalyx[m] "unless you count the normal andr"> Not in this context =] Thanks, great explanation. Thanks for bringing it up, cx2!
19:50:21 <cam> mxnorvak[m]: sry, i missed the preceding conversation re spotify. what sucks?
19:50:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nickcalyx[m] "I am not 100% sure but it probab"> I think I've yet to see a modern CalDav implementation that doesn't use SSL
19:50:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cam "mxnorvak: sry, i missed the prec"> FB etc trackers
19:51:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nickcalyx[m] "if a bit klunky"> Do you run it? What have you had to fuck with?
19:52:10 <bseeinu[m]> Well, consider this: I can target ads based on mood and activity, based on what you listen
19:52:17 <bseeinu[m]> In a specific Zip code
19:52:24 <cam> DannyWorkOrderPr: fb trackers? anyone have a link to more info? all i found was this (https://lifehacker.com/how-to-stop-spotify-from-posting-every-song-you-listen-5843847), which is pretty old
19:52:55 <bseeinu[m]> So if you're working out based on the playlist and that recurrent time of the day and you're in a certain geo area
19:53:18 <bseeinu[m]> You hear my ad about that useless piece of crap for working out gear
19:53:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> cam: If a website, or app, has a Facebook button on it, there's FB tracking code.
19:53:47 <bseeinu[m]> Worse: it could be about private health plans. Based on behavioral analysis and your playlists.
19:53:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Bare minimum, metadata of when/where that button's being loaded
19:54:07 <zxwayland> i don't get it. I downloaded Davx5 via f-droid store. the davx5 doesn't let me upload any .cvs file onto my contacts phonebook
19:54:34 <bseeinu[m]> You don't even need FB to worry about trackers. Spotify is the tracker and ad service.
19:54:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <zxwayland "i don't get it. I downloaded Dav"> What server were you previously syncing your other phone with?
19:54:35 <zxwayland> Don't use facebook? delete it
19:55:08 <zxwayland> I exported my google contacts as downloadded .csv file
19:55:20 <cam> damn
19:55:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> cam: beautiful fuckin world, innit?
19:55:46 <bseeinu[m]> Lolol. You don't need to have Fb to be targeted just like you don't need to be on a google property to be in a remarketing list from Google Analytics and Tag Manager
19:55:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: Use DavX to one-time download your contacts from Google server.
19:56:20 <zxwayland> ah, is that a good idea?
19:56:21 <cam> i wish there was a free or reasonably-priced privacy-friendly alternative to spotify
19:56:46 <bseeinu[m]> Arguably Apple Music, MAYBE
19:56:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland: Then change it to sync with another server, or delete it and use Ete with their server/another server you put up with their software. Or, use DecSync to do it file-based, which you seem to prefer.
19:57:09 <bseeinu[m]> To be honest, just get your music.
19:57:14 <bseeinu[m]> And get your movies.
19:57:22 <bseeinu[m]> And don't stream shit.
19:57:30 <bseeinu[m]> And use NextDNS.
19:57:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> zxwayland I don't think it's valid to be worried about the CalDav connection, one time
19:57:55 <cam> bseeinu[m]: for various reasons, i'm starting to think that's the best way in the long run
19:58:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I'd be against repeatedly syncing with Google's severs, but one download can't be any worse than what you were doing before.
19:58:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <bseeinu[m] "And use NextDNS."> =1
19:58:25 <cam> it's just that privacy aside, spotify's functionality is so legitimately great

20:01:24 <bseeinu[m]> Look up "Custom Intent Audiences" to see what you are "in-market" for. Google Ads, Taboola, Amazon Ads, Hulu, Facebook Ads: they can all import remarketing and users lists to retarget after months, based on intention and behavior
20:02:25 <bseeinu[m]> Oh it's a fantastic system. Very easy to sell shit with it.
20:03:08 <bseeinu[m]> You think you choose to buy something, but did you?
20:03:22 <cam> preaching to the choir
20:03:51 <bseeinu[m]> One could create "ad sequences" on YouTube to show you a sequence of ads to push you "down the funnel" within X days
20:04:37 <bseeinu[m]> And register your "conversion" to a customer. Google Ads will then optimize audiences to show the ad to people similar to you, in behavior
20:05:05 <bseeinu[m]> It's an infinite echo chamber of commerce and behavior  influencing.
20:05:53 <bseeinu[m]> So, please, use Spotify :D

21:36:11 <dazinism> https://f-droid.org/app/com.nononsenseapps.feeder
21:36:12 <dazinism> Briar have there own Fdroid repo
21:36:13 <cx2[m]> pretty sure i snagged it from github, not fdroid
21:37:29 <cx2[m]> <dazinism "Feeder is pretty respectable for"> how do you feel about Handy News Reader? Ive been using it for a bit..... If I remember I liked it better than Feeder
21:39:08 <dazinism> https://briarproject.org/installing-briar-via-f-droid/
21:39:32 <mxnorvak[m]> <dazinism "https://briarproject.org/install"> isn't this the p2p messaging app?
21:41:02 <dazinism> Yeah its nice. One of the main devs recently did a load of nice work on seedvault (backup app used by GrapheneOS)
21:42:00 <dazinism> Uses quite a bit of battery, but theres an option to only have it connect when the phone is charging.
21:43:41 <dazinism> Actually come to think, pretty sure they are in this room.
21:43:43 <bseeinu[m]> Handy News Reader is the one I use on my eink Android reader too
21:44:07 <mxnorvak[m]> How good of a massaging app do u find it to be, compared to signal, in terms of security and privacy?
21:44:28 <bseeinu[m]> Trying to figure out how to use filters to reject all the COVID CORONAVIRUS COVID19 compulsory articles
21:45:38 <dazinism> I did try handy, was something about it that didnt quite work for me. But I think I was trying to use it for something a bit weird (getting notifications for forum posts)
21:48:31 <dazinism> I know a bit about a few of the people involved in developing the app. One of them a friend of some folks I knocked about with a bit.
21:48:34 <dazinism> Briar this is.
21:48:36 <dazinism> It was carefully considered and built for very good privacy.
21:48:42 <dazinism> Everything goes over tor
21:49:16 <cx2[m]> Everything goes over TOR without Orbot?
21:49:28 <dazinism> Unlike signal, there is no central server, you connect directly to people you know.
21:49:50 <dazinism> No not with orbot, its got its own for process built in.
21:50:21 <mxnorvak[m]> And there's no need for a number to sign up
21:51:25 <cx2[m]> dazinism: Just downloaded.... tried adding one of my normal feeds. Didn't work. Will it only load ceratain feeds?
21:52:26 <miniblue[m]> strcat: Oh okay. Only reason I asked was because I wanted to modify the icons/names of some app icons that I like the features of but hate the look of but I guess to do that I would actually have to create my own builds of said apps or just suck it up and deal with it.
21:52:33 <Cyrinux[m]> <dazinism "I know a bit about a few of the "> There is a public directory with some ressource to try?
21:52:36 <dazinism> If you are in a forum with lots of folks who all know each other, whenever 2 or more people are 'online' they pass all the messages they have to the others. Relaying on messages who may not be online.
21:53:03 <dazinism> cx2: if the feed provider blocks tor then you cant get the feed
21:53:14 <cx2[m]> dazinism: nevermind.... it didn't like that I wasn't using https..... weird, because I copy and pasted it from Handy News Reader....
21:53:50 <dazinism> (Eg if they are behind cloudflare and havent changed the default tor DDOS protection rules)
21:54:22 <miniblue[m]> I know it's a very vain and useless idea but UI is kind of a big factor as far as experience goes yet is something I'm willing to sacrifice. I think misunderstood launcher functionality as well.
21:54:57 <dazinism> Cyrinux: directory of what?
21:59:47 <dazinism> If anyone wants to try briar I am briar://ab4eitvv2ty6ifgc4i2sblbusecqrcjoxp3kjgnn2xz2nyws7jjwa
22:02:19 <dazinism> You need to hit the + down the bottom of contacts > add contact at distance > paste your link here...
22:03:42 <dazinism> If the internet goes down, or you dont want to use it, you can also pass messages via Bluetooth or to other devices on the same WiFi network.
22:05:28 <dazinism> miniblue: I found you can hide app icons, but still keep them handy, by having a few apps grouped together on the home screen
22:06:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <mxnorvak[m] "Downloading pages as a pdf appar"> Why wouldn't it be? Printing as PDF is always an option, too.
22:06:36 <Cyrinux[m]> But for this concept working we need to get lot of user
22:07:03 <Cyrinux[m]> I would love a privacy forum in briar
22:08:06 <Cyrinux[m]> dazinism: briar://adenu7kzmmxtniokj2axwegk5l6ecxuvwbkyl6zyywh7rxnwsxyv6
22:09:18 <mxnorvak[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Why wouldn't it be? Printing as "> How can i do it with bromite?
22:10:56 <Cyrinux[m]> dazinism: if you got some cool resources to share then in Briar feel free
22:12:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <mxnorvak[m] "How can i do it with bromite?"> Share menu
22:13:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> No native functionality I'm aware of.
22:13:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> The only app I have on my device that can do it is Syncthing, but, it's a thing =]
22:14:13 <mxnorvak[m]> So i should install Syncthing?
22:17:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> ...I mean, if you have a need for it. But that's definitely not what I'm saying, lol
22:17:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Install an app that downloads/saves websites when you pass a link to them.
22:18:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> After spending 17 seconds searching on F-Droid, I found Web2PDF, as well as Save for Offline
22:19:22 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I am not recommending either of these, but, figure out something you trust. Just telling you, conceptually, how to accomplish what you're trying to do.
22:21:33 <mxnorvak[m]> Tnx, yeah I'll find something
22:28:52 <chris42> Otherwise if using Firefox you can setup your own firefox sync server
22:41:23 <demonMachina> I would just like everyone to know that I have somehowfigured out how to install extensions on chromium-browser-privacy Fedora.... prettty f-ing stoked about that.
22:41:47 <demonMachina> 1. Turns out, the "easy" way doesn't work so hot with KDE Plasma
22:44:06 <demonMachina> 2. Fun Fact, I foundthat if you have regular chromium installed on macOS, go ahead and install all of the extensions that you would normally install there, **THEN** install Ungoogled Chromium (pretty sure you have to rename it on macOS though). The extensions automagically populated in Ungoogled.... Tried this method in Fedora, and of course it didn't work.
23:25:46 <magicos[m]> Is there a possibility an FakeStore could be implemented, so we could run apps that look after 'com.android.vending'?
23:35:53 <fading_epilogue> demonMachina: you mean ungoogled chromium packaged in rpmfusion? doesn't the wiki say to install Chromium web store to install/update extensions?
23:35:55 <fading_epilogue> https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store
23:55:45 <strcat[m]> really annoyed @ powershell 5 having a legacy curl alias
23:55:48 <strcat[m]> on windows
23:55:57 <strcat[m]> so people have to remove it or type curl.exe
23:55:58 <strcat[m]> sigh
23:56:05 <strcat[m]> they aliased it to an incompatible thing
