00:03:46 <madaidan[m]> Ah, I forgot about that
00:06:24 <JTL> I'd be curious to see an audit of some sort
00:14:04 <zaxxa[m]> How are audits carried out?
00:20:49 <renlord> what audits
00:21:19 <cn3m[m]> <zaxxa[m] "How are audits carried out?"> I run a lot of MITMs both privately and I used to do them professionally. You want to do the monitoring not on the device. mitmproxy to another device and make sure you can decrypt all communications. "privacy" companies like Apple can make this hard since e2ee will bypass this. If there's something I can't read that's my main focus. I just have to look around a lot
00:25:01 <cn3m[m]> Wireshark is a great tool as well. I also monitor the device in the wild to make sure it doesn't act wildly different. Malware is usually what changes when you try to audit it so companies are extremely careful to not do that. Things like VM and MITM while mostly detectable are not going to generally abuse that, it's very likely you'll catch them doing it too. Try it on malware analysis
00:26:57 <cn3m[m]> that's what I'd do to test Windows 10
00:28:18 <zaxxa[m]> I see, thanks
00:49:38 <renlord> cn3m[m]: do you share your results publicly?
00:49:43 <TheJollyRoger> Cripes, one family problem after another... I get back and the threads seem to have vanished.
00:50:11 <renlord> madaidan[m]: win10 seems to be moving towards that direction with UWP applications
00:50:23 <renlord> but momentum seems to have died.
00:50:25 <renlord> :(
00:50:42 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "cn3m: do you share your results "> I don't since it's too much work to organize.
00:50:59 <renlord> developers for windows dont seem to want to develop UWP apps
00:52:05 <cn3m[m]> it's a lot of work to just setup. Sorting and explaining the data and filtering out some things that are needed for OS functions that are not things I want shared publicly
00:52:14 <cn3m[m]> it's just not feasible
00:52:21 <renlord> fair enough
00:52:39 <renlord> maybe just sharing the dump without an interpretation piece?
00:53:10 <cn3m[m]> I could find a way to do that. Just redact some info
00:53:31 <cn3m[m]> I'll do that the next time I test a Windows machine
00:59:32 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "madaidan.: win10 seems to be mov"> You mean the mobile stuff?
00:59:52 <madaidan[m]> There's W10S
01:00:18 <renlord> they seem to have pivoted to calling them 'universal' for both desktop and mobile
01:00:28 <renlord> but ya -- they look tablet-ish
01:01:59 <renlord> but the windows store is pretty shitz
01:02:27 <renlord> if i want something like win10s, i'd probably just shell out for an ipad
01:02:32 <cn3m[m]> I might try a Windows 10 Enterprise MITM at some point
01:08:21 <emucla> are huawei devices supported by grapheneOS?

04:05:34 <renlord> for calls
04:16:20 <joshman[m]> Bluetooth calls are broken
04:27:50 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): hey how do you set Edge in the virtualization to have sane privacy settings everytime?
04:28:13 <TheJollyRoger> Running cts.
04:32:14 <zoraver[m]> thelearner: https://github.com/bromite/bromite/issues/580
04:41:26 <strcat[m]> josh.man: have you tried rebooting
04:43:39 <renlord> with bt calls, its random
04:43:46 <renlord> sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt
04:44:32 <TheJollyRoger> Is there a CTS test plan I could run that might give us more information?
04:50:10 <TheJollyRoger> My phone is back on the rack now. One emergency lead to another and I didn't get back until friggin' late.
04:50:47 <thelearner[m]> zoraver: thank you :)
04:57:00 <joshman[m]> <strcat[m] "josh.man: have you tried rebooti"> Yes sir. Various Times
05:01:35 <joshman[m]> I just tried again. And it worked. Weird. Will test it more during the day
05:07:24 <dan-v[m]> i haven't been following along with the bluetooth issues very closely; why is stock aosp not experiencing this? i'm assuming it's hardening related?
05:07:50 <JTL> iirc it's an issue exposed by hardened_malloc
05:09:26 <dan-v[m]> JTL: gotcha
05:10:41 <TheJollyRoger> Crazy to think how upstream probably has this bug but like... not realized it because they haven't figured out the potential for that being an exploit.
05:11:04 <TheJollyRoger> Makes me nervous thinking about what other kinds of bugs could be lurking down below, that don't get found by upstream.
05:11:15 <TheJollyRoger> Not in like Android specifically, but other things.
05:13:06 <JTL> Oh sure
05:13:38 <TheJollyRoger> Like the uh... kernel >_<.
05:13:55 <cyredanthem[m]> 85-90% of exploits in Android are memory related iirc
05:14:24 <TheJollyRoger> Oh jeez.
05:18:32 <cyredanthem[m]> I tried to do the math on what percentage of exploits GrapheneOS would stop
05:20:55 <cyredanthem[m]> My guess is effectively 40% of all exploits should be thwarted by GrapheneOS
05:22:50 <TheJollyRoger> Wow.
05:22:53 <thelonewolf[m]> When will armv8.5 hardware be available? It has MTE.
05:24:07 <thelonewolf[m]> A14 would probably use armv8.5
05:24:45 <cyredanthem[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Wow."> TheJollyRoger: the tough part is vendor images are different every time
05:25:06 <cyredanthem[m]> You also have to ask if they are trying to exploit GrapheneOS or just stock Android
05:25:22 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
05:25:47 <cyredanthem[m]> May if I recall correctly was all vendor for the pixels
05:27:14 <cyredanthem[m]> Which would be very unlikely to be effected by GrapheneOS hardening
05:28:09 <cyredanthem[m]> Though all of those were medium severity
05:37:12 <strcat[m]> btw let me know if you have issues with the clock app
05:37:17 <strcat[m]> an issue was reported with that
05:37:42 <strcat[m]> it is expected that there's a warning about the API level on first launch though
05:37:43 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/218
05:38:32 <strcat[m]> I am not sure the issue is correct
05:38:34 <strcat[m]> there may be no new issue
05:38:42 <renlord> post-updated, phone rebooted and alarm rang on time to wake me up for a very important meeting
05:38:47 <renlord> dont seem to have an issue
05:39:04 <renlord> this was 2 days ago
05:41:04 <cyredanthem[m]> Though all that said the hardening and especially on the webview is very helpful so looking at what I did specifically would be misleading
05:41:23 <renlord> cyredanthem[m]: what sort of privacy settings? i just keep everything on default
05:41:32 <renlord> and have dns-level ad blocking
05:42:01 <cyredanthem[m]> A few random privacy settings and DuckDuckGo
05:42:03 <cyredanthem[m]> I don't remember I'll check
05:42:31 <renlord> meh, i gave up using DDG, i sometimes use startpage.com if i have the patience
05:42:35 <renlord> otherwise just load google.com
05:42:55 <renlord> DDG gives me very subpar search results for very specific things i look for
05:43:24 <strcat[m]> cyredanthem: we do harden the vendor components
05:43:26 <strcat[m]> just not firmware
05:43:35 <cyredanthem[m]> I doubt Google is doing much effective tracking with a temporal browser any way
05:44:51 <cyredanthem[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): oh thanks I stand corrected. Does it effect it if the vendor is partially built from source or not?
05:45:20 <strcat[m]> as we build more it applies stuff like zero-on-init for stack variables to more code
05:45:30 <strcat[m]> but most of the hardening applies to it already
05:46:33 <cyredanthem[m]> Gotcha thanks good to know
05:47:08 <cg_droid> strcat[m], yes, I received a warning (but only the first time and the apps work) in Messages, Clock and Conversations (xmpp), but they work ok and no more warning after that.
05:48:11 <strcat[m]> g2g for now
05:48:16 <strcat[m]> really need help with the bluetooth stuff
05:48:28 <strcat[m]> we need to figure out the order it gets in stock aosp and make sure this matches
05:49:28 <cyredanthem[m]> In the code or on a live system?
06:14:50 <renlord> both
06:16:07 <cyredanthem[m]> Ah it's just the Pixel 3? If it's bonito as well I can boot the GSI(I think the AOSP May from Google is out with no gapps)
06:19:02 <TheJollyRoger> https://gist.github.com/Peter-Easton/ab0333677b1ee1b3e22a3231bfdd84a7 Current test of the beta release. Looks like the CTS is just being dumb again.
06:19:33 <TheJollyRoger> I think it's that CTS testing app not being installed/uninstalled properly which is responsible for the one "fail" result.
06:21:39 <cyredanthem[m]> If I can help let me know. I should be able to do without my phone for a day or so
06:22:01 <cyredanthem[m]> DSI Loader can't come soon enough
06:22:24 <blacklight447[m]> Dsi?
06:22:52 <cyredanthem[m]> It allows you to run stock images in a live boot on any phone
06:23:15 <cyredanthem[m]> At least potentially it's uncertain if bootloader will need to be unlocked
06:24:57 <renlord> gsi you mean
06:25:03 <renlord> generic system image?
06:25:54 <cyredanthem[m]> DSU
06:25:56 <cyredanthem[m]> Not DSI sorry typo
06:25:57 <cyredanthem[m]> So close
06:26:54 <cyredanthem[m]> Dynamic system updates
06:29:15 <cyredanthem[m]> It's supported in Android 10 or at least partially
06:30:21 <cyredanthem[m]> Theoretically, if I understand correctly it could be used to develop on the same device you already have if you only have one
06:30:38 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): https://developer.android.com/topic/dsu
06:30:48 <cyredanthem[m]> It needs to be signed by Google or your vendor
06:32:39 <cyredanthem[m]> It's only a GSI though so it's not great for testing I guess

15:24:17 <gnumdk[m]> Hello, I'm really curious, is there any documentation explaining how and why GrapheneOS bootloader is properly signed ?
15:25:22 <renlord> gnumdk[m]: yes, read the android verified boot documentation
15:25:43 <renlord> you will find a flow chart with some graphics, confirm your findings when you install grapheneos for the first time
15:26:26 <renlord> gnumdk[m]: also, read the grapheneos.org website in its entirety, do not skip anything.
15:31:34 <gnumdk[m]> ok
15:41:03 <gnumdk[m]> But, are GrapheneOS key signed by Google ?
15:51:31 <nickcalyx[m]> No
15:52:28 <gnumdk[m]> ok, so it does not work like secure boot on PC...
15:54:28 <Arhu> It is more secure
16:05:50 <brenneke[m]> Hands-free call volume very low when paired with car audio. (after last update)
16:47:41 <brenneke[m]> Pixel 2 XL.
16:50:41 <DrWhax> gnumdk[m]: you can sign with your own keys..
17:06:21 <cn3m[m]>  @gnumdk:matrix.org GrapheneOS loads their own keys. This means your device is locked to GrapheneOS code and can't be changed without wiping the device

17:58:43 <dazinism> hypokeimenon: https://calyxinstitute.org/about/board/nicholas-merrill
17:59:44 <hypokeimenon[m]> I see, thanks.
18:01:17 <dazinism> After folks chatting yesterday about getting apps (GCam) from various, slightly shady app stores I did some more research
18:01:53 <dazinism> Turns out Exodus Privacy display app signing certs SHA1 fingerprint in their reports
18:03:32 <dazinism> Thats reports for, I think, for every app on the Play Store.
18:03:44 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Verifying_apk_files
18:04:45 <cg_droid> dazinism, maybe you'd like more Stanley app from F-droid if you are looking forr the certificate and some more information
18:05:02 <dazinism> Guess thats not as nice as if they had the SHA256 fingerprints, but something
18:05:19 <cg_droid> Only sha1 too...
18:06:11 <dazinism> Most often apk downloads from the devs site or git repo will use the same cert
18:14:53 <dazinism> cg_droid: yeah, prefer apps_packages info as it shows much more info about apps including the SHA256 fingerprint, but Stanley works for SHA1 fine
18:15:11 <cg_droid> 😉
19:17:22 <joshman[m]> <dazinism "After folks chatting yesterday a"> What's the bottom line I don't get it

20:18:01 <inquiree> When did he ever stop?
20:18:24 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_inquiree:matrix.org I'm on a personal crusade to do the same thing
20:18:28 <cn3m[m]> let's see who breaks first
20:18:34 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_inquiree:matrix.org I'm sure he's asking the same thing about me
20:18:47 <inquiree> I don't know how he hasn't been banned honestly
20:19:28 <inquiree> With his extensive history of slandering anyone pointing out his logical inconsistencies/conspiratorial fearmongering
20:19:35 <cn3m[m]> I am glad he's not we can spot him when he shills his guide
20:19:58 <inquiree> Even the mods aren't spared. No idea why they're still putting up with his BS
20:20:25 <cn3m[m]> I don't really care if he's just gonna make another account and I'm going to keep debunking him
20:21:46 <cn3m[m]> I feel like no one actually trusts that username we all know he's bad news. it's for the best he's not banned
20:29:58 <inquiree> cn3m: That should apply to people that know better. I don't think most people subscribed to the subreddits he patronizes can make that distinction
20:33:23 <dazinism> eglssm: if they really bother you can disable or uninstall apps from your main user profile on the phone using adb. Some things may stop the phone working properly so have to be a bit careful.
20:34:24 <inquiree> madaidan, cn3m: https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/em8doj/smartphone_hardening_guide_for_normal_people/fdmxqau/. You see that bit about the titan M? It's a point he loves to tout. We should probably address that
20:51:09 <clathu[m]> After having read bad things about F-Droid, I don't know which App Store to use. Is Aurora Store the better alternative at the moment ?

21:27:16 <chani> I'm pretty new to this and trying to be careful, but I had thought F-droid was (generally speaking) safer than Aurora Store.
21:27:57 <cx2[m]> <brenneke[m] "Will watch for developments than"> Of course! Give the guys time... there are some great minds working on this project....just working through a few kinks
21:28:14 <cx2[m]> * and / or gals
21:28:42 <cn3m[m]>  @nickcalyx:matrix.org depends
21:28:55 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid has more insecure software that's a security threat
21:29:03 <cn3m[m]> Play Store has more badware
21:42:50 <hitchhooker[m]> what makes google play store apps so much more secure? there is code review?
21:43:51 <hitchhooker[m]> hmalloc busts so many memory unsafe apps from play store that barely never happends with f-droid
21:46:24 <nickcalyx[m]> Low
21:46:24 <nickcalyx[m]> > F-Droid has more insecure software that's a security threat
21:46:24 <nickcalyx[m]> How can you say that, quantitatively
21:50:02 <hitchhooker[m]> https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect/ is there more than this?
21:50:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> From what's already been said, it may be partly to do with F-droid apps shipping with a v1 signature instead of a v2. Read past chat
21:56:12 <cn3m[m]>  @nickcalyx:matrix.org look at how long they don't patch stuff and random old programs
21:56:33 <cn3m[m]> v2 signing is a nice addition from modern app stores yes
21:56:58 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid does a lot right and with common sense it can be very good
21:56:59 <nickcalyx[m]> Fdroid only distributes other people's software
21:58:24 <nickcalyx[m]> In any case, I definitely support alternatives to google controlling the whole ecosystem of android app distribution
21:58:44 <nickcalyx[m]> Probably we can all agree on that :)
21:59:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> I'm opposed to Google's control
22:00:02 <cn3m[m]>  @nickcalyx:matrix.org 100%
22:00:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> but if they open-sourced their PHA(potentially harmful app) detection algorithms or something I wouldn't mind..
22:00:42 <cn3m[m]> I'd put a warning on any network permission app that is over two years old. Require v2 signing and block all apps over 5 years old
22:01:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> shouldn't be anything over 2 years old in the store tbh lol
22:03:17 <cn3m[m]> I see comments on PTIO all the time about their disk change password and how GrapheneOS is unsuable since I said it didn't have it. I explain how it works and they say, but it's in F-Droid and it's security software section
22:05:49 <madaidan[m]> <inquiree "madaidan, cn3m: https://old.redd"> I've already replied to that point but he doesn't listen. He's incredibly stubborn and ignorant. He doesn't care for the truth and no matter how much evidence you present to prove him wrong, he sticks to his biased agenda.
22:06:09 <madaidan[m]> And btw, to ping me you need to add that dot at the end or I don't get a notification
22:06:27 <madaidan[m]> "madaidan." instead of "madaidan"
22:06:59 <cn3m[m]>  @madaidan.:matrix.org he's a madlad with a .
22:07:21 <cx2[m]> <madaidan[m] "I've already replied to that poi"> Going to read.... but lemme guess... something about the spooky black box...
22:07:30 <madaidan[m]> <cx2[m] "Going to read.... but lemme gues"> Exactly.
22:08:10 <madaidan[m]> He likes to say Huawei phones are the best and Pixels are the worst because of the dreaded Titan M black box. It's crazy.
22:09:29 <cn3m[m]>  @madaidan.:matrix.org I need to take up a prescription habit to handle this guy
22:09:30 <blacklight447[m]> you know what i found funny about this guy
22:09:36 <blacklight447[m]> hes always obessed about the USA and the 14 eyes
22:09:49 <blacklight447[m]> because of this, he wants to use a huewei device, fine
22:10:25 <blacklight447[m]> but here is the thing
22:11:11 <madaidan[m]> I wish him and all his alts were banned. It's too much to deal with him. He's relentless.
22:11:24 <blacklight447[m]> his proof for huewei being the only trustworthy oem comes from a report from the UK claiming they found no evidence of a backdoor
22:11:25 <blacklight447[m]> and the uk is part of the 14 eyes
22:11:33 <blacklight447[m]> so to avoid tech from the 14 eyes, your gonna rely on a report from the 14 eyes saying that something is not backdoored, where the fuck is the logic in that
22:11:50 <madaidan[m]> The mods of r/privatelife are all his alts lol
22:13:08 <blacklight447[m]> imagigne being banned on so many privacy subs that you just start your own
22:13:15 <gervarouge[m]> <blacklight447[m] "and the uk is part of the 14 eye"> But they sided with me!?!
22:13:15 <gervarouge[m]> They must be right
22:13:21 <blacklight447[m]> look at it, its all just him posting news articles
22:13:47 <blacklight447[m]> lol
22:13:49 <madaidan[m]> <gervarouge[m] "But they sided with me!?!"> He's so hypocritical
22:14:15 <madaidan[m]> It's not the only case of him discrediting a source until it fits his agenda
22:15:36 <cn3m[m]> he has so many alts I'm starting too wonder I'm one of them
22:15:41 <cn3m[m]> 😆
22:16:28 <gervarouge[m]> We all are
22:17:16 <cx2[m]> <blacklight447[m] "so to avoid tech from the 14 eye"> **ESPECIALLY** if that concern is likely due to “spycraft”... the Brits of all people?? haha
22:18:44 <blacklight447[m]> <madaidan[m] "It's not the only case of him di"> this just shows weakness
22:24:12 <gervarouge[m]> Can we just clone madaidan, blacklight, and cn3m?
22:28:42 <analog[m]> why blacklight
22:29:16 <gervarouge[m]> Le postage
22:56:11 <blacklight447[m]> <analog[m] "why blacklight"> ?
22:56:12 <blacklight447[m]> you got a problem with me? lol
23:00:39 <aksuited[m]> When connecting a phone to a pc to transfer files or adb, does the pc see identifying info about the phone like imei hardware id etc or just the phone name?
23:01:00 <aksuited[m]> Android phone by the way
23:13:13 <strcat[m]> aksuited: no, just the phone name
23:13:45 <strcat[m]> aksuited: if you enable ADB and whitelist the host, completely different story, you give it a massive amount of information and control over the device
23:13:50 <strcat[m]> I thought that was clear?
23:14:00 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't be using ADB on a production device, it is in developer options for a reason
23:14:22 <strcat[m]> that's the purpose of ADB
23:14:32 <aksuited[m]> I had to use it
23:14:38 <strcat[m]> OS and app debugging, giving an attached computer a huge amount of information and control
23:14:46 <aksuited[m]> I disableed the usb debug after it
23:14:55 <strcat[m]> why did you have to use it
23:14:59 <aksuited[m]> Amd reset the option of pc
23:15:15 <aksuited[m]> I installed threema work app
23:15:30 <aksuited[m]> And then i tried to uninstall and it just wouldn
23:15:46 <aksuited[m]> So i had to use adb to uninstall it

23:18:14 <cn3m[m]>  @strcat:matrix.org thanks
23:19:03 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer/issues assorted easy issues to work on
23:19:09 <strcat[m]> also, need someone to work on updating pdf.js
23:19:13 <strcat[m]> last time there were issues with CSP
23:19:43 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/pdf.js is the current one
23:19:46 <strcat[m]> you build it with gulp
23:19:48 <strcat[m]> need to update
23:20:55 <aksuited[m]> <strcat[m] "OS and app debugging, giving an "> No way now to remove the information from pc? If i remove platform tools which i used adb from?
23:21:13 <strcat[m]> aksuited: I don't know what you mean
23:21:28 <strcat[m]> I'm explaining that ADB gives a massive amount of control over the device
23:21:36 <strcat[m]> I doubt you needed it to uninstall an app, you could have used Settings
23:22:05 <strcat[m]> there is nothing you can do to take back the fact that you trusted the computer like that before - you can revoke the trusted host keys from ADB and disable ADB
23:22:27 <strcat[m]> if that computer was compromised it could have used ADB to gather data about the device and do all kinds of things like installing apps, granting permissions
23:22:29 <strcat[m]> that's what ADB does
23:22:39 <strcat[m]> don't use ADB if you aren't a developer is good advice
23:23:02 <strcat[m]> if the computer wasn't compromised then no problem...
23:23:17 <strcat[m]> there is nothing for you to remove in that case, don't overcomplicate things
23:23:19 <aksuited[m]> The settings just freezed when tried to uninstall
23:23:32 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "don't use ADB if you aren't a de"> this is very good advice
23:23:41 <cn3m[m]> along with don't use developer options
23:24:00 <aksuited[m]> All day i tried from settings from holding the app and uninstall and nothing
23:24:17 <strcat[m]> if you encounter bugs please report them on the issue tracker
23:24:22 <aksuited[m]> <strcat[m] "there is nothing for you to remo"> Ok thanks
23:27:30 <aksuited[m]> I thought it was a corrupt install and didnt want to create an issue about it
23:28:27 <aksuited[m]> Meaning i didnt think it was an os probl
