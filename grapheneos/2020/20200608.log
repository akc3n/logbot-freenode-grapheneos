00:35:59 <pr0xy[m]> Question about updating APKs that were downloaded and installed directly, not through F-droid or Aurora Store.
00:35:59 <pr0xy[m]> I downloaded and installed the APK of several apps like Signal, Threema, Wire, direct from their websites. Do I need to go back to those websites to download updates?
00:35:59 <pr0xy[m]> I see that these apps show up in the Aurora Store as having updates. Is it OK to just update these apps through Aurora going forward?
00:36:26 <aeonsolution[m]> each app and company has their own rules for updating
00:36:36 <aeonsolution[m]> Signal I believe is self-updating
00:36:58 <aeonsolution[m]> but many other user-installed .apks may not have that option
00:37:28 <aeonsolution[m]> you would have to go an research that yourself to see if they have that option available
00:38:27 <pr0xy[m]> So updating via Aurora might not be the best idea
00:40:01 <aeonsolution[m]> if you trust the company and their update schedule it works, but that is something you as a user have to evaluate
00:41:41 <pr0xy[m]> Makes sense. I read that for instance Signal installs were best via the Signal site, and not Aurora. I didn't want to break my installs if Aurora tried to install an update that relied on Google Play

00:45:09 <generateduser392> tried to update fdroid version from aurora
00:45:16 <generateduser392> something about signature error
00:45:35 <yolotrolo[m]> you can't updates  applications if they have different signatures
00:45:50 <yolotrolo[m]> fdroid apps are using fdroid signature keys
00:46:03 <pr0xy[m]> I thought there was an F-droid signature block so that those wouldn't show up in Aurora
00:46:14 <generateduser392> didn't have it enabled at the time
00:51:15 <yolotrolo[m]>  * fdroid apps are signed with fdroid keys
01:02:40 <qyo3462572445[m]> I wish more companies offered their android apps elsewhere other then the playstore. Its such a pain when they don't.
01:05:31 <generateduser392> and had a way of informing you when new version released
01:08:41 <qyo3462572445[m]> Agreed. I know its not a big market for companies though. So I guess I understand it but, still would be nice.
01:26:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> qyo3462572445: generateduser710
01:26:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Contact your favorite company and ask them to publish their own F-Droid compatible repository. Bromite does it to great success.
01:27:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I successfully lobbied a company to start posting APKs, it's not out of the question, sometimes it just takes any consumer demand for the dev team to point to and say "people want this shit". Every request is considered multiple people wanting something, if a business is smart.
01:45:34 <nickcalyx[m]> Its even less work for them if they just submit the app to fdroid, rather than setting up,their own repo. I say this as someone who has done it,both ways
01:46:21 <nickcalyx[m]> Though fdroid wont accept apps that aren't totally FOSS
01:56:09 <qyo3462572445[m]> That's true. Good idea. I'll try that. Thanks! And yea, I try to only use Foss but if I NEED an app, I will use it if its not Foss
01:56:50 <nickcalyx[m]> I think lots of app makers who aren't of the richard stallman mindset use non-free libraries
01:57:08 <nickcalyx[m]> and therefore fdroid won't accept their apps
01:59:28 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "I think lots of app makers who a"> Bitwarden and Firefox come to mind
02:02:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > Its even less work for them if they just submit the app to fdroid, rather than setting up,their own repo. I say this as someone who has done it,both ways
02:02:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > Though fdroid wont accept apps that aren't totally FOSS
02:02:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Not to mention, you have to trust your users to their key hygiene/build servers, etc etc etc

02:20:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> (Relevant resource appreciated)
02:36:14 <cn3m[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Also, Janus?"> It's the v1 signing bypass. It's fixed in Android, but F-Droid is still using the old poorly designed system. v2/v3 would be worth switching too after almost 2 years of the exploit. Play Store is with no unknown sources is the recommended for people stuck with old phones

03:53:38 <JTL> ?
03:54:38 <furofuro_01[m]> <fire-water56[m] "Awesome! I finally got Graphene "> Congrats :>
04:07:31 <nickcalyx[m]> > Do you really trust F-Droid though *cough* Janus  *cough*
04:07:31 <nickcalyx[m]> Well, I know some of the devs, and I do trust them so I'm not,impartial.  Its a volunteer effort and they do their best. Im sure if you wrote a patch to upgrade it to v2/v3 signing they would gladly accept it :) and in any case I think they will need to do that anyway to run under Android R, so its an inevitability
04:42:06 <brenneke[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "Signal I believe is self-updatin"> That is what I keep hearing but it never happened for me, I eventually de-blacklisted in Aurora and updated that way. It had now seen a few updates and is working fine. Originally installed with web APK.
04:58:54 <furofuro_01[m]> <brenneke[m] "That is what I keep hearing but "> It does for me
04:59:14 <furofuro_01[m]> Though it isnt that frequent (I believe the app has to be running on background)

07:11:20 <furofuro_01[m]> <joshman[m] "Has someone successfully connect"> Wow
07:11:53 <TheJollyRoger> joshman[m]: I haven't tried that yet.
07:15:08 <furofuro_01[m]> Nvm didnt read that yet
07:28:02 <thelearner[m]> > Has someone successfully connected GOS device to a monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse
07:28:02 <thelearner[m]> Would also like to know.
07:29:03 <strcat[m]> wireless keyboard and mouse should both work fine
07:29:13 <strcat[m]> mirroring screen on a monitor depends on the device, not all support HDMI over USB-C
07:29:29 <strcat[m]> one of many USB-C features that's often / usually not available
07:29:52 <strcat[m]> we don't enable the support for floating windows and we don't include a taskbar app for that
07:30:10 <strcat[m]> so you can't plug it into a monitor and get some kind of environment suitable for that regardless of which device it is
07:30:28 <strcat[m]> and even simply mirroring via HDMI depends on hardware - GrapheneOS supports it
07:31:10 <strcat[m]> similarly I think wireless display would work fine on hardware that has support for it, Pixels don't include it, they consider it deprecated in favor of Chromecast
07:31:38 <strcat[m]> technically could be added since that's largely a software thing (the hardware support is there)
07:31:45 <strcat[m]> but not what we work on
07:51:05 <hjj9oooo> hi
07:52:08 <hjj9oooo> I would like to install GrapheneOS on my Pixel 3A, I'm asking If I can install: Signal, Wickr, Skype and other apps
07:52:25 <furofuro_01[m]> Signal definitely
07:52:31 <furofuro_01[m]> Not sure about the others
07:52:59 <furofuro_01[m]> More or less they can be installed, not sure about the functionality due to no Gservices
07:53:49 <hjj9oooo> I have to sideload apks or it's preferred installing Aurora store?
08:07:22 <xabi[m]> you can sideload or use aurora
08:07:31 <xabi[m]> both work fine
08:09:06 <hjj9oooo> well thanks, in case can I revert back re-installing default Pixel 3a rom?
08:18:03 <dazinism> hjj9oooo: yes.

10:33:24 <furofuro_01[m]> Edit: Firefox isn't that bad among the firefox-based browsers when configured properly with extensions and about:config, but isnt the greatest for security (and hidden telemetry), along with its lack of sandboxing in android.

20:41:48 <BalooRJ> Anyone know if there is a way to receive SMS messages on a laptop computer while using GrapheneOS?
20:42:13 <BalooRJ> any kind of open source bridge app between a computer and a phone? I'm talking strictly SMS though.
20:48:43 <v2flel[m]> BalooRJ: maybe Signal desktop (Havent tried it)
20:49:04 <BalooRJ> Signal doesn't support SMS unfortunately
20:49:07 <BalooRJ> on desktop.
20:50:56 <v2flel[m]> Well damn
20:55:56 <xabi[m]> Any app that reads the notificationa could do it, phone app on windows . KDE also has a similar option via Bluetooth
21:06:18 <cn3m[m]> KDE Connect runs on Windows
21:35:56 <dazinism> Oh look, looks like my lame attempt to get PDF Viewer in the Fdroid repo got picked up by IzzyOnDroid
21:35:58 <dazinism> https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/org.grapheneos.pdfviewer
21:38:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW
21:38:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> I lose all tags that are made to me when I'm away
21:42:25 <dazinism> An Fdroid repo to get updates for the PDFViewer. They're scraping it from github, so they are Daniels builds, signed with his key
21:44:03 <dazinism> Can use it to get notified and install any PDF Viewer updates between OS updates
21:53:21 <xabi[m]> <cn3m[m] "KDE Connect runs on Windows"> Didn't know that
21:56:08 <radixed9[m]> What is the best fire and forget Android browser for family? Something that will automatically update and that you don't have to worry about long term for privacy and security?
22:00:04 <radixed9[m]> Couldn't get this one on iOS. They got a Samsung that gets quarterlies only. I'd say Bromite, but I am worried what would happen if it was no longer around. Edge?
22:35:16 <dazinism> I'd just go with Bromite, not to tricky to get something else if it ever want about
22:35:23 <dazinism> *wasnt
22:35:43 <dazinism> They get their builds out pretty quick
22:35:43 <radixed9[m]> F-Droid doesn't do silent updates sadly
22:35:47 <radixed9[m]> that's my main concern
22:36:19 <dazinism> Obviously pretty committed
22:36:36 <dazinism> Yeah, guess thats an issue
22:37:05 <radixed9[m]> I definitely trust Bromite. I don't think it is ideal for the non tech savvy. Really needs to be in the Play Store I guess
22:37:06 <dazinism> Could root their phone and install privileged extension
22:37:25 <dazinism> (That is dry sarcasm )
22:37:48 <radixed9[m]> Sadly stupid verified boot gets in the way
22:38:07 <radixed9[m]> (Arizona desert level sarcasm)
22:39:37 <radixed9[m]> I guess Chrome is the way too go. Block third party cookies, use a PrivateDNS, turn off usage data, and call it a day
22:40:03 <dazinism> They arent savvy enough/(trainable?)to update when notified?
22:40:19 <strcat[m]> radixed9: note my advice is to avoid Private DNS if you're using a good VPN provider that provides private/secure DNS themselves
22:40:42 <strcat[m]> newuser1201: https://grapheneos.org/install as a starting point
22:40:50 <radixed9[m]> <strcat[m] "radixed9: note my advice is to a"> It is my grandma's phone and she wouldn't. Thank you for the note
22:44:14 <strcat[m]> newuser1201: don't do that, follow the way it does it in the guide
22:44:27 <strcat[m]> you need to run ./flash-all.sh in the terminal where you set up PATH for fastboot
22:44:43 <strcat[m]> you should be able to run fastboot --version successfully and then run ./flash-all.bat
22:51:34 <strcat[m]> extract it in powershell with tar xvf
22:51:35 <strcat[m]> per the instructions
22:51:37 <strcat[m]> then move into the directory with cd
22:51:47 <strcat[m]> then run ./flash-all.bat after you've confirmed that fastboot --version works
22:51:52 <strcat[m]> which you've done
22:52:06 <strcat[m]> just use the same terminal where you have fastboot working and it'll work
22:52:22 <strcat[m]> and you'll need the same terminal after flashing it to lock the bootloader with `fastboot flashing lock`, which is very important
22:52:40 <strcat[m]> the reason it's not working outside the terminal where  you set up PATH is because that's temporary for that terminal
22:53:03 <strcat[m]> you could persistently change PATH via the Windows GUI for editing environment variables but I wouldn't recommend that
22:53:30 <strcat[m]> because the platform-tools this has you obtain is meant as a temporary thing and doesn't have self-updating, etc. like if you got it via the SDK
22:53:56 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't have you put it at some sensible location for having it persistently either
22:59:01 <radixed9[m]> I need to get off Android Studio. It is so bad
23:52:51 <strcat[m]> run fastboot --version yourself in that terminal
23:52:52 <strcat[m]> it won't work
23:52:59 <strcat[m]> you need to set up PATH properly before running flash-all.bat
