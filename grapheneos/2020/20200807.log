00:01:01 <cn3m[m]> I am too lazy to switch
00:02:09 <cn3m[m]> sorry I am lagging a little on my end
00:02:54 <cn3m[m]> Linus Sex Tips: how do you tell age?
00:02:58 <nikitalita[m]> and the fluffychat repo is still down
00:03:13 <cn3m[m]> I got it from Aurora
00:04:05 <cn3m[m]> ah true
00:04:13 <cn3m[m]> firefox and windows seem to be their thing too
00:04:56 <cn3m[m]> pixulus: I am sorry, but you know what I have to do...
00:06:19 <cn3m[m]> instinct kicked in and I saw the image I was ready to ban. Then I saw the username
00:06:27 <cn3m[m]> be careful guys :)
00:06:47 <cn3m[m]> I jest you all can send images just don't spam them
00:06:49 <nikitalita[m]> cn3m: they're probably using firefox with "resist fingerprinting" turned on
00:06:55 <nikitalita[m]> "resist fingerprinting" spoofs your UA
00:07:29 <cn3m[m]> ah
00:07:38 <cn3m[m]> it forces windows right
00:07:56 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
00:08:27 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
00:09:47 <Linus_Sex_Tips> so this is IRC hmm
00:18:21 <cn3m[m]> Linus_Sex_Tips: hi
00:18:43 <Linus_Sex_Tips> hello
00:33:49 <nikitalita[m]> man
00:33:59 <nikitalita[m]> application management is hard if you're not on the play store
00:38:54 <nikitalita[m]> it seems like most of the open source apps for android that have brand recognition either don't have their shit in f-droid repositories or maintain their own
00:39:22 <nikitalita[m]> they make you download an apk
00:39:40 <nikitalita[m]> and it's a crapshoot whether or not they support staying resident in the background so you get notifacitons
00:40:37 <strcat[m]> neither
00:40:59 <strcat[m]> the main F-Droid repository is managed by a group of packagers for F-Droid
00:41:13 <strcat[m]> a developer can't put their app into the main F-Droid repository, developers don't upload their apps like the Play Store
00:41:21 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
00:41:31 <nikitalita[m]> this is why many of them just choose to maintain their own repositories
00:41:32 <strcat[m]> a developer can't update their app or remove it if it's unmaintained or replaced
00:41:38 <strcat[m]> it's not their repository
00:43:03 <nikitalita[m]> it's like, you have to either choose between the debian model, where the package maintainers can do shit like just remove RNG from your app because it made valgrind complain, or you have to go through a broker like the play store which maintains strict guidelines and makes you integrate proprietary services into your app
00:43:20 <nikitalita[m]> still bitter about the openssl debian incident
00:43:28 <burlycootz[m]> Potentially silly question: when connecting to a Bluetooth that demands a passcode is there any way to pre-load the passcode? I don't get prompted for passcode and wanted to.see if there is a workaround.
00:49:33 <strcat[m]> nikitalita: the Play Store does not make you integrate proprietary services into your app
00:49:50 <nikitalita[m]> aren't you required to use firebase for push notifications?
00:49:59 <strcat[m]> no
00:51:12 <nikitalita[m]> huh
00:51:44 <strcat[m]> you can do push notifications however you want
00:51:58 <strcat[m]> there are rules around which apps are allowed to request power optimization exceptions to bypass doze / app standby
00:52:03 <nikitalita[m]> https://hub.packtpub.com/android-8-forces-foss-apps-to-use-firebase-for-push-notifications-or-label-them-as-using-too-much-battery/
00:52:07 <strcat[m]> there is nothing forbidding using another push notification implementation
00:52:08 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, this is what I meant
00:52:17 <strcat[m]> nikitalita: that's misinformation
00:52:37 <strcat[m]> apps are not required to use FCM for push notifications
00:53:03 <nikitalita[m]> hmmm
00:53:44 <nikitalita[m]> is there an example of a foss app in the play store that does push notifcations without either using firebase or using a perma-notification to stay resident in the background
00:54:13 <strcat[m]> many and I'm not sure why it matters if it's open source or not
00:54:27 <strcat[m]> apps are not required to use FCM for push notifications in the Play Store
00:54:39 <strcat[m]> and your initial claim went further and made it sound like that was somehow a requirement of any store with that model too
00:56:46 <nikitalita[m]> <strcat[m] "many and I'm not sure why it mat"> mostly so I can just look at what they did
00:56:57 <strcat[m]> the same as they do outside the Play Store
00:57:13 <strcat[m]> the only difference is that in the Play Store you aren't allowed to explicitly prompt the user to disable battery optimizations except specific cases of apps
00:57:18 <strcat[m]> but users can ALWAYS disable it themselves
00:57:27 <strcat[m]> so you can put it in documentation
00:57:45 <strcat[m]> there is NO REQUIREMENT to use FCM
00:57:56 <strcat[m]> that's an example of common misinformation being spread and doesn't have an actual basis
00:58:00 <nikitalita[m]> I wasn't aware of other implementations because pretty much all the apps that I'm using right now that I get  notifications from are using the perma-notification to stay resident
00:58:35 <strcat[m]> if they implement their own push notifications using a foreground service is the best way to do that
00:58:59 <strcat[m]> they are not required to use FCM for being on the Play Store
00:59:06 <strcat[m]> simply not true and that's what you claimed
00:59:51 <strcat[m]> pixulus: no, it's not
01:01:21 <strcat[m]> speculating about this isn't necessary
01:01:25 <strcat[m]> it's clearly documented
01:01:29 <strcat[m]> in an easy to understand way
01:01:52 <nikitalita[m]> strcat: IMO, this is semantics. Having the user jump through hoops to make the app function as designed without the use of a proprietary library is functionally a requirement
01:02:00 <strcat[m]> they do not have to jump through hoops
01:02:21 <strcat[m]> and it applies whether the app uses a proprietary library or not
01:02:54 <strcat[m]> and using FCM doesn't require using a proprietary library anyway since there is an open source implementation of that part of the client side SDK
01:03:43 <strcat[m]> I suggest as step one people read and understand the power management restrictions placed on apps: https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/power/power-details
01:04:11 <strcat[m]> this applies to all apps, even system apps
01:04:37 <strcat[m]> the user granting a battery optimization except simply disables the network restriction
01:05:24 <strcat[m]> if the user actively uses the app then it's not going to be in the 'rare' bucket anyway
01:06:16 <strcat[m]> FCM doesn't bypass these restrictions, it's part of them
01:06:51 <strcat[m]> if a messaging app actually ends up in the rare bucket then it can only send you 5 push notifications via FCM per day when you aren't actively using it
01:07:06 <strcat[m]> and if it's NOT in the rare bucket it can just access the network when not active itself
01:07:18 <strcat[m]> except when the device is in deep sleep (doze)
01:07:40 <strcat[m]> and then it still works - there are just active windows
01:07:49 <strcat[m]> which grow progressively longer the longer the phone sits there unused
01:08:06 <strcat[m]> there is nothing that forces you to use FCM
01:08:27 <strcat[m]> a battery optimization exception simply bypasses the Doze and Rare bucket network restrictions
01:09:29 <strcat[m]> the device can't doze is there's a foreground service
01:09:36 <strcat[m]>  * the device can't doze if there's a foreground service
01:10:42 <strcat[m]> a foreground service allows the app to continue running and they aren't impacted by doze
01:11:19 <strcat[m]> so if the app has a foreground service it doesn't really need a battery optimization exception unless it's worried about ending up in the rare bucket because the user hardly ever interacts with the app
01:12:18 <nikitalita[m]> ah hah, I see
01:12:29 <strcat[m]> take away the battery optimization from Signal and it should still work fine
01:12:44 <strcat[m]> the only restriction on the Play Store is you can't ask for a battery optimization exception except very specific cases
01:12:53 <strcat[m]> so a messaging app can't request that exception but... it doesn't really need one
01:12:53 <nikitalita[m]> so the foreground service is mostly out of an abundance of caution
01:13:10 <strcat[m]> the foreground service lets the app continue running and avoids it being killed
01:13:43 <strcat[m]> so the foreground service is what allows an app to do push notifications itself reliably, rather than depending on starting itself via an alarm and hoping the device isn't in doze mode (i.e. user is not using the device)
01:14:13 <strcat[m]> an app like an email app can just use jobs and ignore all this stuff
01:14:23 <strcat[m]> just use a job set to require network access
01:14:31 <strcat[m]> and look how that works there
01:14:40 <strcat[m]> app is currently active -> no delay
01:14:52 <strcat[m]> app is in working set (one of the apps the user regularly uses) -> every 2 hours
01:15:16 <strcat[m]> frequent use -> every 8 hours (if you use it at least daily and don't use that many apps it'll be in the working set though)
01:15:22 <strcat[m]> rare -> every 24 hours
01:16:05 <strcat[m]> and when the user is not using the device at all, it goes into doze pretty quickly, and then only runs jobs, etc. during active windows more than long enough to check for emails, etc.
01:16:14 <strcat[m]> and those active windows get increasingly spread out
01:16:27 <strcat[m]> so for example when you sleep it starts having a 30 min delay, then 1 hr, then 2 hrs, then 4 hrs, etc.
01:16:41 <strcat[m]> then when you wake up and use the phone it's out of doze
01:17:18 <strcat[m]> nikitalita: so if an app doesn't really need push (like email) it can just do that as the baseline
01:17:28 <strcat[m]> and then they can offer the user the option of push via a foreground service
01:17:36 <strcat[m]> and they do not need a battery optimization exception at all either way
01:19:05 <strcat[m]> an app only needs a battery optimization exception to make absolutely sure their foreground service will always have network access even if the device wants to doze or the user rarely ever uses the app
01:19:33 <strcat[m]> and the ONLY Play Store restriction is that most apps can't explicitly request an exception
01:19:35 <strcat[m]> via a prompt
01:19:54 <strcat[m]> but you can try on GrapheneOS
01:20:01 <strcat[m]> disable Signal's battery optimization exception
01:20:04 <strcat[m]> it's still going to work fine
01:20:23 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, apps like fairmail get around this by having a link to battery exception settings and instructions on how to disable optimization
01:20:57 <strcat[m]> an email app doesn't really need push unless up to 2 hr delay (or longer when using the phone) isn't good enough
01:21:08 <strcat[m]> they can just use a job to fetch otherwise
01:21:17 <strcat[m]> I personally don't want push notifications for emails
01:21:36 <strcat[m]> don't want notifications at all
01:21:54 <strcat[m]> I always have email - that's a given shrug
01:21:57 <JTL> I guess it depends on your usecase
01:22:28 <nikitalita[m]> I'm fortunate that people don't really email me unless its for something important
01:22:56 <nikitalita[m]> if they break that rule then I usually just put them in the unfocused bucket
01:23:09 <strcat[m]> I think email apps should just use a job to check by default (and of course check when you use the app)
01:23:19 <strcat[m]> and offer the option of checking via push
01:23:32 <strcat[m]> which requires a foreground service without FCM
01:23:53 <strcat[m]> and even then I wouldn't expect an email app to have notifications by default
01:24:57 <nikitalita[m]> mmm, I dunno, smartphones have pretty much trained people to expect push notifications for everything by default
01:25:03 <strcat[m]> at least, not notifications that make a sound/vibration
01:25:22 <strcat[m]> silent low priority notifications that simply show an icon wouldn't be that bad if it doesn't spam them
01:25:28 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
01:25:47 <strcat[m]> I don't see how I could be productive if I got pinged for every email
01:26:13 <aeonsolution[m]> ^
01:26:15 <strcat[m]> if people want a prompt reply from me they shouldn't be using email
01:26:56 <nikitalita[m]> this is kinda why I've segmented all my emails
01:27:12 <nikitalita[m]> I have 7 seperate email accounts according to tiers
01:27:31 <nikitalita[m]> There are like two that i regularly check, one I get notifications for
01:27:47 <nikitalita[m]> the rest are basically just in case I need a password reset
01:28:46 <strcat[m]> if people have something to email about for GrapheneOS they should be using the GrapheneOS emails on the site
01:29:26 <cn3m[m]> ^
01:29:36 <strcat[m]> and they can expect a 1-4 day delay when I go through a batch of 50 emails
01:30:16 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/contact also tries and fails to get people to use more appropriate methods to get info
01:30:59 <strcat[m]> it just gets flooded with requests for supporting more devices, etc. and people add security⊙go trying to get higher priority
01:31:04 <strcat[m]> for unrelated things
01:31:14 <nikitalita[m]> welp
01:31:37 <strcat[m]> it's a bit better now that I have strict enforcement of SPF / DKIM / DMARC
01:31:55 <strcat[m]> sadly gmail.com doesn't set their DMARC policy to reject yet
01:32:09 <strcat[m]> so that's a problem
01:32:26 <strcat[m]> oh and for some reason a spam filtering service used by icloud.com blacklisted the mail server's IP
01:32:42 <strcat[m]> so I can't respond to those anyway
01:32:47 <nikitalita[m]> heh
01:33:01 <JTL> :/
01:33:10 <strcat[m]> I think people reported attestation.app alerts (which are limited to once per day per device now) as spam
01:33:15 <cn3m[m]> I love email such a well designed platform /s
01:33:26 <nikitalita[m]> it seems that's happening a lot to most email servers that aren't controlled by the big mail providers
01:33:31 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "I think people reported attestat"> really...
01:33:32 <cn3m[m]> wow
01:33:35 <strcat[m]> instead of just removing their email from the attestation.app account
01:33:41 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, that happens
01:33:52 <strcat[m]> a lot of people forget their password and can't remove the email because I don't support email recovery (login is username/passphrase)
01:34:13 <strcat[m]> because the alerts are important for security
01:34:29 <strcat[m]> so for example lets say someone's email service doesn't use DANE or at least MTA-STS
01:34:37 <strcat[m]> that means an attacker can get the plain text alert emails
01:34:43 <strcat[m]> so I can't just put an unsubscribe link in them
01:34:55 <strcat[m]> so it instead asks people to email contact⊙aa to unsub
01:35:00 <strcat[m]> and I have to manually verify each one
01:35:11 <strcat[m]> and a lot of people forget their password
01:35:43 <nikitalita[m]> perhaps you could put a "why we don't support unsubscribe" link in the email, disguised as a regular unsubscribe link, to trick people into reading the reason why you don't support it
01:35:48 <strcat[m]>                                 message.setText("The following devices have failed to provide valid attestations before the expiry time:\n\n" +
01:35:48 <strcat[m]>                                         expired.toString() + "\nLog in to https://attestation.app/ for more information." +
01:35:48 <strcat[m]>                                         "\nIf you do not want to receive these alerts and cannot log in to the account,\nemail contact⊙aa from the address receiving the alerts.");
01:36:27 <strcat[m]> this is an example of an alert email:
01:36:29 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/oyXefvEwSxpMrLSBdEvfvZub >
01:36:33 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, they don't read those things; I know when I get spam, my eyes just kinda glaze over and I scroll to the bottom of the email looking for an unsubscribe link
01:37:18 <strcat[m]> and if the email they send to contact⊙aa does not pass SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification then I can't unsubscribe based on it
01:38:02 <nikitalita[m]> also, I know that some email providers are now starting to punish mail servers (who don't come from the big providers like mailchimp) who send email without a proper List-Unsubscribe embedded
01:38:26 <nikitalita[m]> so that's possibly part of the reason
01:38:31 <strcat[m]> the thing is ppl enabled these emails themselves
01:38:41 <strcat[m]> and then they report them as spam instead of disabling it
01:38:45 <nikitalita[m]> yep
01:38:54 <strcat[m]> and if they forget their password everyone using attestation.app gets punished
01:39:05 <strcat[m]> by having the alerts classified as spam and even the mail server blocked as is the case for icloud now
01:39:20 <strcat[m]> I probably have to blacklist using icloud emails in the frontend
01:39:24 <strcat[m]> and server
01:39:27 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
01:39:46 <nikitalita[m]> and I'm guessing there's no process though apple to unblacklist your server
01:39:53 <strcat[m]> it's not apple that did it
01:39:58 <strcat[m]> it's a service they use that did it
01:40:06 <strcat[m]> and they do not respond via their contact form for getting unblacklisted
01:40:10 <nikitalita[m]> mmm
01:40:13 <strcat[m]> they say they respond in a couple days
01:40:23 <strcat[m]> sent multiple forms and it has been months
01:40:34 <strcat[m]> if people want to help with that let me know
01:40:57 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
01:41:00 <strcat[m]> in general I find the best way to deal with this stuff is to identify as many people as possible in their company and just start sending emails to all of them repeatedly and eventually they deal with it
01:41:15 <nikitalita[m]> basically the only real way to fix that nowadays is to send your emails through a trusted broker
01:41:20 <strcat[m]> that's how you have to deal with big companies
01:41:25 <strcat[m]> figure out the emails of all their executives
01:41:39 <strcat[m]> and one of them will read it, realize they are doing something bad
01:41:40 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, definitely
01:41:41 <strcat[m]> and actually fix it
01:42:00 <nikitalita[m]> that's how one of me exes got her company to cover her work injusry
01:42:08 <strcat[m]> you can't go via the normal support mechanism because it's flooded with messages and isn't really taken care of
01:42:12 <nikitalita[m]> she actually tracked down the phone number of the CEO and called him directly
01:42:17 <nikitalita[m]> and basically shamed him into doing it
01:42:37 <strcat[m]> yeah in general when you get in contact with an actual specific person without anonymity you get results
01:43:12 <strcat[m]> I've also gotten results from using twitter
01:43:19 <strcat[m]> @reply and keep talking about it
01:43:32 <strcat[m]> and don't just stop talking in public about it when they want to do DM
01:43:51 <nikitalita[m]> public shaming is basically the only legal tool we really have now to hold companies accountable
01:44:18 <strcat[m]> I have an essentially unused facebook account with 0 content, 0 friends added to it, etc. solely to use facebook's developer tool nonsense and log into things that only support facebook login
01:44:22 <strcat[m]> so it gets repeatedly banned
01:44:32 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, that'd do it
01:44:39 <strcat[m]> you need a facebook account to disable other people posting ads on behalf of your site
01:44:52 <nikitalita[m]> sigh
01:45:15 <nikitalita[m]> remember like, back in the mid 90s, people proposed utopian visions of what the internet would be?
01:45:28 <nikitalita[m]> "A NEW COUNTRY, FREE FROM RESTRICTIONS, INFORMATION FREEDOM FOR ALL"
01:46:06 <nikitalita[m]> now it's just a giant surveillance tool where you can play in the sandbox of a few big companies
01:53:05 <Kruger[m]> Sorry for interrupting, some countries like US, India etc do need high Internet Surveillance because of many reasons, one of them being - enemies
01:53:16 <rickza[m]> Can anybody help or do i have to post on reddit regarding this issue, The following devices have failed to provide valid attestations before the expiry time. But when i log into attestation.app it gives me : Last verified time: Fri Aug 07 2020 02:10:08 , my verify interval is set to 4 hours and permitted delay until alerts is set to 48 hours but i keep on getting emails everyday
01:53:25 <nikitalita[m]> lol
01:53:33 <nikitalita[m]> we were just talking about that rickza
01:53:36 <strcat[m]> rickza: sounds like you have multiple device registrations
01:53:59 <strcat[m]> rickza: do you have multiple devices registered? perhaps you set it up, disabled it, and set it up again
01:54:03 <Kruger[m]> Well you can laugh at that if you like, but sadly it is true
01:54:04 <strcat[m]> and haven't deleted the old registration
01:54:27 <nikitalita[m]> Kruger: off-topic: https://matrix.to/#/!NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=privacytools.io&via=tchncs.de
01:54:38 <strcat[m]> rickza: the alert email gives you the fingerprint of the impacted devices, you shouldn't look at other ones
01:54:42 <strcat[m]> only look at the one it emailed you about
01:54:54 <strcat[m]> copy the fingerprint, ctrl-f to go to the section for that device
01:54:58 <strcat[m]> others aren't relevant
01:55:40 <rickza[m]> Thanks dude, this makes sense, ill look into it
01:55:45 <strcat[m]> every pairing has a unique fingerprint, if you disable remote attestation and enable it again the service still expects attestations from the previously registered device
01:56:00 <strcat[m]> if you redo it, as far as the service knows it's a 2nd device you just registered
01:56:32 <strcat[m]> a device cannot be allowed to delete themselves from the attestation service
01:56:54 <rickza[m]> The hash that im getting emailed is different to my pixel 3a's hash
01:57:05 <strcat[m]> so look at the list of devices
01:57:12 <strcat[m]> you have multiple registered then
01:58:01 <strcat[m]> if you disable remote attestation on a device you need to log into the service and delete that remote attestation pairing
01:58:03 <rickza[m]> where do i find the list of devices ?
01:58:07 <strcat[m]> or it'll start sending you alerts
01:58:17 <strcat[m]> rickza: the page there lists out devices based on fingerprints of the pairing
01:58:24 <strcat[m]> https://attestation.app/
01:58:35 <strcat[m]> the whole page is a list of devices in sections with their fingerprint at the top as a header
01:59:05 <strcat[m]> sounds like you enabled remote attestation and paired with the service, then disabled it, then enabled it again
01:59:13 <rickza[m]> I only see one device which is my device
01:59:14 <strcat[m]> so you have a previous device registered that's inactive and not sending attestations
01:59:22 <strcat[m]> rickza: did you make a previous account
01:59:50 <strcat[m]> I could add the account username to the emails perhaps
01:59:57 <rickza[m]> Yeah i did make a previous account but i unfortunately forgot why i made a 2nd one
02:00:13 <strcat[m]> rickza: well that's the issue previous account has an inactive device registered
02:00:44 <strcat[m]> rickza: when you disabled + enabled again for the new account, previous account stopped getting attestations
02:00:49 <strcat[m]> so the alerts are coming from there
02:01:27 <strcat[m]> rickza: you need to email the contact⊙aa address it gives at the bottom of the alert email from the email address receiving the alerts
02:01:34 <strcat[m]> and ask to disable them
02:01:58 <strcat[m]> probably going to have to disable them for both accounts since I won't know which is which
02:02:03 <strcat[m]> and then you can add back the alert email to the account you use
02:02:25 <rickza[m]> I will do so, thanks man, i appreciate your help
02:02:41 <strcat[m]> I don't have a fancy UI to do this, I just verify the authenticity of the email asking to disable alerts and remove it from any accounts
02:03:07 <strcat[m]> nikitalita: but yeah we were just talking about this
02:03:21 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, this sounds like a support nightmare
02:03:28 <strcat[m]> so in general what happens is people just report it as spam
02:03:33 <strcat[m]> because they forgot their account info
02:03:44 <strcat[m]> and then the alerts start being classified as spam
02:03:44 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, it sucks
02:04:06 <rickza[m]> Sorry for making more work for you but i am learning and definitely wont repeat this again.
02:04:07 <strcat[m]> I could start disallowing capital letters in usernames
02:04:12 <strcat[m]> rickza: it's okay
02:04:13 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
02:04:17 <strcat[m]> as long as you don't report the emails as spam
02:04:19 <nikitalita[m]> make it case insensitive
02:04:27 <strcat[m]> not case insensitive
02:04:31 <strcat[m]> just disable using capital letters
02:04:52 <strcat[m]> there may be existing accounts with case variants
02:04:56 <nikitalita[m]> just curious, how many full developers are on the project right now? Github lists three, including yourself
02:05:45 <strcat[m]> membership in the github org isn't public for everyone in it
02:05:48 <strcat[m]> there are 4 in the org
02:05:55 <strcat[m]> and people aren't necessarily in the org who are working on it
02:06:02 <strcat[m]> like aeonsolution isn't in the org atm
02:06:07 <strcat[m]> they could be
02:06:10 <nikitalita[m]> ah hah
02:06:44 <rickza[m]> Thanks again man, ill sort this out in the evening after work, really appreciate you guys going out of your way to develop GOS, seriously you guys are legends.
02:07:09 <strcat[m]> nikitalita: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/AttestationServer/blob/master/src/main/java/app/attestation/server/AttestationServer.java#L288
02:07:18 <strcat[m]> that's the sanity check I added for usernames (and the same check in the frontend code)
02:07:31 <strcat[m]> so maybe I should just disallow capital letters so it's harder for people to forget username
02:07:32 <strcat[m]> might help
02:08:12 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, if you're interested in helping out you don't have to be a part of the org to contribute 🙂
02:09:34 <aeonsolution[m]> hey strcat if i wanted to contribute to GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc where could i start researching?
02:10:22 <nikitalita[m]> I'm considering getting a pixel 4a and helping out getting grapheneos on that
02:11:36 <aeonsolution[m]> nikitalita: nice, well you can start already, what are you interested in?
02:12:41 <cn3m[m]> yeah there is a lot of work that could be done before release
02:14:05 <nikitalita[m]> I dunno; I've a bit of everything
02:14:17 <aeonsolution[m]> im going to piggyback on that cn3m, i need help testing Pixel 3 family devices
02:14:32 <nikitalita[m]> i've done a fair amount of systems programming before
02:14:46 <nikitalita[m]> linux kernel hacking and drivers and such
02:15:39 <aeonsolution[m]> nikitalita: have you looked at https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues?
02:15:44 <JTL> nikitalita[m]: good luck
02:16:49 <aeonsolution[m]> preferably i need to find people with Pixel 3, Pixel 3L, and Pixel 3a XL
02:17:01 <cn3m[m]> One issue on my wishlist is have Vanadium respect the no network permission on other apps like the Download Manager does. If I wasn't committed to other areas I would work on that issue
02:17:30 <aeonsolution[m]>  * preferably i need to find people with Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, and Pixel 3a XL
02:18:11 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "preferably i need to find people"> I would help, but my Pixel is basically dead I am on a backup phone now. xD
02:18:47 <aeonsolution[m]> no worries, it would be better for new people so we can expand the community support
02:19:10 <cn3m[m]> ^
02:19:14 <nikitalita[m]> ideally we'd be able to get this on a shitbox $99 burner phone but I doubt they have the hardware security requirements that grapheneos is looking for :P
02:19:31 <nikitalita[m]> a $349 midrange is a good compromise though
02:19:46 <strcat[m]> there are 650 total attestation.app accounts
02:20:06 <strcat[m]> if I lowercase all the usernames, there are 646 unique usernames
02:20:12 <strcat[m]> so there are 4 accounts that are case variants of others
02:20:31 <strcat[m]> I also think it might be a bad idea to case normalize usernames
02:20:31 <aeonsolution[m]> we need to mob programming for new comers to help with device support and then grow our device maintainers from 1.5 to 10
02:20:32 <strcat[m]> dunno
02:20:45 <aeonsolution[m]>  * we need to mob program with new comers to help with device support and then grow our device maintainers from 1.5 to 10
02:21:17 <nikitalita[m]> strcat: do the variants have emails that you can notify them about changes to their usernames
02:21:35 <strcat[m]> if they have no devices registered I can just delete them as inactive accounts
02:21:37 <strcat[m]> let me see
02:23:03 <strcat[m]> yeah there are 4 accounts with a case variant of the same username
02:23:20 <strcat[m]> see right now it's ASCII only
02:23:31 <strcat[m]> so dealing with these and then storing all accounts in lowercase is an option
02:23:38 <strcat[m]> but you don't want to deal with case normalization with unicode
02:23:45 <strcat[m]> so if I expand what's allowed in usernames I wouldn't want that
02:23:52 <strcat[m]> atm your username is exactly what you enter
02:24:00 <strcat[m]> if you enter FooBar that's your username, foobar is not related
02:24:15 <strcat[m]> if I decide to case normalize I can't undo that
02:24:45 <cn3m[m]> strcat: is it correct that Auditor is the only defense from a root exploit installing accessibility services for persistence?
02:24:51 <strcat[m]> because I'd probably want to convert all existing usernames to lowercase and then just lowercase what users enter
02:25:13 <strcat[m]> cn3m: I mean you could probably boot in safe mode
02:25:40 <cn3m[m]> right, but you wouldn't know it happened unless you had auditor
02:25:44 <strcat[m]> I don't think a third party accessibility service would run in safe mode
02:25:46 <strcat[m]> you could check
02:25:51 <cn3m[m]> I didn't think of that though thanks
02:26:03 <strcat[m]> cn3m: well in general if someone gets root via exploit they can modify any persistent state
02:26:16 <strcat[m]> so they can install any app, give it any permissions that are possible to grant to third party app
02:26:36 <strcat[m]> and even though they'll lose root after reboot any changes they made to persistent state would be around
02:26:46 <strcat[m]> and they could exploit the OS again if it isn't patched
02:27:02 <strcat[m]> Auditor having the patch level from hardware is an important part of it
02:28:21 <cn3m[m]> thanks good explanation
02:29:41 <strcat[m]> yeah I don't see a way to fully case normalize usernames due to those 4 cases of overlap
02:29:58 <strcat[m]> I think a major source of confusion for users is that they register Foobar and then try to use foobar or vice versa though
02:30:05 <strcat[m]> I could start only permitting lowercase usernames
02:30:24 <strcat[m]> existing usernames with uppercase will continue to remain as is
02:30:28 <strcat[m]> but I could stop creation of new ones
02:30:41 <strcat[m]> going to do this
02:31:22 <aeonsolution[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "hey strcat if i wanted to contri"> shameless signal boost 😀
02:31:37 <strcat[m]> dunno just start with hardened_malloc repo?
02:31:39 <strcat[m]> and README
02:32:14 <cn3m[m]> the documentation is quite good
02:32:14 <cn3m[m]> imo
02:32:30 <cn3m[m]> as a super novice to security I reference it a lot
02:36:21 <aeonsolution[m]> youre not a super novice!
02:36:36 <aeonsolution[m]> i appreciate the morale support
02:37:06 <aeonsolution[m]> 😎
02:37:24 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "youre not a super novice!"> I beg to differ xD
02:38:21 <strcat[m]> yeah I think I prefer forcing all lowercase
02:38:32 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "yeah I think I prefer forcing al"> all new?
02:38:36 <strcat[m]> yes
02:38:44 <cn3m[m]> I think that is wise
02:38:46 <strcat[m]> and eventually I could convert all the old accounts to lowercase
02:39:04 <strcat[m]> only 4 are ambiguous
02:39:13 <renlord> shouldnt usernames be case sensitive
02:39:21 <renlord> the onus is on the user to remember what username they used
02:39:28 <cn3m[m]> people forget them
02:39:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: well atm they are case sensitive
02:39:34 <renlord> Foobar should not be equal to foobar
02:39:40 <cn3m[m]> then it gets reported as spam to make it go away
02:39:42 <strcat[m]> but people are forgetting if they use Foobar or foobar
02:39:48 <strcat[m]> and then they can't login to disable alerts
02:39:51 <strcat[m]> and they report alerts as spam
02:40:02 <strcat[m]> and they require support from me to disable alerts
02:40:06 <renlord> then we probably should implement forgot username or something
02:40:13 <cn3m[m]> could you send the username with the attestation report?
02:40:22 <strcat[m]> cn3m: yes
02:40:26 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "then we probably should implemen"> he doesn't want email recovery
02:40:39 <cn3m[m]> understandably
02:40:41 <strcat[m]> renlord: if I disallow uppercase in usernames
02:40:45 <strcat[m]> usernames are still case sensitive
02:40:52 <strcat[m]> people just can't make new accounts with uppercase letters
02:41:03 <renlord> that's just an odd thing to do imo
02:41:12 <strcat[m]> -        if (username.length() > 32 || !username.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9]+")) {
02:41:12 <strcat[m]> +        if (username.length() > 32 || !username.matches("[a-z0-9]+")) {
02:41:21 <strcat[m]> ```-        if (username.length() > 32 || !username.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9]+")) {
02:41:21 <strcat[m]> +        if (username.length() > 32 || !username.matches("[a-z0-9]+")) {
02:41:21 <strcat[m]> ```
02:41:30 <strcat[m]> matrix markdown formatting is so broken
02:41:43 <JTL> I agree
02:42:01 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://gist.github.com/thestinger/58dd7eac3a98512075ca0ac358a45822
02:42:21 <strcat[m]> renlord: we already heavily restrict username characters (passwords can be anything)
02:42:57 <renlord> the underlying problem is user forgetfulness, dont think just patching it to restrict to lowercase actually addresses the problem
02:43:05 <renlord> what if you have a user who has a pref for uppercase characters?
02:43:08 <renlord> lol
02:43:16 <strcat[m]> most services have case insensitive usernames
02:43:31 <cn3m[m]> isn't it best to truncate passwords around 128?
02:43:31 <renlord> should just have a report that says Hi <Username>, this is your attestation details...
02:43:49 <renlord> cn3m[m]: why? they get hashed anyways
02:43:57 <strcat[m]> case insensitivity is a really big problem with unicode
02:44:01 <strcat[m]> but we only permit latin characters anyway
02:44:33 <strcat[m]> renlord: in cases where usernames are displayed to others lowercase has advantages like not being able to confuse I with l in a font where they look the same
02:44:44 <strcat[m]> which one of those is an L and which one is an i
02:44:46 <strcat[m]> in this case that's not an issue
02:45:00 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "cn3m: why? they get hashed anywa"> that is fair, I see it all the time which is why I thought it must have a reason. Though in all fairness terrible reason when talking about security
02:45:28 <strcat[m]> ideally fonts would all have the bars on top and bottom of I so it doesn't look like l
02:45:31 <strcat[m]> but most don't
02:45:41 <renlord> the impression i get when password lengths are restricted to 32 characters is the password is stored in plain text in SQL as VARCHAR(32)
02:45:43 <renlord> LOL
02:45:54 * renlord runs away from service
02:46:02 <strcat[m]> we restrict passwords to 4096 characters
02:46:03 <strcat[m]> lol
02:46:07 <strcat[m]> arbitrarily
02:46:12 <strcat[m]> there has to be some limit
02:46:18 <strcat[m]> I'm not letting people upload a 2GB password
02:46:23 <strcat[m]> to be hashed with scrypt
02:46:43 <renlord> it also consumes their upload bandwidth
02:46:45 <renlord> 2gb password
02:46:48 <renlord> kek
02:47:12 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really make any sense to have > 128 characters or so and you don't need NEARLY that long for 128-bit entropy if it's just random + stored in pw manager
02:48:14 <strcat[m]> so for example with a fully random passphrase with only hex characters 32 characters is 128-bit
02:48:49 <renlord> *fully random* passphrase
02:48:54 <renlord> many people dont use a password manager
02:48:59 <cn3m[m]> ^
02:49:12 <strcat[m]> but even just alphanumeric (a-z A-Z 0-9) has 62 possibilities per character
02:49:14 <strcat[m]> renlord: sure but
02:49:21 <strcat[m]> how many people are going to write an essay as their passphrase then
02:49:28 <strcat[m]> > 256 characters really seems overkill
02:49:30 <cn3m[m]> you can't have a not random 128 character password unless it is a scripture verse or something idk
02:49:35 <strcat[m]>  * more than 256 characters really seems overkill
02:49:46 <renlord> a literature major might use a poem
02:49:47 <cn3m[m]> Google has 128 iirc
02:50:00 <cn3m[m]> which would be terrible
02:50:03 <strcat[m]> well the limit is 4096
02:50:11 <cn3m[m]> not in any objective way, but in a sensical way
02:50:17 <strcat[m]> if someone has a more than 4096 character passphrase
02:50:20 <strcat[m]> there is something wrong
02:50:41 <cn3m[m]> I use the Linux 4.4 source code as my password for everything
02:50:48 <strcat[m]> cause password manager even with just lowercase latin + digits wouldn't even hit 32 for a 128-bit passphrase
02:50:51 <renlord> cn3m[m]: @_@
02:50:54 <strcat[m]> and if you are typing it out by hand
02:51:00 <strcat[m]> i don't see how you hit 4096
02:51:00 <strcat[m]> lol
02:51:34 <cn3m[m]> anyway how big of a threat is brute forcing that anyway?
02:51:50 <nikitalita[m]> depends on the algorithm and your threat model
02:52:19 <strcat[m]>     private static byte[] hash(final byte[] password, final byte[] salt) {
02:52:19 <strcat[m]>         return SCrypt.generate(password, salt, 32768, 8, 1, 32);
02:52:19 <strcat[m]>     }
02:52:23 <strcat[m]> that's what's being used
02:52:46 <nikitalita[m]> also depends on the implementation, of course
02:52:55 <renlord> server would probably go down before it actually gets overwhelmed by traffic with all that scrypt hashing
02:53:16 <strcat[m]> random tokens used by the server are all 32 bytes (subscribe key, salts, cookie token, request token for JS)
02:53:28 <strcat[m]> i.e. 256-bit
02:53:35 <strcat[m]> so that there's always 128-bit+ security
02:53:45 <nikitalita[m]> WPA2 used to be just semi-feasible to brute-forcing the aes key that you get from the handshake if they were using a weak password that could be looked up in a dictionary file
02:53:58 <strcat[m]> in theory the JS request token can be removed if all browsers supported SameSite=Strict
02:53:58 <cn3m[m]> with rate limiting and the fact the data is on the server there is no reason for me to use more than 6 characters in my online passwords
02:54:00 <strcat[m]> since that's used
02:54:16 <strcat[m]> there's not really rate limiting other than hashing speed
02:54:18 <cn3m[m]> my google account was 6 characters fully random
02:54:38 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "there's not really rate limiting"> I meant in general, but yeah not sure it is needed here
02:55:32 <strcat[m]> anyway yeah
02:55:33 <nikitalita[m]> but then they found that on certain implementations on routers you could actually expose the PMKID, which made it feasible to brute force any key on router that did this easily: https://www.ssl247.nl/over-ons/blog/new-wpa-wpa2-network-attack
02:55:36 <strcat[m]> I'll add the username to the alert emails
02:56:11 <strcat[m]> the thing is that accounts are not really tied to an email - intentionally
02:56:15 <strcat[m]> you don't need an email to make an account
02:56:30 <strcat[m]> and under the hood it's set up so that you could actually add multiple alert emails, it's just not exposed via the UI or API yet
02:56:44 <strcat[m]> because email is just considered 1 possible alert mechanism
02:56:49 <strcat[m]> it could support others
02:57:09 <strcat[m]> it knows how to alert multiple emails for 1 account already it just doesn't let people add multiple atm
02:57:47 <nikitalita[m]> also, speaking of PSK
02:57:55 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/OlECeogGmmdvFIHSCdcSXoIq >
02:58:09 <strcat[m]> when it sends alerts it iterates through emails for that user
02:58:18 <strcat[m]> it just only currently allows setting one
02:58:31 <strcat[m]> could fairly easily set it up to support 3 or w/e
02:58:39 <nikitalita[m]> well, this is really an #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  thing
03:12:09 <strcat[m]> renlord: I think it would really be best to move to case insensitive usernames so there's less support burden
03:12:23 <strcat[m]> I've checked and most services use case insensitive
03:13:10 <cn3m[m]> I can't think of a case sensitive one off the top of my head
03:13:26 <renlord> my bank uses case sensitive
03:13:28 <renlord> lol
03:13:40 <renlord> anyways, i dont have strong opinions on this
03:13:52 <renlord> i just wanted to highlight that the underlying cause of this is user forgetfulness
03:14:11 <strcat[m]> yeah and users are forgetful so we have to design to avoid that being a problem as much as we possibly can
03:14:18 <strcat[m]> this places a substantial support burden on us
03:15:02 <renlord> if email was not associated with an account
03:15:08 <renlord> how do said user get alerts??
03:15:21 <renlord> s/do/does/
03:15:23 -SEdbot[m]- > <@freenode_renlord:matrix.org> s/do/does/
03:15:23 -SEdbot[m]- s/does/does/
03:15:31 <renlord> wtf
03:15:36 <renlord> stupid bot
03:16:01 <renlord> cant even regex properly
03:16:30 <strcat[m]> what is that bot even trying to do
03:16:38 <strcat[m]> s/that/the/
03:16:47 <renlord> the bot got booted off irc
03:16:48 <renlord> lol
03:16:57 <renlord> SEdbot[m] (sedmaunium@gateway/shell/matrix.org/x-xnaoiiclvienyvpk) has quit (Killed (Sigyn (Stay safe off irc)))
03:17:26 <renlord> its trying to do my sed replacement
03:17:38 <renlord> but replaced it weirdly
03:17:43 <strcat[m]> failing pretty hard at it
03:18:09 <strcat[m]> it looks like they accidentally input the pattern as the message
03:18:40 <strcat[m]> like instead of replace(pattern, message) they did replace(pattern, pattern)
03:19:11 <strcat[m]> and I don't get why it underlines the end
03:19:26 <strcat[m]> anyways that's gone
03:20:28 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/AttestationServer/commit/629d22beb1722a85e993e6b726f77029fd2411ad
03:21:20 <strcat[m]> renlord: I do think it's probably best to make usernames case insensitive but I'm unsure how to do that at this point
03:23:29 <strcat[m]> due to the 4 usernames with an uppercase variant that conflicts
03:23:58 <nikitalita[m]> do they have devices attached to them
03:24:12 <nikitalita[m]> ccccccnekcfgtiefultnicgllnfrtnihdbbukjlkgetc
03:24:28 <nikitalita[m]> fucking cat keyboard
03:25:58 <strcat[m]> some do
03:27:44 <strcat[m]> deleted one that's inactive
03:27:47 <strcat[m]> no devices
03:28:10 <nikitalita[m]> anyway to inform them?
03:31:04 <strcat[m]> meh
03:31:08 <strcat[m]> they're inactive will just delete them
03:31:11 <strcat[m]> 2 gone
03:31:20 <strcat[m]> one of them had 2 accounts both with 0 devices
03:31:33 <renlord> strcat[m]: any plans to mirror ota updates?
03:31:38 <strcat[m]> one of them was 2 accounts, one inactive since 2019 so I deleted the inactive one
03:31:50 <strcat[m]> renlord: well I could add multiple servers
03:31:59 <strcat[m]> and add multiple DNS entries so it round robin load balances across them
03:32:04 <renlord> why not use a cdn to push them
03:32:07 <strcat[m]> if we had geodns we could also have regional servers then
03:32:12 <renlord> so there's more geographical locality
03:32:15 <strcat[m]> renlord: what CDN will let me host 1GB files
03:32:19 <strcat[m]> unlimited bandwidth
03:32:24 <strcat[m]> no charge based on bandwith
03:32:28 <strcat[m]>  * no charge based on bandwidth
03:34:20 <renlord> fair point
03:34:32 <renlord> none i guess LOL
03:34:41 <strcat[m]> yeah so for example this other account
03:34:47 <strcat[m]> 3 devices all active
03:35:00 <strcat[m]> but another case variant of the account with 3 devices that stopped updating last month
03:35:11 <strcat[m]> so I expect they forgot they used an uppercase char and made new account
03:35:18 <strcat[m]> I'm fine with just deleting the inactive one to deal with this
03:35:23 <strcat[m]> then doing case normalization from now on
03:35:34 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
03:35:39 <renlord> do you think it might be a good idea to post some statistics?
03:35:42 <renlord> on the landing page?
03:35:51 <renlord> just to show how much usage
03:40:11 <strcat[m]> ok 1 account left to deal with
03:40:18 <strcat[m]> then can do case normalization
03:41:50 <strcat[m]> yup another clear case where account became inactive
03:41:58 <strcat[m]> and there's a case variant that's active
03:42:00 <strcat[m]> deleting inactive
03:45:24 <renlord> i only have 1 device for my attestation account
03:45:29 <renlord> but what does it look like with multiple accounts
03:45:41 <renlord> is there a button for each device and all devices print on the same page?
03:45:55 <renlord> looking at the code, that's how its rendered i think
03:46:00 <renlord> strcat[m]:
03:48:59 <strcat[m]> yes
03:55:57 <strcat[m]> ok that's all dealt with
03:56:11 <strcat[m]> can implement case normalization now
03:58:06 <strcat[m]> could still let people set a preferred case
03:58:13 <strcat[m]> but allow logging in with any case
03:58:21 <nickcalyx[m]> <strcat[m] "renlord: what CDN will let me ho"> Github? Archive.org?  Other thought is bit torrent
03:58:46 <strcat[m]> can't host files on archive.org
03:58:52 <strcat[m]> github doesn't work either
03:58:56 <strcat[m]> it has 100MB file size limit
03:59:14 <nickcalyx[m]> Ah ok
03:59:35 <strcat[m]> I can just do DNS-based load balancing myself
03:59:38 <nickcalyx[m]> Calyx runs mirrors
03:59:55 <nickcalyx[m]> Such as tor.calyxinstitute.org
03:59:57 <strcat[m]> and then could do geodns to have regional mirrors but it's really not needed
04:00:02 <strcat[m]> the latency doesn't really matter
04:00:04 <strcat[m]> for releases
04:01:32 <strcat[m]> ok I'll have 2 columns perhaps
04:01:40 <strcat[m]> username and usernameNormalized
04:01:57 <strcat[m]> just add a new column, enforce that it's unique and use that one to login
04:02:03 <strcat[m]> and then won't lose people's preferred case
04:02:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: BTW check signal
04:02:28 <strcat[m]> okay in a bit
04:02:31 <strcat[m]> busy with multiple things
04:03:50 <strcat[m]> or hmm
04:03:56 <strcat[m]> I can just set a unique constraint with collate nocase
04:24:12 <nikitalita[m]> https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1281353123584327680
04:24:37 <nikitalita[m]> im just curious, how would you even do this type of thing without analytics and trackers
04:35:21 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/AttestationServer/commit/b8284160f2fe7c4ddc19e6b84f93ac51fdf95775
04:35:22 <strcat[m]> okay this works
04:35:25 <strcat[m]> and I did the migration
04:35:44 <nikitalita[m]> nice
04:35:55 <strcat[m]> so now I can login to my account strcat with Strcat or strCAT or whatever
04:36:02 <strcat[m]> and it prevents making a new account with a case variant of that
04:36:11 <strcat[m]> and it preserves the case the account was created with
04:36:36 <strcat[m]> so if I login with Strcat, still calls it strcat since that's how it was created
04:36:41 <strcat[m]> can let people change username at some point
04:36:49 <strcat[m]> not important atm
04:37:21 <strcat[m]> hopefully this reduces support issues
04:37:25 <strcat[m]> fewer ppl forgetting how to loginm
04:37:28 <strcat[m]>  * fewer ppl forgetting how to login

07:44:37 <cn3m[m]> my apologies
07:45:36 <erhcetua[m]> its fine
07:45:52 <kryptonymous[m]> no reason to apologize bud. You're trying. People who do this lead sad lives
07:46:05 <cn3m[m]> it is a direct attack on our community
07:46:27 <cn3m[m]> @c3nmfaggot:matrix.org is hilarious and definitely targeted
07:47:14 <cn3m[m]> I haven't banned anyone
07:47:18 <cn3m[m]> I was made a mod to fight this

07:48:38 <cn3m[m]> I ban everyone who spams
07:48:46 <kryptonymous[m]> good
07:48:51 <cn3m[m]> I was made moderator to counter this
07:49:05 <cn3m[m]> so it isn't revenge from me banning someone
07:49:36 <cn3m[m]> this is a direct attack on our community
07:49:53 <kryptonymous[m]> of course not. Dude, these posts are inhumane. Whether you're targeted or not should't matter. It's sick
07:49:55 <cn3m[m]> I am in many matrix rooms and haven't seen this elsewhere

07:50:16 <kryptonymous[m]> that's a shame

07:54:00 <cn3m[m]> mwkim: are you here for real or are you brigading?
07:55:37 <cn3m[m]> also anyone feel free to ping me if this comes up, but dm is definitely more effective

07:58:12 <renlord> whats going on
07:58:44 <renlord> i dont see it on the irc side
07:59:01 <renlord> maybe we should just stop using matrix
07:59:28 <kryptonymous[m]> another moron troll posting foul pics. wasn't up too long though
07:59:36 <cn3m[m]> renlord: tons of spam took my eye off for a moment
07:59:42 <cn3m[m]> sorry again to everyone who saw that

08:02:25 <renlord> yep, didnt come thru to the IRC side
08:04:04 <erhcetua[m]> if matrix registration forced using email, it would reduce trolls
08:04:36 <cn3m[m]> it does
08:04:37 <cn3m[m]> lol
08:06:07 <erhcetua[m]> mhh, well dunno then
08:08:05 <cn3m[m]> either way just use gmailinator you get past that easy
08:10:58 <renlord> why dont people just use irc?
08:11:55 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "why dont people just use irc?"> everyone is on Matrix and it has e2ee for messages
08:12:10 <cn3m[m]> it is the better platform, but immature
08:14:19 <theultron[m]> WTF! I just got my lunch. I though will see what's going on matrix and get see to gore.
08:16:00 <cn3m[m]> theultron: I am very sorry
08:16:29 <theultron[m]> You don't need to be. These trolls have no other work to do!

08:42:20 <kryptonymous[m]> InternetWithout"I.P": cn3m is trying his best. Best thing to do in the short run is "Ignore" them.
08:42:53 <cdesai> If matrix is set to invite only for a bit again people can still get in via irc
08:43:27 <very_sneaky> what's the state of pixel 4 support at the moment? i just did a search for 4a support in the logs and looks like strcat isn't happy with the current level of support for the pixel 4? the website indicates that production support is available - indicating not experimental, is this not the case?
08:43:40 <very_sneaky> or are there just very few devs with the 4

14:56:34 <alzxjm[m]> brockin042: Any updates about MMS on Fi?
15:01:52 <Knull[m]> is Fi actually ok to use?
15:03:08 <alzxjm[m]> Knull: I like it. It's Googley though.
15:03:24 <alzxjm[m]> Great security. Immune to SIM swapping (at least as immune as a Google account).
15:04:43 <Knull[m]> Googley is what I'm afraid of. That's why I'm on graphene. How so do you mean, though?
15:06:23 <alzxjm[m]> The on-topic part of the Google Fi discussion is that it doesn't (AFAIK) completely work on GrapheneOS. MMS messages cannot be received and visual voicemail doesn't work. Calls, SMS, and data all work. I'm interested in finding out if anyone can get MMS working on Graphene (say by messing with APN settings - which I tried and couldn't solve).
15:06:49 <alzxjm[m]> I run Google Fi on CalyxOS. That's not on-topic but I'm happy to chat about it in the CalyxOS room or the offtopic room.
15:08:45 <crixtnn[m]> it would be great if Daniel could setup some sort of store where one could buy grapheneos pixels. i bet a lot of people would gladly pay a premium knowing it goes to supporting the project rather then filling the pockets of opportunistic parasites like the one before.
15:09:36 <d3s7nth[m]> > opportunistic parasites
15:09:36 <d3s7nth[m]> Yikes
15:15:56 <Knull[m]> well I'm concerned for the privacy of using Fi. but I was unaware of that, thx
15:28:48 <tim_> Please spread the subreddit r/SpenderWasRight
15:28:57 <tim_> Thanks for your attention
16:02:11 <Joeri[m]> I am not sure whether there will ever be a confirmation for every app. but most apps which require Google mobile services work fine (if not perfectly) without them. I suggest you look at it on an app by app basis.
16:02:53 <Joeri[m]> you might also be interested in different roms which offer a hard level of security but do allow MicroG, the Google mobile services alternative, to be installed.
16:05:29 <Joeri[m]> also I don't think installing Google mobile services would keep enough of the security you wish for. you're handing all the trust to Google, I would go as far as saying that that hurts your security more than installing a custom rom could increase security.
16:05:32 <firefightingphys> > > <@crixtnn:matrix.org> it would be great if Daniel could setup some sort of store where one could buy grapheneos pixels. i bet a lot of people would gladly pay a premium knowing it goes to supporting the project rather then filling the pockets of opportunistic parasites like the one before.
16:05:32 <firefightingphys> > While the idea is nice, it wouldn't be feasible. Dealing with orders, returns, problems, troubleshooting etc.
16:05:32 <firefightingphys> That is what /e/ is doing though. You can buy a smartphone with /e/ installed already
16:08:38 <crixtnn[m]> a-1_2 You can get playstore apps anonymously and keep them updates with Aurora store from fdroid. WhatsApp works perfectly. Banking usually do work if not you could use the website. google maps works in browser as a PWA decently. tried ms word and worked as well. if you are interested in privacy there are better options for each of these available.
16:10:45 <jaxson[m]> The only problem with whatsapp is that notifications sometimes arrive late all at the same time.
16:11:06 <firefightingphys> Ask your bank if they cover fraud you if you installed the banking app using Aurora. Mine does

16:14:57 <firefightingphys> > How come? I can ask no a problem, tbh I can shift Banking off to my iPad if needed
16:14:57 <firefightingphys> Well my bank covers fraud if you use their app if the app was not obtained from a "dubious" source. They considered Aurora "not dubious" and said that it would be covered
16:16:20 <jaxson[m]> You can always use bank account in browser
16:17:50 <jaxson[m]> Maybe it's safer using the app
16:26:02 <nikitalita[m]> :o
16:55:22 <Biv[m]> whatcha guys think about kiwi browser
16:55:37 <Biv[m]> now that its open
17:19:55 <erhcetua[m]> use vanadium
17:29:08 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <erhcetua[m] "use vanadium"> What about adding extension support to Vanadium, or nah?
17:32:39 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <Biv[m] "whatcha guys think about kiwi br"> Well, I would love if they added Kiwi Browser to F-Droid, the only thing I can see is Kiwix
17:42:19 <refragable[m]> extension support for Vanadium doesn't seem to be likely https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200602#c4036919
17:49:52 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <Vicarious[m] "Bromite "> I like that too, and I use it as my default browser
17:54:39 <ghostcat[m]> <refragable[m] "extension support for Vanadium d"> Doesn't need it if you use a system wide ad block. Private DNS.
17:55:09 <refragable[m]> I know, but the topic was extension support
17:57:00 <ghostcat[m]> <refragable[m] "I know, but the topic was extens"> I understand the topic but you do know extensions make yourself more browser fingerprint able right?
17:57:24 <refragable[m]> Yes, please don't explain it. I read Daniels reasons and the web browsing section on the site
17:57:49 <refragable[m]> The ad blocking thing was incidental to the statement regarding the possibility of extension support
17:58:26 <cn3m[m]> features from extensions would be better off built into the browser like Bromite handles it(but better)
17:59:17 <ghostcat[m]> Built in Vanadium would be best if I am understanding cn3m here.
17:59:36 <ghostcat[m]> * Built in extensions Vanadium would be best if I am understanding cn3m here.
18:00:09 <cn3m[m]> if you incorporated the features in yes ^
18:00:18 <cn3m[m]> as a reasonable patchset
18:00:20 <cn3m[m]> which Bromite does
18:01:06 <ghostcat[m]> Couldn't we argue the official Tor browser also does this?
18:01:26 <cn3m[m]> I use and recommend Vanadium
18:01:43 <cn3m[m]> <ghostcat[m] "Couldn't we argue the official T"> not really those are real extensions
18:01:50 <cn3m[m]> Bromite and kinda Safari though
18:03:31 <alzxjm[m]> Vicarious: Use a custom dns. `dns.adguard.com`
18:04:22 <ghostcat[m]> <cn3m[m] "not really those are real extens"> Elaborate if you will cause I was under the impression that they were built in? How can you tell the difference from built in to non built in?

19:34:54 <erhcetua[m]> element android is ass tbh

19:39:40 <erhcetua[m]> besides gitlab's project no
19:55:43 <albedoirl[m]> <persistentpixel[m] "Seems really poor"> I agree the battery life is pretty bad, but it beats google/Microsoft/apple knowing you better than you know yourself
19:58:08 <cn3m[m]> from a technical perspective that is more Facebook that knows you best. But I digress offtopci
19:59:29 <albedoirl[m]> They all know you just as well only from different directions. YouTube watch history says a lot about a person.
21:04:14 <Knull[m]> <albedoirl[m] "They all know you just as well o"> I could see how that may be true on an individual basis, but in sheer metrics, might not be as measurable
21:05:01 <Knull[m]> Amazon is probably a little scarier
21:05:30 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m] "Does graheneOS have any long-ter"> fallbacks, but they are that effective
21:05:58 <cn3m[m]> hopefully more people will degoogle and the experience will improve
21:06:34 <cn3m[m]> Google, Huawei, and Amazon have all cut off into their own corner
21:06:34 <cn3m[m]> a universal solution may eventually be preferable
21:09:07 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m] "So basically is there no way to "> signature spoofing is not inherently the issue
21:09:11 <cn3m[m]> microg is a mess
21:09:54 <cn3m[m]> Do you really want messages being piped through google servers for notifications and such?
21:10:40 <cn3m[m]> iOS does this in a sane way with e2ee if Google copied that maybe a less bloated microg could make some sense(idk). Though it not super stable and not very privacy friendly right now
21:11:07 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m] "Doesnt signature spoofing signif"> yes, but it can be done properly
21:11:22 <cn3m[m]> you can stub out fallbacks for google play
21:11:23 <cn3m[m]> and sig spoof them only
21:11:28 <cn3m[m]> if they are really simple it will be pretty safe
21:11:39 <cn3m[m]> it will make the app think Play Services are there just offline
21:15:27 <cn3m[m]> the fallback is on GitHub issues
21:15:39 <cn3m[m]> not even that hard to do
21:16:05 <cn3m[m]> you just make an app that is signature spoofed to look like play services and tell apps there is no internet
21:16:21 <cn3m[m]> good first issue maybe(correct me if I am wrong smarter people)
21:38:21 <erhcetua[m]> yeah it should

22:29:39 <aeonsolution[m]> Hi everyone, are the any people new comers or first-time callers(long time supporters) of GrapheneOS that have Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, and/or Pixel 3a XL that would like to help me (a device maintainer) test kernel patches for the Android 11 kernel on you phones!?
22:34:02 <aeonsolution[m]> nice, well i can help you get started on building the development version today
22:34:21 <aeonsolution[m]> are you interested in trying to build GrapheneOS's development branch
22:35:32 <aeonsolution[m]> I'd be happy to walk you through the process 😎
22:36:07 <aeonsolution[m]> the hard requirement is a Linux distro and patience
22:36:29 <aeonsolution[m]> and these dependencies <https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies>
22:37:38 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] Hi everyone, are the any people new comers or first-time callers(long time supporters) of GrapheneOS that have Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, and/or Pixel 3a XL that would like to help me (a device maintainer) test kernel patches for the Android 11 kernel on your phones!?
22:45:02 <aeonsolution[m]> you can use the built-in backup system SeedVault
22:45:15 <aeonsolution[m]> you can try the logs or maybe someone else can add their 2 cents
22:47:15 <refragable[m]> You need an USB drive or to make a local backup and then transfer it to your pc. Seedvault currently only backs up apps and not your data (downloads, pictures, etc). Some apps don't allow backups (like Signal) so you'd have to check if those sorts of apps have their own backup mechanisms (Signal does have its own backup method).
22:47:53 <refragable[m]> Seedvault also supports using a Nextcloud account to do cloud backups
22:48:30 <refragable[m]> There's some more info at https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android
22:53:47 <aeonsolution[m]> This is a super simplification so please bear with me. Vanadium is hardened browser and webview based on Chromium. It doesn't include any of Google's proprietary features.
22:54:34 <aeonsolution[m]> Here is more information if you're interested: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
22:56:03 <aeonsolution[m]> I would really encourage you and everyone that asks about degoogled applications to ask more specific questions. Degoogle is very, very broad.
22:56:28 <aeonsolution[m]>  * I would really encourage you and everyone that asks about degoogled applications to ask more specific questions. [correction] Asking if something is degoogled is very, very broad.
22:58:11 <aeonsolution[m]> Phoning what home?
22:58:27 <aeonsolution[m]> Here is the project <https://www.chromium.org/Home>
22:59:37 <aeonsolution[m]> Here is the project <https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium> and here are the patches <https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/tree/10/patches>
23:02:58 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] This is a super simplification so please bear with me. Vanadium is hardened browser and webview based on Chromium. It doesn't include any of Google Chrome's proprietary features.
23:07:02 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium has no telemetry and gets updates with the system
23:07:04 <cn3m[m]> it can be slightly out of date, but it is more secure
23:07:17 <cn3m[m]> this will be fixed at some point completely
23:07:37 <aeonsolution[m]> the project updates the version of Vanadium faster than Chromium as prebuilts and can be built from scratch as well when the new release is pushed
23:07:59 <aeonsolution[m]> also i second everything cn3m says 😉
23:10:33 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] the project updates the version of Vanadium as fast as Chromium's release generally. When it is updated, GrapheneOS puts the prebuilts up on Github but if you want it faster you can be build it from scratch as well when the new release is pushed on <https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/releases?platform=Android>
23:11:31 <aeonsolution[m]> please ignore the initial statement, it was incomplete and had some incorrect info-the correction clears it all up
23:12:37 <aeonsolution[m]> and ontop of that like cn3m said you can wait for Vanadium to get updated when a new release of GrapheneOS is made available
23:13:11 <aeonsolution[m]> via the system update
23:14:37 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat spoke about it too this week, it should be in the logs if you're curious
23:15:53 <aeonsolution[m]> analtenderloin: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/issues
23:22:45 <refragable[m]> analtenderloin: if you're want the latest Vanadium build, you can always download and install the prebuilts manually https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_external_vanadium/tree/10/prebuilt/arm64
23:23:05 <refragable[m]> You install the TrichromeLibrary.apk first and then the other two in any order
23:23:20 <refragable[m]> those are the same apks that are bundled into the OS
