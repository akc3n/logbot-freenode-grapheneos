01:34:05 <aeonsolution[m]> <chimeyy[m] "I'm getting the 4a soon and woul"> Hi chimeyy, thank you for showing interest in all those areas and GrapheneOS. IMO you should pick 1 area that interests you the most and start with that. Its takes awhile to be productive and your mileage will vary depending on what experience you are bringing in. Right now, the priority of GrapheneOS is to migrate to Android 11 so the devs will most likely not be
01:34:05 <aeonsolution[m]> available to help you out.
01:34:11 <aeonsolution[m]> If you want AOSP information overload, then you can jump to https://source.android.com/setup
01:34:18 <aeonsolution[m]> If you want to build GrapheneOS, then you can try your luck at https://grapheneos.org/build
01:34:30 <aeonsolution[m]> If you want to build apps that work on GrapheneOS then you need to build Android apps that don't require Google Play Services. Here is the project's development guidelines. https://grapheneos.org/build#development-guidelines
01:35:40 <aeonsolution[m]> chimeyy: All the information you need to get started is on https://grapheneos.org/. You just need to jump in.
01:47:31 <fomijafi[m]> How does screenshotting work in android 11? I see stock should have a button in the recent apps menu but not here in GOS

02:07:38 <joemaloney864[m]> Very swag
02:08:36 <cn3m[m]> joemaloney864: it is worth noting to get FSF certified Parabola(iirc) has to not ship microcode updates which is a security hazard
02:08:42 <cn3m[m]> I would recommend something sane like Arch
02:08:44 <cn3m[m]> or Fedora
02:09:35 <joemaloney864[m]> When you can show me a real world attack because of that, I shall
02:09:46 <joemaloney864[m]> Otherwise no, I don't use proprietary software
02:11:59 <cn3m[m]> <joemaloney864[m] "Otherwise no, I don't use propri"> ironic since you are running proprietary software, but specifically out of date proprietary software. You have microcode on your system, but you are just running an ancient version
02:12:40 <joemaloney864[m]> I'm not
02:12:46 <joemaloney864[m]> I'm using Libreboot m'dude

02:14:01 <cn3m[m]> joemaloney864: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16751363 you're wrong, but okay
02:14:21 <cn3m[m]> Intel CPUs ship with microcode(which is proprietary)
02:14:33 <cn3m[m]> libreboot specifies they don't ship updates
02:15:07 <joemaloney864[m]> Okay let me rephrase
02:15:18 <joemaloney864[m]> I don't use proprietary software if I don't have to
02:15:46 <cn3m[m]> okay apparently fixing a whole family of vulnerabilities is in the don't have to camp
02:15:56 <joemaloney864[m]> Yes.

02:17:00 <joemaloney864[m]> Much easier ways to attack someone than through their CPU

02:23:20 <joemaloney864[m]> Lol sure if you want to put it that way, even though I have already said I am not using proprietary software unless I had no choice
02:23:32 <joemaloney864[m]> Which in that case I guess I don't have a choice
02:23:52 <renlord> the issue atm is that you're running out-of-date proprietary software
02:24:11 <joemaloney864[m]> Please read my previous message lmao
02:24:16 <renlord> and for some odd reason, you're refusing to update it out of some odd principle
02:24:40 <renlord> as cn3m[m] pointed out, you dont have a choice but to run proprietary software, so you have an obligation to update.
02:25:01 <joemaloney864[m]> Lmao that's not how it works

09:19:38 <lickidysplit-pti> Hmmm, try select your carrier manually?
09:34:45 <BlackWinnerYoshi> I just noticed that this GrapheneOS beta update deleted some of my apps. Not sure which ones exactly, but it definely removed certain Simple Mobile Tools apps. Although, these weren't that important to me, so oh well. I still want to warn other people about this, and I recommend backing up your data before a beta update, in case it deletes something important
09:35:11 <cn3m[m]> Black Winner Yoshi (privacytools.io): did you get them from F-Droid?
09:39:28 <strcat[m]> Black Winner Yoshi (privacytools.io): the beta does not delete apps
09:39:47 <strcat[m]> the only thing that could happen is an app incorrectly marking itself as having a max API level of 29
09:40:02 <strcat[m]> and it's considered incorrect / very bad practice to ever set a max API level like that
09:40:18 <strcat[m]> so that is not an issue with the upgrade but rather the app if the developer made that huge mistake
09:40:44 <strcat[m]> we're going to be pushing it out to stable once the APN configuration is added back and SetupWizard is compatible
09:40:54 <strcat[m]> and it will be necessary for people to upgrade to continue receiving security updates
09:41:33 <strcat[m]> bugs in apps such as the developers wrongly marking them as incompatible with Android 11 (which is very explicitly called out as a very bad practice - you're never supposed to set max API level) is not a good reason to not upgrade
09:42:24 <cn3m[m]> strcat: couldn't it also be if it is v1 signing and the API is set to (30 iirc)
09:42:40 <cn3m[m]> or is that only new installs?
09:42:52 <cn3m[m]> I thought that was deleting apps too
09:43:27 <strcat[m]> F-Droid is still signing apps with v1?
09:43:52 <strcat[m]> then if they've wrongly built apps with targetSdkVersion v30 while using the obsolete and less secure v1 signing perhaps that would apply
09:44:08 <strcat[m]> we regularly warn against the issues with F-Droid
09:44:11 <strcat[m]> not a problem with our new release
09:44:19 <strcat[m]> not something that will change when it goes to stable
09:44:20 <propertype[m]> <lickidysplit-pti "Hmmm, try select your carrier ma"> Nope doesnt work either
09:44:40 <strcat[m]> there is an issue on the bug tracker about the APN configurations needing to be migrated to Android 11
09:44:52 <strcat[m]> that's currently one of the 2 release blockers but if it isn't worked on the release will proceed anyway
09:45:03 <strcat[m]> since most devices don't have maintainers and we can't hold up a release for work that no one is doing
09:45:24 <strcat[m]> carrier compatibility for devices without maintainers is a best effort thing
09:45:40 <strcat[m]> if no one steps up to work on it we just won't ship those updated APN configurations anymore
09:46:12 <strcat[m]> there are a couple days left to work on it
09:47:18 <strcat[m]> similarly it would be nice to get the SetupWizard ported and that's currently a release blocker but in a couple days we'll release without it
09:47:35 <strcat[m]> and note that's how the UI for restoring backups is provided
09:49:12 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "then if they've wrongly built ap"> yes that is what they are doing several apps had this issue
09:49:33 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid is still using v1 and SHA-1, but they are fixing both soon last I heard
09:50:01 <strcat> yeah so that's a serious issue for F-Droid compatibility with Android 10 if they're wrongly marking apps as targetSdkVersion 30 and signature v1
09:50:08 <strcat> I'd recommend switching away from F-Droid ASAP
09:50:23 <strcat> they've had years to address this security issue, now the OS is finally phasing it out for the new API level
09:50:53 <strcat> we won't be halting releases and security updates due to an F-Droid bug caused by years of neglect and lack of focus on security
09:51:07 <strcat> use Aurora Store and various serious alternatives to the Play Store
09:52:20 <cn3m[m]> Aurora Store I heard had a fallback issue to v1, but I believe that fallback doesn't happen on Android 11. I have yet to test it
09:52:35 <cn3m[m]> anu showed me the apksigner iirc
09:52:40 <strcat> cn3m[m]: I don't see how it could be an issue with the Play Store
09:52:59 <strcat> because you can't upload app updates or new apps without updating signature format + targetSdkVersion
09:53:08 <cn3m[m]> well the apk for the store itself iirc
09:53:28 <cn3m[m]> I should check
09:53:35 <cn3m[m]> or maybe the target is lower
09:53:43 <strcat> doubt it unless you mean the one from F-Droid
09:53:44 <cn3m[m]> but yeah Aurora Store should be fine
09:53:50 <strcat> and that's not their fault
09:54:04 <cn3m[m]> strcat: I think anu said it was from github
09:54:06 <strcat> it's F-Droid downgrading the security of apps and making them incompatible with Android 11 if they were updated for it
09:54:10 <cn3m[m]> I have the tools on my machine let me check
09:54:11 <strcat> not the app devs themselves
09:54:22 <strcat> you've gotten signature v2+ from any tools from the past 4+ years
09:54:33 <strcat> how are they even building / signing apps that they get v1
09:54:41 <cn3m[m]> it has v2 and v3 signatures
09:54:47 <cn3m[m]> but I think v1 is still a fallback
09:54:49 <strcat> do they build on ubuntu 5.04?
09:54:55 <cn3m[m]> and there was an issue causing it to fallback
09:55:04 <cn3m[m]> idk let me check again
09:55:21 <cn3m[m]> I was almost certain anu said github
09:56:58 <alzxjm[m]> If I uninstall an F-Droid-sourced app and reinstall with the Gitub or Aurora release (different signing keys) will the installer use the Seedvault backup for that app?
09:57:23 <strcat> no, backups are specific to app signing keys
09:57:34 <cn3m[m]> strcat: iirc there is nothing stopping you from building with v1, v2, and v3
09:57:45 <cn3m[m]> but yeah not 100% sure why it would fail and fallback
09:57:46 <strcat> it would be a security issue if it installed app data from an app signed with one key for an app signed with another key
09:57:48 <strcat> they are different apps
09:58:01 <alzxjm[m]> Makes sense. Thanks!
10:51:00 <kopolee11[m]> <strcat "I'd recommend switching away fro"> Would some of these issues be mitigated if one didn't use the F-Droid repository, but still used the client for other repositories? (Such as Bromite)
10:57:41 <engulf[m]> <strcat "yeah so that's a serious issue f"> This seems to be resolved

11:02:45 <Haegii> hello togetheryesterday i installed the new beta update and i'm now on RP1A.200720.009.2020.09.18.13 (beta channel)since the update i lost many functionalities, the most important one beeing NetGuard, which got removed from my phone complete and i'm not able to install it via F-Droid.is it possible to rollback to an older beta version (or even the
11:02:46 <Haegii> stable channel) without wiping my phone?
11:04:53 <engulf[m]> No, you have to wait for new build for NetGuard or install it via AuroraStore
11:05:37 * engulf[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/PCGsATwmANBirJnhjmpFWHzT/message.txt >
11:06:29 <engulf[m]> You can follow the issue here https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/issues/827
11:13:45 <strcat[m]> Haegii: this is a security issue with F-Droid that has been a problem for a long time
11:13:49 <strcat[m]> recommend getting your apps from a better source
11:14:36 <strcat[m]> also, F-Droid didn't address that they had apps with targetSdkVersion 30 despite having a security problem no longer allowed with targetSdkVersion 30 and above
11:14:41 <strcat[m]> this is not a problem with the apps
11:14:46 <strcat[m]> it is a problem with F-Droid's build of the apps
11:14:56 <strcat[m]> the OS is working as intended and forbidding signature v1 for targetSdkVersion 30+
11:15:11 <strcat[m]> the Android SDK doesn't even allow you to do that, since it's wrong
11:15:16 <strcat[m]> they're doing their own thing with legacy tools
11:15:38 <strcat[m]> this has been a problem for 4+ years
11:15:52 <strcat[m]> but targetSdkVersion 30 finally drops v1 signature support
11:16:07 <cn3m[m]> not even sure what you would use netguard for. It is best to use the built in firewall or privatedns for blocking in almost all cases
11:17:06 <strcat[m]> https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/2162
11:18:26 <strcat[m]> but yeah was probably a bad idea to procrastinate this security update for 4+ years until it became mandatory for apps targeting current API level
11:19:16 <strcat[m]> v2 signatures were introduced in Android 7+ and are a security improvement
11:19:36 <strcat[m]> addressing that Java-style JAR signatures do not sign the entire zip
11:19:37 <strcat[m]> and leave room for potential exploitation / trickery
11:19:52 <Haegii> thanks for the quick response.
11:19:56 <strcat[m]> since there are unsigned parts of the zip structure / contents (nothing that apks use themselves... but that's not good)
11:20:01 <strcat[m]> so in 2016
11:20:04 <strcat[m]> v2 signatures were launched
11:20:17 <strcat[m]> F-Droid did not migrate for their app builds until recently despite it being a security update
11:20:28 <strcat[m]> targetSdkVersion dropped v1 support for apps targeting the new API level (30+)
11:20:50 <strcat[m]> i.e. apps got over 4 years to migrate (it was available in the SDK and developer previews before Android 7 launch in 2016)
11:21:07 <strcat[m]> and even now, apps not targeting targetSdkVersion 30+ are still supported with v1
11:21:42 <strcat[m]> and apps get until around November 2021 to move to API 30+ (Play Store enforces a minimum API level - F-Droid does not and has a lot of apps not targeting modern API levels)
11:21:48 <strcat[m]> (which is a privacy and security problem)

11:51:36 <Creigh[m]> <strcat[m] "recommend getting your apps from"> Would you argue F-Droid is not a good source at all? Any recommendations? How about apps that are different on F-Droid, e.g. Telegram FOSS that doesn't use Google's API for push notificiations?
11:52:11 <strcat[m]> well seems like a pretty big problem that F-Droid delayed a signature security update for 4 years and caused users to lose their data for apps they shipped as targetSdkVersion 30 with the old signature
11:52:35 <strcat[m]> and seems like a big problem that they are fine with shipping unmaintained, insecure apps with known vulnerabilities / no maintainer to fix anything
11:52:54 <strcat[m]> also no standards for API level (even the Play Store requires API 28+) or other things
11:53:00 <strcat[m]>  * also no standards for API level (even the Play Store requires API 28+) or other things like that
11:53:11 <strcat[m]> you can decide for yourself what to use to obtain apps
11:54:12 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS will eventually include an app update system for a first party app repository but that won't be intended to provide a bunch of apps
11:54:49 <strcat[m]> we don't have an official recommendation and this is one of several reasons that we cannot recommend F-Droid
11:54:59 <strcat[m]> we've talked about this specific problem for multiple years and now users lost data because of it
11:55:01 <strcat[m]> that's on them
11:55:05 <strcat[m]> entirely
11:55:25 <renlord[m]> i personally just use apkmirror these days
11:55:26 <strcat[m]> can't blame Android 11 for forbidding insecure signatures for API 30+ when the official tools do not even allow making those broken apks
11:55:33 <strcat[m]> and have used v2+ for over 4 years
11:55:43 <strcat[m]> an app built with current SDK in August 2016
11:55:46 <strcat[m]> used v2 signature
11:55:48 <strcat[m]> it's 2020 btw
11:55:57 <strcat[m]> apply the 2016 security updates already?
11:55:58 <strcat[m]> shrug
11:56:58 <strcat[m]> I think it's a nice little demonstration of the neglect / negligence you get with F-Droid
11:57:05 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean I am going to suggest using something else
11:57:11 <strcat[m]> but you should be aware of what you get with F-Droid
11:57:21 <strcat[m]> and you can assume that they have similar issues elsewhere in their code and how they build apps
11:57:28 <strcat[m]> and similar neglect in securing their servers, keys, etc.
11:57:36 <strcat[m]> it's not an isolated thing
11:58:24 <strcat[m]> we used to bundle the F-Droid privileged extension (before this project was called GrapheneOS) and it uncovered many F-Droid bugs and was heavily neglected since it isn't the main way people use F-Droid
11:58:27 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid is too overconfident in their source and reproducibility. There is so much more to this
11:58:44 <strcat[m]> some people probably remember having F-Droid chain reinstalling apps and having their apps force closed each time
11:59:06 <strcat[m]> it can't be trusted with the ability to do background installations of apps even just because there are serious usability issues caused by their bugs if you allow that
11:59:14 <strcat[m]> and I mean consider it from a security perspective
11:59:37 <strcat[m]> if they aren't going to fix an issue with chain reinstalling apps for years that causes serious usability issues
11:59:56 <strcat[m]> the only reason it doesn't have much of an impact without the privileged extension is because it has no permission to do that in the background
12:00:06 <strcat[m]> so at most it just makes a notification saying it failed to do it
12:00:33 <strcat[m]> anyway lots of apps are total garbage, including open source ones, and they often have lots of privacy and security issues
12:00:46 <strcat[m]> open source absolutely doesn't imply that you get better privacy and security
12:00:46 <Creigh[m]> When I started using F-Droid I trusted it as a curated repository but then, everytime there was an update, I had to check out the release notes of the updated software and honestly I still don't understand how this security issue caused data loss for users. When initially reading about F-Droid, I also tried to understand why Signal isn't distributed via F-Droid. It's just so hard. The spirit of F-Droid is so good
12:00:46 <Creigh[m]> acutally.
12:01:14 <cn3m[m]> Signal 100% is right for not being on F-Droid
12:01:46 <kopolee11[m]> I asked this earlier, but bumping for visibility.
12:01:47 <strcat[m]> Creigh: it caused data loss because they shipped apps with API level 30+ (i.e. targeting Android 11+ and declaring compatibility with the backwards incompatible changes including privacy/security changes) with v1 signatures which is forbidden (v1 signatures are deprecated since 2016)
12:01:47 <kopolee11[m]> Would some of these issues be mitigated if one didn't use the F-Droid repository, but still used the client for other repositories? (Such as Bromite)
12:02:02 <strcat[m]> kopolee11: yes, some of them
12:02:13 <renlord> best way to guarantee reproducibility is to not change anything (incl. security updates) :upside_down_face:
12:02:14 <strcat[m]> kopolee11: including this issue, which was only an issue for F-Droid's own repository
12:02:15 <kopolee11[m]> Thanks!
12:02:21 <strcat[m]> other people building / signing apps in a saner way never had this issue
12:02:24 <Creigh[m]> <strcat[m] "Creigh: it caused data loss beca"> So incompatible apps corrupted the data themselves?
12:02:32 <strcat[m]> Creigh: no data was corrupted
12:02:39 <strcat[m]> the apks provided by F-Droid for those apps are invalid
12:03:00 <strcat[m]> so after upgrading to Android 11, where targetSdkVersion 30 is implemented
12:03:07 <strcat[m]> they are treated as invalid app installations
12:03:07 <cn3m[m]> they had so much advanced warning
12:03:08 <d32d23dd23d23d> anyone had this issue where building the kernel stops at LTO vmlinux.o
12:03:10 <d32d23dd23d23d> ?
12:03:16 <strcat[m]> d32d23dd23d23d: it's not stopping
12:03:25 <strcat[m]> it just takes a long time to link the kernel with LTO
12:03:30 <cn3m[m]> but F-Droid didn't deal with it 4 years ago, and they didn't deal with it 3/4 months ago
12:03:33 <strcat[m]> which is required for CFI
12:03:35 <strcat[m]> it takes most of the time
12:03:35 <mrxx_0[m]> It's very long
12:03:35 <d32d23dd23d23d> it exits with an error really
12:03:39 <strcat[m]> it requires a lot of memory too
12:03:42 <strcat[m]> 32GB or something
12:03:44 <d32d23dd23d23d> make error
12:03:46 <strcat[m]> d32d23dd23d23d: not enough memory
12:03:49 <d32d23dd23d23d> got 32 gig of ram
12:03:49 <mrxx_0[m]> Needs a lot of ram if I remember
12:03:52 <strcat[m]> you need 38GB+ of memory to link Linux with LTO
12:03:55 <d32d23dd23d23d> virtual machine
12:03:59 <strcat[m]> d32d23dd23d23d: make a 32GB swapfile
12:04:03 <strcat[m]> d32d23dd23d23d: turn on full overcommit too
12:04:04 <d32d23dd23d23d> ok thanks
12:04:08 <strcat[m]> instead of heuristic overcommit
12:04:15 <d32d23dd23d23d> good info, thank you
12:04:18 <strcat[m]> 32GB is more than enough with a swapfile
12:04:25 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really use > 32GB at the same time
12:04:28 <strcat[m]> but it needs > 32GB total
12:04:45 <strcat[m]> 16GB is not really enough (you'd be swapping like crazy)
12:05:14 <strcat[m]> linux kernel is MASSIVE so linking it with LTO (required for CFI, an important security feature) is very demanding - takes a lot of time and memory
12:05:22 <strcat[m]> usually people aren't using LTO/CFI with the Linux kernel
12:05:28 <strcat[m]> so the linking step is not demanding at all
12:05:49 <strcat[m]> standard Android kernels use CFI though (many vendors don't use it / turn it off but I mean AOSP)
12:06:25 <strcat[m]> it would help if the Atheros driver got replaced since that thing is ridiculously large
12:06:31 <d32d23dd23d23d> i'm just trying to build for pixel 3a, no idea about linux kernels really
12:07:00 <d32d23dd23d23d> just stunned by how big the source is
12:07:06 <strcat[m]> btw both grapheneos.org and releases.grapheneos.org were recently moved to new servers so let me know if there are any issues
12:07:33 <strcat[m]> d32d23dd23d23d:  keep in mind you have the whole history from the start of AOSP along with half the repositories just being for development
12:07:56 <strcat[m]> d32d23dd23d23d: you have sources for the whole Android SDK, all the different SDK packages, the emulator, the whole massive Compatibility Test Suite and so on
12:08:16 <strcat[m]> you only actually use a fraction of the source tree simply building the OS for a device
12:08:31 <d32d23dd23d23d> how do i use the emulator?
12:08:34 <d32d23dd23d23d> android studio?
12:08:41 <strcat[m]> d32d23dd23d23d: it's included in the source tree
12:08:57 <strcat[m]> if you build for the emulator target you can simply run `emulator` in the shell where you have the build environment set up
12:09:00 <strcat[m]> and it will launch it with your build
12:09:06 <d32d23dd23d23d> nice
12:09:24 <strcat[m]> you could also use images in the emulator that comes with the SDK which is a newer release of it from the SDK branch
12:09:38 <strcat[m]> but generally for development / testing you'd just use the emulator in the source tree
12:10:01 <d32d23dd23d23d> ok so im adding 32 gigs of swap now
12:10:29 <strcat[m]> d32d23dd23d23d: I'd just use a swapfile for simplicity
12:11:22 <Creigh[m]> Is there any info regarding prerequisites to becoming a device maintainer? Been looking on Reddit and grapheneos.org but I feel like I don't know where to look. I'm developing desktop applications for Windows professionally and am only a hobbyist Linux scripter and user and have 0 experience in Android development. How realistic is using Graphene OS as a learning platform?
12:22:23 <strcat> Creigh[m]: device maintenance is a very broad thing
12:22:28 <strcat> it can be done by a team of people though
12:22:32 <strcat> doesn't all need to be 1 person per device
12:22:49 <strcat> you'll just need to jump in and get started on learning if you're interested
12:30:47 <Creigh[m]> <strcat "you'll just need to jump in and "> The reason I'm asking _now_ is that I lost my beloved Pixel 3a last Friday and since the 4a is around the corner thought I'd check out the situation on that device. Turns out there's no maintainers. :( But I wouldn't know where to jump in. I guess if I bought a 4a, I couldn't use it as a daily driver since I regularly install unstable releases on it? Meaning if I'd like to be
12:30:47 <Creigh[m]> a maintainer and use Graphene as a daily driver I'd need at least two devices, right?
12:34:20 <renlord> Creigh[m]: why jump in straight into device maintenance?
12:34:37 <renlord> could always start with features with emulator, then eventually move into device maintenance
12:34:42 <renlord> as you develop familiarity
12:34:57 <renlord> also a low-barrier way to see if its your cup of tea
12:35:32 <renlord> many things on the issues list can be worked on using just the emulator
12:39:00 <Creigh[m]> <renlord "Creigh: why jump in straight int"> As I said, I have _zero_ experience regarding Android and just didn't think about that step in between. However, if I'd be interested in supporting the Pixel 4a specifically, would you say that's too much as a first step? Would you rather start with issues for supported devices?

13:36:28 <zyxt128[m]> Let's say I want to create a kid's friendly ROM (like blocking porn sites or any other non-kid's friendly site). My initial idea was to run a rule in order to block them in the main.cpp of the netd service (and also disable the ability to set rules). Do you believe that there is a better alternative? I don't want the kids to be able to mess with the firewall at all.
13:38:12 <Creigh[m]> zyxt128: wouldn't you just achieve that by creating a separate user account with less privileges that you'd configure from an admin account?
13:40:15 <zyxt128[m]> Creigh: yeah but with a user account with less preivileges, how can I block the access to specific sites? I want to allow them to use a browser

17:14:04 <Autopsy[m]> What a tit.
17:19:21 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <Autopsy[m] "What a tit. "> What means tit?
17:21:12 <strcat[m]> Autopsy: they're just going to have their devices bricked / data lost
17:21:14 <strcat[m]> it's not GrapheneOS
17:21:55 <strcat[m]> taking our releases and replacing the boot image with something incompatible and not considered as part of our development / builds is not GrapheneOS and not going to turn out well
17:22:14 <strcat[m]> if people want to modify it they really need to do their own builds
17:22:25 <strcat[m]> like, what keys is this supposed to be signed with, since they don't have ours?
17:22:43 <strcat[m]> how are delta updates supposed to work?
17:24:32 <strcat[m]> may partially explain the load on the update server because updates will repeatedly fail and be redownloaded
17:24:46 <strcat[m]> for weeks, until the next major release where it isn't trying to use a delta
17:25:31 <jpds> (To be fair, when my phone had the cancelled version, it did constantly go and download the newer one over and over again)
17:26:11 <jpds> And the update client gives the user no way to prevent a upgrade download
17:26:25 <Lia[m]> Disabling the updater app helps
17:26:45 <strcat[m]> jpds: that was a Beta release
17:27:04 <strcat[m]> jpds: and the way to disable updates is given in the usage guide
17:27:26 <strcat[m]> it's not recommended and so we don't make a special toggle to make it encouraged vs. disabling the Updater
17:30:50 <Autopsy[m]> <shdudbdjdj[m] "What means tit?"> Boob
17:31:25 <Autopsy[m]> strcat I know. It's bonkers tbh.
17:41:05 <strcat> so
17:41:08 <strcat> for builds from source
17:41:15 <strcat> I dealt with the Updater issue by not including it in a build by default
17:41:21 <strcat> instead you need to set an environment variable to include it
17:41:31 <strcat> so that way it's hard for people to accidentally include it without setting the URL to their own server
17:42:05 <strcat> but if people are modifying the official releases that bypasses this way of helping people not attempt to update from a fork to an official build
17:42:39 <strcat> perhaps we should include a persistent notification if the bootloader is not locked?
17:43:11 <strcat> like 'To complete the installation of GrapheneOS, lock the bootloader."
17:43:18 <strcat> with a button to reboot to bootloader
17:43:23 <strcat> dunno
17:53:00 <Seplx[m]> <strcat "perhaps we should include a pers"> imo it would be better if it wasn't a persistent notification, but instead one that appears on every boot. So if there is anyone that wants to make some changes to GOS it won't be that annoying.
17:53:24 <strcat> Seplx[m]: making changes to GrapheneOS is done by building and signing it with your own keys
17:53:36 <strcat> and nothing stops you from locking the bootloader
17:53:45 <Seplx[m]> <strcat "Seplx: making changes to Graphen"> Yes I know
17:54:18 <strcat> modifying the official releases is broken because it breaks the existing signatures, etc.
17:54:32 <strcat> and the official updater can't handle updating from tampered images
17:54:41 <strcat> not sure what it's supposed to even do in that case
17:55:00 <strcat> it can very easily brick the device or lose all data in that case
17:55:31 <strcat> encryption key uses the OS verified boot key as one of the inputs for deriving it
17:55:45 <strcat> all of the disk encryption keys
17:56:15 <strcat> it the OS verified boot key somehow 'changes' (cannot happen on a normal install) it won't be able to decrypt data anymore
17:56:56 <Seplx[m]> How are avb keys handled? They are not generated when building?
17:56:59 <strcat> I think it'll end up breaking pretty fast but not before wasting a lot of bandwidth from the update server
17:57:09 <strcat> Seplx[m]: after building, signing is a separate step
17:57:27 <strcat> after you have a build, you generate keys and sign it
17:57:32 <strcat> and then you use the signed release
17:57:39 <jonah__> <Seplx[m] "imo it would be better if it was"> isn't this basically the current behavior? well not a notification, but a large splash screen that appears on every boot.
17:57:53 <strcat> if you're doing development rather than a production release to actually use, you don't need to sign the build
17:58:09 <strcat> before signing it, the build is using the publicly available AOSP test keys
17:58:21 <strcat> the signing step resigns everything with production keys - it's a post-build process
17:59:13 <Seplx[m]> You can't choose to use dev keys while building?
17:59:16 <strcat> if we really wanted we could publish the raw target_files zip and otatools so that people could sign our builds with other keys but that doesn't make much sense to me
17:59:22 <strcat> Seplx[m]: that is not when it's supposed to be signed
17:59:31 <strcat> you build a release and then sign the release
17:59:38 <strcat> the official signing tools sign a release
18:00:32 <strcat> you aren't supposed to include your keys in the source tree and change the AOSP test key paths to your keys there, you're supposed to use the official signing tools which sign a build and change the properties to a release-keys build from test-keys
18:00:45 <strcat> building and signing are just separate steps
18:01:23 <strcat> Seplx[m]: if you did for some reason take the approach of replacing the AOSP test keys that's a 'dev-keys' build not a release build
18:01:30 <Seplx[m]> Thank you
18:02:12 <d32d23dd23d23d> can warnings be ignored during build process?
18:02:25 <strcat> unsure what you mean

18:03:33 <d32d23dd23d23d> sorry for long text -_-
18:09:41 <strcat[m]> d32d23dd23d23d: why ignore those warnings though?
18:38:02 <strcat> d32d23dd23d23d: you'd have to go and fork those repos and edit build files to explicitly silence warnings
18:38:11 <strcat> at that point makes more sense to figure out what is wrong and address it
18:46:16 <Seplx[m]> > <@zyxt128:matrix.org> Hi guys
18:46:16 <Seplx[m]> > Let's say I want to create a kid's friendly ROM (like blocking porn sites or any other non-kid's friendly site). My initial idea was to run a rule in order to block them in the main.cpp of the netd service (and also disable the ability to set rules). Do you believe that there is a better alternative? I don't want the kids to be able to mess with the firewall at all.
18:46:16 <Seplx[m]> You can edit the hosts file to block those sites like adaway does
18:50:37 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense to hard-wiring blocking into the OS instead of doing it properly in a way that can be configured and updated
18:50:57 <strcat[m]> if you want to lock down a device for users on it you should use a device manager
18:51:13 <strcat[m]>  * doesn't make sense to hard-wire blocking into the OS instead of doing it properly in a way that can be configured and updated
18:51:52 <strcat[m]> the DNS resolver also has to iterate line by line through the hosts file and it's not intended to be a massive list of domains
18:52:59 <strcat[m]> also not sure how that will stop someone from trivially bypassing it
18:53:09 <strcat[m]> if you don't use a device manager, it's not going to work
18:53:16 <strcat[m]> custom version of the OS not useful for this
18:53:44 <strcat[m]> all you would end up doing is hard-wiring what a device manager paired with a VPN service can do into the OS, doesn't really make sense
18:53:50 <strcat[m]> also, seems offtopic
18:54:06 <strcat[m]> it's only on-topic for this channel if it's about doing something with GrapheneOS
20:21:30 <bbqcore[m]> latest beta is Android 11?
20:25:13 <Anonymous[m]> S√≠
20:57:40 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: yes
20:57:55 <strcat[m]> we have a couple things we need to do before we can push out another release that can be released as stable
21:13:14 <broda721[m]> If I was to keep my pixel device after EOL, what would be the least insecure way to keep using it as daily driver? Keep GrapheneOS without updates, load back up stock android, or install LineageOS? (pixel 3a)
21:19:07 <cn3m[m]> Don't.
21:19:38 <cn3m[m]> There are many sane cheap options like Android One phones with everything disabled or old iPhones
21:19:46 <cn3m[m]> using a phone without updates isn't a good idea
21:20:35 <Seplx[m]> <broda721[m] "If I was to keep my pixel device">  Self build aosp.
21:21:24 <cn3m[m]> though if you have too GrapheneOS + manually updating Vanadium(rss feed) from GitHub is the least bad way to do it. Just don't though
21:21:36 <broda721[m]> Fair enough
21:22:52 <broda721[m]> I know you guys aren't fond of Lineage, but is even keeping GrapheneOS unupdated better than using LineageOS?
21:34:58 <cn3m[m]> Lineage won't patch vendor images and won't have anti persistence
21:35:02 <cn3m[m]> or the hardening
21:36:04 <cn3m[m]> <broda721[m] "I know you guys aren't fond of L"> Lineage is great at what it is, but maintaining security and privacy is not that
21:54:19 <strcat[m]> broda721: you should use it past EOL, the rest is off-topic for the channel
21:54:26 <strcat[m]>  * broda721: you shouldn't use it past EOL, the rest is off-topic for the channel
21:56:21 <strcat[m]> you won't get the security updates anywhere - and partial security updates leaving open major holes as serious as what you're fixing are not really any use
21:58:00 <cn3m[m]> http://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/da15rg/security_patches_and_oem_support/f1n83b1?context=3 (comment where this is covered)
21:58:03 <strcat[m]> regardless of what you do with it, you won't have the security updates like before
22:01:16 <strcat[m]> you don't have much choice other than an iPhone if you're going to be using it for 5 years rather than 3
22:02:03 <strcat[m]> if privacy and security are such a low priority that using it significantly fast EOL is a consideration, seems weird to be here and using GrapheneOS
22:02:04 <strcat[m]> why go through that trouble
22:02:42 <strcat[m]>  * why go through that trouble? just use the stock OS from the start
22:03:36 <strcat[m]>  * if privacy and security are such a low priority that using it significantly fast EOL is under consideration, seems weird to be here and using GrapheneOS
22:58:32 <ham5urg> Is it hard to get the IMEI changed with a Pixel 4?
