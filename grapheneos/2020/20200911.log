00:01:13 <aeonsolution[m]> hi everyone, we need testers for pixels 3 family and pixel 4 family devices, if you are interested please follow the instructions here https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch
00:01:44 <aeonsolution[m]> this is step 0, and i will help you if you need assistance
00:02:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: I'll test pixel 4 myself
00:03:23 <aeonsolution[m]> do you have a pixel 4 xl?
00:03:59 <aeonsolution[m]> i can help with the pixel 4a, but we still need more people to pitch in
00:36:52 <LinusSexTips[m]> has the newest update been pushed to OTA yet?
00:41:10 <aeonsolution[m]> Linus Sex Tips: you can check the github for progress, there isn't a timeline for this because there are issues that arent straight forward that have to be resolved. if there is anything meaningful to report itll come from strcat
00:41:33 <LinusSexTips[m]> Ok thank you
00:41:39 <aeonsolution[m]> np
00:45:53 <Guest34242> hi everyone. i saw on reddit that grapheneOS 2020.09.10.05 is released but my phone doesn't detect the update, is that okay as it takes time to get delivered to my phone or is there something i'm doing wrong?
00:46:25 <Guest34242> i also noticed that this link https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest/releases/tag/QQ3A.200805.001.2020.09.10.05 is dead that i found in https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.10.05
00:52:34 <aeonsolution[m]> can you look for the link on github and make a pull request
00:53:36 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat updates all those links on the website and does the heavy lift for the project, you can help out by doing that
00:54:28 <aeonsolution[m]> if you want to get updates, you should be watching the github or looking at the channel logs
00:55:00 <aeonsolution[m]> we do all the question answering and we dont want to leave you hanging but it takes away from us doing the development work with the limited time we have to spare
01:01:11 <evan0001[m]> sorry connection dropped and irc refused to connect. i'm not sure who i was talking to about the dead link issue
01:01:48 <aeonsolution[m]> it was me ✋
01:02:29 <aeonsolution[m]> if you see a deadlink, can you look for the correct link on the github
01:03:16 <aeonsolution[m]> and then make a pull request on https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org
01:03:53 <aeonsolution[m]> its also super helpful way to contribute
01:04:12 <evan0001[m]> i'd like to help. that's what i've been trying to do but i couldn't find anything on here https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest/tags is it even possible to make a pr to add something like a tag to a repo?
01:05:22 <aeonsolution[m]> that release isnt ready yet
01:05:26 <aeonsolution[m]> just read the comments on the website
01:05:39 <aeonsolution[m]> its going to be the final release
01:05:54 <aeonsolution[m]> for andoird 10
01:06:25 <aeonsolution[m]> i thought it was already up
01:07:10 <evan0001[m]> i read that part but i believe i've misinterpreted it
01:08:20 <evan0001[m]> what i understood was that 2020.09.10.05 is released and ready to be installed and then later on another release will bring android 11
01:18:13 <bungeetaco[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "hi everyone, we need testers for"> I can test on my Pixel 3 XL if you still need a tester.
01:18:47 <aeonsolution[m]> nice, yeah you can help test the updated bonito kernel
01:20:12 <aeonsolution[m]> just follow the instructions on the website and let me know if you have questions
01:20:16 <bungeetaco[m]> Ok, It's my main phone though. I'm guessing I can just restore from Seedvault after I'm done testing?
01:20:24 <aeonsolution[m]> uhhh
01:20:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> bungeetaco: no
01:20:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seedvault currently doesn't support R
01:21:01 <bungeetaco[m]> I meant if I go back to stable build after
01:21:01 <aeonsolution[m]> if its your main phone, you can help out by donating for now
01:21:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> And tbh I took the easy way out for R
01:21:18 <aeonsolution[m]> when theres a beta release, help report bugs
01:21:39 <bungeetaco[m]> I sent 50$ this morning.
01:22:20 <bungeetaco[m]> I'll test anyways, worse case scenario I spend a few hours re-installing some things :p
01:25:34 <aeonsolution[m]> well you can try building it for now, you dont have to do anything on your phone yet
01:25:46 <aeonsolution[m]> the flashing is the last step, you can decide at that point if you want to backup or not
01:26:47 <aeonsolution[m]> change the 11 to a 10. we want to test the android 11 kernel on grapheneos 10
01:28:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: I already tested it
01:28:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> For pixel 4
01:28:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Did you test pixel 3 yourself?
01:28:56 <aeonsolution[m]> my build is at 98% lol
01:29:10 <aeonsolution[m]> almost there ^.^
01:29:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh so you're at the longest phase of the build
01:29:51 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah
01:30:44 <lickidysplit[m]> I can't copy the btc address on the donation page. Can a mod pm me
01:36:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW there's a lineage-18.0 now
01:37:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> I bet it'll be December and they still won't release
01:43:51 <bungeetaco[m]> So just to confirm, I'm pulling the 10 branch correct? aeonsolution
01:44:00 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
01:44:05 <bungeetaco[m]> Ok thanks
01:44:10 <aeonsolution[m]> np
01:44:41 <aeonsolution[m]> there are some gotchas bungeetaco you should be aware of
01:44:54 <aeonsolution[m]> to build the kernel you need at least 14 gigs of ram
01:45:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> 28
01:45:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> My RAM + swap can go up to 40
01:45:58 <aeonsolution[m]> the LTO peaks so you could run out of memory
01:46:18 <aeonsolution[m]> making swap can help get you over the hump but itll take a little longer than having dedicated ram
01:46:30 <aeonsolution[m]> anu is right, if you have 28+
01:46:41 <aeonsolution[m]> youll build the kernel in an hour or so
01:46:52 <aeonsolution[m]> with 14 gigs, it takes 2-3 hours
01:47:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> 20 minutes
01:47:13 <aeonsolution[m]> oh shit
01:47:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> At least here
01:47:20 <aeonsolution[m]> wtf
01:47:26 <aeonsolution[m]> i hate my laptop
01:47:29 <aeonsolution[m]> lol
01:48:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh I really should buy a ram upgrade
01:48:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe go a little closer to 64 GB
01:49:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> I doubt there's much I can do about the CPU. It's pretty much the latest Intel has on the market
01:50:41 <aeonsolution[m]> my laptop can hear you!
01:51:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then let it
02:00:53 <bungeetaco[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "to build the kernel you need at "> I have a good 32 to spare
02:01:22 <bungeetaco[m]> Pulling the repo now
02:01:45 <bungeetaco[m]> How much disk space do I need already? lol
02:02:13 <bungeetaco[m]> My linux partition is 300gb give or take
02:03:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> bungeetaco: you can squeeze in 40 GB if you want lol
02:03:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btrfs with zstd:15 and it won't slow down your build
02:05:30 <bungeetaco[m]> No idea how I would set that up tbh, just running regular Ubuntu 20.04
02:05:54 <bungeetaco[m]> I have a ZFS network drive with like 20tb of space, but idk if it can output to that
02:07:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> bungeetaco: it is said that aeonsolution's laptop is listening
02:09:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh would probably be better to get aeon something better
02:12:40 <aeonsolution[m]> maybe later
02:16:20 <strcat[m]> the release is out as a tagged release for Pixel 2, 3, 3a and variants of them
02:16:31 <strcat[m]> it is not quite ready for Pixel 4 so therefore there isn't a manifest tag yet
02:16:32 <strcat[m]> that's why
02:16:41 <strcat[m]> can't make a manifest tag before Pixel 4 kernel repos have tags
02:16:45 <strcat[m]> because it references those
02:16:59 <strcat[m]> the official releases for other devices are done and will be pushed out to beta soon
02:54:44 <renlord[m]> aeonsolution:
02:54:54 <renlord[m]>  * aeonsolution: should just get a ryzen processor or something
02:55:26 <renlord[m]> CPU and RAM is quite cheap now
02:55:30 <aeonsolution[m]> thats the plan, just havent had a chance to get the parts
02:55:33 <renlord[m]> even PCIe SSDs are on the way down
02:55:46 <aeonsolution[m]> oh nice
02:55:48 <aeonsolution[m]> didnt know that
03:06:37 <dan-v[m]> strcat: can confirm 86.0.4240.16 build of chromium webview (not trichrome) works on 11
03:09:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: I have a server I can give you access to
03:10:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> But you can't do make clean at the drop of a hat
03:10:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you place a load on it for more than 4 hours continuously it will cripple you to some really weird speeds
03:11:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> It can build clean in about 2h, including the kernel
03:12:52 <aeonsolution[m]> thank you, ill message you for when we start testing the coral kernel
03:13:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> You also accept that any data stored on it may be lost at any time
03:13:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it's secure erase'd so you won't be getting any of it back
03:14:19 <renlord[m]> even copying the build back/forth the server takes a while
03:16:08 <bungeetaco[m]> Anyone else manage to get one of the kernels built on Ubuntu 20.04? aeonsolution has been babysitting me for an hour trying to get my build environment working lol.
03:16:48 <bungeetaco[m]> Pulled the tools from the build page and from here: https://source.android.com/setup/build/initializing
03:16:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord: well it's rather limited
03:17:46 * bungeetaco[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/yKQcWifRkCzkvBQvdvLseleQ/message.txt >
03:29:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> bungeetaco: yes
03:29:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Use prebuilts for now
03:35:24 <bungeetaco[m]> I was asking because I asked if there was anything I could help test earlier and aeon said he needed someone to build test the crosshatch kernel.
03:37:02 <bungeetaco[m]> Gonna try building from Manjaro instead, maybe it had something to do with the 20.04 toolchain
03:37:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> bungeetaco: don't
03:38:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's currently a breakage on arch that I'm looking into
03:38:55 <bungeetaco[m]> Alright, gentoo it is then
03:40:09 <bungeetaco[m]> Anything else I can do to help in the meantime?
03:43:38 <aeonsolution[m]> dont use gentoo
03:43:55 <bungeetaco[m]> 😎
03:44:01 <aeonsolution[m]> let me think
03:45:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> bungeetaco: it's not going to build regardless of what you use
03:45:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> We used newer compilers to build the R kernels then shipped them on Q
03:46:04 <bungeetaco[m]> Ah, gotcha
03:50:57 <bungeetaco[m]> Well if you need a Pixel 3 XL tester, I'm available. I can run test builds provided the toolchain works.
03:59:08 <bungeetaco[m]> Thanks a lot for maintaining this project by the way. I know it's a lot of work.
04:05:58 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> Had anyone been able to activate an unlocked phone with xfinity (Verizon mnvo). I saw a reddit comment that says it is not possible but can't understand why of Verizon works
04:08:51 <aeonsolution[m]> Verizon variant phones have the disable bootloader unlocking
04:09:32 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> I already have graphene os installed on an unlocked phone (using ATT currently) but want to make a carrier switch
04:09:33 <aeonsolution[m]>  * Verizon variant phones have disable bootloader unlocking
04:09:59 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] Verizon variant phones disable bootloader unlocking
04:10:33 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> <aeonsolution[m] "Verizon variant phones have the "> You mean phones phones bought from Verizon right? I already posses an unlocked phone and have flashed grapheneos
04:11:00 <aeonsolution[m]> xfinity probably needs carrier blobs that verizon doesnt
04:11:05 <aeonsolution[m]> Verizon just works
04:11:13 <aeonsolution[m]> its the same issue with Sprint
04:12:11 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> <aeonsolution[m] "xfinity probably needs carrier b"> I saw a github issue about visible  mnvo Verizon issues. Is that related?
04:12:34 <aeonsolution[m]> can you share the link
04:13:05 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> <aeonsolution[m] "its the same issue with Sprint"> Thanks. I experienced that with google fi in the past (graphene worked but not on sprint network)
04:13:51 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, its probably the same issue with xfinity
04:14:30 <aeonsolution[m]> xfinity eventhough is under Verizon, it most likely requires those blobs to work
04:14:30 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/153
04:15:38 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> Thanks I am still reading that. Trying to understand the blob dependency comment you made in the context of Verizon (working) vs some Verizon MNVOs maybe not working
04:16:13 <aeonsolution[m]> some carriers require additional settings for your phone to work on their network
04:16:58 <aeonsolution[m]> i might be using the wrong word to describe, adding the carrier settings to GrapheneOS for networks that require it
04:17:34 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> Thank you. Unfortunate as some Verizon mnvos cost a lot less than Verizon
04:17:53 <aeonsolution[m]> right
04:28:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> u29601mg6ba93j: there's an experimental patch on glassrom
04:28:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can try it there
04:28:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> If it works all the more reason for me to clean it up and get it into graphene
04:31:11 <kan12> hi, i have a daily driver pixel 3a, any way i can help out with the porting/testing effort? happy to use the beta branch and to keep donating
04:43:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution
04:44:22 <aeonsolution[m]> yo
04:44:58 <aeonsolution[m]> kan12: we could always use more testers
04:45:33 <aeonsolution[m]> if you want to help test kernel stuff, this is step 0 https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch
04:47:51 <aeonsolution[m]> <kan12 "hi, i have a daily driver pixel "> the project appreciates donations, https://grapheneos.org/donate
04:48:18 <aeonsolution[m]> at the moment Paypal and Github sponsorship is the preferred method to support the project and the lead developer
04:49:47 <aeonsolution[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "aeonsolution "> oh you meant the patch, yeah thats still in the works. faxing had asked about it and i havent forgotten. juggling a few things.
04:57:25 <kan12> aeonsolution[m]: thanks, i might give that a try. i'm sponsoring at the moment and really appreciate the work put into grapheneOS
05:24:53 <wondercat> graphene is amazing specially with battery life
05:29:32 * SEWaRybdALEy[m] uploaded an image: ima_55a7060.jpeg (202KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/EiUSpqNuMMlJRfEWNpYyVwJD/ima_55a7060.jpeg >
05:53:08 <strcat[m]> dan-v: that's good news
08:58:32 <CEZM[m]> What ever happened with yesterday's update?
09:02:51 <propertype[m]> It's not finished yet.
09:23:38 <CEZM[m]> Normally it's available when a release post is made, did anything go wrong?
09:23:39 <CEZM[m]> It's ok if it's not ready, just felt odd.
09:32:09 <strcat[m]> issues were detected in testing
09:32:12 <strcat[m]> that's the point of testing it
09:32:22 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 release definitely can't be pushed out yet
09:34:24 <ninjahmeh> Been trying to Google Fu for myself to solve why chrt is throwing command not found while I build kernel for blueline from grapheneos11 source.
09:35:00 <strcat[m]> you're missing the command
09:35:17 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies
09:35:29 <strcat[m]> perhaps trying to build on something obsolete
09:35:47 <ninjahmeh> Been a while since I got my head into all this but iv been pretty meticulous getting my environment setup and so forth. Yeah am reading from that and used android source build env instructions too
09:36:02 <strcat[m]> don't use that documentation
09:36:03 <ninjahmeh> Think it may well just be PATH issue as well
09:36:04 <strcat[m]> use ours
09:36:18 <ninjahmeh> Ok
09:36:24 <dallemon[m]> ninjahmeh: i found just following the intructions from the site to work best
09:36:27 <strcat[m]> old AOSP documentation is not a good guide to follow
09:36:58 <strcat[m]> they strangely try to cover building historical code and it isn't really focused on the latest releases etc
09:37:02 <strcat[m]> or doing production builds
09:37:18 <strcat[m]> help is needed with the problems tied to this September Pixel 4 release
09:37:22 <strcat[m]> along with the Android 11 migration
09:37:26 <strcat[m]> people are welcome to help
09:37:36 <strcat[m]> I don't know if I want to push out the release atm
09:37:50 <ninjahmeh> Yeah wish I had the means to splurge on the 4 instead of the 3 I just found cheap
09:39:41 <ninjahmeh> Would do what could to help there but if you find anything 3 related needs testing or whatever I will keep my eyes and ears peeled
09:41:27 <ninjahmeh> Ah shit, so I'm going to have to bring a Linux onto my Mac too, oh well, that should be fun on a 2012 Nvidia chooser Mac xD
09:43:02 <ninjahmeh> Can't believe I missed that line in dependencies on your list lol...
09:43:12 <ninjahmeh> Clearly weak Google Fu was used
09:47:34 <strcat[m]> need help with development, not really testing
09:47:56 <strcat[m]> and funding for our development work along with a lot of other costs associated with the project
09:48:40 <strcat[m]> not able to get out this current release as is because there isn't enough help
09:48:46 <strcat[m]> lack of device maintainers
09:49:22 <strcat[m]> and porting everything + getting things rolling with Android 11 is not going to be easy
09:54:02 <inrdrna[m]> starting Monday I will help cause my 3A will rotten on my desk otherwise
09:54:37 <inrdrna[m]> I don’t mind it being a guinea pig if it can helps
10:00:23 <CEZM[m]> <strcat[m] "issues were detected in testing"> Got it. 👍
10:02:00 <ninjahmeh> Yeah I read your plights with these concerns when I first joined here the other day. Once iv been through court with my employers at tribunal I may be able to find space for some financial support, though covid has wrecked me and a lot of others that way lately
10:06:10 <ninjahmeh> Development wise I am interested also just not hugely knowledgeable as much as I would like. If anyone has a bit of time and is a pixel 3 owner too I would gladly put time and effort into learning and maintaining with them
10:07:41 <ninjahmeh> Iv had some time on zombiROM which was an Omni ROM fork so I do have a bit of experience but yeah would be a matter of working with someone before I was more useful independently
10:16:42 <ninjahmeh> Seems a lot of users just timed out lol or was that me?
10:17:55 <noctux> that's the matrix-gateway being unstable
10:19:32 <ninjahmeh> Yeah I just figured looking at that lot. Well anyway any patient pixel 3 owners who are involved and want to help me to help them to help the project let me know
10:23:12 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <ninjahmeh "Yeah I just figured looking at t"> I have 3a, does this help? But i can not Build a OS or something like that. I just could install/update  my phone and can pm what works and what not
10:28:16 <ninjahmeh> From the sounds of it testing isn't so much of an issue, and while the 3 lines (3a, XL and 3aXL) are all going to be similar they will be different enough to require separate maintenance
10:32:13 <ninjahmeh> When I get home from London I'm going to have to get back to brushing up on my Git skills as sounds like the core need right now is on porting graphene OS up to android 11 with the other core need seemingly a lack of finances which sadly is not an area I can help at the moment, having covid draw a line through my employment 😐
11:14:54 <strcat[m]> Beta is available now for Pixel 2, 2 XL, 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL
11:15:06 <strcat[m]> still working on the 4 and 4 XL and tags are subject to change (sorry, but how things have to be right now)
11:15:35 <strcat[m]> if something breaks let me know but I expect it to be fine
11:15:40 <strcat[m]> problems on 4 and 4 XL were unexpected
11:16:04 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/commit/cb05b257bb267c4c8692c6ecf2fbd4a429047452
11:16:14 <strcat[m]> for now the tentative solution is not shipping the Android 11 kernels for Pixel 4 yet
11:16:23 <strcat[m]> but going to try a bit more and might reverse that if I find a fix
11:16:40 <strcat[m]> also need to confirm that this is the issue... probably is tho
11:18:22 <strcat[m]> yeah, it's the issue
11:18:28 <strcat[m]> going to try some workarounds before giving up
11:18:41 <strcat[m]> so could ship it like this without the Android 11 kernel but can try a bit longer 1st
11:22:28 <shdudbdjdj[m]> Thank you for your amazing work <3
11:23:23 <lickidysplit[m]> Spamming the OTA update Button 😂
11:23:46 <shdudbdjdj[m]> Same here ❤️😀
11:23:59 <galyoninion[m]> hi, everyone
11:24:12 <galyoninion[m]> I want to use mobile network and phone features with Graphene OS.
11:24:15 <galyoninion[m]> However, when I looked at the official website, it was written that VoLTE had almost no carry that could be used.
11:24:41 <galyoninion[m]> Can't I use VoLTE on GrapheneOS?
11:24:59 <galyoninion[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
11:28:37 <strcat[m]> lickidysplit: it's in the beta channel
11:28:41 <strcat[m]> if you aren't using beta won't see it
11:28:52 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#beta-channel
11:29:08 <strcat[m]> no Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL release yet because I want to try shipping the Android 11 kernel
11:29:10 <strcat[m]> going to try again
11:29:29 <strcat[m]> galyoninion: VoLTE works on some carriers, not others, help is needed to make it more portable and fix issues
11:29:36 <strcat[m]> galyoninion: someone did do some work to help with this
11:29:46 <strcat[m]> don't know what else is needed
11:29:50 <strcat[m]> also it'll need to be ported to Android 11
11:29:59 <strcat[m]> this is where lack of device maintainers for all the devices is super problematic
11:30:05 <strcat[m]> also 1 maintainer for Pixel 4 is not really enough
11:31:56 <lickidysplit[m]> I've got beta channel selected. Is it a possible time zone issue maybe ?
11:33:29 <Quan7um> I'm set to beta mode, but not seeing any updates
11:33:51 <Quan7um> 3aXL
11:34:04 <lickidysplit[m]> ^ twins
11:34:12 <Quan7um> Guess i could manually download
11:34:27 <Quan7um> 👍
11:40:04 <strcat[m]> unsure what's happening with that, sounds problematic
11:40:21 <strcat[m]> oh
11:40:23 <strcat[m]> I figured it out
11:40:29 <strcat[m]> just wait a second
11:40:46 <Quan7um> No problem

11:43:08 <Quan7um> Will have both just in case ;)
11:43:54 <shdudbdjdj[m]> Gwtting the OTA update right now ❤️
11:43:59 <shdudbdjdj[m]> *Getting
11:44:08 <strcat[m]> if you update manually you need the OTA anyway not factory images
11:44:09 <strcat[m]> to sideload it
11:44:21 <strcat[m]> flashing factory images only possible unlocked and wipes data
11:44:31 <Quan7um> <strcat[m] "I figured it out"> Thank you. Will let you know of anything stands out.
11:45:07 <Quan7um> <strcat[m] "if you update manually you need "> Understood.

11:57:18 <Quan7um> Update complete here as well.
11:59:33 <ninjahmeh> So,
12:01:26 <ninjahmeh> Any pixel 3 owners want to look to help maintain it? I'm game but not confident to say I could manage alone at my current skill level
12:06:46 <lickidysplit[m]> Once I finance myself a new PC I'd love to help
13:16:27 <imsofrustrated[m> what does the preinstalled app "auditor" do? I tried verifying my 2 grapheneOS phones and everything worked with scanning the QR codes, but what does the app do now?
13:18:01 <inrdrna[m]> sending a report every 4 hours
13:18:10 <inrdrna[m]> verifying all is good
13:22:14 <Arch2k[m]> Hi all,
13:22:14 <Arch2k[m]> Been using GraphenOS for almost a year now, and I really love the OS.  I just received the OTA for my 3XL (Beta channel - Sept10 build) and many things are broken related to sound.  I am unable to play videos (online or offline), hear anyone on phone calls etc.
13:22:14 <Arch2k[m]> Is anyone else having similar issues? If so, I am happy to file a bug report on GitHub, just wanted to check here first.
13:40:03 <faxing[m]> I'm not on the beta but I mean if you're having issues you should still file a bug report regardless of if other people are having it or not
13:40:08 <faxing[m]> Worst that can happen is they close it
13:40:37 <faxing[m]> Best that can happen is they fix a sound issue for a bunch of people now and a whole bunch more in the stable release
13:40:59 <faxing[m]> imo
13:40:59 <Arch2k[m]> Ok, will do.  Thanks
13:41:05 <faxing[m]>  * in my opinion
13:54:14 <dazinism> I'm on 3XL beta and my phones locking up (needs reboot) when answering or making calls...
13:54:55 <dazinism> Found out when someone tried to call me, then I tries to call them back (lol)
13:55:42 <dazinism> Took a bug report after rebooting via developer options. Anyone know if that would still have useful data?
13:58:57 <dazinism> ...guess I should have a look....
14:03:03 <Arch2k[m]> dazinism: This is the same issue I am having, along with other sound issues.  I am filing a bug report right now.
14:08:41 <dazinism> Yeah also no audio, newpipe gives an error message when you start playing. I'll join the issue
14:09:32 <Arch2k[m]> Awesome - here is a link: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/288
14:14:34 <strcat[m]> it's possible that deploying the Android 11 kernels early is not going to work
14:14:36 <strcat[m]> the issue may be something else though
14:14:39 <strcat[m]> clearly this can't leave beta
14:14:51 <strcat[m]> inrdrna: https://attestation.app/about
14:14:55 <fomijafi[m]> Yep, seems like my message notifications have no sound as well, pixel 3
14:15:13 <strcat[m]> yeah, I'll try making another beta release rolling back the kernel changes with the hope that it's the cause
14:15:16 <strcat[m]> the cause may be something else
14:15:27 <strcat[m]> it was a mistake to try deploying the new kernels early
14:15:40 <strcat[m]> that's what the beta releases are for though
14:17:12 <alex-resist> Not sure if this is of interest, but I'm running the beta on Pixel 3a right now and everything seems to be working fine
14:17:44 <strcat[m]> I cancelled the release
14:17:51 <jpds> No ideas on my 3a either
14:17:53 <strcat[m]> going to be rolling back the kernels and doing a release like that
14:17:54 <strcat[m]> lower risk
14:17:55 <jpds> No issues*
14:18:02 <engulf[m]> Sounds seem to be working on Pixel 3a, at least through speakers and headphone jack
14:18:05 <strcat[m]> I need help with the migration
14:18:08 <strcat[m]> yeah can't risk it though
14:18:09 <strcat[m]> too many issues
14:18:32 <alex-resist> Can one see from the kernel version number if it's an Android 10 or 11 kernel?=
14:18:54 <strcat[m]> yes because it references the commit hash
14:19:01 <strcat[m]> the GrapheneOS commit
14:19:06 <strcat[m]> for the kernel
14:19:19 <alex-resist> Yes, I see, but both are supposed to be 4.9.x variants?
14:19:24 <strcat[m]> cancelled that release, making a new one atm
14:19:31 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: depends on device
14:20:52 <alex-resist> Ok
14:21:06 <cdesai> look for the g part at the end
14:21:26 <strcat[m]> it may not be caused by the Android 11 kernels
14:21:28 <cdesai> but just the release number should tell you anyway just check the changelog
14:21:34 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really matter - don't have time to investigate anymore, rolling it back
14:21:50 <strcat[m]> if there are still problems after rolling back the kernels, we won't make a September Android 10 release
14:22:04 <strcat[m]> it's taking too much time to do this final release
14:22:08 <cdesai> strcat[m]: it's probably the kernels given how small the other patches are and don't really touch too much
14:22:16 <strcat[m]> days of work that could have been spent on 11
14:22:23 <strcat[m]> cdesai: they do touch av
14:22:32 <strcat[m]> and we included that USB audio fix too
14:22:54 <strcat[m]> rolling back the kernels, we'll see how it goes without that
14:23:04 <strcat[m]> unfortunately has been a huge time expenditure dealing with this
14:23:11 <strcat[m]> was a mistake to try shipping it early
14:23:20 <strcat[m]> they clearly don't respect the concept of not breaking userspace ABI
14:23:49 <strcat[m]> currently building the old kernels again
14:24:07 <alex-resist> Will there be a new release on the beta channel with the Android 10 kernels?
14:24:22 <strcat[m]> yes and hopefully no issues
14:24:26 <strcat[m]> and then it can go to the stable channel
14:27:21 <alex-resist> Hopefully all goes well. I could help testing new betas on the 3a and 3a XL, but those devices don't seem to be affected

14:58:51 <atasuke[m]> I’m trying to use my own signed builds with a modified version of auditor but I’m getting this error
15:14:21 <atasuke[m]> I fixed it. It was just the phone I used to be the auditor that was faulty
16:01:00 <strcat[m]> also BTW Auditor is known to not work properly with Android 11 on the Pixel 4 due to upstream bugs
16:01:01 <strcat[m]> don't know what to do about that
16:01:04 <strcat[m]> need help with development
16:01:16 <strcat[m]> including figuring out and reporting upstream issues
16:03:37 <strcat[m]> or perhaps it's broken on all devices with the Android 11 update
16:03:40 <cdesai> ^ this people can try even on stock
16:03:41 <strcat[m]> I mean auditing them
16:03:56 <cdesai> just try auditing a pixel running 11 and see what happens, and report back
16:04:05 <strcat[m]> 09-11 12:03:05.228  4387 11996 E GenerateAttestationService: Caused by: java.security.cert.CertificateExpiredException: Certificate expired at Mon Dec 05 01:41:27 EST 1966 (compared to Fri Sep 11 12:03:05 EDT 2020)
16:04:24 <strcat[m]> it works for the first verification
16:04:31 <strcat[m]> this happens when doing the 2nd verification
16:04:38 <strcat[m]> it seems it ends up with a bogus date for the 2nd key
16:11:16 <strcat[m]> -                ((X509Certificate) certChain[i - 1]).checkValidity();
16:11:16 <strcat[m]> +                //((X509Certificate) certChain[i - 1]).checkValidity();
16:11:20 <strcat[m]> yeah it ends up with that fucked up date somehow
16:28:30 <strcat[m]> IntentService and AsyncTask are both deprecated
16:28:31 <strcat[m]> fun stuff
16:45:00 <lovenomalice> Just jumping in to ask a question about installing GOS on my new phone, but does X.509 even understand 1966 as a date? It's at least before Unix time.
16:45:18 <lovenomalice> Before the Unix Epoch.
16:45:49 <lovenomalice> Not many certs issued in 1966 :)
16:58:13 <lovenomalice> Anyway ... I've got my phone, I've read the FAQ and Usage guide ...
16:58:26 <lovenomalice> I"m pretty excited but havea  few questions
16:58:36 <lovenomalice> The FAQ says that enabling OEM Unlocking "requires internet access on devices with Google Play services as part of Factory Reset Protection (FRP)". I'd like to avoid pinging Google about my new phone.
16:58:46 <lovenomalice> My (incomplete) understanding is that FRP requires a Google account. As my device has no Google account, can I enable OEM Unlocking without pinging Google? Or is there another method?
17:12:53 <Autopsy[m]> <lovenomalice "The FAQ says that enabling OEM U"> Why is this a problem?
17:12:55 <Autopsy[m]> Google made the device.
17:13:05 <Autopsy[m]> They know everything there is to know about the device.
17:14:41 <Autopsy[m]> Turn the WiFi on, click OEM Unlock and continue with your life?
17:14:57 <lovenomalice> They don't know it's been turned on, where it is, or that it's being unlocked.
17:15:30 <lovenomalice> Anyway, I don't want to debate my preferences; I'm asking how it works.
17:16:32 <atasuke[m]> lovenomalice: if it’s brand new you don’t need to connect to unlock bootloader
17:16:54 <lovenomalice> Thanks. Is that because there is no Google acocunt?
17:17:30 <atasuke[m]> Yes
17:17:36 <lovenomalice> Great, thanks.
17:18:14 <lovenomalice> Also, Is private DNS (which I understand is just a user-friendly name for DNS-over-TLS?) traffic routed over VPN/Tor connections?  This passing comment in July says it is not: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200722#c4473164
17:19:05 <lovenomalice> (just a passing comment, not official documentation, and maybe taken out of context)
17:19:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> lovenomalice: private DNS doesn't make sense when you're using a VPN
17:19:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Most VPNs already have an internal private DNS
17:20:25 <Autopsy[m]> DNS queries will "leak" when reported by your VPN provider.
17:20:56 <lovenomalice> I'm likely to use Tor (Orbot).
17:23:09 <lovenomalice> Also, it's not clear to me why it doesn't make sense with VPNs. I see some redundancy, but not in every case and also some effective end-to-end encryption for DNS requests doesn't hurt.
17:23:37 <lovenomalice> Is there something about the AOSP Tor/DNS mechanism that takes over DNS config?
17:23:52 <Autopsy[m]> You inherently trust your VPN provider, as you use their service
17:24:16 <Autopsy[m]> So, it makes sense to also use their DNS
17:24:59 <Autopsy[m]> Tor, I dunno. Don't use it, so I can't say about the private DNS feature.
17:25:14 <lovenomalice> There is no private DNS on Tor, AFAIK
17:26:27 <lovenomalice> Anyway, so I take it that Tor/VPN configs somehow override user DNS configs, including private DNS?
17:26:54 <lovenomalice> Actually, that doesn't quite make sense, sorry
17:27:14 <lovenomalice> First, am I right that private DNS isn't routed over Tor?
17:27:30 <Ultron[m]> <lovenomalice "First, am I right that private D"> Yes.
17:27:35 <lovenomalice> thanks
17:27:57 <lovenomalice> If I don't use private DNS, is DNS routed over Tor?
17:28:43 <lovenomalice> (And I appreciate you all answering my questions - if you read the FAQ, etc. as requested, you come with tougher questions! :)  )
17:29:41 <Autopsy[m]> <lovenomalice "(And I appreciate you all answer"> Makes a change
17:30:43 <lovenomalice> I'm not trying to find faults in GOS; I think it's great. I just want to know what my phone is doing.
17:30:50 <Ultron[m]> <lovenomalice "If I don't use private DNS, is D"> Tor bypasses your DNS settings. Exit node resolves the DNS.
17:31:18 <lovenomalice> I didn't know that; thanks. I'm going to have to read up on it.
17:32:03 <lovenomalice> Just one more ... :)
17:32:45 <lovenomalice> Connectivity monitoring - I understand why Google's servers are used, to blend in for anonymity. Can I disable connectivity monitoring? I can manually handle captive portals, but is there a way to handle network failover? Also, can I subsitute different servers (without compiling my own OS)?
17:34:24 <Ultron[m]> It's not recommended to change the captive portal servers / disable the captive portal check as you read in the FAQ. If you still want to do it then you can make the change via ADB.
17:36:17 <lovenomalice> Thanks. I get it. Do you know what happens to network failover if it's disabled?
17:36:25 <Ultron[m]> GOS uses Cloudflare as the fallover DNS. You cannot change it without root / recompiling the OS.
17:36:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> DNS isn't routed over tor
17:37:03 <Ultron[m]> But the need to go to fallover DNS will be very rare. Set whatever primary DNS you want to set in the Private DNS Setting.
17:37:36 <Ultron[m]> <lovenomalice "Thanks. I get it. Do you know wh"> Did you mean disabling private DNS?
17:37:49 <lovenomalice> No, disabling the connectivity check
17:38:49 <lovenomalice> If I understand correctly, if the connectivity check fails on, for example, Wifi network, the OS fails over to, for example, cellular.
17:38:54 <Ultron[m]> I am not sure but you will get a message that you are not connected to internet as notification even if you are connected.
17:39:07 <lovenomalice> Ah, that's interesting
17:39:56 <Ultron[m]> You can try playing with it using some adb commands and see what it does for you.
17:39:59 * Ultron[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZcyVAuWMERgXRmvhhjlVGGPr/message.txt >
17:40:20 <Ultron[m]> But it's really an empty request. So nothing to be concerned of.
17:41:18 <lovenomalice> I just don't want to keep notifying Google. I understand the risks are minimized.
17:42:29 <Ultron[m]> Yes but then you stand out. All other Pixels are pinging to Google for connectivity check and yours is not.
17:43:08 <lovenomalice> Yeah, I know. However, I stand out to the ISP. Google doesn't know my Pixel is on.
17:43:33 <Ultron[m]> True.
17:43:34 <lovenomalice> (and only if the ISP figures out I have a Pixel)
17:44:18 <lovenomalice> I'd love to route my DNS requests over VPN or Tor. I understand that neither private nor non-private DNS is routed over Tor
17:45:02 <lovenomalice> Someone said VPNs use their internal DNS resolution. How do I get my DNS routed to that? If I use Private DNS, it doesn't touch the VPN.
17:45:09 <strcat[m]> if you use a VPN service, the DNS traffic goes over that
17:45:13 <Ultron[m]> You can also change to GOS for connectivity checks. Not sure if the server is up. Do check.
17:45:16 * Ultron[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/TNfXOSVhfTlRrDcddhvIQxIe/message.txt >
17:45:17 <strcat[m]> whether or not you use Private DNS
17:45:28 <lovenomalice> Thanks strcat!
17:45:34 <lovenomalice> Is that true for Tor too?
17:45:34 <strcat[m]> the connectivitycheck server works fine
17:45:51 <strcat[m]> if you use Tor via a VPN service, all traffic is routed through it
17:45:54 <strcat[m]> DNS is routed through it
17:45:59 <strcat[m]> I don't know why you'd think otherwise
17:46:11 <lovenomalice> What I mean is, if I use Tor without VPN
17:46:15 <strcat[m]> Private DNS makes the OS uses DNS-over-TLS, it doesn't change how DNS is routed
17:46:19 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you mean by that
17:46:32 <strcat[m]> Tor on Android is generally used via a VPN service
17:46:39 <strcat[m]> I don't know how else you would be routing all the traffic through it
17:47:04 <lovenomalice> I agree. I thought that because of this comment: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200722#c4473164
17:47:38 <strcat[m]> lots of people post inaccurate info here
17:47:43 <lovenomalice> and another one above
17:47:44 <strcat[m]> someone else could reference the inaccurate info you posted
17:47:53 <strcat[m]> the IRC logs are likely going to be taken down
17:48:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let me know when that happens ^
17:48:42 <strcat[m]> you should just read the FAQ which covers these topics
17:48:56 <strcat[m]> it is expected that people read relevant FAQ sections
17:49:08 <lovenomalice> I hope you don't do that. I would just post a warning. I knew not to trust the old comment completely, which is why I asked. Also, I think most people know to have a bit of skepticism
17:49:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is quite possibly the only place on the internet you can directly search my messages
17:49:39 <lovenomalice> I did read the FAQ, usage guide, install guide, looked through IRC logs, and at some of your old comments :)
17:49:47 <lovenomalice> My questions aren't overed in them
17:49:52 <lovenomalice> *covered
17:50:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> lovenomalice: basically you don't need private dns if you're using a VPN
17:50:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> VPNs already use an internal DNS
17:50:54 <lovenomalice> > someone else could reference the inaccurate info you posted -- I didn't post any, other than citing others in this conversation. Let's stop pointing figures and we'll probably get a lot more done.
17:51:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> That only customers have access to
17:51:04 <lovenomalice> *fingers :)
17:51:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> As for tor
17:51:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Malicious exit nodes don't exist on VPNs
17:51:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> They do on tor
17:52:06 <lovenomalice> > Malicious exit nodes don't exist on VPNs -- Yes they do!
17:52:12 <lovenomalice> Plenty of malicious VPN services
17:52:34 <lovenomalice> Ask the people in Hong Kong whose 'anonymous' vpn logged their sessions.
17:52:56 <Ultron[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Malicious exit nodes don't exist"> Off-topic but can they do any damage on a https connection?
17:53:05 <lovenomalice> anyway, that's getting off-topic
17:53:32 <lovenomalice> Ultron - they can glean any info that your ISP can when you don't use a VPN
17:54:12 <lovenomalice> a VPN effectively shifts your ISP's power to the VPN provider (for these purposes)
17:54:46 <lovenomalice> If you don't trust your VPN more than your ISP, then you haven't improved your situation.
17:55:30 <Ultron[m]> Okay. There is a off-topic group which you can join. #grapheneos-offtopic
17:56:06 <lovenomalice> thanks. I'll drop it. ...
17:57:03 <Seplx[m]> <Ultron[m] "Off-topic but can they do any da"> They see the websites you connect to. So if you connect to example-com/joe they will only see example-com and they will not see the contents of the site. This is still valuable information
17:57:29 <Ultron[m]> Thanks. That's what I wanted to know.
18:04:10 <lovenomalice> Was I booted or is it just that I typed "dr-p"?
18:05:40 <lovenomalice> Anyway, *having read the FAQ in detail*, there are a few sections that are unclear. How does one submit updates?
18:06:48 <Ultron[m]> Don't know but there is some problem. Users gets removed and then re-join.
18:07:10 <lovenomalice> It's fine.
18:08:08 <Ultron[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/blob/master/static/faq.html
18:08:30 <Ultron[m]> Contribute to FAQ through github may be?
18:09:17 <lovenomalice> If that's the accepted channel ... I just don't want to go on a wild goose chase trying to find out if and how to contirbute.
18:11:04 <lovenomalice> Anyway, here are a couple: 1) The FAQ says that enabling OEM Unlocking "requires internet access on devices with Google Play services as part of Factory Reset Protection (FRP)".
18:11:43 <lovenomalice> I'd add to that, "if the device has a Google account configured on it", assuming that's accurate.
18:12:24 <Autopsy[m]> has or had, perhaps. It needs verification, though.
18:12:40 <lovenomalice> Good point
18:13:15 <lovenomalice> Also, perhaps it requires a Google account on which FRP was enabled
18:13:25 <Autopsy[m]> Because, the current FAQ statement covers everything, imo. Check first, if you need interwebs, then use interwebs.
18:13:27 <Autopsy[m]> <lovenomalice "Also, perhaps it requires a Goog"> That, too.
18:14:00 <lovenomalice> It could be worded more generally: "If the device has or had a Google account on it, you *may* need an Internet connection ..."
18:15:10 <lovenomalice> 2) The FAQ says, "It isn't possible to directly override the DNS servers provided by the network via DHCP" and "you shouldn't misuse the static IP address option just to
18:15:41 <lovenomalice> That makes no sense to an old sysadmin. The point of static DNS configs is to override network-provided ones.
18:16:07 <lovenomalice> I'm sure it makes sense in some way, but some clarification would be useful.
18:19:07 <lovenomalice> Thanks to everyone who helped. I hope GrapheneOS grows leaps and bounds - it's one of the most important projects around, IMHO. So I mean the following in the interest of that happening:
18:20:23 <lovenomalice> I want you guys to do well and you'll need a community to do that, of course.
18:21:24 <lovenomalice> I've been involved in FOSS for many years, on a low level, and volunteer plenty otherwise. I'd hesitate to join this community - the hostility I encountered, including from the leader, tells me a few things:
18:22:13 <lovenomalice> First, it's going to be hard to grow unless that changes, and that will limit the success of my efforts.
18:22:25 <lovenomalice> Second, I don't want to be around that hostility
18:23:29 <lovenomalice> I really do wish you well. I hope that didn't come across as too obnoxious. I'm not trying to point fingers, I just want to see GOS thrive.
18:23:35 <lovenomalice> drop

18:31:50 <gizmodroid[m]> Popped in here to see about the sound issue on the Sept 10th beta on Pixel 3. Then I see that its been reported and issue has been created and closed:

18:31:50 <gizmodroid[m]> Good job :) Thanks!

18:38:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk who has been hostile to this snowflake
18:38:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> But ok
18:47:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> gizmodroid: might look out of context but there are weird messages above you
18:47:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> That you might have missed
18:52:34 <gizmodroid[m]> Haha, yeah, I saw that. All good
20:33:16 <Cyrinux[m]> Hi folks, I maybe miss the info, there will be at least 2 version of the pixel 4a, the 4G and 5G, both will be supported?
20:33:46 <propertype[m]> I don't have any sound problems with the release from yesterday. Tried Newpipe, Spotify, YouTube... Calls are fine too
20:40:39 <lickidysplit[m]> 3a xl reporting 0 issues with sounds over skytube / calls / music etc. 👍 nothing's broken for me yet but that being said I did go to sleep after the OTA last night so haven't been able to play with much. Will do some testing today with different applications in different circumstances and log any crashes that happen
20:50:28 <hydraulicus[m]> Since I updated this morning,  I am unable to make any calls. When I try and make a call, the phone app crashes and the phone freezes requiring a reset. My phone is a 3 XL.
21:34:01 <asuh[m]> For the 3a users here, is there any external app or built-in functionality in GrapheneOS that can force the phone to use a specific band?
21:41:22 <asuh[m]> For background, I attempted to do the impossible and use the phone with a Sprint account. Voice and text work fine, LTE does not. My thought is forcing it to use a T-Mobile band could be a way to get LTE access.
21:49:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> asuh: not implemented
21:52:54 <asuh[m]> anupritaisno1: ok. and I also noticed Network & Internet > Mobile network > Advanced > Carrier Settings is disabled, which I suppose could be related
21:54:20 <asuh[m]> I was surprised I could even get it activated, but disappointed they couldn't find a way to let me use T-Mobile's network by default. I know it's possible to do this with a standard 3a, but GrapheneOS is more limited so I could only get so far.
22:16:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> asuh: I'm working on that one
22:25:01 <asuh[m]> @anu
22:26:04 <asuh[m]> anupritaisno1: that's great. It appears there will come a time soon where Sprint users are automatically using T-Mobile so this won't be an issue in the, hopefully, near future. However, the ability to force a band could prove useful in general.
22:39:29 <alex-a-soto[m]> Curios if anyone is experiencing any problems with calls ending when using Android 10 native sip client?
22:39:58 <lickidysplit[m]> Beta update ?
22:39:59 <alex-a-soto[m]> * Curios if anyone is experiencing any problems with calls ending when using Android 10 native sip client after the most recent update on a 3a?
22:40:09 <alex-a-soto[m]> Yeah, beta update channel
22:40:21 <lickidysplit[m]> It's a known issue on some devices. Seems.like some are not affected
22:40:57 <alex-a-soto[m]> Ah was battling for hours trying to figure out what was wrong, also since I ported my number over
22:41:00 <lickidysplit[m]> Devs are working on it 👍 but it's been brought up already
22:41:48 <alex-a-soto[m]> Great! Is stable recommended in the mean time?
22:42:44 <lickidysplit[m]> I think another beta is going to be released and the changes rolled back
22:43:22 <lickidysplit[m]> Stable won't force you onto the stable channel till there's a new stable update I believe
22:47:39 <fll[m]> <lickidysplit[m] "Stable won't force you onto the "> That is correct. You can't "downgrade" so to say. When you switch back to stable you will be back on stable with the next update on the stable channel.
22:49:26 <alex-a-soto[m]> Oh, I see, that's unfortunate, I guess I will use linphone in the meantime.
