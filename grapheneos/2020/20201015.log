00:31:00 <tk321[m]> hello, having issue flashing, using windows, says fastboot too old
00:31:19 <tk321[m]> but downloaded newest one running 30.0.4
00:35:41 <tk321[m]> tried restarting pc same issue
00:35:53 * tk321[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/iPEbIhWURbevjjKwZdOvTHSf/message.txt >
00:39:46 <res4[m]> You have to add platform tools to your Path.
00:52:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <tk321[m] "tried restarting pc same issue"> Yeah I am going to fix this annoying shite lol
01:00:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> [tk321](https://matrix.to/#/@tk321:matrix.org) you need to add fastboot to your PATH
01:00:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> PM me if you need remote support
01:04:49 <tk321[m]> hmm lemme try
01:05:11 <tk321[m]> dont know how to pm, just using a browser for this chat lol
01:06:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> <tk321[m] "hmm lemme try"> OK, then please read the install guide again
01:06:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Everything is documented there
01:06:15 <res4[m]> The command for it is on the Installation guide, or you can do it by going into your Advanced System Settings.
01:06:39 <tk321[m]> ok going to look for it again
01:06:52 <LinusSexTips[m]> it's just one command
01:07:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seems this is going to be a remote support thing
01:09:05 <tk321[m]> sry im a noob with command prompt
01:09:19 <tk321[m]> the folder i have everything in is in downloads
01:10:48 <tk321[m]> i put everything in a folder called platform-tools in downloads to make it simpler
01:12:28 <res4[m]> So you downloaded it manually? platform-tools should have automatically been a folder when extracting the zip file.
01:13:37 <tk321[m]> yes i dl it manually, but changed name to make easier to cd into it in command prompt
01:14:11 <tk321[m]> but i changed it back to platform-tools no extra folder inside there. just the folder platform-tools in downloads and insider there everything is extracted including the rom
01:16:57 <res4[m]> Sounds alright to me. Then just add it to your Path.
01:20:02 <tk321[m]> done, anu helped
01:20:19 <res4[m]> Alright, glad to hear it.
01:20:41 <res4[m]> Don't worry. We'll get through this together.
01:21:10 <tk321[m]> ;) quick question, whats a good linux to learn on, want to give it a try, havent been on linux in years
01:21:23 <tk321[m]> i tried mx but it didnt recognize the hdmi for my 2nd screen, tried mint, and seems to work
01:21:26 <tk321[m]> any better alternatives?
01:22:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Issue resolved
01:22:35 <tk321[m]> btw phone just says fastboot mode, i think we flashed it and locked the bootloader. how do i start the os lol
01:22:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> [tk321](https://matrix.to/#/@tk321:matrix.org) you press the power button
01:23:32 <tk321[m]> bootslot:b enter reason: no valid slot to boot
01:23:35 <res4[m]> <tk321[m] "any better alternatives?"> I think Mint is pretty much the most beginner-friendly, but hides its Linuxy-nature maybe a bit too much. I'd recommend going for something popular with a lot of community support. However, this is off-topic and should not be discussed here.
01:23:45 <tk321[m]> k
01:23:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> [tk321](https://matrix.to/#/@tk321:matrix.org) ah yeah great one sec
01:24:13 <tk321[m]> how do i get phone to start the os,? looks like we flashed and locked the bootloader
01:24:18 <tk321[m]> but still shows that screen with the red !
01:28:16 <tk321[m]> hmm enter reason : no valid slot to boot
01:28:22 <tk321[m]> am i missing something
01:30:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
01:33:56 <tk321[m]> i think something went wrong with the flash :(
01:36:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> tk321 can you just reply in the PM instead of spamming here?
01:39:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> [tk321](https://matrix.to/#/@tk321:matrix.org) so just send me the details again I'll take a look
01:39:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seems you somehow triggered a known bug on the pixel 4
01:41:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Man I'm sleeping
01:41:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> [res4](https://matrix.to/#/@res4:matrix.org) can you take over?
01:42:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> So basically there's this bug that sometimes gets triggered on the pixel 4 where the bootloader believes a slot is corrupt and never tries to boot it
01:42:08 <res4[m]> I wish, but I don't have any experience with that bug. Sorry
01:42:31 <tk321[m]> im going to try on a mac
01:42:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it just happens quite randomly. I've had it several times while developing for the 4
01:42:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> [res4](https://matrix.to/#/@res4:matrix.org) basically he needs to just unlock the bootloader again
01:42:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Run the flash script once again
01:43:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> And hope that this time the bootloader doesn't fuck it up
01:43:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's it
01:43:23 <res4[m]> Oh, okay.
01:43:38 <tk321[m]> when i get to this step, $env:Path = "$pwd$env:Path"
01:43:47 <tk321[m]> do i copy that exactly? or do i change something depending on my path
01:43:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> <res4[m] "Oh, okay."> You can also make him sideload the graphene OTA in recovery
01:43:57 <tk321[m]> if i followed the dl instructions in terminal
01:44:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> That works too
01:44:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> [tk321](https://matrix.to/#/@tk321:matrix.org) this is a known bug on the pixel 4
01:44:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> You flash it on a mac, use a different USB port or whatever it is the software on the phone that is at fault
01:45:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot flashing unlock
01:45:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unlock the bootloader with that
01:45:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Run the flash script again
01:45:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then lock it again
01:45:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> That is all
01:47:12 <res4[m]> ttk321 I can PM with you if you want someone to go through the steps with you.
01:47:22 <tk321[m]> sure please do
01:48:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> [res4](https://matrix.to/#/@res4:matrix.org)
01:48:14 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20201015_071750_555.jpg < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/hRvBmhGnJrkgLVJPgcIWEiEd/IMG_20201015_071750_555.jpg >
01:48:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seems he has ignored me by accident
01:48:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't know how you can do that by accident
01:49:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> But he's managed to do it
01:49:30 <res4[m]> Yeah that's weird.
01:49:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> [res4](https://matrix.to/#/@res4:matrix.org) anyway the fix is simple
01:50:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just tell him to flash again
01:50:25 <res4[m]> Yeah, I'll try my best.
01:50:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> [res4](https://matrix.to/#/@res4:matrix.org) or do one thing, take a screenshot of this chat and send it here again
01:50:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tell him to just send me the remote details again
01:51:51 <anupritaisno1> Hi
01:52:08 <anupritaisno1> tk321 surely you see this?
01:52:21 <anupritaisno1> It seems you hit the ignore button on my name by mistake
01:52:31 <anupritaisno1> Just send me the remote details again and I'll fix it
01:52:41 <tk321[m]> ok i see now
01:53:02 <res4[m]> LOL that's what happened, isn't it?
01:53:04 <anupritaisno1> Yeah so go back to our PM and send the details there
01:53:11 <tk321[m]> i left that room
01:53:16 <tk321[m]> and when i see ur name says no shared servers
01:53:25 <tk321[m]> the old name that is, send me a pm on the new name?
01:54:37 <tk321[m]> ok i uningored now lol
01:55:42 <anupritaisno157> Irc seems even worse than matrix lol
02:08:53 <res4[m]> Is it working?
02:14:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Resolved
02:15:01 <res4[m]> Thank goodness.
02:15:22 <tk321[m]> done
02:15:56 <tk321[m]> in graphene thanks a million guys
02:16:53 <res4[m]> I always knew you'd make it. Anuprita ain't number 1 for nothing.
02:19:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> [res4](https://matrix.to/#/@res4:matrix.org) "anuprita is no one"
02:20:52 <res4[m]> Well shoot.
02:22:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> I might have to look into teamviewer licenses soon then
02:22:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like, this is the third time I've used it to install the OS for someone else
02:23:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_system_sepolicy/pull/25
02:28:41 <res4[m]> GrapheneOS Customer Support ranks high in satisfaction.
02:37:58 <renlord> res4[m]: i didnt know we have a helpdesk
02:39:59 <res4[m]> I'm joking of course. TeamViewer just reminds me of those Microsoft Customer Support ads on shady websites.
02:40:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> [res4](https://matrix.to/#/@res4:matrix.org) bonus because I have an Indian IP
02:40:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> So it gives that scam alert notification too
02:40:56 <renlord> anupritaisno1[m]: you dont complain about geographical discrimination?
02:41:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> [renlord](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_renlord:matrix.org) no
02:41:34 <res4[m]> Oh, really? And you're using TeamViewer... That's even more brilliant now.
02:43:24 <res4[m]> If you started using a heavy accent and started every session with "GrapheneOS Customer Support, how may I help?", that would be the funniest thing.
02:44:44 <res4[m]> All the poor people that just wanted to install a private and secure mobile OS suddenly starting wondering what on earth they've gotten themselves into.
02:45:17 <res4[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "[renlord](https://matrix.to/#/@f"> Sorry, keep forgetting to reply directly.
02:56:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmm
02:56:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> You have reached grapheneOS custamur suppory sar
02:57:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> How mai I halp over tea viewer?
02:57:21 <res4[m]> Oh god, stop. I'm dying. xD
02:58:25 <res4[m]> GrapheneOS is so official, it finally has its very own shade customer support.
02:58:33 <res4[m]> *shady
02:58:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> OT
02:59:14 <res4[m]> Absolutely, I'm sorry.
03:00:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <res4[m] "GrapheneOS is so official, it fi"> I really advise deleting this btw
03:00:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> James et al. might abuse this message
03:00:31 <res4[m]> Yeah, will do. Don't want to be misleading.
03:05:46 <LinusSexTips[m]> you need a stock photo of a customer support rep with watermarks
03:18:50 <Sheru[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "BTW https://github.com/GrapheneO"> Nice
05:02:40 <M8942w[m]> hi  I'm new and I just got a pixel 3a. before I download GrapheneOS should I update it to android 11 or leave it at 10?
05:04:12 <bobfett> It is better to have the latest update before flashing GrapheneOS, some old bootloader can be buggy I think (it was the reason for asking to updates, I do not know if it is still the case or just good practice in case of problem in order to be able to help you)
05:04:57 <sphinxcat[m]> [8942w](https://matrix.to/#/@8942w:matrix.org): https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites
05:04:57 <sphinxcat[m]> > It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running into bugs, missing features or other differences in older firmware versions...
05:08:01 <bobfett> thanks sphinxcat
05:08:14 <M8942w[m]> Thank you. I was not sure if it being so new would change things
07:54:04 <hiace> Hey
07:54:07 <hiace> make[1]: *** [/home/dell/grapheneos-RP1A.201005.004.2020.10.06.02/kernel/google/crosshatch/Makefile:1107: vmlinux] Error 137
07:54:13 <hiace> While building the blueline kernel
07:55:09 <hiace> Do I miss some dependencies? Im not sure how to understand what causes the error while building
07:55:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> [hiace](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_hiace:matrix.org) please just use prebuilt if it doesn't work
07:56:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> A minimum of 32 GB RAM is required to build the kernel and even at 32 you can run out of memory
07:57:05 <hiace> make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/dell/grapheneos-RP1A.201005.004.2020.10.06.02/kernel/google/crosshatch/out'make: *** [Makefile:152: sub-make] Error 2
07:57:07 <hiace> Oh okey
07:57:19 <hiace> So it is a memory issue?
07:57:23 <hiace> I have 32gbs of ram
07:58:08 <doobry[m]> Hi, I'm new to GrapheneOS and just wanted to share that I'm super excited to see some evidence that the Pixel 4a will be supported soon. Really looking forward to use GrapheneOS. Thanks so much for your work!
07:58:16 <hiace> Thanks anupritaisno1, where is the prebuilt kernels located? I thought that was only for Pixel 4s atm
07:59:53 <hiace> If I want to try and build the kernel again. Can I just rm -rf /out in the kernel/google/crosshatch folder?
10:00:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> [hiace](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_hiace:matrix.org) yeah I just checked
10:00:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't have prebuilts for the 3
10:02:29 <xsmoke[m]> hallo =)
10:02:53 <xsmoke[m]> i am new here and try to get my new shiny pixel 3a to work with graphene
10:03:12 <xsmoke[m]> but i seem to do something wrong
10:03:43 <xsmoke[m]> is there anyone who could help me troubleshoot?
10:04:57 <xsmoke[m]> i unlocked the device via adb and can't get adb to flash my device =(
10:34:56 <alzxjm[m]> xsmoke: Are you following [these instructions](https://grapheneos.org/install)?
10:36:14 <xsmoke[m]> i followed this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc
10:36:15 <xsmoke[m]> and try to find the problem with your guide
10:36:27 <xsmoke[m]> at some point i have to flash-all
10:36:55 <xsmoke[m]> and after i hit the.bat file a screen opens and closes
10:36:56 <xsmoke[m]> nothing happens after that
10:37:32 <zyxt128[m]> open a console/terminal and run the flash-all.bat
10:37:49 <xsmoke[m]> win10
10:39:53 * zyxt128[m] uploaded an image: image.png (43KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/hjvLbFZTfZJzgWRfHYeSFQpG/image.png >
10:39:57 <alzxjm[m]> xsmoke: Are you using PowerShell? If not, you should. And definitely follow the directions on that site rather than a video.
10:40:27 <xsmoke[m]> powershell is like the terminal over on linux right?
10:41:35 <res4[m]> PowerShell is for Windows.
10:42:00 <xsmoke[m]> res why is the private conversation not working? Unable to decrypt: The secure channel with the sender was corrupted. Trying to create a new secure channel and re-requesting the keys.
10:43:11 <res4[m]> I don't know either.
10:43:14 <xsmoke[m]> <zyxt128[m] "image.png"> thanks but i really don't know what you are trying to tell me
10:43:47 <xsmoke[m]> <alzxjm[m] "xsmoke: Are you using PowerShell"> sry, i am not that godd at these things but i am wokring on getting rid of some major companies in my life
10:43:57 <xsmoke[m]> graphene is just the first step
10:44:16 <alzxjm[m]> xsmoke: You should use PowerShell on Windows and follow the instructions I sent. If you follow those to the letter, you will be fine.
10:44:53 <xsmoke[m]> alright, then i will try now to get things going
10:46:07 <res4[m]> Even if you already have some version of PowerShell installed, I'd recommend getting the latest version.
10:46:42 <xsmoke[m]> <res4[m] "Even if you already have some ve"> ok, i download that first
10:47:57 <xsmoke[m]> seems to be the latest version on my end
10:48:29 <res4[m]> Alright then, that's good.
10:49:15 <xsmoke[m]> i just entered this curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip
10:49:15 <xsmoke[m]> (Get-FileHash platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip).hash -eq "413182fff6c5957911e231b9e97e6be4fc6a539035e3dfb580b5c54bd5950fee"
10:49:15 <xsmoke[m]> tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip to my shell
10:49:24 <xsmoke[m]> and something happend :D
10:49:33 <xsmoke[m]> i feel like in 6. grade again
10:49:35 <xsmoke[m]> =)
10:49:57 <xsmoke[m]> and now i have to add a "path"?
10:50:24 <res4[m]> If you haven't done that yet, yes.
10:50:37 <res4[m]> It's just a command you see it on the installation guide.
10:50:39 <xsmoke[m]> question is what path?
10:50:50 <xsmoke[m]> ok
10:51:30 <xsmoke[m]> i used $pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path
10:51:33 <xsmoke[m]> and got an error message
10:52:20 <res4[m]> Send it please.
10:52:29 * xsmoke[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ECwuWkMiAvnYomSuyosqbYQK/message.txt >
10:57:51 <res4[m]> You have to send the entire command line. Copy paste it from the website.
10:58:14 <xsmoke[m]> with " " ?
10:58:22 <res4[m]> Sorry, you have to paste the entire line into your terminal is what I mean.
10:58:38 <xsmoke[m]> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
10:58:40 <xsmoke[m]> ?
10:58:48 <res4[m]> Yes
10:58:54 <xsmoke[m]> roger, copy
10:59:46 <xsmoke[m]> entered the line and powershell didnt give me any feedback
10:59:50 <xsmoke[m]> is that correct?
11:00:41 <res4[m]> Well you can try the sample output command.
11:01:37 <xsmoke[m]> <res4[m] "Well you can try the sample outp"> i can do what? =)
11:02:27 <res4[m]> You can run: fastboot --version
11:03:19 <res4[m]> And see if you get the correct response. It's on the installation guide, right before "Obtaining signify".
11:04:12 <xsmoke[m]> ok
11:06:03 <xsmoke[m]> i am at Flashing factory images
11:06:09 <xsmoke[m]> downloading the image
11:08:09 <xsmoke[m]> PS C:\Users\vciem> tar xvf crosshatch-factory-2020.05.05.02.zip

11:08:09 <xsmoke[m]> PS C:\Users\vciem>
11:09:38 <shurke> tar.exe does not understand .zip files
11:09:47 <shurke> just use windows explorer for unpacking a zip file
11:09:49 <makingaliasesisa> Cant you use 7zip
11:10:02 <shurke> or something like 7zip, yes
11:10:03 <makingaliasesisa> Or explorer
11:10:37 <makingaliasesisa> I forgot explorer can do that...
11:10:44 <xsmoke[m]> where are the files?
11:11:18 <xsmoke[m]> or do i just install 7zip and repeat the command in powershell?
11:14:41 <shurke> xsmoke[m]: what device do you have? a pixel 3a?
11:14:53 <xsmoke[m]> yes, pixel 3a
11:15:41 <shurke> then you should use https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-factory-2020.10.06.02.zip
11:15:56 <shurke> sargo, not the crosshatch zip you pasted above
11:16:09 <shurke> thats for th e pixel 3 XL afaik
11:16:30 <xsmoke[m]> aaaahhhhh
11:16:39 <xsmoke[m]> i gave the command to unpack the wrong file
11:16:45 <xsmoke[m]> thanks for that
11:16:57 <shurke> np ;)
11:17:05 <xsmoke[m]> i just copied it form the guide without correcting it
11:18:56 * xsmoke[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/CjepKgIGnIcXcIunMzLizYOc/message.txt >
11:18:59 <xsmoke[m]> that worked
11:19:06 * xsmoke[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/VOHVjlZKoPiiZSRzZOmsgkJm/message.txt >
11:19:21 <xsmoke[m]> but the step that should have, didn't
11:19:23 <xsmoke[m]> =(
11:24:16 <xsmoke[m]> what now?
11:30:31 <shurke> xsmoke[m]: that last message tells you, that no flash-all.bat is present in your current directory (C:\Users\vciem\)
11:31:00 <xsmoke[m]> thats a start. how can i change that?
11:31:06 <xsmoke[m]> i followed the guide =)
11:32:57 <shurke> you need to cd into your directory where you unpacked the .zip
11:33:26 <shurke> the flash-all.bat should be there
11:33:27 <xsmoke[m]> cd is a linux command isnt it?
11:33:40 <xsmoke[m]> or does it work with powershell too?
11:33:54 <res4[m]> Works on PowerShell too
11:34:32 <xsmoke[m]> where does tar xvf crosshatch-factory-2020.05.05.02.zip unpack the files to?
11:34:45 <xsmoke[m]> i mean tar xvf sargo-factory-2020.10.06.02.zip
11:35:35 <res4[m]> Wait. Just try cd sargo-factory-2020.10.06.02
11:35:44 <res4[m]> Have you done that already?
11:35:54 <xsmoke[m]> no
11:35:58 <xsmoke[m]> will do that now
11:36:24 <res4[m]> Ohhh, yeah. That might explain your issue.
11:36:37 <xsmoke[m]> and then i'll go with flash all bat?
11:36:46 <res4[m]> Right.
11:37:09 <xsmoke[m]> omfg something is happening
11:37:12 <xsmoke[m]> YEAH!
11:38:10 <xsmoke[m]> finally =)
11:40:34 <xsmoke[m]> so now i have to lock the dive again, right?
11:41:40 <res4[m]> Look the bootloader in the terminal, and confirm on your device with the Volume buttons to select and confirm with power button.
11:41:56 <res4[m]> * Lock the bootloader in the terminal, and confirm on your device with the Volume buttons to select and confirm with power button.
11:42:18 <xsmoke[m]> will that be enough: fastboot flashing lock?
11:43:07 <res4[m]> Yes
11:43:35 <xsmoke[m]> but im still cd in the factory folder
11:43:55 <xsmoke[m]> how can i reset powershell and how will it no that i mean my phone?
11:44:06 <xsmoke[m]> *know
11:46:02 <res4[m]> Did you get an error message?
11:46:45 <xsmoke[m]> after it finished loading i tried to go on with the next command line argument
11:47:00 <xsmoke[m]> and it showed me the following: PS C:\Users\vciem\sargo-factory-2020.10.06.02>
11:50:55 <res4[m]> Can anyone confirm or deny that that would be an issue? Seems okay to me. Why would they have to cd back?
11:52:20 <xsmoke[m]> res4: you think i should just go on and use the command anyway?
11:52:37 <xsmoke[m]> okay i will sit thight and wait
11:52:47 <xsmoke[m]> i am working on this since yesterday evening
11:52:52 <xsmoke[m]> so i can wait a little while longer
11:52:53 <xsmoke[m]> =)
11:54:08 <shurke> you can do 'fastboot flashing lock' from that folder too
11:54:18 <res4[m]> I'm just trying to be cautious, wouldn't want to give false information. I'd just do it from that folder.
11:54:34 <xsmoke[m]> ok
11:54:38 <xsmoke[m]> i will do that
11:54:38 <shurke> if it's in our $PATH and your system finds the fastboot executable, it'll work
11:54:58 <xsmoke[m]> dont worry res, any information is better then nothing
11:54:59 <res4[m]> That's what I'm thinking too.
11:55:30 <xsmoke[m]> done
11:55:34 <xsmoke[m]> amazing thank you

12:19:39 <mo67> Hey, I installed GrapheneOS in the beginning of the year and received OS updates normally. Then I installed Orbot and set `Block connections without VPN`. I think since then I don't receive OS updates anymore. In Orbot I allowed the following apps: CaptiveLoginPortal, Dynamic System Update, NetworkStack, Seamless Update Client, Settings, Setup
12:19:40 <mo67> Wizard, Vanadium System Web View. Is there any other app I need to allow to get updates again?
12:25:14 <xsmoke[m]> how do i import files on my phone? videos, pciture, music?

15:06:33 <justchill[m]> Out of curiosity, what would be the best practices if you wanted to use a password manager on GrapheneOS?
15:07:14 <justchill[m]> I'd prefer a local only copy which can't be accessed by any other apps.
15:08:43 <justchill[m]> I was thinking of KeepassDX but it stores the both the password db and the keyfile in common storage. (why isn't at least the key file in the app specific folder ooc? )
15:09:04 <justchill[m]> I know it's encrypted but it feels like an unnecessary attack surface to me.
15:16:32 <engulf[m]> Android 11 brought this cool feature; Scoped storage, you maybe want to look into that.
15:19:52 <alzxjm[m]> engulf: I think it was Android 10, but it wasn't compulsory.
15:23:36 <engulf[m]> Yes, it was introduced in Android 10, but enforced in 11
15:23:51 <engulf[m]>  * Android 10 brought this cool feature; Scoped storage, you maybe want to look into that.
15:26:02 <justchill[m]> I have the latest version of GrapheneOS which is already using Android 11. Are any of the password managers making use of this?
15:26:13 <justchill[m]> What password manager would people recommend?
15:27:08 <justchill[m]> I install all sorts of things on my desktop so I really don't want to access my passwords on my desktop in any way. So, my idea was to store my passwords on my Pixel and type them out when needed.

22:39:29 <Michael75> Hi Graphene community!
22:40:26 <Michael75> Can I get some help?
22:43:34 <dazinism> Michael75: probably, whats up?
22:45:44 <Michael75> Thanks for responding. I tried to flash Graphene on my Pixel 4 today. I was able to do everything but after locking the bootloader, I went to run the OS and it says that there is no valid OS. I gather this is a faily common problem, as others have written about it but no one seems to offer a solution. Can you help?
22:46:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Michael75 I see
22:46:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Boot recovery
22:46:57 <Michael75> Any suggestions would be gratefully received.
22:47:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> And sideload the GrapheneOS OTA
22:47:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's it
22:48:26 <Michael75> I'm sorry, I have no idea what that means.Can you talk me through it like I'm simple?
22:49:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Everything is documented on the documentation on the official website
22:51:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-sideloading
22:51:56 <craicbandicoot[m> <anupritaisno1[m] "But there's more to it than just"> Hey, thanks for the help and now I know it's an upstream issue I can do a little bit more research
23:08:46 <Michael75> Thanks for the advice on sideloading. I've had a look at the instructions and the bit where it says "boot into recovery" I can't do. I don't get a green android on its back, as described.
23:12:41 <Michael75> And can I just check, the OTA is for updates. Can you install/flash Graphene from scratch using this method?
23:13:13 <strcat[m]> no
23:13:18 <strcat[m]> you need the factory images to install GrapheneOS
23:13:28 <strcat[m]> follow the installation guide
23:14:11 <strcat[m]> Michael75: it sounds like you didn't fully flash the OS, you interrupted flashing early, didn't use a reliable USB cable / port, or used a broken OS
23:14:24 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install precisely as it's written there
23:17:00 <dazinism> strcat: think anu found a bug in the P4 where a new install isnt properly marked for boot
23:17:21 <Michael75> But I did that multiple times, repeated, double checked etc. Tried both the stable and beta, no luck.
23:17:38 <strcat[m]> stable and beta are the same release right now
23:17:45 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you don't have a proper environment for flashing
23:18:05 <dazinism> and when in this state sideloading an ota pulls it out?
23:18:27 <strcat[m]> it sounds like the flashing process is being interrupted before flashing via fastbootd can finish
23:18:41 <strcat[m]> as I said above
23:18:48 <strcat[m]> the solution is using a proper setup where flashing isn't interrupted
23:18:51 <strcat[m]> before it can finish
23:19:28 <strcat[m]> sure maybe you can work around it by sideloading an OTA and then locking since it sounds like boot was flashed and the userspace OS was not
23:19:37 <strcat[m]> but that is not a solution to the actual problem
23:19:43 <strcat[m]> which is interrupting the flashing process before it finishes
23:19:49 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound like a bug to me
23:19:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) no it's a bug I've personally faced
23:20:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Several times
23:20:08 <strcat[m]> sounds like a USB issue to me
23:20:19 <strcat[m]> unreliable USB controller
23:20:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> If the pixel 4 bootloader thinks the slot is unbootable it will never try to boot at all
23:20:35 <Michael75> That sounds right to me, I can unlock/lock the bootloader, I can begin the flashing process, it just doesn't seem to finish, beacause every time I try to start the OS after flashing, I get error message that says there is no valid OS. Is there a solution to this?
23:20:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> And just keep falling back to the bootloader screen
23:21:02 <strcat[m]> Michael75: show the output
23:21:02 <strcat[m]> from flashing
23:21:11 <strcat[m]> sounds like it's hitting an error / getting interrupted and not finishing
23:21:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wait okay
23:21:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry seems I was confused
23:21:42 <strcat[m]> sounds like a USB issue to me
23:21:46 <strcat[m]> USB issues are common
23:21:51 <strcat[m]> USB is often / usually poorly implemented
23:25:14 <Michael75> When you say a USB issue, would trying a different USB port on the same computer be a workaround? Is it driver-related? I'm running a fairly old Dell Latitude E6230 on Win10.
23:27:07 <seashield[m]> Just to confuse things, Michael 75 is actually me, I’ve signed up to Matrix since, hence the two names.
23:28:13 <strcat[m]> Michael75: it indicates that the laptop doesn't have a properly working, reliable USB controller
23:28:41 <strcat[m]> the solution would be using a desktop's motherboard I/O ports, or a reliable laptop
23:29:08 <seashield[m]> So trying a different laptop might work?
23:29:30 <strcat[m]> yes
23:30:34 <seashield[m]> And is there anything I need to do to my phone before trying again? I can get back to stock Android 11 but unable to lock the boootloader.
23:33:10 <strcat[m]> just use a computer with working USB
23:33:27 <strcat[m]> it's quite possible you'll brick the device if you keep messing with it using that one
23:35:43 <seashield[m]> I can’t have a bricked device. That just won’t do.
23:38:35 <xander-salamande> I wonder if there's a way to test USB controller quality (aside from, you know, actually flashing a phone and seeing what happens)
23:40:38 <strcat[m]> computer case ports are mostly broken
23:40:42 <strcat[m]> old computers are mostly broken
23:40:56 <strcat[m]> modern laptops from crappy brands are mostly broken
23:41:03 <strcat[m]> external USB hubs are mostly broken
23:41:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "computer case ports are mostly b"> This
23:41:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Case ports for me usually break
23:41:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even when unused
23:41:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "external USB hubs are mostly bro"> Yes
23:41:27 <strcat[m]> many USB cables are broken, don't buy crappy brands of cables / hubs, they damage devices
23:41:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only the motherboard ports are reliable for me
23:41:35 <strcat[m]> they don't supply proper power etc
23:41:53 <strcat[m]> these things are involved in power negotiation etc
23:41:55 <strcat[m]> they aren't just a wire
23:42:05 <strcat[m]> they don't care about following the specs for resistors and so on
23:42:07 <strcat[m]> they do what they want
23:42:09 <strcat[m]> it's broken
23:42:37 <strcat[m]> laptops fall under the 'computer case ports are mostly broken' unless it's a good brand
23:42:50 <xander-salamande> wow
23:42:56 <JTL> From personal experience I think it's rather absurd how varied assorted USB ports can be
23:42:56 <seashield[m]> The thing is, the USB works. It recognises the device, and I used it to read data from memory sticks etc.
23:42:56 <strcat[m]> motherboards from any decent brand have working USB ports
23:43:04 <strcat[m]> seashield: does not mean it works
23:43:22 <strcat[m]> seashield: you're saying it "works" because with non-demanding usage you don't *see* problems happening
23:43:53 <seashield[m]> Wow, you learn something new every day
23:44:05 <seashield[m]> BTW, why is your text red?
23:44:11 <strcat[m]> and also I'm sure Windows kernel just makes another attempt on I/O errors
23:44:19 <strcat[m]> I don't know which client you use
23:44:34 <strcat[m]> probably how it shows that I mentioned you like seashield
23:44:42 <JTL> I had a DAC box that came with a very thin gauge USB cable with flimsy connectors that wouldn't properly seat in the DAC's USB port and with said cable it was very prone to disconnects because of (quite possible) interference
23:44:44 <JTL> (as an example)
23:44:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> [seashield](https://matrix.to/#/@seashield:matrix.org) iirc most of your USB devices do a verify operation
23:45:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> And simply request data that doesn't match a checksum again
23:45:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fastboot does not
23:45:18 <JTL> Replaced said cable with a thicker shielded USB cable from an old printer and that solved the issues
23:45:24 <JTL> </sidetrack>
23:45:27 <strcat[m]> fastboot needs a reliable USB connection, it can't keep attempting the operations over and over until it works
23:45:37 <strcat[m]> it expects USB to actually be a reliable digital connection at a high level
23:45:39 <strcat[m]> and it should be
23:45:51 <seashield[m]> I kind of like jump starting a car battery then? It might work on small cars but bigger engines need thicker cables?
23:45:51 <strcat[m]> the USB protocol is supposed to be digital and paper over any issues underneath
23:46:00 <strcat[m]> seashield: no not really
23:46:11 <strcat[m]> seashield: you just have broken USB ports / USB controller, or whatever
23:46:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) maybe we can do an adb sideload guide for bad connections
23:46:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> adb should be much more resistant to this
23:46:22 <strcat[m]> it's broken - regardless of what you do with it, you're just not noticing it with the other stuff you do
23:46:37 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: not really, USB should work properly and it should be possible to rely upon it as a digital connection
23:47:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well it will just hard fail
23:47:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> And not switch the slot
23:47:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> <seashield[m] "BTW, why is your text red?"> Element bug
23:47:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> It won't let me verify this session
23:47:51 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: this isn't an encrypted session, don't think that's what they're talking about
23:47:53 <seashield[m]> So to be clear, can I do the lock/unlock boot loader bit but I would need a functioning USB port for the flashing bit?
23:48:03 <strcat[m]> seashield: just stop using it
23:48:25 <strcat[m]> don't use fastboot with it anymore
23:48:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> [seashield](https://matrix.to/#/@seashield:matrix.org) OK so basically your device doesn't boot right?
23:48:34 <strcat[m]> do it from a computer with a reliable USB implementation
23:48:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> And you have a pixel 4
23:48:54 <strcat[m]> I really don't think you should continue using it, get access to another computer
23:48:55 <strcat[m]> do it from there
23:48:59 <seashield[m]> anupritaisno1: correct
23:49:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> [seashield](https://matrix.to/#/@seashield:matrix.org) OK then what's the error?
23:50:09 <seashield[m]> strcat: Different computer altogether? Not just different port?
23:50:25 <strcat[m]> yes do as I said
23:50:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <seashield[m] "strcat: Different computer altog"> Show me the error
23:53:53 <seashield[m]> anupritaisno1: follow instructions on graphene website, I can do the lock/unlock boot loader bits, device recognised. When I flash, it does things but seems to cut short. Then when I lick the boot loader to run the OS, it just says “No valid OS found. Device will not start.” So I have to unlock the bootloader again and go back to stock Android 11. Only I can’t lock the bootloader in Android because when I do, i
23:53:53 <seashield[m]> back to saying no valid is etc.
23:54:35 <xander-salamande> <seashield[m] "anupritaisno1: follow instructio"> Do you get any type of e.g. console output when things cut short?
23:55:05 <strcat[m]> flash from a computer with working USB controller / ports
23:55:08 <strcat[m]> using a working USB cable

23:55:28 <strcat[m]> doesn't need to keep going indefinitely, the problem is clear
