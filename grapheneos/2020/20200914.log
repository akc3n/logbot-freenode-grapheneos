00:01:37 <bypassbob[m]> Imagine you could set the biometric so you it only recognised a page of a book on that would be more secure
00:02:46 <cn3m[m]> people would catch on quick
00:04:28 <analtenderloin[m> Anyone know if there's a way to disable system webview webrtc so no IP leak?
00:05:37 <faxing[m]> Are there any plans to implement a system where you'd need to use a password and a fingerprint?
00:06:36 <bypassbob[m]> Is there not 2FA password and biometric already?
00:07:24 <faxing[m]> I couldn't find anything on my 3a XL for needing both a fingerprint and a password to login
00:07:51 <faxing[m]> I could just be missing something, though
00:09:50 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m "Anyone know if there's a way to "> there should be no issue in general
00:10:54 <lev[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "As a fall back, there is nothing"> I've always taken that to mean, "degoogle my life," as in remove the influence/filtration imposed Google from the way you ingest data and experience the world
00:11:42 <lev[m]> though I do also appreciate the desire for technical specificity
00:13:06 <lev[m]> * I've always taken that to mean, "degoogle my life," as in remove the influence/filtration imposed by Google from the way you ingest data and experience the world
00:13:13 <aeonsolution[m]> i understand the sentiment but it doesn't apply to AOSP, i hate the semantics of it but its an important distinction we have to make because of how the phrase is being used to describe GrapheneOS
00:13:55 <aeonsolution[m]> and then users and the community only use that a reference point to all features and apps
00:14:32 <lev[m]> yeah that's totally reasonable, language is important
00:14:33 <aeonsolution[m]> is this or that degoogled, etc without understanding what that means
00:15:03 <aeonsolution[m]> at least with regards to GrapheneOS
00:15:10 <Iusearchbtw[m]> This conversation is just cringe
00:15:33 <lev[m]> my elevator pitch for this project is usually just, "Android derivative focused on hardening/security/privacy"
00:16:07 <lev[m]> hey you take that back... my own mother is 48% cringe, so you're insulting my people
00:16:25 <Iusearchbtw[m]> We don't ship google apps because they literally won't run
00:16:56 <Iusearchbtw[m]> You wanna go ahead? Try it. See what happens when everything comes crashing
00:17:13 <Iusearchbtw[m]> We also do remove a fair amount of apps that rely on gms
00:17:49 <cn3m[m]> what requires GMS in AOSP?
00:18:03 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Also we don't want to ship gms for security reasons
00:18:09 <lev[m]> tbf gboard, gcam, gmaps (I think), gphotos all work fine
00:18:13 <Iusearchbtw[m]> They are apps that we technically can't sign ourselves
00:18:58 <lev[m]> though authentication into a Google account fails, I would presume
00:19:50 <faxing[m]> I just added a fingerprint and still kept my passcode but I can get in to my phone by just using one
00:20:02 <Iusearchbtw[m]> faxing: yes
00:20:26 <snowkeld[m]> <faxing[m] "Is it better to use the default "> Signal is for signal messages. Using it for regular sms has no benefit over stock app besides having everything in one place. Signal<>signal communication is much better than sms.
00:20:32 <faxing[m]> <Iusearchbtw[m] "faxing: yes "> That's what I was asking someone earlier and it sounded like you could have it force both to get it, you can't?
00:20:40 <Iusearchbtw[m]> No
00:20:45 <faxing[m]> Oh yikes
00:20:53 <faxing[m]> Are there any plans to implement something like that
00:20:55 <faxing[m]>  * Are there any plans to implement something like that?
00:20:55 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Firstly faxing let's say your face hardware breaks
00:20:59 <lev[m]> using biometric auth requires a pin I think, but you only use one
00:20:59 <Iusearchbtw[m]> How do you unlock now?
00:21:34 <faxing[m]> I don't keep much on my phone so I'd just reset it if my fingerprint scanner broke
00:21:53 <Iusearchbtw[m]> But that's not realistic for almost everyone else here
00:23:27 <faxing[m]> I was just asking for the increased security
00:23:42 <faxing[m]> Thanks for the answer
00:23:58 <Iusearchbtw[m]> There is none
00:24:11 <Iusearchbtw[m]> For one you cannot access face data until you decrypt the phone
00:24:29 <faxing[m]> <snowkeld[m] "Signal is for signal messages. U"> Thanks! I know Signal encrypted messages are better, but sometimes I still need to use SMS, so I was just wondering if one was better than the other to use.
00:24:32 <ninjahmeh> hey folks
00:27:52 <bypassbob[m]> <Iusearchbtw[m] "For one you cannot access face d"> This maybe a really stupid question but how does the facial recognition even benefit security if the scanner can’t read the encrypted data
00:27:53 <ninjahmeh> what distros are folks using for graphene building? i just finally got a fairly stable install of mint running on my macbook but figured i would ask here if anyone had any suggestions on any that might be better suited, been a little while since i had a linux box and years back when i worked with zombi guys we mostly ran backbox
00:28:09 <cn3m[m]> the website covers that
00:28:28 <cn3m[m]> "Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are the officially supported operating systems for building GrapheneOS."
00:29:27 <cn3m[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies
00:29:37 <ninjahmeh> ah fair enough,  hmm not a fan of ubuntu really so may look into the other 2 before i go down into preparing my boxes environment
00:31:28 <ninjahmeh> i guess arch may be a learning curve thats worth the time if im going to get back into learning my arse from my elbow again
00:43:46 <snowkeld[m]> I've been on Debian for over 10 years.
00:44:05 <snowkeld[m]> Highly recommend
00:44:27 <cn3m[m]> not for security, but that is a topic for the other channel
00:50:52 <lev[m]> have people had issues building on mint?  I would kind of suprised if the instructions for ubuntu were unworkable on mint
00:51:03 <lev[m]> don't they share a very similar package base?
00:55:26 <snowkeld[m]> Mint is Ubuntu or Debian depending on version, though it is highly customized by mint devs. You would likely be fine with anything meant for the corresponding Ubuntu release, if using the Debian version of mint you might have a few more hiccups because it's rolling with Debian testing, or it was last time I looked
01:29:20 <aeonsolution[m]> if you dont want to have a bad time just use the officially supported operating systems, its not a good use of your time to figure out why your distro doesn't have the packages you need to be productive
01:32:34 <user937> i was looking to get a pixel phone with grapheneos to replace my samsung galaxy, but seeing all the problems people report in here, i'm not so sure anymore :(
01:37:19 <cn3m[m]> If you can handle a system with no gapps(disable it on your Samsung to test) go for it
01:37:51 <user937> the only i'd want is Google Maps
01:37:55 <cn3m[m]> I guess you could get an iPhone if that doesn't cut it if you want a serious GrapheneOS competitor
01:38:15 <user937> i'm not a fan of the iphone's UI
01:39:00 <cn3m[m]> <user937 "the only i'd want is Google Maps"> it works iirc
01:39:27 <user937> but i need a google account to use it right?
01:45:49 <Vappy[m]> <cn3m[m] "it works iirc"> Doesnt work on a fully degoogled phone, checked plexus
01:46:11 <Vappy[m]> It does work fine with microG
01:51:18 <cn3m[m]> <user937 "but i need a google account to u"> no
01:51:34 <cn3m[m]> It has worked with fully degoogled phones recenetly iirc
01:51:38 <cn3m[m]> it doesn't need an account
01:51:40 <user937> oh nice
01:51:44 <cn3m[m]> or you can use Maps Go
01:51:46 <cn3m[m]> which is Google
01:51:48 <cn3m[m]> no issue
01:51:50 <user937> perfect
01:52:07 <user937> is there a way to install grapheneos in a virtual environment to test it out?
02:01:43 <Iusearchbtw[m]> user937: no
02:05:03 <user937> ok thanks
02:05:45 <faxing[m]> And he's gone lol
02:12:43 <Iusearchbtw[m]> faxing: indeed
02:13:06 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Sometimes it is better to begone
02:13:06 <Iusearchbtw[m]> (This is sarcasm, for all the snowflakes)
02:13:48 <renlord[m]> i have a systemd-nspawn container if anyone wants
02:14:00 <renlord[m]>  * i have a systemd-nspawn container image if anyone wants
02:14:09 <renlord[m]> i gave up on docker
02:14:16 <renlord[m]> it is always broken with ipv6
02:40:39 <aeonsolution[m]> <renlord[m] "i have a systemd-nspawn containe"> im interested ✋
02:41:39 <renlord[m]> gotta tidy up a bit before i share
03:16:44 <louipc> what does fully degoogled mean?
03:17:26 <louipc> i refered to plexus too, but i guess its wrong
03:17:49 <louipc> Vappy[m]:
03:33:53 <aosidaisudh2039u> hi which build do i pick for building kernel for 3a ? , blueline ? crosshatch?
03:35:08 <cn3m[m]> aosidaisudh2039u: crosshatch is Pixel 3, blueline is Pixel 3 XL
03:35:34 <Vappy[m]> <louipc "what does fully degoogled mean?"> Uh, degoogled and fully degoogled are technically the same thing, but I was referring to the fact that degoogling your device means you would need to rid yourself off of Google services framework and Google play services, which some apps depend on to make their apps usable. If you remove GSF and GPServices from your device, some apps lose some functionality while other apps
03:35:35 <Vappy[m]> refuse to start.
03:35:59 <louipc> aosidaisudh2039u: sargo i think
03:36:36 <aosidaisudh2039u> it says invalid codename when i do ./build.sh
03:36:45 <aosidaisudh2039u> with sargo
03:37:36 <louipc> aosp_sargo?
03:38:46 <louipc> oh i see
03:38:59 <louipc> aosidaisudh2039u: https://grapheneos.org/build#kernel
03:39:08 <louipc> it crosshatch
03:40:18 <louipc> lol.. maybe bonito im confused
03:41:16 <aosidaisudh2039u> lol
03:41:19 <aosidaisudh2039u> what's right?
03:42:11 <aosidaisudh2039u> "Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL: crosshatch - separate crosshatch, blueline and bonito builds due to hardening"
03:42:16 <aosidaisudh2039u> i don't get this
03:42:42 <louipc> i would bet on bonito
03:42:53 <aosidaisudh2039u> because 3 is blueline, and 3a is bonito
03:42:58 <aosidaisudh2039u> 2 and 2
03:42:59 <cn3m[m]> aosidaisudh2039u: they use different kernels between device familys for hardening
03:42:59 <louipc> yea
03:43:05 <aosidaisudh2039u> cool
03:43:06 <cn3m[m]> families*
03:43:21 <cn3m[m]> so crosshatch is for 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL
03:43:24 <aosidaisudh2039u> thx guys
03:44:05 <louipc> i do recall strcat saying long ago that the new phones between normal and XL variant use the same build
03:44:33 <louipc> if im not mistaken
03:44:41 <strcat[m]> the crosshatch kernel sources cover 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL
03:44:43 <cn3m[m]> <louipc "i do recall strcat saying long a"> they are separate builds and even testing
03:44:51 <cn3m[m]> the kernel is shared
03:44:53 <strcat[m]> the stock OS uses the same kernel for 3 + 3 XL
03:44:59 <strcat[m]> and then another for 3a + 3a XL
03:45:01 <louipc> ah
03:45:04 <strcat[m]> we also use same for 3a + 3a XL
03:45:19 <strcat[m]> but we have a different kernel for 3 and 3 XL because we disable dynamic kernel modules and build in those modules instead
03:45:26 <strcat[m]> and the touchscreen driver is different for 3 and 3 XL
03:45:40 <strcat[m]> that's why we have blueline, crosshatch and bonito as the parameters to the script
03:45:56 <strcat[m]> docs try to explain this
03:46:27 <strcat[m]> if we did what the stock OS does, it'd just have crosshatch and bonito parameters
03:46:42 <strcat[m]> but we split blueline/crosshatch due to different touchscreen driver, which we built in
03:47:29 <Iusearchbtw[m]> louipc: 4 and 4xl use the same kernel btw
03:47:39 <Iusearchbtw[m]> There was no difference in drivers
03:47:44 <louipc> cool
03:54:30 <Ultron[m]> <louipc "google maps wont work"> It works but without the sign in functionality.
04:39:56 <aosidaisudh2039u> so far it has been ``./scripts/link-vmlinux.sh: line 93: 69661 Killed                  ${LD} ${LDFLAGS} -r -o ${1} $(modversions) ${objects}make[1]: *** [/home/shifted/Desktop/grapheneos-QQ3A.200805.001.2020.09.11.14/kernel/google/crosshatch/Makefile:1106: vmlinux] Error 137make[1]: Leaving directory

04:54:46 <aosidaisudh2039u> is this absolutely impossible to build on 6gb ?
04:55:28 <JTL> aosidaisudh2039u: Some aggressive use of swap might be a workaround, but LTO seems to be quite memory intensive
04:55:37 <Ultron[m]> Can any body give me how much time it takes to build GOS on a decent 4c/4t cpu, 16 gb ram and ssd?
04:55:51 <JTL> I don't have any recent benchmarks handy
04:56:30 <JTL> but I remember wih a skylake era xeon and 4 (around) 5400 rpm drives in RAID10 it took about ~3 hours I think?
04:56:34 <JTL> haven't done that in awhile
04:56:38 <inthewaves[m]>  * aosidaisudh2039u:  https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies says you need >= 16G ram
04:57:28 <Ultron[m]> <JTL "but I remember wih a skylake era"> Nice. I have a skylake cpu as well but consumer. i7 6700K.
04:57:48 <JTL> it was roughly the same performance as the 6700k
04:57:53 <JTL> except as a xeon
04:58:10 <JTL> that good enough for you to start with? :P
04:58:24 <Ultron[m]> Haha yes.

05:48:28 <mekanation[m]> Hello, I am trying to figure out which build to run for the pixel 3a, sargo is what is listed for the AOSP, but my options on the kernel are blueline, crosshatch or bonito. None of which are sargo. I've poured over the github and the readmes inside the kernel directory as well as looked at the bash script, but nothing is jumping out at me as "use this one!"
05:50:03 <Lia[m]> bonito?
05:50:07 <louipc> bonito
05:50:30 <Lia[m]> <Lia[m] "Problems I encountered as I foll"> Need help here, I can't test patches without it being able to be installed as user app
05:50:42 <louipc> mekanation[m]: yea i guess the build instructions could be worded better
05:51:39 <mekanation[m]> Awesome thanks!  I was really trying to not ask a stupid question but its a bit of a big build to get wrong
05:52:05 <Lia[m]> I used the default args.gn, changed it, generated my certdigest
05:52:08 <Lia[m]> But nothing works
06:24:11 <strcat[m]> Lia: you're not using the correct cert digest
06:24:24 <strcat[m]> or you're not signing it
06:27:33 <mekanation[m]> Id love to help out grapheneOS more, but I dont have a ton of experience with android development, just core java and some C. Are there any devs willing to mentor? or maybe some beginner friendly bug fixes?
06:34:29 <cn3m[m]> mekanation: I can recommend some starter issues that you would have no problem with basic knowledge thanks for the interest
06:34:35 <cn3m[m]> do you have the build setup?
06:37:21 <mekanation[m]> Most of the way done. How reliable is a emulator build over a for device build?
06:37:29 <mekanation[m]>  * Most of the way done. How reliable is an emulator build over a for device build?
06:38:22 <strcat[m]> the emulator is reliable, you're just limited in what you can work on since it doesn't have the full functionality of a real device and doesn't have features like verified boot from a root of trust
06:38:36 <strcat[m]> and GPU performance isn't good
06:38:44 <strcat[m]> especially on some poor quality drivers
06:52:50 <louipc> mekanation[m]: you could make cool non-google apps too :D
06:53:01 <mekanation[m]> Is the correct order of operations write some code then buiild, or build so you have a base, write some code then build only difs?
06:53:29 <mekanation[m]> I'm game for anything louipc
06:53:56 <louipc> i think that depends on the changes youre doing
06:55:44 <louipc> refactoring gonna need fresh builds usually
06:58:41 <strcat[m]> very few changes require fresh builds
06:58:51 <strcat[m]> mekanation: get working builds without any changes first
06:58:58 <strcat[m]> make changes, do an incremental build, test it
06:59:23 <strcat[m]> you do not need to do a fresh build except in rare cases or before you're going to send in changes in a PR to make sure it works properly
06:59:55 <louipc> yea good idea
07:01:38 <Lia[m]> <strcat[m] "Lia: you're not using the correc"> Made and signed one before, probably because I initially cancelled the ninja with wrong certdigest

07:02:33 <strcat[m]> Lia: did you run gn args again with the new certdigest?
07:02:39 <strcat[m]> if you change args.gn you need to run gn args again
07:02:40 <Lia[m]> <strcat[m] "Lia: did you run gn args again w"> Yeah
07:03:00 <strcat[m]> I would recommend double checking it's the right certdigest and doing a clean build with it
07:03:01 <Lia[m]> Cancelled and changed it
07:03:08 <strcat[m]> make sure you matched the case it uses
07:03:12 <strcat[m]> needs to be same format
07:05:02 <Lia[m]> Retrying before rebuilding cleanly as it takes a long time
07:06:34 <Lia[m]> Should the build not be interrupted? Leaving my device the whole day is not an option for now
07:09:23 <strcat[m]> interrupting it is usually fine but may sometimes cause an issue
07:09:26 <strcat[m]> I don't think that's the issue
07:09:38 <strcat[m]> the issue may be that you cannot change that part of the build configuration without a clean build
07:15:21 <Lia[m]> Just to be clear, it's not only the src/out I should delete?
07:15:30 <Lia[m]> Tested one last time and it failed

07:29:49 <strcat[m]> instead of piping to sha256sum

09:38:57 <Seplx[m]> <lickidyspl1t[m] "If I were to donate $500 AUD to "> Changing imei is illegal
09:46:12 <louipc> what if theres no imei to start with
09:46:40 <cn3m[m]> louipc: yeah I use VoIP for everything
09:48:07 <louipc> good idea
09:57:29 <Ultron[m]> <cn3m[m] "louipc: yeah I use VoIP for ever"> But your device can be still traced via the IMEI, right?
10:17:57 <bypassbob[m]> <louipc "what if theres no imei to start "> What about the imsi?
10:17:57 <strcat[m]> Wi-Fi doesn't have an IMEI
10:18:10 <strcat[m]> prefer Wi-Fi
10:19:28 <Lia[m]> What do they mean when your location can be traced by wifi?
10:19:45 <Lia[m]> By the way, rebuilding is in progress (will take days probably)
10:19:48 <bypassbob[m]> WiFi triangulation is built into iPhones and android
10:20:50 <bypassbob[m]> Them google street view vans scanned WiFi data also
10:21:14 <louipc> bypassbob[m]: same
10:21:34 <Lia[m]> Any case where wifi > ethernet?
10:21:45 <strcat[m]> bypassbob: not sure what the relevance is
10:21:49 <Lia[m]> In GrapheneOS
10:21:53 <Ultron[m]> <Lia[m] "Any case where wifi > ethernet?"> None. Ethernet wins in every scenario except mobility.
10:21:55 <strcat[m]> bypassbob: Wi-Fi supports anonymity, suggest reading the usage guide
10:22:19 <Lia[m]> Since there is full randomization on MAC on GOS.
10:22:20 <louipc> no wires to trip over with wifi
10:22:26 <bypassbob[m]> strcat: you said prefer WiFi. It’s relevant to you.
10:22:35 <strcat[m]> it's not relevant
10:22:48 <strcat[m]> read the usage guide
10:22:51 <bypassbob[m]> WiFi triangulation isn’t relevant to WiFi?
10:23:01 <strcat[m]> don't post misleading / false information here
10:23:38 <bypassbob[m]> How’s it false
10:23:52 <strcat[m]> explained above
10:24:01 <strcat[m]> Wi-Fi supports anonymity, which is the default
10:24:12 <bypassbob[m]> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system
10:24:14 <strcat[m]> it doesn't use unique / persistent identifiers
10:24:23 <strcat[m]> bypassbob: not relevant
10:24:27 <strcat[m]> we're talking about phone privacy
10:24:33 <louipc> bypassbob[m]: https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
10:24:34 <strcat[m]> not a STATIONARY Wi-Fi AP
10:25:47 <strcat[m]> using nearby Wi-Fi networks as a way to detect location has no relevance to the topic
10:26:27 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning for improving location detection are disabled by default, unlike the stock OS. These can be toggled in Settings ➔ Location ➔ Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning. These features enable scanning even when Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is disabled, so these need to be kept disabled to fully disable the radios when Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are disabled. GrapheneOS doesn't yet have an implementation of a coar
10:26:27 <lickidyspl1t[m]> location service to supplement GPS location, so enabling these options doesn't actually do anything at the moment. Implementing a supplementary location service is planning but we need a robust, secure and private implementation via a local database. The initial focus will likely be a cell phone tower database, so these features still wouldn't be relevant.
10:27:04 <lickidyspl1t[m]> > of a coarse location service to supplement GPS location, so enabling these options doesn't actually do anything at the moment.
10:27:43 <lickidyspl1t[m]> 🤔 confusing lol. So they're useless features at the moment ?
10:28:38 <strcat[m]> what are you asking specifically?
10:28:50 <strcat[m]> I don't see anything confusing
10:29:05 <strcat[m]> it says there that we do not provide an implementation of those features, and regardless, that has no relevance to the topic
10:30:03 <bypassbob[m]> Do you think 2FA will be implemented in Graphene soon?
10:30:09 <strcat[m]> as explained there, Wi-Fi scanning is anonymous on these devices (without GrapheneOS too)
10:30:16 <strcat[m]> bypassbob: 2FA works fine on GrapheneOS, what exactly do you mean?
10:30:23 <strcat[m]> you mean 2FA to unlock?
10:30:34 <bypassbob[m]> Yes and power on
10:30:47 <bypassbob[m]> I haven’t got GrapheneOS yet just going off what I’ve read
10:30:52 <strcat[m]> bypassbob: there is only an unlock method (which decrypts), not a boot password, not how it works
10:30:55 <cn3m[m]> <bypassbob[m] "Yes and power on "> that won't happen
10:30:56 <strcat[m]> there is per-profile encryption
10:31:02 <bypassbob[m]> Here to learn more and ask questions
10:31:28 <strcat[m]> bypassbob: we aren't going to be implementing a 2nd factor for the main passphrase, it would result in people losing their data and a strong encryption is already more than enough
10:31:37 <strcat[m]> the plan is to extend how secondary unlock works
10:31:52 <strcat[m]> recommend reading the planned feature on the tracker about having fingerprint + PIN 2 factor unlock
10:31:57 <strcat[m]>  * recommend reading the planned feature on the tracker about having fingerprint + PIN 2 factor secondary unlock
10:32:04 <strcat[m]> does not impact primary unlock which should be a strong passphrase
10:32:25 <bypassbob[m]> How does it work on boot? I’ve had some expensive encrypted phones. That you have to press a certain button combination to boot the device if you don’t it boots a dummy os. After booting it requires password
10:32:34 <cn3m[m]> it takes 650 years to break a Titan M with a 4 digit random PIN
10:32:51 <strcat[m]> bypassbob: as I said, there are per-profile encryption keys based on the unlock method
10:32:57 <strcat[m]> it isn't tied to booting, it's per-profile
10:33:07 <strcat[m]> so your question isn't applicable to GrapheneOS
10:33:30 <strcat[m]> there is no boot passphrase, and there won't be one, each profile has a separate encryption key derived from the profile's primary unlock method (as with AOSP)
10:34:03 <bypassbob[m]> So it’s like turning on windows then logging into a user?
10:34:16 <strcat[m]> just go by what I said
10:34:20 <strcat[m]> > there is no boot passphrase, and there won't be one, each profile has a separate encryption key derived from the profile's primary unlock method (as with AOSP)
10:35:02 <cn3m[m]> and of course that primary unlock method is super strong since the Titan M
10:35:35 <strcat[m]> it's super strong if you use a strong passphrase regardless since it uses scrypt combined with hardware-accelerated, hardware-bound encryption with the Titan M protection added on top of that
10:36:16 <strcat[m]> the Titan M protection added on top is what makes it so that even a 6 digit PIN will take a ridiculous amount of time to brute force unless they can exploit the tiny attack surface of the Titan M
10:36:28 <strcat[m]> so even a profile protected by a weak unlock method has that
10:36:47 <strcat[m]> if it's a strong passphrase then it doesn't really matter, but of course it benefits that too
10:37:10 <strcat[m]> the strong key derivation + hardware accelerated portion of it helps make passphrases inherently stronger
10:37:35 <strcat[m]> it does scrypt in software and then the hardware portion of key derivation is delegated to the TEE implementation so that's device specific
10:39:00 <strcat[m]> TEE ideally uses something like HKDF via a hardware accelerated implementation (Qualcomm SoC has hardware-accelerated HMAC for that with a hardware-bound key as an option)
10:39:28 <strcat[m]> anyway encryption is per-profile, and could be made more granular than that
10:39:35 <bypassbob[m]> So a very long passphrase would take a lot longer than 650 years
10:39:39 <strcat[m]> it's not just 1 encryption key for everything with a passphrase entered on boot
10:40:08 <strcat[m]> bypassbob: far longer than that
10:40:26 <strcat[m]> and if the Titan M is not exploited successfully, then even a crappy PIN unlock lasts that long
10:41:36 <strcat[m]> and Titan M firmware cannot be updated until authentication of the owner account is done successfully so you'd actually need to exploit it, can't do something like bribing insiders millions to steal the keys to sign firmware
10:41:36 <strcat[m]> it's a nice approach
10:42:00 <strcat[m]> would like to see other companies deploy OpenTitan chips with a comparable implementation of the APIs supported by AOSP in their devices
10:42:23 <strcat[m]> this is just 1 of several features it offers (this is called Weaver)
10:43:06 <strcat[m]> basically Weaver is a table of slots, 1 for each profile
10:43:13 <cn3m[m]> Yeah Google and GrapheneOS could both work together and still couldn't break open your locked phone with malicious firmware it is super cool
10:43:22 <strcat[m]> when you set the unlock method for a profile, it derives an auth token which is passed to Weaver
10:43:31 <strcat[m]> Weaver generates a random token, passes that back to the OS
10:43:39 <bypassbob[m]> That’s usually the method to breaking security as well blackmail or bribing workers
10:43:56 <strcat[m]> and the OS uses that as one of the inputs to derive the encryption key (along with the other inputs like a token derived from the auth method, etc.)
10:44:11 <strcat[m]> and Weaver enforces a rate limit that's exponentially increasing quickly going up to 1 day per attempt
10:45:38 <bypassbob[m]> What type of encryption is used?
10:45:42 <strcat[m]> so - if you use a strong passphrase this is a nice extra layer, but you don't really depend on it
10:45:54 <strcat[m]> bypassbob: depends on device
10:46:05 <bypassbob[m]> 4 XL
10:47:22 <strcat[m]> 4 XL Is AES-256-XTS for data blocks, AES-256-CTS for file names
10:47:45 <strcat[m]> with file names rounded to 32 byte lengths on GrapheneOS
10:47:56 <strcat[m]> it depends on the device though
10:48:09 <bypassbob[m]> In your opinion is the 4 the most secure to date?
10:48:16 <aln124[m]> I have a question regarding trojans on graphene os. How safe can someone be?
10:48:19 <strcat[m]> devices without hardware accelerated AES will use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiantum_(cipher)
10:48:19 <bypassbob[m]> * In your opinion is the 4 the most secure device to date?
10:48:32 <aln124[m]> For example, swedish government has now a new law that gives the police right to secretly monitor your phone/pc etc if they "suspect" you of some sort of crime that can give 2 years of prison time...
10:49:11 <bypassbob[m]> <aln124[m] "For example, swedish government "> A lot of countries are doing this.
10:49:12 <strcat[m]> Adiantum is probably a lot nicer than using AES-256-XTS really
10:49:26 <strcat[m]> but when you have hardware accelerated AES it's hard to justify using a software implementation
10:49:37 <strcat[m]> it exists for devices without hardware accelerated AES
10:51:54 <strcat[m]> aln124: don't install malware and grant it a bunch of permissions particularly quite powerful ones - about all that can be said
10:51:56 <Ultron[m]> <aln124[m] "For example, swedish government "> Key Disclosure Law is there in many countries. None of the protection will work out there as you will need to reveal the key.
10:52:05 <Ultron[m]> to the government ofcourse.
10:52:44 <strcat[m]> aln124: I don't think malware that you installed yourself and granted permissions is really an interesting topic beyond mentioning that Auditor is a great way to detect that there's an accessibility service, etc. (not really the core purpose of it, but it's a nice way to do that)
10:53:08 <strcat[m]> Ultron: this is why using profiles is important
10:53:29 <cn3m[m]> if you are worried about malware use another profile to install sketchy stuff you are going to grant permissions too
10:53:32 <strcat[m]> how can you decrypt a profile on your device made for your friend in another country? you don't have the passphrase
10:53:41 <strcat[m]> there are per-profile encryption keys
10:54:25 <strcat[m]> the owner account can't decrypt secondary profiles
10:54:52 <Lia[m]> I'm excited for the VPN profiles fix in Android 11
10:55:14 <cn3m[m]> Yeah, I name my profiles after people
10:55:16 <strcat[m]> Lia: inthewaves implemented it, our next release will be Android 11 though so that's why we have it there
10:55:40 <strcat[m]> Android 10 GrapheneOS branch is EOL now

10:57:49 <strcat[m]> we just still had to do that release for everyone not beta testing
10:57:54 <strcat[m]> and ofc it had to be beta tested itself
10:58:08 <strcat[m]> and we couldn't release the problematic one we had to cancel
10:58:14 <strcat[m]> not ideal for beta testers on 3a / 3a XL but yeah

11:04:08 <Hugh[m]> Is anyone able to actually get nextcloud to install during a seedvault restore?
11:09:49 <cdesai> That is not supported at the moment
11:10:08 <cdesai> Next cloud backups didn't work so well, but a lot of improvements have been made in that area
11:17:32 <Hugh[m]> Fair enough
11:17:59 <Hugh[m]> Also is there a way to trigger a restore at a point after initial setup
11:21:10 <strcat[m]> not via the supported UI
11:21:40 <strcat[m]> technically you can via adb shell to run the activity but that's not really supported
11:22:16 <Hugh[m]> What would be the adb command or can you point me in the direction of the instructions?
11:23:07 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Hugh: adb restore
11:23:26 <Hugh[m]> This will trigger seedvault?
11:23:34 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Remember that adb backup/restore is deprecated
11:23:36 <Iusearchbtw[m]> No
11:24:30 <Hugh[m]> Ah I meant the seedvault adb activity strcat  mentioned
11:25:45 <strcat[m]> I meant that it is technically possible to launch the same restore activity as SetupWizard but this is unsupported by Seedvault
11:27:54 <Hugh[m]> ok, no worries. Thanks anyway

14:51:35 <xnaas> (If you have to)
15:04:08 <strcat[m]> OdwoRyn: that's not a problem
15:04:16 <strcat[m]> the install guide suggests updating the stock OS before flashing anyway
15:06:07 <vpsvrm[m]> Hi, when do you expect first beta release for 4a?
15:07:17 <strcat[m]> no one is working on that
15:07:40 <strcat[m]> devices require a device maintenance team to step up and work on them, and commit to long-term support
15:07:55 <strcat[m]> so far no one has done that
15:08:13 <strcat[m]> if that's the case in 6 months, it will be no closer to having support for it then either
15:08:22 <strcat[m]> if no one steps up to do that we won't support it

19:33:50 <mekanation[m]> Yea thats what I was thinking. Like if you do platform tools via linux you have to add your user to the right group to run fastboot commands, but you also have to log out and back in for the changes to take effect. Easy to google and fix, but if something like that was just as a warning in the guide it might make the install process easier for people.
19:34:33 <mekanation[m]> But at the same time what is the mission of GrapheneOS? Power users who wont be annoying about things, or get everyone on it for more privacy focus everywhere
19:34:38 <mekanation[m]>  * But at the same time what is the mission of GrapheneOS? Power users who wont be annoying about things, or get everyone on it for more privacy focus everywhere?
19:35:23 <Autopsy[m]> <mekanation[m] "Yea thats what I was thinking. L"> I take the lazy (unrecommended) way of using root or admin most of the time. Having to explain what to do to not use root or admin would take longer than just downloading the files and getting them to run the script
19:35:57 <Autopsy[m]> <mekanation[m] "But at the same time what is the"> The latter, imho.
19:36:13 <Autopsy[m]> Can't talk for the project, but the latter for me.
19:36:22 <dazinism> Could write something in the community wiki
19:36:59 <dazinism> Dan could use it if he likes the look of it
19:37:11 <dazinism> Anyone could add/edit/improve
19:37:25 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Home
19:37:29 <Autopsy[m]> Linky plsnxoxo
19:37:37 <Autopsy[m]> Oh, you did!
19:37:43 <mekanation[m]> Sounds good, do we have a bug/features/sprint/whatever people call it these days board?
19:38:59 <dazinism> I set that up had a couple of folks other than me do some stuff there
19:39:49 <dazinism> No, but could just start a list in a wiki page
19:40:57 <mekanation[m]> I'm just looking to help however I can, but I havent found a good work on this spot.
19:50:25 <dazinism> mekanation: if you think the documentation is missing anything and want to write stuff. Probably not terrible idea to write in the wiki. Others can edit/improve and it can be submitted,  or picked from  for the main site if appropriate
20:27:16 <sad_plan[m]> strcat how come theres so few maintainers? I wouldve thought there were more interest in keeping this great project running 🙃 in any case, what *requirements* would one need to be a device maintainer? Know C langauges?
21:39:17 <Iusearchbtw[m]> sad_plan: tbh way more than just knowing how to code
21:39:57 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Like you should somewhat have a picture of what you have to do and how you're going to do it before you can write the code for it
21:41:53 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Past experience may make things easier but won't guarantee a result
22:48:00 <adeus[m]> Can anyone point me to where I can find more information on how GrapheenOs handles backups ?
22:48:14 <adeus[m]> What is included in backups, limitations, etc.
23:15:08 <renlord[m]> adeus: https://github.com/stevesoltys/seedvault
23:15:14 <renlord[m]> this is the backup provider used in Graphene OS.
23:15:25 <renlord[m]> all applications that implement the backup API can be back-up
23:15:28 <renlord[m]>  * all applications that implement the backup API can be backup-ed
23:16:15 <renlord[m]> limitations: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/257
23:31:58 <anonymous821[m]> mekanation: i might repost at a different time. I avoid Signal as it requires a phone no. Doesn't it also have access to contacts too?
23:35:42 <adeus[m]> <anonymous821[m] "mekanation: i might repost at a "> Just use a virtual number and set a strong 2FA. It does not require access to contacts.
23:36:39 <adeus[m]> Anyone that has used the backup and restore process in GrapheneOS can you tell me when you restore does Signal require re-registration ? Or is the app restored exactly how it was at snapshot?
23:38:16 <anonymous821[m]> adeus: how do I setup a virtual number? is it free?
23:38:42 <adeus[m]> anonymous821: just get a virtual number from any of the million services you can buy them for as cheap as 99c
23:47:33 <anonymous821[m]> adeus: ok. I can potentially be doxxed via the payment though.
23:47:34 <anonymous821[m]> Also, will I still be needing the vitual number for future verification purposes on Signal?
23:47:50 <adeus[m]> > <@anonymous821:matrix.org> adeus: ok. I can potentially be doxxed via the payment though.
23:47:50 <adeus[m]> > Also, will I still be needing the vitual number for future verification purposes on Signal?
23:47:50 <adeus[m]> Use bitcoin
23:48:15 <adeus[m]> No, it won’t ask you to verify the number again.
23:48:31 <anonymous821[m]> lol, pseudonymous
