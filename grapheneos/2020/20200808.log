00:35:11 <barstool[m]> I just wanted to say something that's on my heart. Even if its silly or this is the wrong place today it I just lost a good friend two days ago. I want to let Daniel know that he`s looked up to by a lot of people. I can tell by reading g your posts sometimes that life has you on the edge right now. The business problems you're going through right now, will definitely pass. So focus on your passion. This community
00:35:11 <barstool[m]> loves you. The solace you've brought through your hard work is definitely appreciated. Just remember, that you have an army of people who believe in you. You're one in a million.  Even in the difficult times hold your head high be cause what you do is so important to everyone who follows your work. Thank you bro.
00:49:09 <barstool[m]> I just think Daniel works so hard and we all know  how great this project  is to the future of privacy. This man is a legend
00:49:37 <JTL> BeingFrey[m]: My condolences
00:49:45 <JTL> I hope he reads your message :)
00:50:12 <JTL> er barstool[m]
00:55:08 <barstool[m]> I'm fine. I just want Daniel to know how much he's appreciated. He works his ass off. I know other devs too but he's a pioneer
00:55:33 <JTL> Agreed
00:57:12 <refragable[m]> analtenderloin: Did you find the section on the website? https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking
00:57:19 <refragable[m]> the recommended solution is an ad blocking dns
01:06:03 <refragable[m]> analtenderloin: Basically, you don't need root (which is bad for security) to use a custom dns but you lose control over the blocklist unless you self-host or use a service like NextDNS (however more blocklist changes = more uniqueness).
01:09:00 <cn3m[m]> custom blacklists are a potential feature in the future, but GrapheneOS is extremely careful about censorship
01:09:20 <cn3m[m]> the system should work on it's own and not have to resort to enumerating badness
01:10:08 <cn3m[m]> adblockers are a type of privacy theater for that you can see the design philosophy document from the Tor Project
01:10:38 <cn3m[m]> https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#philosophy
01:10:42 <cn3m[m]> see #5
01:13:42 <cn3m[m]> In general Vanadium tries to blend in with Chrome users on Pixels. This is a reasonably large sized group compared to alternative options. This is definitely the most sound approach in my opinion
01:13:57 <JTL> ^
01:15:06 <cn3m[m]> for example if you use an alternative browser say Bromite you will be trackable with just your ISP/VPN provider information and your user agent. There are many other invisible metrics that could be used. However you have to get quite invasive to track Vanadium(which shows up in research like Mozilla's)
01:16:02 <cn3m[m]> 3.5% of sites use visible fingerprinting, but that is largely canvas fingerprinting used for anti spam and such. It is not a cost effective way of tracking users. Many due to performance overhead amount many other reasons
01:17:06 <cn3m[m]> it is far more concerning to have a unique statistic like a rare UA such as Bromite or DuckDuckGo(browser) + your semi unique VPN/ISP provider than it is to for instance reveal what device you are using
01:18:05 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium is of course trackable and unique compared to Chrome, but the difficulty in pulling that off(especially cross site) is frankly ridiculous.
01:19:13 <cn3m[m]> off the top of battery tracking, performance metrics(due to hardening features), and some slightly different versioning results in more fingerprint-ability than Chrome. However not in a practical way. The security benefits on the other hand are more practical
01:20:06 <cn3m[m]> I would have to do a deeper dive on Vanadium to be sure, but it seems to be the security and privacy sweet spot for GrapheneOS users
01:24:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> Do all Vanadium users look the same?
01:29:49 <cn3m[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Do all Vanadium users look the s"> assuming the same phone yes
01:30:14 <cn3m[m]> and obviously time zone
01:30:21 <cn3m[m]> and general latency plays a factor too
01:30:38 <cn3m[m]> the more important part is to blend in with Chrome users
01:34:09 <cn3m[m]> Trying to create a whole iPhone + Safari homogeny that works so well with only GrapheneOS users would be sadly completely impossible. Google has made the inroads(especially in the US) it makes much more sense to utilize that. Let me dig into the code and I will get back to you on that a little bit
01:35:10 <cn3m[m]> iirc in the US Pixels are the 3rd largest phone brand. The market share is still quite low, but Google doesn't make as many devices as say Samsung
01:35:59 <cn3m[m]> If you are only sharing a fingerprint with a Note 9 you are not blending it with every Samsung phone. A 3a blends in with a large chunk of Pixels.
02:05:09 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m] "cn3m: what's your opinion on usi"> it supports wireguard. I would personally choose that
02:08:05 <strcat[m]> cn3m: Vanadium uses the same versions as Chrome stable releases
02:09:20 <alzxjm[m]> I think for antifingerprinting purposes it's good to use a popular VPN so you'll share the same IP as a lot of people and can't be tracked by your unique IP.
02:10:07 <alzxjm[m]> Mullvad works great though
02:11:00 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: Vanadium uses the same ver"> With a slight delay at times. My bad that was pretty bad wording. That will get fixed soon
02:11:06 <cn3m[m]> hopefully
02:11:20 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m] "I think for antifingerprinting p"> really depends
02:11:59 <strcat[m]> cn3m: they do staged rollouts anyway
02:12:21 <cn3m[m]> true ^
02:12:50 <cn3m[m]> that was not as noteworthy as I though I stand corrected
02:12:51 <cn3m[m]> thanks

09:13:04 <smashingclerk[m]> don't think it meets graphenes security requirements
09:13:48 <bloodnaousky[m]> other the pixel devices what other device qualifies for it?
09:14:15 <smashingclerk[m]> right now it's just pixel devices
09:14:24 <bloodnaousky[m]> hmm
09:14:50 <smashingclerk[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
09:15:20 <BlackWinnerYoshi> I cannot install the same app on two different user profiles, is this normal for AOSP/GrapheneOS?
09:15:39 <cn3m[m]> <bloodnaousky[m] "other the pixel devices what oth"> none atm
09:16:01 <cn3m[m]> the A2 was being considered, but it requires an out of date bootloader
09:16:15 <cn3m[m]> OnePlus has a horrible track record on verified boot
09:16:47 <cn3m[m]> the OnePlus 3 using the default signing key for the boot partition and the 7Pro having fake custom verified boot key support(fixed)
09:16:51 <cn3m[m]> among other issues
09:17:14 <cn3m[m]> that pretty much leaves Samsung and Motorola as the only remotely competent options left
09:17:33 <JTL> and Samsung has their own issues
09:17:38 <cn3m[m]> Motorola uses MTK usually for Android One so that is a huge problem
09:17:49 <cn3m[m]> Samsung is a real mess, but they at least try
09:17:59 <JTL> *cough* KNOX efuse
09:20:16 <cn3m[m]> <JTL "*cough* KNOX efuse"> yes but
09:20:43 <cn3m[m]> they get day 1 updates out on the S line
09:21:01 <cn3m[m]> they support their devices fully for 3 years and partially for another
09:21:15 <JTL> Still saying Samsung still does a bunch of shitty things still
09:21:20 <cn3m[m]> they at least try to add decent security hardware
09:24:32 <theultron[m]> Samsung sell inferior hardware in countries like in India.
09:25:00 <theultron[m]> They ship all their phones with their inferior inhouse SOC.
09:25:18 <theultron[m]> Even the top model where they ship with snapdragon soc in USA is shipped exnosys in India.
09:25:37 <theultron[m]>  * Samsung sell inferior hardware in countries like India.
09:26:09 <theultron[m]> Though the top series sell like hot cake here due to brand value.
09:26:36 <theultron[m]> Even after they ship with pathetic exnoysis.
09:27:45 <theultron[m]> <cn3m[m] "they get day 1 updates out on th"> This is the only good thing apart from the build quality.
09:31:07 <theultron[m]> It is clear that you get google or an apple device at this moment if you care about security. No other phone can be considered.
09:32:03 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "It is clear that you get google "> a friend and I are writing an article on iOS and Android
09:32:15 <cn3m[m]> and that is pretty much the first thing
09:39:03 <cn3m[m]> other Android phones are just sad
10:15:41 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <BlackWinnerYoshi "I cannot install the same app on"> Can someone answer my question?
10:16:04 <renlord> BlackWinnerYoshi: ask again
10:16:14 <cn3m[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Can someone answer my question?"> yes
10:16:18 <cn3m[m]> so essentially
10:16:22 <cn3m[m]> it is cert pinning
10:16:28 <cn3m[m]> it comes down to this
10:16:37 <cn3m[m]> signature not cert*
10:17:02 <cn3m[m]> if you try to install an older apk it won't work
10:17:04 <cn3m[m]> this is true of F-Droid since the site is out of date
10:17:16 <cn3m[m]> it also has to match the same signing key
10:17:31 <cn3m[m]> so F-Droid apps aren't compatible with the devs key
10:17:57 <cn3m[m]> this can result in many apps not working
10:18:33 <cn3m[m]> since most people try to install F-Droid
10:18:35 <cn3m[m]> it fails
10:18:44 <cn3m[m]> they go to install Aurora from the site
10:18:54 <cn3m[m]> or get an apkmirror apk
10:19:00 <cn3m[m]> and it fails to match the sig
10:19:47 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <cn3m[m] "if you try to install an older a"> So if I want to have F-Droid on a different user profile, I have to install the same version with the same signature as the one on the main user profile?
10:20:12 <cn3m[m]> yeah the same signature is easy
10:20:16 <cn3m[m]> though same version is not
10:20:43 <cn3m[m]> you have to probably extract it from your main profile and tresorit send it with a short link to your other profile
10:25:46 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <cn3m[m] "you have to probably extract it "> Well, I don't have Tresorit, so I'll use Disroot's Lufi instance
10:31:53 <cn3m[m]> Tresorit send is free
11:12:06 <kuantem[m]> Speaking of installing APKs, what are your thoughts on the application "Shelter". I use it with any apps I download via the Aurora Store from FDroid.
11:12:22 <kuantem[m]> Mainly banking apps, nothing social.
11:12:34 <cn3m[m]> kuantem: Shelter is using systems not meant for end users
11:12:35 <cn3m[m]> use real profiles
11:12:39 <kuantem[m]> Should probably just use browser lol
11:12:42 <cn3m[m]> they are better and do the same job
11:13:00 <kuantem[m]> Understood
11:13:30 <cn3m[m]> Browser > User Profiles > Shelter
11:28:20 <eqex[m]> <cn3m[m] "Browser > User Profiles > Shelte"> Woke up from quick nap and i was wondering for good half a minute where i should navigate with those instructions.
11:29:03 <bloodnaousky[m]> shelter can be used to isolate gsuite apps?
11:30:11 <kuantem[m]> I think what cn3m was saying is to use a different Android profile for other applications.
11:30:21 <kuantem[m]> Instead of Shelter.
11:30:44 <bloodnaousky[m]> seperate profile for every work app?
11:31:06 <kuantem[m]> For any set of apps, in this case, gsuite apps
11:31:27 <kuantem[m]> I mean... I guess a profile could be created per app

14:47:13 <fll[m]> It has two userfacing toggles, namely Network and Sensors. Those are "custom", so to say. I don't know about background changes though. I'd assume that could easily brake apps.....but really no idea.
