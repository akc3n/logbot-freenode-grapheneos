02:01:33 <Dustin[m]1> I'm looking at the FAQ -- the Pixel 2 is listed as legacy
02:01:34 <Dustin[m]1> What version of Graphene does it have up to this point
02:01:35 <Dustin[m]1> Question mark*
02:02:07 <aeonsolution[m]>   it depends on Google update support, let me link you
02:02:45 <Dustin[m]1> Thank you
02:04:49 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
02:05:53 <Dustin[m]1> I was checking that out
02:06:03 <Dustin[m]1> But I didn't see any exact answer
02:06:05 <Dustin[m]1> Maybe I'm daft
02:06:35 <aeonsolution[m]> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en
02:07:28 <aeonsolution[m]> The supported device elude to the support but if you look it up online you'll see what the lead developer is referring too.
02:07:42 <Dustin[m]1> But I see that the latest version under Stable is from 05/05
02:08:51 <aeonsolution[m]> EOL support for Pixel 2 is October 2020
02:09:31 <aeonsolution[m]> You might find something in logs too if you check it out.
02:09:52 <Dustin[m]1> Ahh
02:10:03 <Dustin[m]1> That's good to know then
02:10:34 <Dustin[m]1> That's a shame as they're quite decent in price now
02:12:24 <cyredanthem[m]> > That's a shame as they're quite decent in price now
02:12:24 <cyredanthem[m]> That's what happens when something is almost worthless
02:13:22 <Dustin[m]1> Haha
02:14:16 <Dustin[m]1> Says a lot that something 3 years old is considered worthless now
02:15:02 <cyredanthem[m]> Only Apple cares sadly
02:15:30 * madaidan[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/OcxxKvLMdmGjdVhmDyZEWRzE >
02:15:47 <aeonsolution[m]> <madaidan[m] "> <@cyredanthem:synapse.travnewm"> LOL
02:20:00 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 2 is still pretty good until October
02:20:29 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, but I think he was trying to understand why its becoming legacy
02:20:34 <Dustin[m]1> Sure are a lot of 3a on eBay with LCD issues
02:20:37 <Dustin[m]1> Fascinating
02:21:57 <cn3m[m]> 10 all devices are on the lastest
02:22:18 <Dustin[m]1> Come November, the device may be EOL but I imagine you're still left with a good, private device
02:22:44 <Dustin[m]1> Although you stop receiving security updates
02:23:04 <Dustin[m]1> Tough call
02:23:27 <Dustin[m]1> But from my layman's view, it seems like a good option for a budget user
02:24:30 <cyredanthem[m]> Don't use an out of date phone
02:25:09 <cyredanthem[m]> Daniel covered this if you want a new phone get and Android One and disable gapps instead of running an out of date phone
02:25:13 <cyredanthem[m]> It's not worth it
02:25:21 <cyredanthem[m]> Defeats the point of GrapheneOS
02:25:38 <Dustin[m]1> Interesting
02:26:07 <Dustin[m]1> Yeah, I see why he would say that. I appreciate that
02:26:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Used iPhone is worth looking at too that's the closest privacy and security
02:26:57 <cyredanthem[m]> They are supported for so long
02:27:05 <cyredanthem[m]> Whatever you do just avoid old not updated phones
02:27:18 <cyredanthem[m]> Like Pixel 2 after October
02:27:49 <Dustin[m]1> What a sad situation
02:27:53 <Dustin[m]1> You either leave yourself unsecured or you waste more resources on having to replace devices constantly
02:28:08 <cyredanthem[m]> I mean if your not a developer and you want to keep a phone for 5 years just get an iPhone
02:28:43 <cyredanthem[m]> GrapheneOS is a research project not an alternative to recycling it's just not possible
02:28:51 <Dustin[m]1> Yeah
02:29:05 <cyredanthem[m]> a Nexus 5x is 5 years old and even with GrapheneOS would be full of holes
02:29:13 <Dustin[m]1> Yeah
02:29:14 <Dustin[m]1> That's fair
02:30:53 <cyredanthem[m]> Pixels are our first choice. iPhone second. Pretty much no one will recommend anything else in good faith for security and privacy. I love my 3a and it beats my old iPhone even if it got 6 some years of support
02:32:06 <cyredanthem[m]> Dustin: I'd stretch it for a decent Pixel 3a even used if you can. It has 2 years of support left
02:32:34 <cyredanthem[m]> You probably won't want to keep a phone that long
02:32:50 <Dustin[m]1> It's tough to find a balance with this stuff. I'm not giving up on Linux phones yet, either. Just weighing my options now.
02:32:50 <Dustin[m]1> Quite frankly, my trials with Ubuntu Touch have been less than stellar
02:33:03 <cyredanthem[m]> Ubuntu Touch is a security and privacy nightmare
02:33:11 <Dustin[m]1> Thank you for all your suggestions and information, cyredanthem :)
02:33:44 <cyredanthem[m]> Of course man. I always feel bad about replacing phones before their time, but it's life
02:34:12 <Dustin[m]1> Yeah
02:35:01 <Dustin[m]1> <cyredanthem[m] "Ubuntu Touch is a security and p"> Oof
02:35:11 <Dustin[m]1> Good to know
02:36:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes iPhone and GrapheneOS are mostly comparable security wise. https://reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/ekxifpa?context=3 read here for more on the differences
02:36:37 <cyredanthem[m]> Anything Android is going to have better privacy and security protections for anything installed than an Ubuntu Touch phone
02:37:15 <cyredanthem[m]> They have no meaningful sandbox or no verified boot. They have no noteworthy hardening
02:40:14 <Dustin[m]1> Well, you've given me a lot to think about
02:40:17 <Dustin[m]1> Maybe I should actually look into an iPhone
02:40:19 <Dustin[m]1> I've never had one or used one for a meaningful length of time
02:40:23 <cyredanthem[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html this goes into more details into the issues with Linux Phones
02:40:56 <madaidan[m]> helo
02:41:08 <cyredanthem[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "https://madaidans-insecurities.g"> Dustin: depends on what you need and your price range. I have both GrapheneOS and iPhone
02:41:22 <cyredanthem[m]> > helo
02:41:22 <cyredanthem[m]> I posted your site and you came
02:41:23 <cyredanthem[m]> Wow skills
02:41:31 <Dustin[m]1> I don't need much, to be honest.
02:41:44 <Dustin[m]1> I already saw that iOS does CalDAV and CardDAV so I can sync with my Nextcloud
02:41:46 <Dustin[m]1> So that's covered
02:41:51 * madaidan[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GmRpORWhGAVkLwxbXSgbaRsC >
02:42:07 <Dustin[m]1> I'm sure that the other basic stuff I do is available there
02:42:11 <cyredanthem[m]> > I already saw that iOS does CalDAV and CardDAV so I can sync with my Nextcloud
02:42:11 <cyredanthem[m]> Yeah I would kill for that on Android to be so easy
02:43:45 <cyredanthem[m]> The one gotcha right now with iOS of course never being able to change the OS and it currently has an unfixed WebRTC leak that they said they would fix ages ago. You have to block JS if that's a concern
02:44:50 <cyredanthem[m]> Otherwise I have no complaints it has some very strong privacy protections on apps which probably are a little better
02:45:47 <Dustin[m]1> You know, that's very compelling
02:46:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Pixel 3a > iPhone(any semi modern one) > Android One in my opinion. The Android One is hard to recommend though
02:47:15 <Dustin[m]1> You can still use an iPhone without an iCloud account, right?
02:48:16 <cyredanthem[m]> iCloud no, AppleID yes
02:48:24 <cyredanthem[m]> You can make up everything and they don't verify anything
02:48:25 <Dustin[m]1> Oh, that's what I meant
02:48:30 <Dustin[m]1> Hey, great
02:48:59 <cyredanthem[m]> You can also not get AppleID at all and sideload apps, but only from a mac and it is only 7 days if you aren't a developer
02:49:15 <cyredanthem[m]> So generally I would say you need to have an AppleID
02:50:29 <cyredanthem[m]> https://redditcommentsearch.com/ you can search iOS(or Android One) and DanielMicay to see everything Daniel has said on the subject on Reddit
02:50:34 <Dustin[m]1> That's not the end of the world anyway I suppose
02:50:35 <Dustin[m]1> It's not like I'll install Pokemon Go or some shit
02:50:57 <Dustin[m]1> But that's a very compelling case
02:50:58 <Dustin[m]1> Thank you
02:51:18 <cyredanthem[m]> I'd love for everyone to use GrapheneOS, but that's not always practical
02:51:43 <cyredanthem[m]> And if you go with the super hardcore setup recommended here and replace your laptop with an iPad then having an iPhone minimizes attack surface a little bit
02:52:57 <cyredanthem[m]> It's worth noting some much older iPhones do have an exploit that can allow them to temporarily run any software and that can be a security concern. It has to be physically plugged in and loaded up. If you reboot it fixes it though so reboot after leaving one unattended
02:53:15 <cyredanthem[m]> That and WebRTC are the only gotchas, but it depends on your needs and habits
03:09:31 <youraveragecanuc> What desktop operating systems should we consider using nowadays? I'm slowly learning that everything I thought about Linux and security is wrong. Sounds like Windows and MacOS are moving in the right direction, but what are the best alternatives to these two? Kicksecure?
03:10:18 <cyredanthem[m]> <youraveragecanuc "What desktop operating systems s"> I use macOS but only for the no root app installs so I can safely sandbox with multiple users
03:10:19 <Dustin[m]1> Thanks again cyredanthem, I'm going to do some more research and go from there
03:10:25 <cyredanthem[m]> ChromiumOS is strong
03:10:25 <Dustin[m]1> Take care. I'll pop in if I have more questions
03:10:34 <cyredanthem[m]> > Thanks again cyredanthem, I'm going to do some more research and go from there
03:10:34 <cyredanthem[m]> Good luck friend yeah sounds good
03:10:44 <cyredanthem[m]> Chrome* not Chromium
03:10:45 <cyredanthem[m]> My bad
03:11:21 <cyredanthem[m]> Kicksecure will be great with Wayland and maybe a better base then Debian
03:11:53 <cyredanthem[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "That and WebRTC are the only got"> youraveragecanuck: ChromeOS and iPadOS are definitely the most secure options but one has privacy issues and the other has usability issues
03:12:01 <cyredanthem[m]> Wrong quote whoops
03:12:54 <cyredanthem[m]> I just use macOS with my fancy setup and I'm very comfortable with that
03:14:49 <youraveragecanuc> Right. I think iPad is kind of out of the question for me, usability-wise. Can ChromeOS actually be used as a development environment though? I admit I don't know much about it, but I was under the impression that its target users are those that want to do everything in a browser
03:15:24 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes you can run Linux, VirtualBox, or even Android apps
03:15:27 <cyredanthem[m]> It is very powerful now
03:15:40 <cyredanthem[m]> Privacy is meh, but not that horrible unless you really hate Google
03:16:50 <youraveragecanuc> That's excellent to hear. I'll have to look into it. I don't /hate/ google. I'd just prefer to have a moderately private OS
03:17:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Personally I found macOS to be the middle ground for privacy and security for me
03:17:31 <cyredanthem[m]> It's not perfect at either, but it's a full OS and semi decent at both
03:17:48 <cyredanthem[m]> ChromeOS has a solid lead though
03:18:12 <cyredanthem[m]> Just don't use the ChromiumOS forks as they don't have verified boot as the Chromebooks only support OEM verified boot keys
03:19:54 <youraveragecanuc> So in order to use ChromeOS I'd have to purchase a new Chromebook?
03:20:23 <cyredanthem[m]> If you want verified boot yes
03:21:13 <cyredanthem[m]> Same with macOS(there's a workaround I could try, but I'm not sure if it's worth the setup)
03:24:17 <youraveragecanuc> That’s a shame. So assuming someone has a non-chrome book non-Mac laptop, the best options are windows and (future) Kicksecure?
03:24:40 <cyredanthem[m]> I dunno ChromiumOS if you want sandboxing
03:24:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> <youraveragecanuc "That’s a shame. So assuming some"> Well, Qubes OS.
03:25:06 <cyredanthem[m]> Qubes trusts too many maintainers and has terrible guest security
03:25:14 <cyredanthem[m]> It's a one trick pony
03:28:12 <youraveragecanuc> Are the Debian (or other distro) devs not enthusiastic about bringing the features (and goals) of Kicksecure upstream? Seems like the sensible way forward without sacrificing much (any?) usability
03:28:33 <cyredanthem[m]> That's debatable
03:29:26 <cyredanthem[m]> First Debian doesn't care and second I don't think it is fair to say that it has little impact on usability
03:29:40 <cyredanthem[m]> Debian is not known for security whatsoever
03:30:02 <cyredanthem[m]> They possibly are the least secure actively supported Desktop OS
03:39:14 <Guest78742> How to look at past chats?
03:43:54 <overheadscallop[> second link in the topic
03:56:45 <Shippwrecked[m]> <youraveragecanuc "That’s a shame. So assuming some"> Another option is regular linux and do risky stuff in VMs

04:52:11 <Shippwrecked[m]> I like brave too
04:52:13 <Shippwrecked[m]> It's probably the best browser out of the box currently
04:53:32 <cn3m[m]> Safari is up there too
04:53:33 <Shippwrecked[m]> It's what I recommend to anyone non-technical who asks because it blocks ads/trackers does some anti-fingerprinting and doesn't phone home by default
04:53:42 <Shippwrecked[m]> Doesn't really need any config for a normal user
04:56:48 <cyredanthem[m]> If you can't use Safari yes
04:57:22 <Shippwrecked[m]> Brave or ug-chromium on desktop vanadium or bromite on mobile is what I'd go with
04:57:23 <cyredanthem[m]> Safari has a very underrated privacy and security model
04:58:40 <cyredanthem[m]> It has a beautiful extension system where ad blockers don't need page access
04:58:49 <cyredanthem[m]> It has probably the best anti fingerprinting due to homogeny
04:58:53 <Shippwrecked[m]> I don't consider the slower updating of ug-chromium a big deal it's only a few days usually
04:59:24 <cyredanthem[m]> iPhone with no adblocker using Safari is insanely good at blending in
05:00:46 <cyredanthem[m]> Not everyone has Safari, but that's my go to recommendation

05:16:16 <cyredanthem[m]> > Harden Firefox is still a no go? Due to bad security and sandboxing?
05:16:16 <cyredanthem[m]> Right now it's looking that way Linux has some major changes soon that might make it okay
05:16:31 <cyredanthem[m]> But not for maybe 2 years?
05:16:55 <JTL> I feel Mozilla has some systemic issues other than just strictly sandboxing
05:17:07 <JTL> That's for another discussison though
05:17:43 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes they do actually
05:17:54 <cyredanthem[m]> ioctl is not in the seccomp rules which is an issue too
05:18:02 <cyredanthem[m]> They also have far less privacy out of the box
05:18:57 <cyredanthem[m]> Well the x leak is tied to Fission which should help a lot
05:19:28 <cyredanthem[m]> CFI MIGHT be in testing at some point soonish
05:19:43 <cyredanthem[m]> You can already build it with that, but it's not any good
05:19:58 <cyredanthem[m]> They don't see an issue with mozjemalloc which sucks
05:20:05 <cyredanthem[m]> PartionAlloc for days
05:21:38 <cyredanthem[m]> The one area that Firefox is a little more secure is slightly more things are written in memory safe code. The PDF viewer is a great example and powers the one in GrapheneOS. However the leak of meaningful mitigations that Chromium enjoys on all it's code negates that
05:21:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cyredanthem[m] "https://www.followthatpage.com/"> There's also very nice change-detector apps for Android, if you want to keep it slightly more private what you're tracking changes on
05:21:59 <cyredanthem[m]> Servo stuff isn't bad, but it's not a substantial attack surface
05:22:22 <cyredanthem[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: fair enough thanks any recommendations?
05:23:08 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox for Windows they claim to be on the cusp of Windows 8 parity
05:23:22 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 they need a new media player for
05:23:48 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows still they aren't as well mitigated obviously

05:35:48 <cyredanthem[m]> What do apps know about you on GrapheneOS 10?
05:36:01 <cn3m[m]> what's up
05:36:03 <cn3m[m]> what's up
05:37:03 <strcat> Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) == security theater btw
05:37:45 <strcat> userspace random number generators are security theater and a bad idea
05:38:22 <strcat> typical meaningless implementations of secure/verified boot and MAC/MLS are security theater
05:38:26 <strcat> same with most app 'sandboxes'
05:40:56 <cn3m[m]>  time you turn your phone on or off, charging, basic device stats(not too useful), app list(use profiles to manage this is surprisingly helpful), they have sensor access only in the foreground but you can turn that off, they(gryophone and such, but very limited), it can see your real ip, without permissions not that much. Do keep in no firewall or network level domain blocking is fully effective  @thelearner:matrix.org
05:40:57 <cn3m[m]> so not much actually
05:41:00 <cn3m[m]> they can also get how you hold your phone when you have the app open, but again turn off sensors. GrapheneOS is very well throught through for privacy with apps
05:42:44 <cn3m[m]> You can run privacy breacher to see some of this. Of course if you give permissions there's lot more that can be done
05:43:24 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: security is not obtained through installing / bundling a bunch of stuff
05:43:27 <cn3m[m]> all apps can talk so keep that in mind
05:43:28 <cn3m[m]>  @thelearner:matrix.org anytime was my day job to abuse this stuff
05:43:29 <strcat> doesn't improve any of the fundamentals
05:44:30 <strcat> kicksecure isn't changing any of the fundamentally core insecure things
05:44:32 <strcat> and it's still debian too
05:44:49 <strcat> just concentrating on security theater, spreading more misinformation / attacks on actual security projects
05:45:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Could you elaborate on Kicksecure? I know they want to rebase
05:45:21 <strcat> people who churn out a lot of low quality documentation making dishonest and inaccurate claims are not somehow more trustworthy and it does not mean they do useful work
05:45:33 <cyredanthem[m]> Is forking ChromiumOS the way forward?
05:45:48 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: I am not going to waste my time countering people who write prolific misinformation sorry
05:45:57 <strcat> that whole wiki is awful and full of bad info
05:46:19 <cyredanthem[m]> Okay understood. I know madaidan is working on cleaning it up, but I definitely agree there
05:46:20 <cyredanthem[m]> Thanks for your time
05:46:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> What's a comparably good source of info on Linux hardening
05:46:57 <strcat> 'Linux hardening' is a joke
05:47:00 <strcat> use a different OS
05:47:15 <strcat> you can't fix something after the fact by tweaking settings and bundling more software
05:47:19 <strcat> not how security works
05:47:40 <strcat> work on distribution where security is actually part of how it is developed
05:47:57 <strcat> certainly not debian which is basically windows xp
05:48:07 <hypokeimenon[m]> assuming Linux is too far gone, what are the viable alternatives one should be supporting? Genode or something?
05:48:22 <strcat> the linux kernel is definitely a lost cause in the long term
05:48:25 <cyredanthem[m]> Genode has no desktop security model it's possibly worse ha
05:48:25 <strcat> it's completely insecure
05:48:29 <strcat> the architecture is completely insecure
05:48:39 <strcat> it has no future for secure use cases
05:48:55 <strcat> and thinking it does is the first sign someone is just one of those dishonest security theater charlatans
05:48:55 <cyredanthem[m]> So pick Windows and macOS over ChromeOS?
05:49:00 <strcat> because that's super obvious
05:49:03 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: not what I said
05:49:24 <strcat> and the people developing ChromeOS do not think the Linux kernel has a long-term future for a secure OS
05:49:35 <cyredanthem[m]> That's very true
05:49:51 <cyredanthem[m]> Zircon and Fuchsia
05:49:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> the future is fuschia
05:49:52 <strcat> I'm saying that you should not trust people who think running 10 million lines of code in ring0 with no isolation and a culture of anti-security people making everything with full backwards compatibility guarntees is a good idea
05:50:07 <strcat> every release tons more attack surface and complexity
05:50:13 <strcat> linux kernel security is getting WORSE with each release
05:50:36 <strcat> the architecture is anti-security / anti-robustness from the start
05:50:42 <strcat> linus started with that attitude / culture
05:50:46 <strcat> that is the genesis of linux
05:50:50 <strcat> it's an anti-security project from day 1
05:50:55 <strcat> it exists because of that
05:51:07 <cyredanthem[m]> True look how they treat anyone who interested in security
05:51:12 <cyredanthem[m]> There's a long history there
05:51:24 <strcat> linux was explicitly a rejection of more robust/secure kernel designs for performance improvements
05:51:42 <strcat> from day 1 it has been designed as an insecure OS for performance
05:51:50 <strcat> that is why linus exists - go read linus' old posts yourself
05:53:41 <hypokeimenon[m]> Are there any kernel and OS projects that have a competent attitude towards security
05:53:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> Or promising projects
05:53:51 <cyredanthem[m]> Thanks for the input strcat as always
05:54:14 <renlord[m]> Minis
05:54:23 <renlord[m]> Minix
05:54:23 <cyredanthem[m]> > Are there any kernel and OS projects that have a competent attitude towards security
05:54:23 <cyredanthem[m]> iPadOS ;-P
05:54:45 <renlord[m]> Tanenbaum always said Linus would have failed his os course.
05:55:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> lol tanenbaum vs torvalds
05:56:10 <hypokeimenon[m]> iirc redox claimed to be inspired by minix
05:57:44 <strcat> putting everything in a VM is also just a bad workaround
05:58:02 <strcat> and doesn't change that the OSes being used are insecure
05:58:18 <cyredanthem[m]> cough Qubes cough
05:58:24 <strcat> what would be nice is if a decent number of people actually cared about security
05:58:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Yeah those guests are just bad
05:58:29 <strcat> and were working towards making things better
05:59:08 <strcat> instead of just a few people like me doing all the work they can to make the best of a bad situation in 99% of the software ecosystem
06:01:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> I've been saying for a while now that data security and sane data control was more issue/goal than digital privacy but are there any similar security focused organisations and software projects we can support?
06:01:46 <strcat> security is how you obtain privacy...
06:02:00 <strcat> the privacy improvements are part of the security systems
06:02:02 <cyredanthem[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "I've been saying for a while now"> hypokeimenon: Google, Apple, and GrapheneOS are the only groups I have any faith in
06:02:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yeah that's what I've been sayingstrcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org)
06:02:20 <cyredanthem[m]> Privacy is a subfeature of privacy
06:02:21 <strcat> I don't know how people think they can obtain privacy throwing away all the privacy / security progress that has been made
06:02:43 <strcat> privacy is not a separate thing from security
06:02:48 <cyredanthem[m]> Anyway getting hacked is the worst privacy infringement ever
06:02:56 <cyredanthem[m]> You don't beat that
06:03:02 <strcat> the application / browser sandbox is what gives you a boundary and enforces rules to provide privacy
06:03:22 <strcat> most issues are with that
06:03:37 <cyredanthem[m]> I saw someone install unofficial lineage with the full sandbox turned off for privacy
06:03:39 <strcat> there are other things that are separate like how MAC randomization is not properly implemented nearly anywhere and is just privacy theater
06:03:44 <cyredanthem[m]> That made me question humanity
06:03:57 <strcat> but most stuff is tied to sandboxing / permission models
06:04:02 <strcat> i.e. security stuff
06:04:20 <cyredanthem[m]> > there are other things that are separate like how MAC randomization is not properly implemented nearly anywhere and is just privacy theater
06:04:21 <cyredanthem[m]> Is MAC randomization worth having on? It's not actively hurting right?
06:04:31 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: it's not hurting but I'm just saying
06:04:39 <strcat> on most devices it is not going to accomplish what you think
06:05:00 <strcat> because the wifi card will just leak other identifiers - even the MAC address itself - even if it's using your randomized MAC as the MAC
06:05:13 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: the wifi hardware is not designed for privacy in most cases
06:05:20 <JTL> > 23:03 <cyredanthem[m]> I saw someone install unofficial lineage with the full sandbox turned off for privacy
06:05:23 <JTL> lolwut?
06:05:26 <strcat> the firmware/hardware happily leaks other identifiers and has sequence numbers, etc.
06:05:53 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: this was fixed on the Nexus 5 and Pixels but all earlier Nexus devices couldn't have Wi-Fi anonymity despite us using MAC rand, which we documented
06:06:08 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: my XPS 13 and other wifi cards I have available do not offer anonymity
06:06:20 <strcat> MAC rand doesn't work without also avoiding other identifiers
06:06:31 <strcat> including LEAKING THE HARDWARE MAC in supplementary info they love attaching
06:06:39 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: the wifi manufacturers love filling out these supplementary info fields
06:06:43 <JTL> blah
06:06:54 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: every time it sends out a scanning probe it attaches a bunch of identifying info
06:07:04 <cyredanthem[m]> That's terrible good on Google though for fixing
06:07:11 <strcat> it wasn't really google that fixed it
06:07:13 <strcat> it was qualcomm
06:07:17 <strcat> google might have made them do it
06:07:31 <strcat> they specifically fixed it for pixels
06:07:44 <strcat> I do not know if other modern qualcomm phones using the built-in SoC Wi-Fi support do the same thing
06:07:47 <cyredanthem[m]> My bad that was misleading of me
06:07:48 <cyredanthem[m]> I mean Qualcomm
06:07:54 <strcat> I have an optimistic feeling that they are fixed
06:07:56 <strcat> but I don't know
06:08:03 <strcat> and I don't think they fixed anything for Atheros in laptops, etc.
06:08:05 <cyredanthem[m]> Does iPhone out of curiosity if you have checked?
06:08:18 <strcat> it didn't have it fixed at the time Pixels fixed it
06:08:22 <strcat> I don't know if they do now
06:08:26 <strcat> I would guess they have
06:08:36 <strcat> but may be wrong - can't claim it is fixed, don't know
06:08:51 <cyredanthem[m]> Of course thanks for your wealth of knowledge
06:08:54 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: there were papers published on how MAC rand doesn't work
06:08:59 <strcat> and it impacted iphones
06:09:05 <strcat> and Qualcomm + Google directly fixed the problems
06:09:07 <strcat> following that
06:09:12 <strcat> others didn't even acknowledge it
06:09:18 <strcat> maybe apple fixed it but they haven't SAID they fixed it
06:09:33 <cyredanthem[m]> Terrible how few people know what you know.
06:10:53 <hypokeimenon[m]> thelearner: nice display name
06:11:54 <cyredanthem[m]> > strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): how did you learn all this? Links would be great, if you could. Thanks.
06:11:54 <cyredanthem[m]> Read everything he ever wrote on Reddit
06:12:01 <cyredanthem[m]> Then read it again
06:12:24 <cyredanthem[m]> I've done that once and I started again a few days ago
06:13:11 <hypokeimenon[m]> Ideally read around as well, reference stuff in whitepapers and documentation
06:13:21 <cyredanthem[m]> nm.reddit.com/u/DanielMicay or search topics on redditcommentsearch.com
06:13:53 <cyredanthem[m]> Read Google and Apple documentation they are pretty much the only ones I'd read
06:13:57 <hypokeimenon[m]> Find a decent network of other active security researchers and keep a critical ear to the community
06:14:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat "cyredanthem: my XPS 13 and other"> Curious: Are you wired, and/or wrapping your local network connection in VPN?
06:14:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> I wouldn't go wireless personally
06:14:40 <cyredanthem[m]> Read Daniel first since that's a what not to do
06:14:45 <cyredanthem[m]> The Reddit is great
06:15:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Then you will know enough to start reading Google and Apple docs
06:15:07 * hypokeimenon[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/fzyuCYyPSowIVGPbLfNtYaxj >
06:15:11 <cyredanthem[m]> thelearner: nm.reddit.com/u/DanielMicay
06:15:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Read all he has written in context
06:15:55 <cyredanthem[m]> It's a bit of work, but he's the most understandable guy who knows anything
06:15:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> cyredanthem: what is nm.reddit is it is minimised like I.reddit?
06:15:59 <cyredanthem[m]> It's night mode
06:16:02 <hypokeimenon[m]> JS minimised*
06:16:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> Oh nevermind then
06:16:34 <cyredanthem[m]> thelearner: don't go to Reddit beside /r/grapheneOS or maybe /r/netsec it's a shithole
06:16:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> can you do nm.old.reddit.com?
06:17:00 <cyredanthem[m]> It's old Reddit by default
06:17:19 <cyredanthem[m]> nm.reddit.com is old reddit
06:17:39 <cyredanthem[m]> i.reddit.com is slightly more usable without js. I use that occasionally
06:18:16 <hypokeimenon[m]> I.reddit is what I use currently but it's not good on the eyes
06:19:14 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm surprised that /r/netsec isn't a complete shitshow yet, but if you need security news it's the least shit way to get it
06:19:30 <cyredanthem[m]> Just use common sense though
06:20:30 <JTL> ^^
06:20:41 <cyredanthem[m]> Keep in mind CVE count and even value of exploits are pointless metrics
06:20:48 <JTL> Yeah
06:21:02 <cyredanthem[m]> The better hardened a system the less useful attacks
06:21:09 <cyredanthem[m]> Therefore lesser value
06:21:40 <cyredanthem[m]> If I have a hardened system 700 CVEs a year that's going to beat the crappy side project system with 300 CVEs
06:22:12 <cyredanthem[m]> If someone starts referencing CVE counts as the end all be all of security ignore them
06:22:19 <JTL> ^^
06:22:32 <cyredanthem[m]> > So netsec is one of the best for tech info?
06:22:32 <cyredanthem[m]> Beside Twitter from Daniel and thegrugq yes
06:22:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> <thelearner[m] "So netsec is one of the best for"> I think people like lobster.rs and hacker news more
06:22:44 <JTL> "This has less CVEs. Because no one looked!"
06:22:46 <JTL> lol
06:22:47 <cyredanthem[m]> hypokeimenon: there's so much misinfo on both
06:23:32 <cyredanthem[m]> > "This has less CVEs. Because no one looked!"
06:23:32 <cyredanthem[m]> Or people saying their crappy OnePlus system is more secure than an iPhone since Zerodium has their exploits value dropping. That's naive.
06:23:33 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "hypokeimenon: there's so much mi"> Thanks, I wasn't aware of that.
06:23:53 <cyredanthem[m]> Hacker News is not a reliable source for security news sadly
06:24:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> what about lobste.rs?
06:25:45 <cyredanthem[m]> GrapheneOS exploits would be terrible unreliable and wouldn't persist they would be worth far less than say a Samsung(which even POTUS uses).
06:26:01 <cyredanthem[m]> > what about lobste.rs?
06:26:01 <cyredanthem[m]> I can't vouch for it personally especially for a beginner
06:27:34 <hypokeimenon[m]> Wilders security forums?
06:28:02 <cyredanthem[m]> That is bad too
06:28:22 <cyredanthem[m]> I mainly use Twitter, but I used to be active there
06:29:06 <cyredanthem[m]> Twitter is the best source. If you need something more traditional then you can look at then I guess /r/netsec
06:29:11 <strcat> well also
06:29:22 <strcat> most projects / software products do not get CVEs assigned
06:29:31 <strcat> they see CVEs as PR and try to avoid them
06:29:41 <strcat> so they are never going to get a CVE assigned for their own fixes
06:29:51 <strcat> and they will try to actively avoid it for other people's reports
06:30:03 <strcat> CVE is a pretty broken / dubious system anyway
06:30:20 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes Debian is infamous for that
06:30:21 <strcat> so for example with linux maybe 2% of security fixes get a CVE
06:30:36 <strcat> but it gets a LOT more CVE assignments than other projects
06:30:45 <strcat> because for most projects it's more like 0% for regular development
06:30:52 <cyredanthem[m]> CVEs are garbage and worse psudeo intellectuals think they understand it
06:31:01 <strcat> linux is also a huge project with a huge amount of code / bugs
06:31:16 <strcat> but you can't really draw any conclusions from CVEs...
06:31:24 <strcat> people trying to do that are idiots or just scammers
06:31:38 <cyredanthem[m]> I lose respect for anyone that takes CVEs seriously instantly
06:31:56 <strcat> it doesn't mean much at all because most projects avoid CVEs
06:32:01 <strcat> they just fix the bugs
06:32:08 <strcat> and don't announce anything
06:32:19 <hypokeimenon[m]> What's a good way to track security issues, fixes and speed etc.
06:32:29 <strcat> certain companies like Apple and Google are very meticulous about getting CVE assignments
06:32:32 <strcat> for each security fix
06:32:36 <strcat> but that's incredibly rare
06:32:43 <strcat> and they definitely don't do it for all, especially Apple
06:32:47 <cyredanthem[m]> > What's a good way to track security issues, fixes and speed etc.
06:32:47 <cyredanthem[m]> Study the companies and pretty much only trust Google and Apple
06:33:37 <cyredanthem[m]> CVE tracking is an exercise in futility
06:34:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Even looking at bug bounty stuff is not always a good indicator
06:37:29 <cyredanthem[m]> hypokeimenon: you're just not going to find this stuff. If security is an after thought to image and performance there's you're screwed
06:37:54 <hypokeimenon[m]> Unfortunately that seems to be the case
06:39:08 <cyredanthem[m]> Read trusted security professionals and follow Google and too a lesser extent Apple(I've done some basic research based off their documentation and it helps me personally)
06:39:27 <cyredanthem[m]> That's all you can do unless your highly involved with the projects
06:39:40 <hypokeimenon[m]> What would at least be helpful would be two-three or more decent info/cybersec communities to integrate with and bounce off/learn from
06:40:50 <cyredanthem[m]> Daniel Micay's Twitter, thegrugq, following chromium and AOSP
06:41:21 <cyredanthem[m]> Communities really haven't formed beside here
06:42:25 <strcat> the infosec community i.e. security researchers / engineers is mostly on twitter
06:43:00 <cyredanthem[m]> I use nitter rss exclusively for my security news and discussion
06:43:01 <strcat> make a twitter account, follow everyone I follow other than ~20 that are not infosec related
06:44:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> Nitter rss feed seems like a good bet, thanks strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org) cyredanthem
06:45:11 <cyredanthem[m]> I check Feeder on my phone every day to get what strcat is talking about. I don't use a Twitter account since no phone number
06:46:04 <cyredanthem[m]> I have a slightly different follow list so obviously defer to strcat's list
06:46:21 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm going to review mine and see if I can improve it
06:47:52 <strcat> I just tried to make a list on twitter
06:47:55 <strcat> and this UI is fucking horrible
06:48:58 <hypokeimenon[m]> On nitter?
06:49:18 <cyredanthem[m]> Nitter is just for rss feeds
06:49:24 <cyredanthem[m]> That's all I use it for
06:54:09 <cyredanthem[m]> <strcat "and this UI is fucking horrible"> hypokeimenon: less is more for who to follow on security or tech in general
06:54:09 <cyredanthem[m]> Wrong quote
06:56:01 <hypokeimenon[m]> Hmm. I disagree and agree. I understand if the point you're making is that in reality, it isn't long until you encounter individuals who through apathy, circumstance or laziness- will just be misinforming or rehashing.
06:56:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> In principle it is better to get information from as many 'competent' sources as possible and form a holistic falsifiable judgement.
06:57:07 <cyredanthem[m]> Competent is the hard part right now
06:57:11 <cyredanthem[m]> There's precious few
06:57:36 <hypokeimenon[m]> And the issue is that it is difficult not to run into misinformation.
06:58:38 <cyredanthem[m]> One thing I highly recommend is reading all of Daniel's posts on Reddit and then dive into the Chromium docs
06:58:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> Tbh I know there are other forces like visibility and critical adoption at play but it kind of sucks that the infosec comm. is on Twitter.
06:59:03 <cyredanthem[m]> What's wrong with Twitter?
07:00:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> It's Twitter. By design it isn't for nuanced exchange
07:01:30 <cyredanthem[m]> So read mailing lists? I'm not sure how you're going to find nuanced exchanges about serious security matters
07:02:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> Don't worry about me, I'm just venting.
07:02:59 <cyredanthem[m]> There's so much good stuff you could read
07:03:08 <cyredanthem[m]> Chromium documention is wonderful
07:03:23 <cyredanthem[m]> Android documentation
07:04:06 <cyredanthem[m]> I read Apple documentation, but I'm a macOS user so probably not as relevant
07:04:39 <cyredanthem[m]> There's good you don't need to read garbage on Reddit or whatnot
07:05:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> No, you've helped a lot already. I'm just being entitled.
07:06:52 <cyredanthem[m]> hypokeimenon: are you a developer?
07:07:32 <hypokeimenon[m]> No
07:11:14 <cyredanthem[m]> hypokeimenon: the current state of affairs is not excellent
07:11:32 <cyredanthem[m]> That's what happens when you build the internet from the ground up as everyone is trusted
07:11:48 <cyredanthem[m]> A lot of people are too young to have watched the internet chance
07:11:52 <cyredanthem[m]> Change*
07:13:56 <hiya> hi
07:14:11 <hypokeimenon[m]> do you reckon it's better to remake the internet than continue patching up something that wasn't designed to be secure?
07:14:22 <hypokeimenon[m]> <hiya "hi"> hiya
07:16:33 <hiya> I am wondering whether or not there is a possibility to make grapheneOS for other popular devices like OnePlus?

07:17:15 <hiya> Yes
07:17:52 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
07:18:14 <hypokeimenon[m]> And you've understood everything said here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
07:20:03 <hiya> It doesn't make any sense for me.
07:20:07 <hiya> But okay
07:20:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> Sorry to ask, but are you an English native?
07:20:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> Which parts did you not understand?
07:21:09 <hiya> hypokeimenon[m]: Yes. I cannot follow why is it hard to support OnePlus?
07:21:34 <hiya> Are they not helping? Does this need more support than what LineageOS guys need?
07:21:47 <hiya> strcat[m]: I talked to you in Copperhead long back
07:21:54 <hiya> Are you the same guy?
07:21:54 <hypokeimenon[m]> It is not a question of whether it is hard or not.
07:22:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> It's a question of whether the device is appropriate and there is the man power to do it
07:22:20 <strcat[m]> OnePlus devices do not meet the requirements
07:22:38 <strcat[m]> we don't want or need help adding support for them
07:22:45 <strcat[m]> we need help adding support for the Pixel 4 and 4 XL, then the Pixel 4a
07:22:51 <strcat[m]> and maybe other devices meeting the requirements
07:22:59 <strcat[m]> and we need a ton of resources to make our own hardware
07:23:11 <strcat[m]> we don't want to add support for random devices for no particular reason
07:23:25 <strcat[m]> this is explained in https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support quite well I think
07:23:34 <strcat[m]> read the whole section, don't skim it
07:23:37 <cyredanthem[m]> OnePlus is consistently bad on security. The website lines that all up
07:24:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> <hiya "I am wondering whether or not th"> It is not a case of wanting to exclude popular devices. It is not a case of supporting certain devices out of anything but meeting the security requirements.
07:25:53 <hiya> Hmmm
07:25:58 <strcat[m]> we don't care how popular a device is - that doesn't factor into anything and misunderstands the nature and purpose of GrapheneOs
07:26:02 <strcat[m]>  * we don't care how popular a device is - that doesn't factor into anything and misunderstands the nature and purpose of GrapheneOS
07:26:09 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is not a "custom ROM"
07:26:20 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is not something to put on your existing phone to make the privacy/security less bad
07:26:32 <cyredanthem[m]> GrapheneOS you buy a phone for
07:26:36 <strcat[m]> that's fundamentally not what it is and if you think it's a "custom ROM" you are misunderstanding the project and the purpose of it
07:26:39 <hiya> But in most part of the globe Pixel phones are as rare as Cheetah
07:26:48 <hiya> For example in India
07:26:49 <strcat[m]> don't care how rare they are
07:26:50 <strcat[m]> popularity is not a factor
07:26:54 <strcat[m]> eventually we won't support Pixels at all
07:27:05 <strcat[m]> we are not EVER going to support OnePlus devices
07:27:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> <hiya "But in most part of the globe Pi"> This is not by design, it is unfortunately a case of being one of the few options that meets the security requirements.
07:27:19 <strcat[m]> Pixels are what we use until we have our own hardware or something better
07:27:38 <strcat[m]> eventually we will not need to support Pixels at all, we can just have our own hardware
07:27:50 <hiya> What do you think about Fairphone?
07:28:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Terrible
07:28:07 <strcat[m]> hiya: doesn't meet the requirements/standards
07:28:11 <strcat[m]> doesn't come close
07:28:16 <hiya> Popular deGoogled ROMs like /e/ are supporting it now
07:28:20 <cyredanthem[m]> Just get an iPhone if you don't want a Pixel. That's the only reasonable other option
07:28:28 <strcat[m]> hiya: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support in the entirety
07:28:35 <strcat[m]> hiya: GrapheneOS is not a "custom ROM"
07:28:42 <cyredanthem[m]> Oh boy /e/ is so shit
07:28:47 <strcat[m]> hiya: GrapheneOS is not an insecure OS without full security updates
07:29:00 <strcat[m]> hiya: GrapheneOS is not a hobbyist project
07:29:02 <hypokeimenon[m]> <hiya "For example in India"> I hear you, but as strcat has said. The phone just has to meet the requirements and the team needs resources to maintain it. It's not meant to exclude any particular community.
07:29:10 <strcat[m]> hiya: GrapheneOS does not substantially roll back the standard privacy/security model
07:29:27 <strcat[m]> hiya: it's not relevant to bring up unrelated projects that are not alternatives/competitors to it
07:29:28 <hiya> cyredanthem[m]: iPhone doesn't care about privacy. It just fakes and fleeces
07:29:30 <strcat[m]> we are not interested in doing what they do
07:29:36 <cyredanthem[m]> Lineage and /e/ ship updates every month that don't actually meet the label they put on it. They break the sandbox partially and they break verified boot completely
07:29:46 <cyredanthem[m]> hiya: source missing
07:29:53 <strcat[m]> hiya: look, GrapheneOS is not a "custom ROM", you aren't understanding the purpose and nature of the project
07:30:00 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is not something that aims to replace the OS on your phone, sorry
07:30:16 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
07:30:29 <hiya> strcat[m]: Replaces? It is Android OS without Google Apps pre-installed.
07:30:42 <strcat[m]> hiya: no, that is not what it is at all
07:30:48 <hiya> cromnion[m]: verified boot is not broke with /e/ on officially supported phones.
07:30:52 <strcat[m]> hiya: you are totally missing the point of the project and misunderstanding it
07:31:04 <strcat[m]> hiya: yes it certainly is, lol
07:31:05 <cyredanthem[m]> GrapheneOS is a security research and hardening project read the front page
07:31:15 <strcat[m]> hiya: please don't spread misinformation here - if you don't know what you're talking about, don't make claims about it
07:31:31 <strcat[m]> hiya: you need to read https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support before posting more here
07:32:21 <strcat[m]> at the very least read the https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices section
07:33:17 <strcat[m]> hiya: GrapheneOS does not exist to provide Android without Google apps and services, GrapheneOS is not a custom ROM, and GrapheneOS is not intended as a replacement for the OS on people's existing devices
07:33:22 <strcat[m]> that is not the purpose of it or what it is
07:33:45 <strcat[m]> I strongly suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/ as a starting point and reading the whole device support section in the FAQ
07:33:57 <strcat[m]> I wish there was more documentation on the project but that's what there is right now
07:34:30 <strcat[m]> it's discouraging / demotivating when people won't read what was already written there and it slows down making progress on more documentation
07:34:44 <hiya> strcat[m]>	hiya: yes it certainly is, lol | Are you saying verified boot doesn't work with officially supported devices on their ROM?
07:35:06 <strcat[m]> hiya: yes, among other privacy/security features they roll back, it does not have verified boot
07:35:31 <strcat[m]> hiya: it does not provide full security updates, does not provide the full standard privacy/security model and does not have verified boot - those are facts
07:35:42 <cyredanthem[m]> > strcat[m]>	hiya: yes it certainly is, lol | Are you saying verified boot doesn't work with officially supported devices on their ROM?
07:35:42 <cyredanthem[m]>  Verified boot only works on the Stock ROM on all devices, except Pixels which need it specifically setup
07:36:01 <strcat[m]> hiya: it is not doing work in the same space as GrapheneOS, there is basically 0 overlap between that project and ours
07:36:01 <cyredanthem[m]> Verified boot requires custom key support
07:36:07 <strcat[m]> they do not do the kind of work we do
07:36:29 <strcat[m]> hiya: even just reading the first paragraph on https://grapheneos.org/ would correct some of your misunderstandings
07:36:34 <hiya> cyredanthem[m]: verified boot is supported for Fairphone 3 with /e/.
07:36:42 <Shippwrecked[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "do you reckon it's better to rem"> It's not practical anymore and wouldn't be enough anyway. People would still want things like dynamic interactive websites so you would have to remake the entire computer stack around securely running untrusted code. If we ever get to a state of health in security it will be through decades of piecemeal changes imo.
07:37:22 <hiya> strcat[m]: What do you mean it isn't meant for existing devices? Pixel is existing and you are using those only?
07:37:32 <hiya> Anyways. It is for Android dev not layman like me
07:37:47 <strcat[m]> it is not for "Android dev"
07:37:50 <strcat[m]> whatever that's supposed to mean
07:38:00 <hypokeimenon[m]> Might be a language barrier
07:38:39 <cyredanthem[m]> > cyredanthem: verified boot is supported for Fairphone 3 with /e/.
07:38:40 <cyredanthem[m]> That's using an exploit against the bootloader if that actually works
07:38:40 <strcat[m]> hiya: locking the bootloader does not mean there is actually verified boot
07:38:46 <hiya> This grapheneOS is either meant for Android developers exclusively
07:38:56 <strcat[m]> hiya: and it does not mean the OS provides a full implementation of verified boot
07:38:57 <strcat[m]> sorry bud
07:39:01 <cyredanthem[m]> Fairphone is an EDL exploit
07:39:03 <strcat[m]> hiya: no, it isn't
07:39:06 <cyredanthem[m]> That's not a viable solution
07:39:12 <hiya> cyredanthem[m]: Fairphone 3 is partnering with /e/ officially
07:39:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> <Shippwrecked[m] "It's not practical anymore and w"> not in my lifetime then lol
07:39:19 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm not an Android developer I'm just a user
07:39:23 <strcat[m]> hiya: stop spreading FUD / misinformation because you didn't get the answer you wanted, thanks
07:39:35 <JTL> cyredanthem[m]: I think the Fairphone 3 is closer to Qualcomm design but otherwise don't quote me on that
07:39:41 <strcat[m]> we aren't supporting OnePlus devices
07:39:48 <JTL> I looked through the docs awhile back and didn't find anything about AVB custom keys
07:40:07 <cyredanthem[m]> <hiya "cyredanthem: Fairphone 3 is part"> JTL: it is an exploit in EDL to support it
07:40:11 <cyredanthem[m]> Theoretically
07:40:24 <JTL> Oof
07:40:29 <cyredanthem[m]> Theoretically and that's one device that may or may not actually work
07:40:35 <JTL> I thought you were referring to an exploit to bypass it
07:40:37 <JTL> lol
07:41:01 <cyredanthem[m]> No it's an exploit to make it work
07:41:02 <hypokeimenon[m]> <hiya "This grapheneOS is either meant "> research project does not mean Android developers exclusively, there is also no reason why GrapheneOS supports Pixel devices other than meeting the requirements
07:41:23 <strcat[m]> that's not what it says on the site anyway
07:41:34 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/#grapheneos
07:41:42 <strcat[m]> > GrapheneOS is an open source privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app compatibility. It's focused on the research and development of privacy and security technology including substantial improvements to sandboxing, exploit mitigations and the permission model. GrapheneOS also develops various apps and services with a focus on privacy and security.
07:41:54 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
07:41:54 <cyredanthem[m]> JTL: https://forum.fairphone.com/t/fairphone-3-unlocking-without-oem-unlocking/57683/7
07:42:01 <strcat[m]> > Devices are carefully chosen based on their merits rather than the project aiming to have broad device support. Broad device support is counter to the aims of the project, and the project will eventually be engaging in hardware and firmware level improvements rather than only offering suggestions and bug reports upstream for those areas. Much of the work on the project involves changes that are specific to different
07:42:01 <strcat[m]> devices, and officially supported devices are the ones targeted by most of this ongoing work.
07:42:11 <hiya> Hmm
07:42:14 <JTL> cyredanthem[m]: okay
07:42:39 <JTL> :/
07:42:56 <strcat[m]> cyredanthem: btw it's the TEE incorporating the verified boot key into key derivation that ties encryption to that
07:43:06 <strcat[m]> and having that doesn't mean the device has verified boot enforcement
07:43:10 <Shippwrecked[m]> <hiya "This grapheneOS is either meant "> No it's designed to provide the highest level of security possible so only targets devices that have good hardware security features
07:43:19 <Shippwrecked[m]> OnePlus is not one such phone
07:43:28 <hiya> cyredanthem[m]: So OEM unlock means it cannot have verified boot? :P
07:43:42 <hiya> Shippwrecked[m]: Ok.
07:44:06 <hiya> Shippwrecked[m]: So, Google Pixel phones have hardware security features? Like a dedicated t2 chip?
07:44:13 <JTL> Pixels have OEM unlock and verified boot
07:44:37 <strcat[m]> running a command to lock the bootloader does NOT mean that the device is providing meaningful verified boot with that OS
07:44:42 <strcat[m]> pretty straightforward
07:44:51 <cyredanthem[m]> > cyredanthem: So OEM unlock means it cannot have verified boot? :P
07:44:51 <cyredanthem[m]> Nowhere did I say that. It's a broken setup to appear like it works
07:45:22 <hiya> Ok you guys are correct about verified boot.
07:45:25 <hiya> It's a complex case for open source, and it generally secret keys in the ROM and information from hardware manufacturers. We have secure boot with FP3, but not yet verified boot, we hope we can have it this year.
07:45:36 <hiya> From lead dev ^
07:46:05 <strcat[m]> hiya: misleading to say that there is secure boot
07:46:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> Source?
07:46:07 <cyredanthem[m]> hiya: they are doing it all wrong and can't verify it
07:46:36 <strcat[m]> hiya: Qualcomm Secure Boot being there for the firmware is a given - it is very misleading to say that the device has secure boot because of that being there
07:46:44 <hiya> "As far as I understant, it seems that only Google pixel models make secure boot possible for custom ROMs at the moment, and possibly a few other devices with some tricks"
07:46:44 <cyredanthem[m]> Exploiting the system keeps it safe is not a secure option. It just looks like it works. It's not secure boot(which is useless anyway)
07:46:47 <strcat[m]> hiya: it's misleading spin / misinformation
07:46:54 <hiya> This is what lead dev told me
07:46:58 <hiya> strcat[m]: Ok
07:47:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> <hiya ""As far as I understant, it seem"> Where are you getting this from btw?
07:47:14 <strcat[m]> hiya: I don't know how many other devices support it but there is more to it than the hardware supporting it anyway
07:47:26 <strcat[m]> the OS also has to support it and preserve the security model for it
07:47:31 <strcat[m]> LineageOS does not do that
07:47:37 <hiya> "There is some documentation on grapheneOS website about this, and in Daniel Micays threads on twitter."
07:47:43 <hiya> Omg, they are also referring to you
07:47:52 <hiya> You guys are top of top when it comes to security
07:48:08 <hiya> Sorry
07:48:13 <hiya> I thought I knew best
07:48:15 <cyredanthem[m]> hiya: Google has taken code from this project
07:48:20 <Shippwrecked[m]> <hiya "/dev/null: So, Google Pixel phon"> Not a T2 chip specifically, but yes
07:48:54 <Shippwrecked[m]> And also the ability to support verified boot with custom ROMs
07:49:13 <hiya> hmm
07:49:18 <hiya> GrapheneOS rocks!
07:49:26 <cyredanthem[m]> Which is exclusive to Pixels on modern Android phones
07:49:34 <hiya> Hu-ha this is sparta!!
07:49:47 <hiya> cyredanthem[m]: ok
07:49:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> <hiya "GrapheneOS rocks!"> Ok man, you're starting to sound facetious
07:50:03 <hiya> Shippwrecked[m]: Can you share some details?
07:50:26 <strcat[m]> we want to support the Pixel 4 and 4 XL so that the project can have current generation devices supported / tested
07:50:31 <strcat[m]> and then the Pixel 4a
07:50:41 <hiya> Ok. I will buy Pixel 4a when it comes to India
07:50:54 <strcat[m]> supporting Pixels is what we do now in the short term because they offer the best privacy and security
07:51:06 <strcat[m]> in the long term
07:51:12 <strcat[m]> we want to have more security focused hardware with GrapheneOS having control over it
07:51:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <hypokeimenon[m] "It's Twitter. By design it isn't"> Twitter w/ links to blogposts/CVEs/comments in threads, and carefully chosen words...I hate the platform, but the security community is there, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere, unfortunately.
07:51:26 <hiya> strcat[m]: is there anyting like t2 chip in pixel phones?
07:51:33 <cyredanthem[m]> Would you consider Qualcomm reference devices as a base?
07:51:34 <strcat[m]> hiya: there is the Titan M
07:51:36 <cyredanthem[m]> > strcat: is there anyting like t2 chip in pixel phones?
07:51:36 <cyredanthem[m]> Titan M
07:51:38 <hiya> Ok
07:51:47 <strcat[m]> we will have documentation on things like this on the site in the future
07:52:18 <strcat[m]> cyredanthem: that's what I've said before: we want to take a Qualcomm reference board/phone and put in the hard work to get it set up properly and on the same level as Pixels, which is a lot of work
07:52:19 <strcat[m]> that is gen 1
07:52:20 <cyredanthem[m]> Is there anyway I could help with cleaning up Reddit posts of yours into documentation?
07:52:32 <strcat[m]> people have tried to help but it mostly just creates more work for me
07:52:47 <hiya> strcat[m]: I think you only told me Google Pixel with stock are more secure than LineageOS on same device? Or someone else. But what do you think about data that Google harvests?
07:52:49 <cyredanthem[m]> I fully understand
07:53:15 <strcat[m]> hiya: yes, the stock OS is substantially more secure than nearly any hobbyist aftermarket OS
07:53:27 <strcat[m]> which do not take privacy and security seriously and at best pretend they do, in nearly every case
07:53:38 <cyredanthem[m]> Disable gapps to opt out of data collection
07:53:41 <strcat[m]> there are only a few options that preserve the privacy/security model of AOSP
07:53:45 <cyredanthem[m]> You're good to go
07:54:42 <hiya> hmm
07:54:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> The frontpage/most upvoted stuff isn't reliable for security news. The comments sometimes can be. The further pages out can definitely be solid (and are mostly where lobste.rs gets its content, but that's slowly changing so lobste.rs is worth poking your head into. I just found this a few pages into HN, today: https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/turning-signal-app-into-a-coarse-tracking-device-643eb4298447
07:55:08 <hiya> What do you think about camera quality? Does GrapheneOS cam app offer same camera quality?
07:55:10 <hypokeimenon[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): just wondering but is there any point to (or research into) those egregious 'security' phones in non consumer markets like the gsmk/bittium etc. ?
07:55:37 <cyredanthem[m]> hypokeimenon: I've done write-ups on why they are all shit
07:55:37 <strcat[m]> hiya: covered on the site
07:55:57 <cyredanthem[m]> hiya: read the whole site you will learn what you need to know
07:56:02 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "hypokeimenon: I've done write-up"> Oh link?
07:56:16 <cyredanthem[m]> I will need to find them they are further back
07:56:30 <strcat[m]> cyredanthem: it would be helpful if people made good documentation for the site but in general it doesn't meet the standards and it will just sit there and use my time
07:56:39 <strcat[m]> cyredanthem: it's hard for me to make documentation for the site I can't just write something and publish it
07:56:48 <strcat[m]> it takes a lot of work to write it and review / reword it
07:56:55 <hiya> ok
07:57:00 <hypokeimenon[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "The frontpage/most upvoted stuff"> thanks
07:57:13 <strcat[m]> and certain topics are hard to cover
07:57:19 <strcat[m]> if I include a section about say, what the security chip on the supported devices does
07:57:29 <cyredanthem[m]> They just advertise features that Google and Apple have had for years, but they do a terrible job implementing them hypokeimenon. I forgot where I saved that do you have a phone in mind? I have written up about 3 or 4 of them
07:57:32 <strcat[m]> that's a lot of work to rewrite in an accurate and understandable way
07:57:39 <strcat[m]> and people can easily misunderstand stuff
07:58:03 <strcat[m]> as one recent example someone read https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers
07:58:05 <strcat[m]> and sent me a confused email
07:58:08 <strcat[m]> > Apps targeting Android 10 will receive a SecurityException and older apps will receive an empty value for compatibility.
07:58:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Just use a Pixel or iPhone if you need a secure phone really. They are cheap and excellent. Enterprise support is top notch.
07:58:18 <strcat[m]> because for some reason they interpreted this as meaning apps can access it...
07:58:19 <strcat[m]> :|
07:58:41 <cyredanthem[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): I understand I'm sorry I can't help more
07:58:48 <cyredanthem[m]> I really respect the work you do
07:59:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "They just advertise features tha"> Most of them look completely bogus but iirc the GSMK Cryptophone series is 'source-available' and the Bittium Mobile looked the least shady.
07:59:55 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm still working on that safer stub implemention of microg, but that codebase is shit
08:00:16 <cyredanthem[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Most of them look completely bog"> hypokeimenon: Bittium is shit, but it's the best of the shitty knockoff phones I found
08:00:32 <cyredanthem[m]> I rather buy a Samsung really
08:00:38 <hypokeimenon[m]> Seems like it
08:00:44 <cyredanthem[m]> And Samsung is very irresponsible at times on security
08:01:01 <cyredanthem[m]> There's no reason for any company or person to not buy a Pixel or iPhone
08:01:02 <cyredanthem[m]> There's no debate
08:01:14 <cyredanthem[m]> If security and privacy are important you will buy one of those
08:01:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> How are they still in business lol
08:01:31 <cyredanthem[m]> hypokeimenon: stupid people and contracts
08:01:56 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "There's no reason for any compan"> iPhones are generally expensive and Pixels may not be available in some countries
08:02:22 <cyredanthem[m]> They market shitty reimplementations of Google and Apple(and GrapheneOS) features

08:02:50 <cyredanthem[m]> > iPhones are generally expensive and Pixels may not be available in some countries
08:02:50 <cyredanthem[m]> iPhones you can get anywhere and they aren't that bad in price if you keep them for 5 years
08:02:59 <cyredanthem[m]> There's no excuse if that's your priority
08:03:24 <cyredanthem[m]> Google Pixels are hard to get, but iPhones are manageable if it's important it will happen
08:04:19 <cyredanthem[m]> Like Bittium is literally a shitty Pixel 3a solid at $2k. They have some features that have been standard on iPhone and Pixels for years marketed as the next hot thing
08:04:30 <cyredanthem[m]> It's so manipulative
08:04:53 <hypokeimenon[m]> Did you manage to look into the GSMK at all?
08:04:58 <cyredanthem[m]> You are worried about your phone use a reputable case maker
08:05:12 <cyredanthem[m]> > Did you manage to look into the GSMK at all?
08:05:12 <cyredanthem[m]> Yeah I can see if I can find my write up
08:06:28 <cyredanthem[m]> Oh yeah that's the phone they have almost no information on and looks super old
08:06:42 <cyredanthem[m]> I have the PDF somewhere
08:06:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> yeah it is old
08:07:05 <cyredanthem[m]> Old phones are not secure
08:07:30 <hypokeimenon[m]> tbh all of them looked shit but GSMK at least let you download the source code
08:08:03 <cyredanthem[m]> That's not a good reason
08:08:23 <cyredanthem[m]> I'd take puke in my mouth first(I mean Bittium)

08:18:48 <Shippwrecked[m]> Distant third
08:19:54 <cyredanthem[m]> I don't have a strong preference between Motorola and Samsung. I have had both and worked on ROMs(in my ignorance). They are okay. They give it some effort
08:20:18 <cyredanthem[m]> I just don't see that from anyone else
08:21:45 <cyredanthem[m]> Just use Google and Apple phones. GrapheneOS is my first choice. Specifically pair an iPhone with an iPad Pro as your main laptop if you can pull that off.
08:21:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> iirc it's only motorola and nokia phones on the android one project
08:22:13 <EssentialChaos[m> <hypokeimenon[m] "iirc it's only motorola and noki"> There are also some Xiaomi phones
08:22:38 <cyredanthem[m]> Honestly it's moot
08:22:46 <cyredanthem[m]> To me phones don't exist if they aren't Google or Apple
08:24:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> Didn't the Pixel C run Android
08:24:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes
08:24:48 <cyredanthem[m]> Nexus tablets have been supported for this project before
08:24:53 <cyredanthem[m]> A tablet isn't impossible
08:25:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> Shame it is old now, Pixel 3a and Pixel C could be a nice combo
08:25:17 <cyredanthem[m]> iPad Pro is the only tablet/laptop tier device with any appreciable security model
08:25:19 <cyredanthem[m]> Period
08:25:32 <cyredanthem[m]> I mean Pixelbook or Pixel Slate, but it's not as good and it's not as private
08:25:34 <cyredanthem[m]> It's still decent though
08:25:35 <EssentialChaos[m> My family member needs a new phone, so I just searched for Pixel 3a in the area, where they live, and the only one available is ~$620
08:25:38 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yeah but those run x86_64 and Chrome OS
08:25:53 <cyredanthem[m]> EssentialChaos: you should get a very old iPhone for them used
08:26:24 <cyredanthem[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Yeah but those run x86_64 and Ch"> hypokeimenon: again iPhone and iPad Pro are the best combo for the average person
08:26:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "My family member needs a new pho"> Can you get one for cheaper and mail it to them? 620 is way too expensive and that's my European perspective lol
08:27:00 <Shippwrecked[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "My family member needs a new pho"> iPhone SE would be a good choice
08:27:21 <cyredanthem[m]> If you can get an iPhone SE do it
08:27:22 <Shippwrecked[m]> A little expensive initial purchase but likely at least 5 years of support
08:28:10 <EssentialChaos[m> <Shippwrecked[m] "iPhone SE would be a good choice"> Would it, though? Only because of updates? Because otherwise it seems rather expensive for that hardware
08:28:29 <EssentialChaos[m> Oh, wait, do you mean the first one?
08:28:38 <cyredanthem[m]> No the new one
08:28:41 <cyredanthem[m]> It's great hardware beside the flashy bits
08:28:51 <cyredanthem[m]> It has great updates potential
08:28:55 <cyredanthem[m]> It's very secure
08:29:14 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "It's great hardware beside the f"> Its great hardware ends with CPU, which is not really what's needed
08:29:34 <cyredanthem[m]> It has a great build, waterproofing, and wireless charging
08:30:00 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "Its great hardware ends with CPU"> And it costs ~$560
08:30:01 <cyredanthem[m]> Plenty of ram, a good camera, and a good enough battery by a bit
08:30:20 <cyredanthem[m]> EssentialChaos: sounds way better than the Pixel 3a for 2 years
08:30:21 <EssentialChaos[m> Also I am not sure I can convince them to buy an iPhone
08:30:23 <Shippwrecked[m]> That's like $100/year I'd say it's worth it if you plan to keep it a long time
08:31:22 <EssentialChaos[m> For reference, the budget is about $280-300
08:31:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> Pixel 2?
08:31:40 <cyredanthem[m]> > Pixel 2?
08:31:40 <cyredanthem[m]> Done in October
08:31:57 <cyredanthem[m]> > For reference, the budget is about $280-300
08:31:57 <cyredanthem[m]> iPhone 8, but it has checkm8 I think
08:32:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Which is very minor
08:32:03 <cyredanthem[m]> But still worth knowing
08:32:53 <BallMonokuma[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "It's very secure"> Not very private or libre, afaik
08:32:54 <cyredanthem[m]> Used iPhone 8 is all you will find that is acceptable for that price point
08:33:13 <cyredanthem[m]> Ball Monokuma: what are you referring too?
08:33:17 <cyredanthem[m]> Which device

08:35:56 <cyredanthem[m]> > Not very private or libre, afaik
08:35:56 <cyredanthem[m]> Oh iPhone. I have MITMd them they are fine. They respect your settings. There's no evidence of that being a problem privacy wise. I would avoid iCloud though. It's about half open source, but that doesn't help much for privacy or security practically. Especially compared to stock Android. It's night and day
08:37:09 <cyredanthem[m]> I had an iPhone for a long time. They do live up to their privacy claims. They make their money off killing right to repair
08:38:49 <BallMonokuma[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Which device"> Just apple services in general. https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/ (iirc you are required to make an apple ID to install apps without jailbreaking)

08:47:57 <hypokeimenon[m]> <BallMonokuma[m] "Security and privacy are linked,"> Security is a requirement for privacy. Tbh it's more important. You get privacy as a result of good data, hardware and software security plus good information control
08:48:00 <cyredanthem[m]> That's much better than any alternative beside GrapheneOS
08:48:23 <cyredanthem[m]> iOS has superior third party privacy as well which is a factor

08:53:41 <BallMonokuma[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Ball Monokuma: GrapheneOS is not"> Aurora store + f-droid should be usable.

08:54:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Ball Monokuma: notifications Snapchat
08:54:12 <cyredanthem[m]> There's a lot of reasons you'll make someone mad doing that
08:54:28 <cyredanthem[m]> I've tried it
08:54:33 <EssentialChaos[m> <BallMonokuma[m] "Aurora store + f-droid should be"> There are also Google service, which are required by some apps
08:55:33 <cyredanthem[m]> I mean you can sideload the gapps apks on GrapheneOS. Technically that's not really gapps though. It also has privacy implications still. Graphene can't magically fix that
08:55:37 <BallMonokuma[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Ball Monokuma: notifications Sna"> Ah yeah, forgot about push notifications, though they shouldn't make the phone unusable (But that's coming from a guys that doesn't use many chat apps).
08:55:40 <BallMonokuma[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "There are also Google service, w"> Yeah, unfortunately
08:55:54 <cyredanthem[m]> Ball Monokuma: for the average person it does I tried sadly
08:56:03 <cyredanthem[m]> Look at P40 reviews too
08:56:08 <cyredanthem[m]> They hate it
08:57:21 <BallMonokuma[m]> Still, a grapheneOS phone with GServices flashed would still be more private than stock Iphone, right?
08:57:27 <cyredanthem[m]> No way
08:57:38 <cyredanthem[m]> Google play services are horrible
08:57:41 <hypokeimenon[m]> Why add google services
08:57:52 <cyredanthem[m]> They give out a unique ad id to every app
08:58:06 <cyredanthem[m]> They send massive amounts of data to Google
08:58:11 <cyredanthem[m]> You can't get around gapps sucking
08:58:22 <cyredanthem[m]> That's why GrapheneOS discourages all forms of gapps use
08:58:43 <cyredanthem[m]> Not that sideloading full gapps, but you get the point
08:59:18 <cyredanthem[m]> iPhone is much more private than zero Google GrapheneOS
08:59:40 <BallMonokuma[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Why add google services"> Some (mostly non-privacy respecting)apps depend on them
08:59:41 <cyredanthem[m]> Non GrapheneOS doesn't have the privacy measures for third party apps to be as good imo
08:59:52 <cyredanthem[m]> You really need GrapheneOS to beat iOS
09:00:32 <cyredanthem[m]> Android is built from the ground up so Google doesn't get hit with anti trust for making advertising competition void
09:00:57 <cyredanthem[m]> Good projects and outside pressure make GrpaheneOS really good
09:01:11 <BallMonokuma[m]> I wish that google didn't suck so much
09:01:22 <cn3m[m]> yes I agree
09:01:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> Hate the game not the player
09:01:47 <cn3m[m]> I worked with apple and Google a lot when I worked in ad tech
09:01:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> Google do good things too
09:02:20 <cn3m[m]> Google has their security and transparency down, but seriously?
09:02:34 <cn3m[m]> Google makes GrapheneOS possible
09:02:55 <BallMonokuma[m]> so, TL;DR, apple sucks, but stock google sucks with the force of me drinking a thickshake
09:03:41 <cn3m[m]> apple sucks far less than Google
09:03:43 <cn3m[m]> one study was 50x less while browser
09:03:46 <cn3m[m]> 10x in in apps I think
09:03:48 <BallMonokuma[m]>  * so, TL;DR, apple sucks, but stock android sucks with the force of me drinking a thickshake
09:03:55 <hypokeimenon[m]> <BallMonokuma[m] "so, TL;DR, apple sucks, but stoc"> Tl;DR if GrapheneOS ever stopped I'm ditching smartphones for good lol
09:04:07 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes I saw that study lines up with my MITMs of both
09:04:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Apple is orders of magnitude better for privacy
09:04:28 <cn3m[m]> that's not really a debate
09:04:53 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yeah the Study is by Prof. Schmidt, August 2018
09:05:17 <cn3m[m]> I used to think Apple was bad until I worked in adtech
09:05:34 <cyredanthem[m]> Apple got a lot better ever since Zdziarski in 2017 got hired
09:05:42 <BallMonokuma[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Tl;DR if GrapheneOS ever stopped"> God I need a pixel, but I got the ordered the pinephone as something  to tinker with recently, so I don't have the money

09:05:46 <cyredanthem[m]> Hiring an iOS hacker and privacy advocate was a good move

09:05:58 <BallMonokuma[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Apple is orders of magnitude bet"> Just shows how hard google sucks
09:06:12 <cn3m[m]> yes I agree there, but Apple is actively pretty good too
09:06:40 <cyredanthem[m]> Apple makes the only local smart watch you can opt into backing up(with e2ee)
09:06:48 <cyredanthem[m]> It makes privacy more accessible
09:29:00 <strcat[m]> an iPhone is the best option aside from GrapheneOS, by far
09:29:16 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is mostly better than iOS but there are some areas that it needs to catch up a fair bit
09:29:28 <cyredanthem[m]> Couldn't agree more
09:29:33 <strcat[m]> and that's ignoring that GrapheneOS still has to fill a ton of gaps in functionality from not having Play Services
09:29:53 <strcat[m]> and even then it won't have nearly as many apps available - although more apps will work than now, and a decent amount are available even now
09:31:01 <strcat[m]> and CalyxOS is the only other OS that is a serious alternative to using the stock OS on mobile devices
09:31:23 <strcat[m]> but it's a different kind of thing than GrapheneOS, different focus
09:31:31 <strcat[m]> largely shared goals though
09:32:08 <jalb> Hi!, what DNS do you recommend as Private DNS in GrapheneOS. I hate Cloudfare and looking for alternatives. Ahd in case you use a VPN, do you use Orbot as VPN with all the apps of the smartphone or only a few?. I see that using Private DNS and then using Orbot as VPN doesn't work very well when I finish. Thanks!
09:32:45 <cyredanthem[m]> CalyxOS is pretty cool. I know a lot of people don't like that it has a free VPN and microG but both could be useful

09:36:03 <jalb> I never used it
09:36:34 <cyredanthem[m]> It's based in Cypruss and technically is a bad product
09:36:43 <jalb> :-o
09:36:45 <cyredanthem[m]> They have a good privacy policy
09:36:52 <cyredanthem[m]> So probably not, but there's no absolutes
09:36:58 <jalb> Ah ok, I suppose you use it to avoid trackers
09:37:20 <jalb> I thought in nixnet.services or snopyta.org, but IDN
09:38:32 <jalb> And do you know why if you use the VPN mode in Orbot then it gives some problems to resolve some apps?, is it due to the Private DNS?
09:38:53 <cyredanthem[m]> I use a separate profile for that with no issues
09:38:59 <jalb> Ah good idea!
09:39:38 <jalb> Thanks  a lot cyredanthem[m]
09:39:56 <cyredanthem[m]> jalb: anytime
09:39:58 <jalb> I don't think Cloudfare has a good privacy policy...
09:40:07 <jalb> That's why I asked
09:40:23 <cyredanthem[m]> It's not horrible it's not amazing either
09:40:53 <cyredanthem[m]> I've used it for a project or two it's reliable
09:41:28 <jalb> I hate when I can't see many webpages in Tor because of Cloudfare
09:42:03 <jalb> And more and more webpages are using it
09:42:09 <cyredanthem[m]> Hcaptcha helps a little
09:42:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Unless you have no js
09:43:00 <cyredanthem[m]> I use a VPN
09:43:06 <cyredanthem[m]> Tor is overrated
09:44:02 <jalb> Yes, I always used Mullvad before and sometimes I also use it in GOS but it's like changing my trust from my ISP to Mullvad
09:44:33 <jalb> When you use the VPN, does it work well with the PRivate DNS enabled?
09:44:42 <jalb> Or you disable it?
09:45:07 <jalb> cyredanthem[m], yes... I don't use js
09:45:12 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes
09:45:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes
09:45:32 <cyredanthem[m]> I have adblock and vpn

09:45:44 <jalb> Both working and enabled?
09:46:05 <cyredanthem[m]> I use JS on Tor on GrapheneOS, but only in a dedicated profile and I wipe the app every time
09:46:08 <jalb> cyredanthem[m], I didn't know...
09:46:40 <jalb> But when I use, for example, the browser, I can't see it's leaking when I check in some websites like ipleak.net or browserleaks.com
09:46:49 <cyredanthem[m]> The screen size makes devices not as hard to identify and that works with css
09:47:07 <cyredanthem[m]> Tor Browser anti fingerprinting is overrated
09:47:12 <jalb> SO, how can the apps bypass the DNS?, or even dnsleaktest.com
09:47:28 <jalb> Interesting
09:47:48 <jalb> Thanks for your help
09:48:03 <cyredanthem[m]> Apps can set their own networking and bypass the dns
09:48:07 <cyredanthem[m]> They also see your real ip
09:48:17 <jalb> Ah ok
09:48:45 <jalb> So it's useless to use a VPN or Tor to hide our real ip
09:48:46 <cyredanthem[m]> Technically you can make a tracker in an app that can phone home even if you block it and it grabs your real ip
09:48:50 <jalb> Or?
09:49:04 <cyredanthem[m]> No
09:49:12 <cyredanthem[m]> It's just if the app is untrusted don't run it
09:49:27 <jalb> OK, thanks. I only use Bromite, VAnadium and Tor browser
09:49:55 <cyredanthem[m]> Yeah the more apps you use as a webapp the better

And claim to be secure bullet proof.i had a few days ago in my hand a specific phone like this and it had all google apps,playservices etc.i asked the seller if it would work on grapheneos amd it couldn work without playsyore.sure i said
09:59:26 <thelearner[m]> cyredanthem: Is there a version of magic wormhole but for phone? To send files phone to pc.
10:09:39 <thelearner[m]> Or would anyone know? Put out a mention what you use. Thanks.
10:14:11 <cyredanthem[m]> limitless0: I was talking about those earlier. They all sell basic features Google, GrapheneOS, and Apple have had for many years as the hot new thing
10:14:33 <cyredanthem[m]> They sell old devices as new or whatever it's a scam
10:16:06 <cyredanthem[m]> Standard Pixels and iPhones with a good case and their enterprise support replaces all of these for a fraction of the price
10:16:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Much better devices
10:17:48 <cyredanthem[m]> Google, Apple, and Graphene are the only people making secure phones. Hell even Samsung and Motorola make more secure phones than they dedicated companies. They are truly terrible
10:18:39 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "Google, Apple, and Graphene are "> Didn't Android devs complain about Samsung breaking Android's security?
10:18:46 <cyredanthem[m]> EssentialChaos: yes
10:18:52 <cyredanthem[m]> I know that's why I said that
10:29:05 <limitless0[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "limitless0: I was talking about "> I think they sell the service and server more than they sell the devices from what i understand from it anyway
10:29:31 <cyredanthem[m]> Get a Pixel or iPhone and load signal
10:29:35 <cyredanthem[m]> Done with $400
10:30:15 <limitless0[m]> I mean even jolla sailfishos claims to be secure os on xperia devices
10:30:53 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes, just get a sane device and run Signal
10:30:55 <cyredanthem[m]> It's easy
10:31:05 <joeri_poeri[m]1> signal is awesome.
10:31:16 <joeri_poeri[m]1> they're moving away from requiring phone numbers soon as well
10:31:50 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes
10:31:51 <joeri_poeri[m]1> it's pretty good because you can get a large chunk of your regular contacts to migrate to it from either WhatsApp or iMessage. it differs in countries which is more common
10:32:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Those two don't even belong in the same sentence
10:32:36 <cyredanthem[m]> iMessage is much better than WhatsApp, but yeah worth getting off both
10:32:51 <limitless0[m]> Signal over orbot with no calls seems safe
10:33:31 <joeri_poeri[m]1> <cyredanthem[m] "iMessage is much better than Wha"> why do you think that iMessage is that much better. surely the e2ee is implemented better but if there's no way to check it you can consider it useless imo
10:33:54 <joeri_poeri[m]1> it has the nice apple polish though. I'll give you that
10:34:29 <cyredanthem[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Yes"> I don't trust Facebook on iota
10:35:24 <joeri_poeri[m]1> that's a good point. even with the checks for the e2ee theres no real way of verifying whether the messages actually get sent with the keys you control.
10:36:05 <cyredanthem[m]> Trusting a company often matters more than their tech
10:36:58 <cyredanthem[m]> For example I rather use unencrypted messages on Google than encrypted messages on Facebook
10:37:02 <cyredanthem[m]> I hate Facebook
10:37:41 <limitless0[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "For example I rather use unencry"> Its like jumping off the bridge or shooting youself
10:37:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> It depends on the implementation, audits, metadata, transparency etc
10:38:39 <cyredanthem[m]> <limitless0[m] "Its like jumping off the bridge "> Apple however doing e2ee and the Justice Department trying to sue them to access iMessage is something
10:39:03 <cyredanthem[m]> Signal is 20x better, but still
10:39:05 <limitless0[m]> I read somewhere long ago about a nsa guy who famously said " we kill people based on metadata"
10:39:15 <cyredanthem[m]> iMessage walks all over everything else
10:39:33 <limitless0[m]> So e2e it matters ish
10:40:02 <hypokeimenon[m]> <limitless0[m] "So e2e it matters ish"> Yes metadata protection is still important
10:40:04 <cyredanthem[m]> Yeah
10:40:11 <joeri_poeri[m]1> <cyredanthem[m] "iMessage walks all over everythi"> why do you have this inherent trust in apple? apple still supplies proprietary software. you can't really trust them any more than you can trust telegram with their magically safe encrypted messages they won't tell you anything about
10:40:18 <joeri_poeri[m]1> the features are great though

10:42:04 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm not worried about closed source software
10:42:12 <cyredanthem[m]> Open source software has had 174 real world supply chain attacks injecting malicious code into the libraries that get spread around

10:46:27 <cn3m[m]> the only reason not to are games and fitness/outdoorsy apps
10:47:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> Well, the most important factor is a decent number of trusted well-managed competent individuals working on the code to make it secure and a high number of competent individuals to find bugs in the code
10:47:11 <cn3m[m]> fun fact Samsung also has a toggle for sensors
10:47:45 <thelearner[m]> cn3m: thanks for the clarification.

10:58:22 <cn3m[m]> that community is so rough, but yeah I love them
11:15:45 <thelearner[m]> Is there a version of magic wormhole but for phone? To send files from phone to pc.
11:19:15 <cn3m[m]> <thelearner[m] "Is there a version of magic worm"> KDE connect?
11:29:39 <toaskoas[m]> have the system camera no gps? in the infos it shows no gps coordinates
11:49:56 <strcat[m]> toaskoas: you have to enable it
11:49:58 <strcat[m]> and get a GPS lock
11:51:57 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: having a bunch of people working on security doesn't mean something becomes more secure, that only works in combination with a culture / approach that produces secure software
11:52:33 <strcat[m]> you can't fix things just by throwing resources / developers at the problem especially when the main problem is the culture, architecture, etc.
11:52:50 <strcat[m]> and fixing individual bugs case by case is one of the least important things for security people to be working on
11:53:37 <strcat[m]> that's not really a security engineering task in the first place, most of the time, unless there's something complex involved in resolving the bug
11:54:39 <strcat[m]> the most important thing is having a culture of designing things for security from the start and incorporating that into everything
11:55:02 <strcat[m]> every developer has to work on it - it is not divided into regular development work and security work in that sense
11:55:50 <strcat[m]> trying to make something secure by hiring security researchers/engineers to work on it separately is a joke of an approach
11:56:45 <strcat[m]> and that's why the Linux kernel and traditional Linux ecosystem is never going to have decent security, the vast majority of the developers and companies involved don't care about security whatsoever
11:57:38 <strcat[m]> you won't make them care either
11:58:05 <strcat[m]> built from day 1 by anti-security people explicitly rejecting using secure architecture, secure tools, etc.
12:01:36 <strcat[m]> and it's still going to be horribly insecure after tons of effort invested into hardening
12:01:49 <strcat[m]> especially since they keep making it worse and worse
12:02:06 <strcat[m]> there will always be job security for people working on Linux security because it just gets worse
12:05:34 <stuux[m]> strcat
12:05:34 <stuux[m]> With regard to Issue #56 of Auditor, should the FEATURE (e.g FEATURE_FACE) still be checked with the package manager and the  hasSystemFeature() method?
12:19:07 <mrxx_0[m]> Hey, I know the LTO vmlinux.o is quite long to compile when building the kernel, so if my computer is still on it after few hours it's normal ?
12:19:42 <mrxx_0[m]> (Old Mac mini on Ubuntu, i5 quad core and 16gb ram, HDD 500gb)
12:21:45 <mrxx_0[m]> Btw I am impressed by the time, computer power and process the building need, for something that will fit in our pocket haha
12:23:08 <toaskoas[m]> <strcat[m] "toaskoas: you have to enable it"> Location access is activated. Still no coordinates are stored
12:23:23 <strcat[m]> toaskoas: and do you have a GPS lock
12:23:28 <strcat[m]> use an app to check if you do
12:23:47 <strcat[m]> bear in mind that GrapheneOS does not have a coarse location service only GPS
12:24:22 <strcat[m]> if you're not outside and running an app continuously monitoring location while you have it open don't expect GPS to work
12:24:23 <strcat[m]> it takes time to get a GPS lock
12:24:37 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "that whole wiki is awful and ful"> I'm a Kicksecure dev. If you'd be more specific then I can change that but I'm not sure what you're referring to. I don't mean to push security theater/misinformation/attacks. I've written very little of the wiki but I can fix parts.
12:26:01 <toaskoas[m]> <strcat[m] "toaskoas: and do you have a GPS "> I have no GPS lock. I have it on "Open Camera". But no GPS lock on the System Camera
12:26:15 <madaidan[m]> I just want to make something good. I don't mean to make security theater.
12:26:20 <strcat[m]> toaskoas: not entirely sure what you mean
12:26:32 <strcat[m]> toaskoas: have you enabled location and granted the location permission to the app
12:26:43 <strcat[m]> it's not good at requesting the permission as needed, it's a legacy app with that bolted onto it
12:27:02 <strcat[m]> there is a setting in the camera settings for that
12:27:06 <strcat[m]> and you need to grant the permission
12:27:31 <strcat[m]> and you need to have a GPS lock or there won't be a location to use
12:28:05 <toaskoas[m]> <strcat[m] "toaskoas: have you enabled locat"> I gave the authorization. Location access was set to always
12:28:26 <strcat[m]> did you enable the setting in the camera app settings?
12:29:15 <strcat[m]> Settings -> Save location
12:29:17 <strcat[m]> it doesn't do it by default
12:29:48 <strcat[m]> it shouldn't really be asking for the location permission on launch, it doesn't use it, but as I said it's a legacy app with that bolted onto it
12:30:00 <strcat[m]> it only uses it if you enable Save location
12:30:13 <strcat[m]> so it should really only ask when you toggle that on
12:30:21 <toaskoas[m]> yes, its enabled. when i start "open camera" i have a location icon in the statusbar. in the system camera it shows no location icon
12:32:31 <strcat[m]> working fine here
12:33:27 <toaskoas[m]> hm, i have a Pixel 2XL
12:34:03 <strcat[m]> it works on a Pixel 2
12:34:36 <strcat[m]> look in the Settings app in Settings -> Location
12:34:47 <strcat[m]> should show it's allowed to access it and should show recent request to use it
12:35:15 <strcat[m]> when I have Save location enabled + location permission enabled and open up the Camera app it is accessing location while open
12:35:19 <strcat[m]> shows in the statusbar and settings
12:35:58 <toaskoas[m]> Ah ok. in the last location requests the camera app is unfortunately not displayed
12:36:58 <strcat[m]> does it show it's allowed there
12:38:21 <toaskoas[m]> But under Location > Always allow access, the app is listed
12:40:21 <strcat[m]> and inside the camera app, Save location toggle is on?
12:40:50 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't really expect it to work well if at all without a coarse location service but it definitely does request location while running here with that on
12:40:58 <strcat[m]> not sure what's wrong for you, seems likely that setting isn't on
12:43:07 <cdesai> you can try using an app like "GPS Test" to see if your device has a lock / time how long it takes
12:46:39 <madaidan[m]> Are you going to respond to the above?
12:48:06 <toaskoas[m]> <strcat[m] "and inside the camera app, Save "> i have no setting to save location in the app. Location access is only requested at startup
12:48:23 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: yes
12:48:31 <strcat[m]> toaskoas: well the issue is you haven't enabled the feature in the app
12:48:37 <strcat[m]> toaskoas: it doesn't do it by default
12:48:45 <strcat[m]> go into the Camera app settings and turn on "Save location"
12:49:03 <strcat[m]> no promises that it will actually work without a coarse location service but it will at least try

13:15:13 <derpy> Would be super useful to have a list of privacy & security (and other) features on the GrapheneOS website - in a table that compares to LineageOS
13:15:53 <derpy> Seems privacy is a big overlap between Lineage & Graphene - while security is more solid on Graphene.
13:17:22 <strcat[m]> derpy: there is not much to compare

13:17:55 <derpy> BallMonokuma[m] I agree
13:17:57 <strcat[m]> not sure where you get the idea that they do any meaningful work on privacy (or security)
13:18:28 <derpy> I get it from the fact that Lineage is an option for de-Googling your Android... Perhaps the top choice to do so.
13:18:53 <strcat[m]> you seem confused and that kind of table is only going to make you more confused
13:19:35 <derpy> What seems confused about my thinking?
13:19:52 <strcat[m]> not the kind of documentation that we make
13:20:03 <BallMonokuma[m]> > less private and secure
13:20:03 <BallMonokuma[m]> Less secure is true on all fronts, afaik. But it removes Gapps, making it more private.

13:20:24 <strcat[m]> derpy: AOSP does not need to be 'degoogled' whatever that means
13:20:25 <strcat[m]> Ball Monokuma: no it does not remove it
13:21:02 <strcat[m]> AOSP does not have Play Services - where do you get that idea?
13:21:13 <zaxxa[m]> "Front I/O ports on desktop computer cases and USB 3.1 or USB C on many laptops often aren't implemented properly or are broken in subtle ways, which may cause flashing to fail even on a USB port that works for other peripherals"
13:21:13 <zaxxa[m]> Is there any way to know for certain whether your laptop ports are implemented correctly?
13:22:01 <madaidan[m]> Lineage's goals are fancy modifications, not privacy/security.
13:22:01 <strcat[m]> use a laptop from a company known to produce quality hardware respecting those standards
13:22:04 <derpy> Funny how googling AOSP vs lineageos (and similar) gives top results quoting you strcat[m] !
13:22:29 <strcat[m]> AOSP does not have Google apps and services... it doesn't contain Google Play Services
13:22:42 <strcat[m]> so it cannot be true that stuff like LineageOS is removing it, doesn't make any sense, it is not part of what they do in any way
13:23:08 <stuux[m]> strcat Any way to test the Auditor with the changes made for the migration to BiometricManager in the emulator?
13:23:09 <strcat[m]> in fact those projects often work on supporting adding in Google apps / services in a hacky / broken way
13:23:17 <strcat[m]> so what's being claimed is the opposite of reality
13:23:22 <BallMonokuma[m]> <strcat[m] "so it cannot be true that stuff "> Just did some research, you are right
13:23:26 <derpy> Right, I was thinking Lineage vs stock Pixel OS... I had not thought about AOSP.
13:23:26 <madaidan[m]> The only thing Lineage removes is the security model
13:23:39 <strcat[m]> derpy: LineageOS is a fork of AOSP
13:23:49 <strcat[m]> it doesn't improve privacy or security, it reduces both
13:24:16 <derpy> Why don't we hear more about people flashing their Androids phones with AOSP?
13:24:27 <derpy> Not end-user friendly?
13:24:29 <strcat[m]> the stock OS is a build of AOSP from the AOSP source tree (unmodified) with Google apps and services added in via extra repositories
13:24:31 <strcat[m]> the stock OS on Pixels specifically
13:24:40 <renlord> i find that one huge flaw of desktop gnu/linux is that once you run things on top of xorg you are more or less naked with your front door open
13:25:00 <strcat[m]> derpy: nothing not user friendly about it - it's the same UX as GrapheneOS other than some very minor things
13:25:04 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "i find that one huge flaw of des"> You're naked regardless of Xorg
13:25:30 <strcat[m]> derpy: someone can take AOSP, build it with our instructions and helper scripts and bundle our update client with it and that's a far better OS than LineageOS
13:25:45 <strcat[m]> derpy: AOSP itself doesn't have binary releases, just signed source releases
13:25:54 <renlord> without xorg, i can still do namespace isolation, control capabilities and filter syscalls
13:25:56 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't have an official update client - they do have a sample update client though
13:26:00 <derpy> LineageOS gets talked about a lot for some reason... I thought it was the vast hardware support claimed.
13:26:07 <strcat[m]> they didn't have that sample update client when I wrote our update app
13:26:09 <renlord> but with xorg if things need to get rendered on my monitor, its very challenging
13:26:36 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "without xorg, i can still do nam"> Sure but most people don't use that properly.
13:26:46 <renlord> exactly
13:26:47 <BallMonokuma[m]> <derpy "Why don't we hear more about peo"> Because AOSP doesn't have the Le cool and fancy and useless features that other roms have
13:26:52 <strcat[m]> derpy: since Android 8, Android has had a stable API/ABI hardware abstraction and AOSP is compatible with all Android devices as long as you provide the kernel + vendor files and so on
13:27:06 <renlord> and using X just makes it even worse
13:27:22 <strcat[m]> derpy: CyanogenMod used to hack together partly working support for everything - that's no longer a thing anymore, really, at least for modern devices
13:27:33 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "and using X just makes it even w"> Definitely
13:27:36 <derpy> strcat[m] why don't any of the devs who complain about GrapheneOS HW support fork your project to work on their hardware of choice?
13:27:39 <madaidan[m]> X is a mess
13:27:46 <renlord> X is a fkin nightmare
13:27:53 <strcat[m]> derpy: I am not aware of any devs complaining about GrapheneOS hardware support
13:27:54 <renlord> i get anxious using it all the time
13:28:09 <strcat[m]> I am aware of random users who don't understand the project complaining about it...
13:28:15 <madaidan[m]> <derpy "strcat why don't any of the devs"> Because they prefer complaining over actual work
13:28:55 <strcat[m]> I mean it seems wrong to say there are developers complaining about that, I think people who read and understand what I've written about this agree with the hardware choices and at most would be interested in supporting the Pixel 4 / 4 XL
13:28:55 <derpy> strcat[m] I mean end users who are devs... People who want AOSP + more security, but some other HW (like OnePlus).
13:29:17 <strcat[m]> derpy: it can't provide that security on a OnePlus device
13:29:27 <strcat[m]> security of hardware/firmware matters and the OS isn't a substitute for that
13:29:42 <madaidan[m]> OnePlus doesn't even have proper verified boot.
13:30:05 <strcat[m]> don't even start thinking about what's wrong with the IOMMU setup, etc.;
13:30:09 <strcat[m]>  * don't even start thinking about what's wrong with the IOMMU setup, etc.
13:30:09 <renlord> what about the nokia android one phones?
13:30:12 <derpy> at all? or partially? grapheneos has security features besides verified boot, right - so you mean they're not worthwhile without it?
13:30:24 <renlord> or any of the other android one phones
13:31:27 <strcat[m]> derpy: the firmware / hardware security involves a lot more than whether it provides verified boot and the quality of the verified boot implementation
13:31:31 <strcat[m]> derpy: I recommend reading through https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support which doesn't go into much depth but does cover these things in an overview
13:31:34 <strcat[m]> the FAQ and other documentation can be expanded over time but it's no good if no one reads it
13:31:35 <madaidan[m]> <derpy "at all? or partially? grapheneos"> OnePlus has a thing they call "verified boot" but it doesn't actually verify boot.
13:32:25 <derpy> I've read the doc... It does generally make sense.
13:32:33 <strcat[m]> derpy: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices specifically read this section or my more elaborate posts about it elsewhere that slowly need to be translated to the FAQ
13:32:53 <strcat[m]> > In addition to support for installing other operating systems, standard hardware-based security features like the hardware-backed keystores, verified boot, attestation and various hardware-based exploit mitigations need to be available. Devices also need to have decent integration of IOMMUs for isolating components such as the GPU, radios (NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular), media decode / encode, image processor, etc.,
13:32:53 <strcat[m]> because if the hardware / firmware support is missing or broken, there's not much that the OS can do to provide an alternative. Devices with support for alternative operating systems as an afterthought will not be considered. Devices need to have proper ongoing support for their firmware and software specific to the hardware like drivers in order to provide proper full security updates too. Devices that are end-of-life
13:32:53 <strcat[m]> and no longer receiving these updates will not be supported.
13:33:34 <strcat[m]> derpy: we can't support a device with broken implementations of basic security features, lack of proper security updates, and lack of proper support for alternative OSes where important security features are broken
13:33:45 <strcat[m]> renlord: there may be Android One devices that are relatively sane but they haven't historically been interesting
13:34:09 <strcat[m]> renlord: they used to have 2 year support instead of 3 which is way worse especially since it can take almost a year to get things going
13:34:10 <strcat[m]> dunno what the situation is now with that
13:34:19 <derpy> What do you think of the security claims about smartphones with modems that have DMA?
13:34:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: also the latest ones are probably worse off than the Pixel 2
13:34:36 <renlord> wtf, dma
13:34:38 <derpy> I was reading only a few open source hardware phones have removed this "security issue"
13:34:42 <strcat[m]> derpy: many components have DMA, that's why there are IOMMUs
13:35:03 <strcat[m]> derpy: those phones are not open source hardware
13:35:13 <strcat[m]> derpy: and they have not solved this "security issue", they have made things worse
13:35:20 <derpy> purism? ya... idk
13:35:22 <renlord> lol
13:35:28 <strcat[m]> derpy: the people behind those projects are incredibly dishonest and have made lots of false claims and spread tons of misinformation
13:35:40 <strcat[m]> derpy: their modem is less secure, their modem isolation is worse - facts
13:35:41 <derpy> I don't like the way purism people talk
13:35:47 <strcat[m]> their modem does not have modern mitigations or isolation on it
13:35:51 <strcat[m]> it is worse
13:35:54 <strcat[m]> factually, objectively
13:36:02 <strcat[m]> they've prevented doing full security updates
13:36:12 <derpy> Wait, Pixel2 is your fav with graphene support?
13:36:13 <strcat[m]> they've chosen an SoC and other components with far worse security / privacy
13:36:20 <strcat[m]> derpy: no that is not what I said...
13:36:24 <derpy> true it isn't
13:36:35 <strcat[m]> nothing I said could reasonably be interpreted that way
13:36:38 <derpy> just trying to get more of your impression of the pixels
13:36:53 <strcat[m]> derpy: Purism does not make open hardware
13:36:56 <strcat[m]> and their devices do not have open firmware either
13:37:08 <derpy> "also the latest ones are probably worse off than the Pixel 2..."
13:37:17 <renlord> even the shittiest arch manual i've read has instructions on iommu these days
13:37:21 <strcat[m]> derpy: I was talking about Android One devices
13:37:22 <strcat[m]> context matters
13:37:30 <renlord> why do people still do DMA?
13:37:47 <renlord> this is like armv7 days
13:37:56 <renlord> on a shitass beagleboard
13:38:06 <strcat[m]> renlord: there is still DMA, IOMMUs restrict it to pages the component is granted access to
13:38:15 <strcat[m]> yeah it's used on even low end devices
13:38:16 <strcat[m]> lots of them don't have it set up reasonably tho
13:38:20 <strcat[m]> they take lazy shortcuts
13:38:32 <derpy> cool, pixel 3XL seems to be choice graphene HW
13:38:38 <strcat[m]> guess which companies use components / drivers / platforms taking shortcuts in this area lol
13:38:41 <strcat[m]> anyway
13:38:45 <madaidan[m]> Purism is such bullshit
13:38:54 <strcat[m]> derpy: Pixel 3 / 3a are basically comparable in security
13:39:10 <renlord> strcat[m]: how do you know if the iommu is not done correctly?
13:39:19 <strcat[m]> the 3a came out later so it has longer guaranteed support but that doesn't mean it will actually be supported any longer
13:39:21 <renlord> besides taking the vendor's word for it
13:39:27 <strcat[m]> renlord: you can usually see from drivers and printing out the debug output
13:39:36 <zaxxa[m]> Probably all the companies use shortcuts
13:39:38 <strcat[m]> renlord: you can see if it's obviously wrong
13:39:54 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's ofc harder to verify something is correct but it's easy to see when things are totally fucked
13:40:12 <derpy> well I'm happy with grapheneOS... way less dodgy than copperheadOS's model of ordering HW with it preinstalled
13:40:26 <strcat[m]> CopperheadOS is a scam ripped off from my code
13:40:29 <madaidan[m]> CopperheadOS is a scam
13:40:30 <strcat[m]> from a known scam artist
13:40:30 <derpy> for geeks being able to install yourself feels critical
13:40:51 <derpy> haha felt like a scam which is why I never shelled out
13:40:55 <strcat[m]> derpy: CopperheadOS == a stolen version of my legacy code, with DRM / tracking added, poorly ported to current Android by clueless / cheap devs without privacy/security experience
13:41:05 <derpy> oh damn
13:41:05 <strcat[m]> derpy: it is 100% a scam
13:41:10 <derpy> I hadn't heard the extent of it
13:41:16 <toaskoas[m]> <strcat[m] "go into the Camera app settings "> I have no Settings to turn on "save location"
13:41:24 <strcat[m]> derpy: https://grapheneos.org/#history
13:41:35 <strcat[m]> derpy: they are doing everything they can to destroy GrapheneOS and my life
13:41:39 <strcat[m]> and when I say they, it's one specific person
13:41:42 <derpy> any reason you don't document this on https://grapheneos.org/ ?
13:41:50 <derpy> oh ok
13:41:51 <derpy> cool
13:41:51 <strcat[m]> derpy: I do look at history
13:41:59 <strcat[m]> and licensing sections
13:42:05 <strcat[m]> I just don't name them because they don't deserve free advertising on our site
13:42:12 <derpy> ya the added tracking is serious
13:42:17 <derpy> when the whole company image is about removing it
13:42:21 * toaskoas[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200522-144149.png (44KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/vPnScCJLhzRWBwWsbFnpBWvu >
13:42:23 <strcat[m]> if I elaborated on the extent of their malicious behavior, etc. then maybe it would be worth naming them
13:42:27 <derpy> name them!
13:42:29 <derpy> jk :)
13:43:03 <strcat[m]> toaskoas: if this is about the location thing drag to open the sidebar showing video toggle and settings
13:43:06 <strcat[m]> and go into setting to turn on save location
13:43:15 <derpy> well I'm glad you transcended the copperheadOS you were involved with
13:43:25 <derpy> late to the party, but still very good news
13:43:31 <strcat[m]> derpy: GrapheneOS is the original project formerly called CopperheadOS
13:43:39 <strcat[m]> I still own half of the Copperhead company
13:43:42 <strcat[m]> 50% of the voting shares
13:43:46 <derpy> ah
13:43:48 <strcat[m]> and believe me it's a scam
13:44:06 <strcat[m]> run by a narcissist sociopath who hijacked the company and who is totally willing to sell out users for money
13:44:12 <derpy> yes I believe you... I used to work in "the valley" - hard to find things that aren't scams to one degree or another
13:44:27 <strcat[m]> derpy: he never had access to the signing keys or anything so people were never at risk of compromise by him
13:44:30 <derpy> and hard to find "startups" without sociopath "leaders"
13:44:34 <strcat[m]> until he pushed me out and people got duped into using software he controls
13:44:49 <strcat[m]> but at this point if people fall for it
13:45:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "but at this point if people fall"> They do
13:45:03 <strcat[m]> they are causing the problem by giving him funding to cause harm
13:45:15 <derpy> sure, security is about user responsibility first, as I understand it.
13:45:36 <j3ghprjfo[m]> strcat are you Daniel?
13:45:38 <strcat[m]> every nickel people give him is more harm to GrapheneOS, myself, other developers and other projects
13:45:40 <strcat[m]> actual privacy and security projects
13:45:46 <zaxxa[m]> How did you come up with the name "grapheneos"
13:46:25 <strcat[m]> it was proposed by various people as a name over time, starting a long time ago
13:46:34 <strcat[m]> it fits well
13:46:53 <zaxxa[m]> Nice, yes I agree its a very nice name
13:48:30 <almistdorent[m]> Hi guys. I have just started to take a look at the project. According to the build documentation, It says one of the supported OS is Ubuntu 20.04. I have a machine that I use for development, but it has Windows 10. Is it enough to build the codes by creating an Ubuntu virtual machine running in Windows?
13:49:21 <strcat[m]> almist.dorent: a VM will work but make sure to give it enough storage/memory
13:49:33 <strcat[m]> it's a build of an entire OS
13:49:40 <strcat[m]> although once you get an initial build incremental builds mean it's very fast to iterate on dev
13:49:46 <strcat[m]> depends on what you're doing tho
13:49:54 <strcat[m]> if you change some libc header it's going to take a long time to recompile
13:51:33 <derpy> strcat[m] if folks offered to help code / security review, then where would you direct them as starting places?
13:51:57 <strcat[m]> depends what kind of stuff they want to work on
13:52:00 <strcat[m]> it's a very broad project
13:52:01 <almistdorent[m]> Will try with 8-10 Gb RAM, and the disk I read it needs at least 80 Gb, so I will assign around 200. Thanks for the tip!
13:52:07 <strcat[m]> lots of help is needed in many different areas
13:52:15 <strcat[m]> almist.dorent: 8-10GB isn't enough
13:52:22 <strcat[m]> linking the linux kernel with LTO uses more
13:52:34 <j3ghprjfo[m]> As someone who wants to learn android and build on my own. Would GrapheneOS make a better base than aosp for experimenting and trying to implement UI tweaks. I eventually want to make my own daily driver, and would like something secure, but I'm afraid the restrictions within grapheneOS may work against me. Any thoughts?
13:52:39 <strcat[m]> it suggests 16GB and that's basically bare minimum to be productive
13:52:49 <strcat[m]> you should really have more
13:52:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "it suggests 16GB and that's basi"> 33-35 for lto here
13:53:07 <derpy> j3ghprjfo[m] pick grapheneOS) why not improve upon the best?
13:53:12 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't think it uses quite that much? unsure
13:53:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: I don't think it "> It does here
13:53:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> It takes ~5 minutes to link with that
13:53:40 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: how are you measuring
13:53:49 <strcat[m]> yeah it takes a long time but I don't think it uses quite that much memory
13:53:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: how are you measu"> Htop + check usage from ld.lld
13:54:04 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: are you looking at RES?
13:54:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
13:54:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also I have only 28gb
13:54:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> The other 5 overflow to swap
13:54:35 <almistdorent[m]> Oh, Christ. My machine has 16. Then I guess I should install Ubuntu instead of running it on a VM
13:54:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <almistdorent[m] "Oh, Christ. My machine has 16. T"> Arch linux good
13:55:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can do a base install of arch, no x server or DE and just install the android build deps
13:55:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> As for disk usage
13:55:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> While android needs 200gb recommended
13:55:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let me see
13:56:05 <strcat[m]> arch may not be the best choice for someone starting especially since you need 2 AUR packages (1 for android-prepare-vendor, and the ncurses compat libs cause of renderscript clang using those due to being old)
13:56:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can manage in about 40gb
13:56:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> My own disk is just 80gb on my build machine
13:56:41 <j3ghprjfo[m]> <derpy "j3ghprjfo pick grapheneOS) why n"> Ultimately that's what I would prefer. I guess I won't know until it get into it
13:56:56 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies
13:57:03 <strcat[m]> the numbers I put there for storage use are recent
13:57:16 <strcat[m]> 89GiB+ storage for a standard sync with history, 61GiB+ storage for a lightweight sync
13:57:18 <strcat[m]> 100GiB+ of additional free storage space for a typical build of the entire OS for a multiarch device
13:57:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "arch may not be the best choice "> Just install yay and yay -Syuu aosp-devel lineageos-devel lib32-gcc-libs
13:57:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's it
13:57:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> You also need any one TTF font
13:57:46 <strcat[m]> if you're using an AUR helper you had to install that 1st
13:57:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "89GiB+ storage for a standard sy"> Can do it in 40
13:58:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> The answer is btrfs with zstd:6
13:58:19 <strcat[m]> that will slow things down though
13:58:44 <derpy> j3ghprjfo[m] I wish someone would improve this on Android: https://danluu.com/input-lag/
13:58:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "that will slow things down thoug"> According to my tests not by a lot
13:59:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> The sync will be painfully slow
13:59:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> But the build is hardly affected
13:59:20 <strcat[m]> derpy: that's not up-to-date
13:59:39 <derpy> strcat[m] the list of benchmarks? what's the best / most accurate you've found?
14:00:24 <strcat[m]> that's 3 years old
14:00:34 <derpy> presumably not up-to-date considering that Apple II and such old HW is listed... Just to illustrate latency increases in modern devices.
14:01:04 <derpy> Ya it illustrates an increasing trend in interface latency over decades.
14:01:51 <strcat[m]> not really
14:02:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> <derpy "presumably not up-to-date consid"> Well you can use Google's UIbench
14:02:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also less latency is not always good
14:02:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> To achieve less latency
14:03:02 <derpy> I do think they're getting better again... Considering 120+hz is becoming a norm.
14:03:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> You are sacrificing some throughput
14:04:01 <strcat[m]> also read how he measured
14:04:02 <strcat[m]> > Mobile results were done by using the default browser, browsing to https://danluu.com, and measuring the latency from finger movement until the screen first updates to indicate that scrolling has occurred.
14:04:16 <strcat[m]> not the same browser
14:04:34 <derpy> ya I don't think his measurement apparatus is great, but almost no one tries to measure real world latency (in benchmarks).
14:04:43 <strcat[m]> seems more like a browser latency measurement
14:05:05 <strcat[m]> also
14:05:18 <strcat[m]> notice how he's measuring SCROLLING latency
14:05:19 <strcat[m]> that is not necessarily input latency at all
14:05:23 <strcat[m]> it may wait before it scrolls
14:05:26 <strcat[m]> Chromium does smooth scrolling stuff
14:05:28 <derpy> The next pixel will be 120hz I think
14:05:37 <strcat[m]> it's a bad benchmark
14:05:38 <derpy> true
14:05:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> <derpy "ya I don't think his measurement"> I don't think this is the place for latency
14:06:03 <strcat[m]> shouldn't measure latency with a browser
14:06:05 <strcat[m]> or with a gesture
14:06:16 <strcat[m]> especially with different approaches to gestures
14:06:37 <strcat[m]> I know for a fact that it waits a certain amount of time
14:06:40 <strcat[m]> it has to measure the acceleration, etc. that's how gestures work
14:06:46 <strcat[m]> they are not just a single point in time
14:06:50 <derpy> Ya no need to use one of the most heavyweight softwares on the device to benchmark latency
14:06:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> sys.use.fifo_ui :^
14:07:02 <strcat[m]> well also why are they using a scrolling gesture
14:07:10 <strcat[m]> different browser engine + different kind of gestures in each
14:07:18 <derpy> ok makes sense
14:07:20 <strcat[m]> scrolling in browsers is complicated

14:17:31 <mrxx_0[m]> If I change my distro anupritaisno1 will it fix the OOM kill ?
14:18:49 <strcat[m]> no
14:18:58 <strcat[m]> it may save a bit of memory but I doubt it'd be enough to change anything
14:19:04 <strcat[m]> use a machine with drastically more memory... or use a bunch of swap and cope with it taking a long time
14:19:11 <strcat[m]> building the linux kernel with LTO takes a lot of memory

14:37:32 <madaidan[m]> Why were grsecurity's RAND{NET,ISN,ID,SRC,RPC} removed?
14:40:42 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: there's really no reason to make the entropy pool larger or add assorted new ways of generating random data
14:41:26 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: there's really no rea"> Isn't that just the RANDNET feature? What about the others?
14:41:41 <strcat[m]> never heard of the others
14:42:05 <strcat[m]> probably because linux started doing that itself?
14:43:11 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: maybe removed out of spite towards OpenBSD? lol, looking at it atm
14:43:15 <strcat[m]> I didn't recall these options
14:43:32 <strcat[m]> let me see when they got removed
14:44:00 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "probably because linux started d"> No, I don't think so.
14:44:28 <madaidan[m]> You can find them in some really old patches.
14:44:45 <madaidan[m]> Grsec patches I mean
14:44:47 <strcat[m]> https://grsecurity.net/pipermail/grsecurity/2005-February/000265.html
14:45:11 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: linux added these things itself afaik
14:46:02 <madaidan[m]> Ah, thanks.
14:46:50 <strcat[m]> does any of it not have an equivalent in linux today?
14:47:14 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "does any of it not have an equiv"> RANDISN definitely isn't (hence tirdad)
14:47:34 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they only randomized the initial sequence number

14:48:39 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "isn't that done by linux today?"> https://bitguard.wordpress.com/?p=982
14:49:54 <strcat[m]> TCP is such garbage
14:50:01 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: linux added these thi"> That'd be funny considering grsec retains tons of things mainline already has now like GRKERNSEC_DMESG
14:50:29 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I would not be surprised if it got removed because of spite towards OpenBSD honestly
14:50:44 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: yes well also they keep a ton of ASLR stuff that is redundant and some is actually worse
14:50:52 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: instead of just fixing minor problems they have their whole own ASLR implementation
14:50:55 <strcat[m]> out of spite
14:51:19 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: yes well also they ke"> Yeah, I saw that
14:51:20 <strcat[m]> I haven't seen the most recent patches (have seen some newer than the public ones)
14:51:32 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "I haven't seen the most recent p"> How?
14:51:32 <strcat[m]> but in the last public ones they still used a weird non-CSPRNG too iirc
14:51:34 <strcat[m]> just cause tradition
14:51:56 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I have access to them if I want them through people who have them - I don't really care though
14:52:06 <strcat[m]> someone gave me it at some point and I glanced at it and lost interest
14:52:41 <madaidan[m]> I'm jealous
14:52:42 <strcat[m]> I don't want to do stuff with out-of-tree GCC plugins so...
14:52:54 <madaidan[m]> Makes me sad hearing whispers of their new features like KERNSEAL or STRUCTGUARD but not having a clue what they are
14:53:13 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: well it's not helpful to have stuff using complicated hacked together gcc plugins imo
14:53:20 <strcat[m]> cause no one else can maintain them and it's really sketchy
14:53:43 <strcat[m]> so all that's useful are the concepts / ideas and no one cares enough to reimplement it
14:53:46 <strcat[m]> like RAP is a really good way of doing CFI
14:53:57 <strcat[m]> it requires changing the ABI but that's fine in the kernel
14:54:13 <strcat[m]> it's really fast and supports backwards edge CFI which Clang still doesn't for the Clang CFI
14:54:42 <strcat[m]> the only downsides are it changes the ABI and is incompatible with execute only code
14:54:43 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "it's really fast and supports ba"> Isn't that the purpose of SafeStack/ShadowCallStack?
14:54:44 <strcat[m]> so if you care about execute-only code it's a dead end
14:55:04 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: SafeStack doesn't really work and is kinda backwards
14:55:18 <strcat[m]> it's a good concept, the implementation is really bad tho
14:55:52 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: ShadowCallStack is arm64-only cause the approach is insecure on x86 since it doesn't have a link register
14:56:03 <strcat[m]> so they dropped x86 support
14:56:18 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: also these aren't CFI for backwards edge
14:56:23 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "it's a good concept, the impleme"> As is most things
14:56:24 <strcat[m]> they are a different thing really
14:56:33 <strcat[m]> I guess you could consider it CFI? but it isn't what you'd typically consider CFI
14:56:37 <strcat[m]> it's a different thing
14:56:47 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "they are a different thing reall"> Doesn't it achieve the same thing though?
14:56:54 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: so RAP backwards edge protection has 2 components to it
14:57:38 <strcat[m]> deterministic type-based enforcement (which is the same as how indirect calls - forward edge - are protected - although most functions can be detected as not indirectly callable)
14:58:08 <strcat[m]> and probabilistic enforcement via an efficient XOR approach
14:58:31 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: you can't bypass the deterministic enforcement with arbitrary read/write and full knowledge of the address space
14:58:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "and probabilistic enforcement vi"> That sounds like -fstack-protector, no?
14:58:38 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: cause it's just a deterministic check
14:58:44 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no it's not the same
14:59:05 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: -fstack-protector is quality GNU/GCC history stuff
14:59:08 <strcat[m]> they had something better and watered it down to -fstack-protector
14:59:17 <strcat[m]> it doesn't implement XOR canaries
14:59:20 <strcat[m]> even though an EARLIER version had it
14:59:30 <strcat[m]> so -fstack-protector ONLY protects against sequential overflows
14:59:38 <strcat[m]> the earlier version protected return addresses against arbitrary writes
14:59:51 <strcat[m]> but GCC/GNU/ Red Hat watered it down
15:00:02 <strcat[m]> for no apparent reason
15:00:05 <strcat[m]> they are just dumb? I don't know
15:00:22 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: anyway -fstack-protector (SSP) has a really limited use case: mitigating some sequential overflows
15:00:52 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "they are just dumb? I don't know"> Likely the reason
15:01:08 <strcat[m]> it puts a canary at the top of the frame and puts ret addr above it
15:01:31 <strcat[m]> and reorders stuff in the frame based on risk
15:01:36 <strcat[m]> stuff most likely to overflow closest to top (can actually make things worse lol)
15:01:46 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: you can't bypass the "> RAP sounds so cool
15:01:54 <strcat[m]> I might be describing top vs. bottom wrong atm
15:01:58 <strcat[m]> btw
15:02:01 <strcat[m]> but I am communicating the concept of it properly
15:02:09 <strcat[m]> I just don't feel like thinking about stacks atm
15:02:18 <strcat[m]> each stack frame has a lower address (on popular archs)
15:02:20 <strcat[m]> i.e. it grows down
15:02:36 <strcat[m]> so the stack guard page for stopping overflows is actually at the bottom of the mapping
15:02:41 <strcat[m]> where bottom == lowest address
15:02:51 <strcat[m]> and the start of the stack is typically called stack top
15:02:58 <strcat[m]> anyways SSP is a really primitive thing
15:03:20 <strcat[m]> it reorders stack frame + sticks canary at top so an overflow into the ret addr or previous stack frames can be detected right before returning
15:03:37 <strcat[m]> some implementations also use a zero byte in the canary
15:03:40 <strcat[m]> so if you leak 1 canary you know the secret and can bypass that
15:03:54 <strcat[m]> and if it's not a sequential overflow where you're forced to overwrite it, doesn't matter, just don't clobber it
15:04:16 <strcat[m]> |      array         |  canary | ret addr |
15:04:32 <strcat[m]> like if you can just overflow past the canary it doesn't do anything
15:04:47 <strcat[m]> it only matters if the overflow is sequential like a memcpy/strcpy overflow or a custom loop that does that, w/e
15:05:38 <strcat[m]> | variables | variables with address taken | small array |      large array       |  canary | ret addr |
15:05:41 <strcat[m]> it basically orders it like that
15:05:48 <strcat[m]> it's a really stupid feature k
15:06:20 <strcat[m]> there was an EARLIER version of stack canaries in the same lineage as these ones
15:07:00 <strcat[m]> where it would XOR the return address into the canary before saving it
15:07:05 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "it's a really stupid feature k"> Good description for everything GNU
15:07:13 <strcat[m]> then XOR it out of the canary after loading it
15:07:30 <strcat[m]> so each canary saved on stack would have ret addr XORed into it
15:07:37 <strcat[m]> so lets say you just overwrite a ret addr
15:07:46 <strcat[m]> when it loads that and XORs it with canary, it doesn't match expected canary
15:07:57 <strcat[m]> so that protected against arbitrary writes (or just non-sequential writes)
15:08:04 <EssentialChaos[m> <madaidan[m] "Good description for everything "> The license is ok, I think
15:08:04 <strcat[m]> but that is not what GCC / GNU / Red Hat implemented
15:08:11 <strcat[m]> they implemented a worse version for no particular reason
15:08:15 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: it's really not
15:09:20 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "EssentialChaos: it's really not"> Not as in conceptually or from law perspective?
15:09:49 <strcat[m]> GPLv2 is not friendly to projects that consider GPL to be an encumbered, non-free license like the *BSDs
15:10:09 <strcat[m]> GPLv2 also has a 'death penalty' clause making it extremely strict when people fail to initially comply with it
15:10:29 <strcat[m]> GPLv3 removed the 'death penalty' clause making it less strict in that regard (also less enforceable)
15:11:11 <strcat[m]> GPLv3 forbids making devices where only signed software can be loaded
15:11:41 <strcat[m]> GPLv3 is considered incredibly non-free by the *BSDs, etc.
15:12:13 <strcat[m]> GCC 4.2.1 was the last release of GCC under GPLv2
15:12:20 <strcat[m]> so that is the version of GCC in OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc.
15:12:25 <strcat[m]> along with frozen binutils, etc.
15:12:54 <strcat[m]> so Clang gave them a modern compiler under a license they consider free
15:13:03 <derpy> strcat[m]: you run OpenBSD? Do you think it is way more secure than properly configured Linux kernel? Or is that perception overblown?
15:13:08 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: GPLv2 is incompatible with GPLv3
15:13:19 <strcat[m]> GPLv2 considers GPLv3 non-free due to the added restrictions
15:13:22 <strcat[m]> GPLv3 considers GPLv2 non-free
15:13:26 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "EssentialChaos: GPLv2 is incompa"> Yeah, I read that
15:13:40 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: so you cannot use GPLv2 code in the same software as GPLv3 code
15:13:55 <strcat[m]> their workaround for this was getting people to say the license is "GPLv2 or later" putting them at the mercy of future changes
15:14:06 <strcat[m]> like how they removed the 'death penalty' making the license way less enforceable
15:14:33 <strcat[m]> so now 'GPL2 or later' software can be used without that clause, weakening what it provided for projects which may have wanted that
15:14:46 <strcat[m]> that's what happens when you let an organization arbitrarily issue new licenses for your software
15:15:16 <strcat[m]> many projects used GPLv2 as the license instead of 'GPLv2 or later' to avoid trusting the FSF
15:15:22 <strcat[m]> so now those are incompatible with GPL3 or GPL3+ software
15:15:31 <strcat[m]> so for example Linux and BusyBox are GPLv2 only
15:15:45 <strcat[m]> you cannot put code into Linux from a GPLv3 project like glibc or vice versa
15:15:59 <strcat[m]> this is supposed to be 'freedom'? lol
15:16:01 <strcat[m]> k
15:16:19 <strcat[m]> doesn't even permit mixing the software with different versions of the same license
15:16:36 <strcat[m]> anyway for very good reasons *BSDs consider GPL licenses non-free
15:17:16 <strcat[m]> so when you hear FSF people going on with their religious rants on non-free software just remember that many people consider their software non-free for valid reasons
15:17:49 <strcat[m]> truly free / open software lets anyone use it for any purpose / endeavor, right? well, GPL does not do that
15:17:55 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "so when you hear FSF people goin"> What a coincidence, I recently had an argument with one of those
15:18:13 <hiya> Is there any off-topic chan?
15:18:20 <hiya> What do you think about S/MIME?
15:18:30 <strcat[m]> I can't use GPLv3 code in a GPLv2 project, both licenses are non-free in that regard
15:18:37 <strcat[m]> seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do too, it's not like I am doing something evil
15:19:15 <EssentialChaos[m> Interesting, do you know anything about Mozilla's license?
15:19:50 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: it's halfway to being fucked up like the GPL
15:20:28 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: the original MPL is incompatible with GPL
15:20:41 <strcat[m]> cause of the GPL restrictions
15:20:44 <strcat[m]> not MPL's fault
15:22:08 <EssentialChaos[m> So what license do you prefer?
15:22:28 <strcat[m]> hiya: just use signify for signing and age for encryption with durability (eventually age might support signing)
15:24:20 <strcat[m]> but for secure communication you should use something like Signal with forward secrecy
15:24:30 <strcat[m]> not one-off sign / encrypt stuff
15:24:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "but for secure communication you"> Matrix
15:24:55 <strcat[m]> email does not work for particularly secure communication
15:25:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> E2e chats
15:25:03 <strcat[m]> you can't bolt it onto it
15:25:18 <Mathijs[m]> matrix has forward secrecy as well
15:25:23 <hiya> Ok, but since I self-host my mailserver. If I use S/MIME would it offer more deliver-ability
15:25:24 <flabbergasted> is it considered safe to let chromium/vanadium store passwords?
15:25:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> But that's just fine
15:25:52 <hiya> I like XMPP + OMEMO, there is Session which is basically signal without phone number
15:25:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <flabbergasted "is it considered safe to let chr"> Yes
15:26:07 <strcat[m]> hiya: hosting your your mail server probably implies it's super insecure cause it's really hard to have basic security on an  email server
15:26:13 <strcat[m]> to the point that most major providers massively fuck it up
15:26:27 <strcat[m]>  * to the point that most providers massively fuck it up
15:26:34 <Mathijs[m]> <strcat[m] "truly free / open software lets "> I'd argue copyleft lisences protect the freedom of the users, bsd-like licenses allow users to get royally fucked over, and only give freedom to developers
15:26:37 <hiya> strcat[m]: :( Why do you think it is super insecure?
15:26:51 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: not sure how copyleft licenses protect freedom and they are themselves non-free
15:27:10 <Mathijs[m]> > <@strcat:matrix.org> truly free / open software lets anyone use it for any purpose / endeavor, right? well, GPL does not do that
15:27:10 <Mathijs[m]>  * I'd argue copyleft licenses protect the freedom of the users, bsd-like licenses allow users to get royally fucked over, and only give freedom to developers
15:27:34 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: so for example GCC plugins basically must be GPLv3+ but the Linux kernel plugins based on grsecurity code are GPLv2 intentionally
15:27:35 <Mathijs[m]> look at what happend with the intel management engine
15:27:38 <strcat[m]> to make them not legally usable
15:27:47 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: what does that have to do with this? nothing
15:28:03 <Mathijs[m]> it's quite a limitation on anyone using intel CPU's
15:28:12 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: irrelevant to the discussion
15:28:15 <Mathijs[m]> even though the software used is BSD
15:28:19 <Mathijs[m]> the whole reason android ROMs exists in the first place, is that it's based on GPL-ed software
15:28:24 <strcat[m]> irrelevant
15:28:38 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: that's not true
15:28:39 <strcat[m]> at all
15:28:41 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: complete and total lie
15:28:46 <Mathijs[m]> because it enforces users access to the source
15:28:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Mathijs[m] "the whole reason android ROMs ex"> No
15:28:52 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: completely untrue
15:29:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Android is all apache2
15:29:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only Linux and libcore seem to be gpl
15:29:16 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: Android forbids GPL2 / GPL3 in userspace other than Java with classpath exception
15:29:23 <strcat[m]> ONLY the Linux kernel is GPLv2
15:29:33 <strcat[m]> even libcore is not GPLv2 it has the classpath exception which is a huge exception
15:29:39 <strcat[m]> it's not GPLv2 anymore at all really
15:29:40 <cyredanthem[m]> Android is not GPL and no that's not a problem
15:30:08 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: the Linux kernel being GPLv2 helps how exactly?
15:30:30 <strcat[m]> AOSP is open source and it has nothing to do with the GPLv2
15:30:48 <strcat[m]> and GPLv2 for the kernel doesn't apply to userspace
15:31:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> He read too much XDA bullshit it seems
15:31:12 <strcat[m]> and also various vendors like NVIDIA, etc. make binary drivers for the Linux kernel anyway lol
15:31:30 <strcat[m]> cause it only applies to 'derivative works' and the port of their driver to Linux is not considered a derivative work
15:31:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nvidia is a nightmare
15:32:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> It only works because nobody is interested in updating Xorg anymore
15:32:03 <derpy> speaking of Intel's ME, it would be sweet if AMD would release its source code (and I think beneficial to their profits, too)... Then we could use libreboot!
15:32:04 <strcat[m]> Google requires all kernel drivers to be open source
15:32:07 <strcat[m]> but the GPLv2 does not
15:32:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wayland support is basically dead
15:32:20 <strcat[m]> since they are not necessarily a derivative work
15:32:25 <strcat[m]> if they are ported from another OS, the Linux kernel community considers that allowed
15:32:33 <strcat[m]> anyway not sure how GPLv2 helps with anything
15:32:37 <strcat[m]> it's just a hindrance if anything
15:32:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> <derpy "speaking of Intel's ME, it would"> Honestly when do we go power10?
15:32:47 <strcat[m]> it's annoying as hell to people working on open source software
15:33:01 <derpy> anupritaisno1[m] when we are rich and have extra $ to blow... not soon :P
15:33:19 <strcat[m]> sucks having incompatible licenses everywhere
15:33:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> <derpy "anupritaisno1 when we are rich a"> But can power10 build android?
15:33:24 <strcat[m]> not being able to reuse code across various components
15:33:25 <strcat[m]> that sucks
15:33:31 <strcat[m]> that is not free
15:33:42 <derpy> anupritaisno1[m] I would imagine, yes.
15:34:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also idk when arch Linux gonna support those
15:34:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe never
15:34:17 <strcat[m]> you can't use gplv2 code even in projects using COMPATIBLE licenses because it can't be upstreamed
15:34:24 <strcat[m]> because it would restrict the license of the project
15:34:39 <user3308> Hi
15:34:46 <strcat[m]> so with the linux kernel as an example
15:34:52 <derpy> for sure strcat[m] - and devs should continue selecting for things that make their lives easier - and that will make software better.
15:35:00 <strcat[m]> they borrow code from *BSDs and make it GPLv2 which locks it down under a license considered non-free by the BSDs
15:35:21 <strcat[m]> so people who use the GPLv2 are hypocrites doing exactly what they claim other licenses cause
15:35:54 <strcat[m]> also it is generally not useful to FORCE people to make code available
15:35:58 <strcat[m]> that doesn't get code upstream
15:36:08 <user3308> How difficult would it be to compromise a grapheneos device through, say, a hypothetical vuln in vanadium, if all browser and app permissions for vanadium are disabled (except network)?
15:36:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "that doesn't get code upstream"> This
15:36:12 <derpy> Do people think Apple "took" from *BSDs because of Darwin?
15:36:16 <strcat[m]> it's hard enough to get code upstream when the people who wrote it WANT it to be upstream
15:36:27 <user3308> Sry for the dumb question
15:37:24 <strcat[m]> landing stuff in upstream projects is hard
15:37:39 <strcat[m]> it's pretty much impossible to land linux kernel drivers upstream for non-trivial new hardware until 1+ years after the hardware is released
15:37:43 <strcat[m]> and that's assuming the vendor does a good job
15:37:50 <strcat[m]> so how are drivers ever supposed to be upstream for current hardware that's not simply a minor iteration of previous hardware
15:37:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat BTW what do you think about zircon?
15:38:20 <strcat[m]> I guess if you only care about poor support for legacy hardware, it's useful to force some vendor to release an internal driver years later
15:38:28 <strcat[m]> and then take another 2 years to upstream something based on it
15:38:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> They can be staging drivers, no?
15:38:56 <derpy> not sure what you're arguing... about better dev process in general or a specific dev process flaw in specific OSS communities? strcat[m]
15:39:26 <strcat[m]> GPLv2 and especially GPLv3 are less than totally free software licenses
15:39:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <derpy "not sure what you're arguing... "> I face that issue a lot
15:39:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> I fix bugs but never bother upstreaming them
15:39:57 <strcat[m]> our ideal is having completely open source hardware, firmware and software under permissive licenses
15:40:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> It takes too much time
15:40:24 <strcat[m]> GPLv3 software is not welcome in GrapheneOS - it's forbidden, it's a non-free license WORSE than proprietary software
15:40:40 <strcat[m]> we would rather have proprietary software than GPLv3 software, GPLv3 software is more harmful to our goals
15:40:43 <derpy> makes sense!
15:41:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "GPLv3 software is not welcome in"> How about the unlicense?
15:41:40 <user3308> Strcat: How difficult would it be to compromise a grapheneos device through, say, a hypothetical vuln in vanadium, if all browser and app permissions for vanadium are disabled (except network)?
15:42:17 <strcat[m]> it's a normal app
15:42:20 <strcat[m]> not a privileged app
15:42:36 <strcat[m]> only special thing about it is there's an app providing the WebView to other apps
15:43:02 <strcat[m]> none of the 3 Vanadium (or Chromium) apps are privileged apps
15:43:03 <stuux[m]> strcat: If i want to test a custom build of Auditor, do I have to change the app signature? Because I get the following error with a custom build of Auditor when trying to audit a device: "Error encountered generating attestation: wrong attestation app signature digest"
15:43:21 <strcat[m]> so beyond it's not relevant to Vanadium in particular really
15:43:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> The webview does sandbox itself
15:43:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <user3308 "Strcat: How difficult would it b"> Very hard
15:43:58 <strcat[m]> user3308: and you need to define 'hypothetical vuln'
15:44:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also selinux is there to prevent that
15:44:21 <strcat[m]> considering that there's a renderer sandbox
15:44:58 <strcat[m]> user3308:  not really clear what you are trying to ask - Vanadium isn't a privileged app, are you just asking about apps in general? and does your 'hypothetical vuln' include a vulnerability escaping from the renderer sandbox?
15:45:15 <user3308> Say, some evil adversary decides to setup a watering hole targeting your browser
15:45:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW strcat is yama back on graphene?
15:45:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <user3308 "Say, some evil adversary decides"> No
15:45:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no not atm haven't restored 90% of the kernel stuff
15:46:07 <derpy> I wonder what % of linux community uses SELinux or apparmor to a degree that actually improves their security
15:46:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Selinux will confine it to at most the affected app and the webview
15:46:11 <user3308> I don't know the details, but how often would they have succeeded if the browser and app permissions are denied?
15:46:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless you have a second exploit you can't go further
15:46:29 <strcat[m]> user3308: Vanadium is in the regular app sandbox - it's not a privileged app
15:46:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> <derpy "I wonder what % of linux communi"> On android? Everything
15:46:37 <strcat[m]> user3308: and it has a really strong renderer sandbox

15:46:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "user3308: and it has a really st"> Not to mention CFI should prevent such stuff
15:46:58 <strcat[m]> user3308: it's really not clear what you're trying to ask sorry
15:47:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <derpy "right, I was thinking desktop/se"> The Linux sandbox is also nice
15:47:13 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <derpy "I wonder what % of linux communi"> There are literally sysadmins in the org I work for who insist on just running `setenforce 0` to fix all related problems and ship out workstations to clients like that.
15:47:13 <strcat[m]> user3308: you haven't laid out a clear question or set of assumptions about what happens to answer
15:47:31 <strcat[m]> 0xC0ncord: the SELinux policies on traditional distributions are incredibly weak and barely do anything anyway
15:47:32 <M0xC0ncord[m]> We are using RHEL 7 as part of a contract.
15:47:35 <derpy> M0xC0ncord[m]haha I bet
15:47:41 <strcat[m]> 0xC0ncord: they are incredibly incomplete and weak policies
15:48:09 <user3308> > does your 'hypothetical vuln' include a vulnerability escaping from the renderer sandbox?
15:48:15 <strcat[m]> 0xC0ncord: the way the OS is assembled out of fragmented components / configurations isn't compatible with strong SELinux policies, but they don't even do a reasonable job with what they have to work with
15:48:17 <user3308> What happens if that's the case?
15:48:20 <strcat[m]> it barely covers anything
15:48:30 <strcat[m]> user3308: you need to make a clear question
15:48:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: no not atm haven'"> Using it set to level 3 here (PTRACE_NO_ATTACH) also I have most of your past kernel work archived
15:49:05 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: well the problem is most of the past work wasn't in the repos you would have looked in
15:49:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: well the problem "> Yeah I just have your kernel
15:49:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nothing else
15:49:46 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: that feature would be a welcome addition addition again it's just a low priority because there are already strong restrictions from the sandbox
15:49:56 <strcat[m]>  * anupritaisno1: that feature would be a welcome addition again it's just a low priority because there are already strong restrictions from the sandbox
15:50:06 <strcat[m]> it needs a toggle
15:50:10 <strcat[m]> in security settings
15:50:15 <user3308> I'll try again
15:50:19 <strcat[m]> it breaks compatibility with some apps and breaks native debugging ofc
15:50:48 <strcat[m]> user3308: and maybe the question doesn't need to be specific to Vanadium
15:51:00 <strcat[m]> because the only thing that would be specific to Vanadium is that it has the renderer sandbox
15:51:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "it breaks compatibility with som"> It's off on debug kernels
15:51:11 <user3308> In general, does disabling permissions (both browser and system) for vanadium offer any resistance against hypothetical sandbox escapes?
15:51:17 <strcat[m]> although other apps can certainly use isolatedProcess and seccomp-bpf to make their own sandboxes comparable or stronger than it
15:51:18 <user3308> Or are you screwed anyway?
15:51:26 <strcat[m]> user3308: which sandbox
15:51:40 <strcat[m]> user3308: the app sandbox or the stronger internal renderer sandbox
15:51:52 <strcat[m]> user3308: it has no relevance to the renderer sandbox
15:52:05 <user3308> App sandbox
15:52:12 <strcat[m]> the renderer sandbox has no file access, no networking, etc.
15:52:21 <strcat[m]> it can only do things via the broker process
15:52:35 <strcat[m]> sites are isolated from each other by the sandbox
15:52:47 <strcat[m]> compromise of the renderer sandbox doesn't give them all your browser data
15:52:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "the renderer sandbox has no file"> Interesting
15:53:05 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's isolatedProcess + strong seccomp-bpf policy
15:53:10 <strcat[m]> other apps can use isolatedProcess
15:53:17 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: and it's per-site-instance renderer sandbox
15:53:32 <derpy> What was that earlier convo about hosting your own email? You don't recommend it or you recommend a specific configuration self-hosted?
15:53:42 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: sites isolated from each other (unlike non-Chromium browser sandboxes where the attacker gets all your data and it can only protect the system from them - which the app sandbox does)
15:53:50 <user3308> Slightly off topic, but I don't know anyone better to ask

17:12:22 <stuux[m]> I test Auditor on Android 11
17:12:26 <strcat[m]> stuux: yes because the attestation chains trust to the app
17:12:42 <strcat[m]> if you want it to work you need to replace the key fingerprint it checks for in the hardware-based attestation
17:13:03 <strcat[m]> the app / OS security checks / information would be insecure if it didn't chain trust via attestation to the app
17:13:22 <strcat[m]> the strength of this comes from the pairing approach
17:13:59 <strcat[m]> unlike using a feature like this for some kind of DRM or whatever where it wouldn't be paired and would only be able to verify up to a root, so that it could be bypassed through having any key chaining up to it
17:14:17 <strcat[m]> stuux: you need to replace the fingerprint in the code and build the app for both ends
17:14:26 <strcat[m]> the standard app will reject your app and there is no way for you to fake it
17:14:42 <stuux[m]> Oh ok
17:14:43 <strcat[m]> and similarly your build of the app will reject the standard app
17:14:55 <strcat[m]> because the standard app won't match
17:15:06 <stuux[m]> Which fingerprint do I have to replace?
17:15:13 <strcat[m]> in AttestationProtocol.java

17:15:22 <strcat[m]> from your signing keys
17:15:47 <strcat[m]> I haven't written documentation on contributing to Auditor
17:16:04 <strcat[m]> contributing to other parts is probably a lot more straightforward right now

17:59:42 <tronss> Do you recommend using Tor browser in a different profile always, disabling most of the other apps?
18:00:05 <tronss> Or do you prefer using for example Mullvad VPN?
18:01:07 <tronss> I normally use my ISP connection without Tor (Orbot) or a VPN, but sometimes, when I want something more private, I use Tor browser
18:01:49 <tronss> I Idon't knkow if you guys/girls use a direct connection or always a VPN or Tor. I read Edward Snowden talk about GrapheneOS and routing all the connections through tor....
18:02:51 <tronss> As what he would do if he had to use a smartphone
18:03:14 <tronss> Maybe you don't agree with that statement...
18:03:43 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: Just make sure you don't mix the modes of anonymity.
18:04:06 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, so only Tor or only VPN in another profile?
18:04:07 <TheJollyRoger> Crossing The Streams is what I'd call a "Very Bad Thing."
18:04:20 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: not necessarily. Have you heard about the "Modes of Anonymity" before?
18:04:27 <tronss> No, sorry :(
18:04:40 <tronss> Can you help me?
18:05:02 * madaidan[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_2020-05-22-19-03-42-1.png (40KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/RKTPtVVSVEcIrlxyLtJlfGJj >
18:05:22 <madaidan[m]> Gotta love being harassed for criticising firefox
18:05:35 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. There's further reading online I can point you to, but in brief, mixing a mode of anonymity, would be something like opening Tor Browser, then logging into your Facebook account, then browsing the internet at large assuming you are still anonymous.
18:06:00 <TheJollyRoger> Simply using a different profile for this isn't going to save you because you've essentially used the tools incorrectly.
18:06:18 <TheJollyRoger> Let me go find you a link, remember that Tor cannot protect you if you use it wrong.
18:06:51 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, well I never use Tor to login in some websites, if that's what it means, or to download files
18:06:59 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/DoNot
18:07:10 <tronss> I only use it as they recomend it to be used
18:07:13 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, thanks
18:07:36 <TheJollyRoger> Great -- this is why I discourage the sledgehammer approach of "simply throw everything into Tor."
18:07:47 <tronss> But I suppose it's safer using it well and in another profile, or do you use it in the same profile as the rest of the apps?
18:09:03 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: is it accurate to call you a Whonix contributor
18:09:06 <TheJollyRoger> It's going to be safer if substantially less convenient.
18:09:20 <TheJollyRoger> So you're going to have to make the call.
18:09:49 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, what do you recommend?
18:10:31 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: is it accurate to cal"> Yes. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Team
18:10:52 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: I'd probably say start by looking at your threat model and what you're protecting against and where you're looking to protect against and how much you're willing to change use habits to do it.
18:12:30 <TheJollyRoger> I tried to go "full paranoia" before by setting up dedicated hardware for dedicated purposes before but in the end, it really did me no good except for giving me a warm fuzzy feeling inside that soon ran cold because it was too much of a pain to manage and was actually preventing me from getting any real work done.
18:12:52 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, well, I'm only looking to use the browser in a way that I could be more anonymous in general, only sometimes
18:13:20 <tronss> Mostly I use my direct connection always with a Private DNS: adguard
18:13:27 <tronss> And free apps
18:13:33 <TheJollyRoger> Well, give it a try both ways and see how you like it.
18:14:08 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, I understand... I think I was done with it too
18:14:39 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
18:17:20 <tronss> But you know, being sincere, there are moments that you want to browse in a private way
18:17:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
18:17:29 <tronss> Only in those moments I use Tor Browser
18:17:57 <tronss> Sometimes I think to use the VPN in my smartphone but maybe it's not a good idea to trust the VPN company more than my ISP
18:18:03 <tronss> And giving network access
18:18:35 <tronss> So, I use Torr, but I know that Firefox is not safe to use, I only hope Tor project did something more to Firefox to prevent some attacks
18:18:54 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it's kinda unfortunate that they're stuck with lousy ol' Fireflops :(
18:18:56 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, so you also use a direct connection
18:19:01 <limitless0[m]> TheJollyRoger: i understand user profiles are the way to go for better isolation but when you delete the profile is it recoverable anymore what you chatted or done on that profile even by forensic tools?
18:19:34 <TheJollyRoger> It depends on what I'm doing. I use Tor for some things, some of which are /not/ anonymous, but there I'm very careful not to mix the modes of anonymity.
18:19:40 <tronss> limitless0[m], I also delete all the caches or stored in  Tor browser after I use it
18:20:07 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, I must read your link :;)
18:20:17 <TheJollyRoger> Since it's mixing modes that gets people screwed.
18:20:50 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, and what I do now.. is it a good mode of anonymity then?
18:21:14 <tronss> I expose my real IP everyday in many apps lol
18:22:14 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: a mode of anonymity is like a tool, it's not inherently good nor evil. It's just used for a different purpose. For instance, if you're using Tor to bypass a firewall at work because say, social media is blocked at your office WiFi, don't use the same session to go browse with an expectation of anonymity.
18:22:34 <TheJollyRoger> Because that's mixing the mode of "Not anonymous, but using Tor" with "Anonymous and using tor."
18:22:40 <TheJollyRoger> And linking your activities.
18:23:14 <TheJollyRoger> This is why we recommend against simply tunnelling everything on your phone over Tor, because the applications on your phone that are not "Tor Aware" won't know the difference.
18:23:30 <TheJollyRoger> That's what I'd like you to take away from this discussion.
18:23:54 <tronss> Ah ok, it's only that Ed Snowden statement confused me...
18:24:01 <TheJollyRoger> There are better experts on the subject than I on the specific nuances of Tor usage, and the Whonix documentation is a good resource to find out more on that.
18:24:16 <tronss> I don't use Tor or all my connections with it, only some times and only to browse in some moments
18:24:27 <TheJollyRoger> ^_^
18:24:48 <tronss> Being sincere: If I want to watch some porn for example, I don't want to expose my real IP
18:24:56 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha, of course!
18:25:11 <tronss> ;)
18:25:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> <tronss "Being sincere: If I want to watc"> Watch porn on telegram

18:27:12 <tronss> You are great
18:27:13 <cn3m[m]> no one gives a rip
18:27:41 <tronss> cn3m[m], why not tor browser?, it's like trusting the VPN company as I trust my ISP
18:28:13 <cn3m[m]> <hiya "What is the difference between s"> secure boot doesn't endorce the os it's not useful for security
18:28:19 <tronss> I think Tor browser could be a better option but I know about the browser.....
18:28:38 <madaidan[m]> <hiya "What is the difference between s"> Secure boot is an incomplete implementation of verified boot.
18:28:56 <madaidan[m]> It's only useful when combined with dm-verity.
18:29:05 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <hiya "What is the difference between s"> Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I understand it is that secure boot is just a term that applies to when (U)EFI verifies the signature of the payload (usually the bootloader) before handing over control to the OS. Verified boot is a far more in-depth implementation of boot security that verifies every stage of the boot chain, but ALSO is able to inform the
18:29:05 <M0xC0ncord[m]> user in some way that the system's integrity is verified.
18:29:16 <tronss> cn3m[m], do you recommend it to avoid the browser itself?
18:29:37 <cn3m[m]> Tor Browser is insecure and not needed for this
18:29:40 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Without being able to convey that information to the user, you just have "trusted" boot I think.
18:29:50 <tronss> cn3m[m], maybe Bromite?
18:30:43 <tronss> Or using Orbot as VPN with Bromite?
18:31:01 <hiya> cn3m[m]: madaidan[m] M0xC0ncord[m] Ok. Thanks!
18:31:53 <madaidan[m]> strcat: your post on reddit isn't showing up btw
18:32:00 <madaidan[m]> I can only see it when looking at your profile
18:32:00 <tronss> cn3m[m], but I"m giving ORbot or my VPN company the network permission... isn't it dangerous in some way?
18:32:08 <madaidan[m]> It's probably caught in the spam filter or something
18:32:16 <cn3m[m]> verified boot verifies the OS(which in turn sane OSs verify the programs)
18:34:45 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "Without being able to convey tha"> If my understanding is still correct, this is actually something I also learned about recently. If the system can't in some way inform the user that the system's integrity is verified, it's pretty useless. The way that that information is made available is also important to protect.

19:49:59 <cyredanthem[m]> All platforms
19:50:15 <madaidan[m]> Firefox lacks proper sandboxing and exploit mitigations

20:08:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Good I had it in my notes, but forgot to mention you
20:09:28 <tronss> madaidan[m], would you use more a VPN with Bromite or Tor browser directly?
20:09:46 <tronss> VPN company or Orbot as VPN
20:10:35 <madaidan[m]> <tronss "madaidan., Disable STRICT_KERNEL"> That's used to mark certain areas of the kernel as read-only. With this new change, those areas aren't read-only so a write flaw in the kernel can be used to overwrite them (for that specific architecture).
20:10:41 <parazen616[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Or just Chrome and a VPN"> Do you know this project?
20:10:48 <madaidan[m]> Basically, they disabled a vital security feature instead of fixing their bugs.

20:11:54 <tronss> madaidan[m], yes, that's what I mean: maybe it protects more from fingerprinting but the browser is not secure, so...?

20:12:00 <tronss> What do you use?
20:12:01 <cyredanthem[m]> If you have to use Tor Browser on Android you can run it in its own profile
20:12:05 <EssentialChaos[m> <madaidan[m] "lol https://git.kernel.org/pub/s"> This is.. kinda concerning... I think, I might switch to something else
20:12:05 <cyredanthem[m]> Wipe the data of the app every session
20:12:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> Does the Tor Project intend to support the new Firefox engine when it comes out?
20:12:40 <cyredanthem[m]> Chromium on macOS is my desktop experience
20:12:46 <tronss> cyredanthem[m], yes, that's what I do, in a new profile and only that app and disabling most of the apps or denying permissions
20:12:53 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm not going back to Firefox on Fedora
20:13:01 <tronss> And cleaning the caches
20:13:24 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "Chromium on macOS is my desktop "> Can I export profiles from Chromium?

20:13:34 <madaidan[m]> <tronss "What do you use?"> I've already said I prefer Tor Browser but it's up to you whether you care enough about the security issues.
20:13:58 <parazen616[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "I do I don't do political stuff"> I don't do political stuff as well but I sounds like they take privacy serious and offer a free vpn and some other gimmicks
20:14:05 <tronss> But I see here different opinions: some recommend VPN + Bromite, others Tor Browser. So, I'm not sure
20:14:08 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "EssentialChaos: yes"> Is there an actual button or should I just copy the folder from .config?
20:14:19 <cyredanthem[m]> Copy it is what I do
20:14:32 <tronss> It's easier and less work to use tor browser directly but I suppose I'm more opened to be attacked
20:14:42 <cyredanthem[m]> parazen616: free vpns like ProtonVPN and Cryptostorm trade speed for privacy which is fine imo
20:14:51 <cyredanthem[m]> Political services are too big of a target
20:14:53 <EssentialChaos[m> Damn, I think Chromium is missing out on some UX features
20:15:33 <cyredanthem[m]> You can try Vivaldi I guess
20:15:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> Vivaldi apparently has good UI customisation
20:15:51 <tronss> madaidan[m], yes... I didn't know until I read here about Linux... I use Debian :(
20:15:53 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "You can try Vivaldi I guess"> I haven't looked into it yet, but if I were to guess, I'd say they also lack those
20:16:02 <parazen616[m]> I don't think riseup trade privacy...
20:16:02 <parazen616[m]> But we'll never now.
20:16:09 <tronss> Some time ago I used OpenBSD, maybe 15 years ago, but now it's not safe as I read here
20:16:12 <cyredanthem[m]> ChromeOS is the only full fledged system that makes a good security model. Even then it's just good not great
20:16:17 <EssentialChaos[m> <tronss "madaidan., yes... I didn't know "> Look into Kicksecure
20:16:39 <tronss> Os maybe HardenedBSD?
20:16:46 <tronss> I've never used it
20:17:00 <cyredanthem[m]> The best OSs for security right now are ChromeOS and macOS on the right hardware. Windows on generic
20:17:06 <cyredanthem[m]> > Os maybe HardenedBSD?

20:17:17 <madaidan[m]> HardenedBSD has nice mitigations but lacks any real application security model

20:18:40 <cyredanthem[m]> That's understandable. Try Windows then
20:18:52 <tronss> That's interesting about you've MITMd them
20:19:03 <tronss> So, did you check all the connections it makes?
20:19:17 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes and read them in plain text
20:19:22 <cyredanthem[m]> It hardly does anything
20:19:28 <tronss> I don't trust Windows...
20:19:40 <cyredanthem[m]> My macOS behaves just like Fedora privacy wise
20:19:40 <tronss> cyredanthem[m], ok, that's great
20:19:42 <cyredanthem[m]> > I don't trust Windows...
20:19:42 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 LTSC then
20:19:50 <cyredanthem[m]> Or Hackintosh or ChromiumOS
20:19:56 <cyredanthem[m]> Anything but standard Linux
20:20:00 <tronss> Uh never heard about LTSC... I'll read
20:20:17 <bseeinu[m]> Yeah LTSC for the win
20:20:27 <bseeinu[m]> Can hackintosh with clover be safe though
20:20:45 <cyredanthem[m]> You need OpenCore to have all hardening features on
20:21:01 <bseeinu[m]> Gotcha
20:21:06 <tronss> Windows 10 Enterprise?, what's the difference in privacy?..
20:21:22 <cyredanthem[m]> SIP technically works, but someone could make a malicious bootloader to flash on the hackintosh so you would need to store it on a removable device
20:21:42 <cyredanthem[m]> > Windows 10 Enterprise?, what's the difference in privacy?..
20:21:43 <cyredanthem[m]> It's debloated no store or edge and you have full privacy control
20:21:49 <tronss> Is it false the opinion about Windows spying on us after all the news we've heard all these past years, and Snowden, etc?
20:22:07 <tronss> cyredanthem[m], interesting
20:22:12 <cyredanthem[m]> LTSC is meant for the financial and medical sectors that can't take the privacy issues
20:22:40 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: the default settings favour Microsoft. They can be switched off.
20:22:43 <cyredanthem[m]> > Is it false the opinion about Windows spying on us after all the news we've heard all these past years, and Snowden, etc?
20:22:44 <cyredanthem[m]> Monitor it and make your own decisions. Most of us here use it
20:22:45 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm a macOS guy for the no root app installs so I can safely sandbox with user profiles
20:22:58 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, and can we trust that they are really doing it?
20:23:14 <TheJollyRoger> As cyredanthem[m] said, set up an intercepting proxy and you'll be able to tell us.
20:23:18 <cyredanthem[m]> > TheJollyRoger, and can we trust that they are really doing it?
20:23:18 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes monitor it
20:23:35 <tronss> cyredanthem[m], yes, that's true... it's better to monitor it
20:23:39 <cyredanthem[m]> Or trust the orgs that do
20:23:56 <TheJollyRoger> You'll be able to install your own root certificate authority and then that way you'll be able to intercept the connections.
20:24:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Everyone should MITM everything
20:24:02 <tronss> Can you buy that Windows LTSC?
20:24:03 <cyredanthem[m]> I MITM GrapheneOS and I have total trust in it
20:24:18 <cyredanthem[m]> You can get it on eBay for cheap
20:24:23 <cyredanthem[m]> Or reinstall the trial every 9 months
20:24:39 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "Everyone should MITM everything"> Do you have a link to some guide?
20:24:40 <hypokeimenon[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You'll be able to install your o"> Can you run only your own root certiticates
20:25:09 <tronss> Yeah, grapheneos only sends some connections through the captive portal and with Vanadium to Google to look like a normal android
20:25:25 <cyredanthem[m]> Do note that Windows 10 LTSC doesn't have the latest hardening features
20:25:28 <cyredanthem[m]> EssentialChaos: no I just figured it out as I went
20:25:32 <cyredanthem[m]> Maybe someone else has a guide
20:25:33 <tronss> And Bromite connects to Google if you don't remove the bookmarks and change the settings
20:25:33 <TheJollyRoger> hypokeimenon[m]: you could if you want... but that'll likely end with you not being able to connect to anywhere that enforces valid HTTPS.
20:25:35 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "Or reinstall the trial every 9 m"> You should probably do that anyway
20:25:36 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 LTSC is still strong, but not as strong as the latest Windows 10
20:25:38 <cyredanthem[m]> EssentialChaos: yes
20:25:53 <tronss> Thank you guys
20:26:37 <WokeBillKristol[> thanks for your help cyredanthem
20:26:38 <tronss> I always believed we can't trust Windows or MacOS
20:26:42 <cyredanthem[m]> Of course :) the Windows Chromium privacy gang is pretty quiet but we exist
20:26:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> <TheJollyRoger "hypokeimenon: you could if you w"> Can you choose which ones you use for each site
20:26:56 <tronss> That's why I changed from Mac to Linux :(
20:27:11 <tronss> "Looking for more privacy" siick
20:27:21 <cyredanthem[m]> > I always believed we can't trust Windows or MacOS
20:27:22 <cyredanthem[m]> Fun fact Linux shares exploits with the US government and you have countless trusted root certs
20:27:36 <cyredanthem[m]> To big companies and the government there's no difference between closed and open source
20:27:40 <hypokeimenon[m]> You can't trust any OS really
20:27:48 <tronss> Yes... or hardware maybe
20:27:56 <TheJollyRoger> hypokeimenon[m]: Not at this moment. There are ways that I've heard discussed in theory, such as cross-signing, certificate blacklisting, and DNSSEC, but I'm not familiar with any of that.
20:28:00 <tronss> What about using a read-only Linux live?
20:28:02 <hypokeimenon[m]> Maybe GrapheneOS at best
20:28:05 <tronss> Tails for example?
20:28:21 <tronss> Without persistence
20:28:37 <tronss> I suppose it can't be hacked easily
20:28:38 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: true statelessness is actually very difficult.
20:28:47 <TheJollyRoger> Also, TAILS uses Debian as an upstream provider.
20:28:49 <tronss> when you reboot it's like new again
20:28:49 <TheJollyRoger> Which is...
20:28:52 <cyredanthem[m]> Terrible security
20:28:54 <cyredanthem[m]> > Without persistence
20:28:54 <cyredanthem[m]> That's not a thing
20:28:58 * TheJollyRoger backs away.
20:29:05 <cyredanthem[m]> It just needs root to overwrite that
20:29:07 <cyredanthem[m]> Debian and Firefox
20:29:08 <cyredanthem[m]> It's terrible
20:29:12 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox ESR
20:29:17 <tronss> cyredanthem[m], Ii mean not changing anything in the system, even being attacked, when you reboot the system is like new again
20:29:26 <tronss> It's read-only
20:29:31 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: consider the following:
20:29:34 <cyredanthem[m]> Tails might be the least secure OS out there
20:29:41 <cyredanthem[m]> > It's read-only
20:29:41 <cyredanthem[m]> That's false
20:29:49 <tronss> But yes... when I use it I could be hacked easily then
20:29:57 <TheJollyRoger> Consider System Management Mode, consider the state of your PC BIOS, consider the SPI in your wifi chips,
20:30:06 <cyredanthem[m]> Tails security measures are all theater
20:30:12 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, good point...
20:30:17 <TheJollyRoger> Consider the firmware of your hard drives.
20:30:19 <cyredanthem[m]> You don't actually have read only system
20:30:20 <parazen616[m]> What about qubes os?
20:30:35 <tronss> Then we can't trust any system out there
20:30:50 <tronss> cyredanthem[m], it's in a pendrive
20:30:57 <TheJollyRoger> Qubes OS is nice in that it attempts to enforce boundaries between domains, but it takes the sledgehammer approach of "simply virtualize all the things" and treats the virtualization of insecure systems as a panacea.
20:31:00 <tronss> But yes, I understand
20:31:02 <cyredanthem[m]> If you had a Tails system even a read only flash drive wouldn't help
20:31:15 <cyredanthem[m]> If the system gets root it can modify the host too
20:31:27 <tronss> cyredanthem[m], yes, it was what I used, a pendrive with a read-only swtich
20:31:33 <tronss> switch
20:31:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You're also missing out big on the exploit mitigations and attacks on the operating system /while it is running./
20:31:44 <tronss> Iit's hardware read-only
20:31:55 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, yes, that's the pointt
20:32:03 <cyredanthem[m]> > Qubes OS is nice in that it attempts to enforce boundaries between domains, but it takes the sledgehammer approach of "simply virtualize all the things" and treats the virtualization of insecure systems as a panacea.
20:32:04 <cyredanthem[m]> It years too many packages and has a terribly insecure guest OS
20:32:07 <tronss> IT's useless if I'm attacked while I'm using it
20:32:07 <cyredanthem[m]> Trusts*
20:32:22 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: security through valuelessness is not security.
20:32:32 <tronss> I see
20:32:34 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: I think you misunderstand
20:32:34 <EssentialChaos[m> Interesting, Microsoft's website says that Windows 10 Enterprise/LTSC's evaluation lasts only 90 days
20:32:36 <cyredanthem[m]> Rearm it
20:32:38 <cyredanthem[m]> It can go for 9 months
20:32:42 <EssentialChaos[m> Rearm?
20:33:02 <cyredanthem[m]> Look up Windows trial rearm
20:33:36 <TheJollyRoger> tronss: TAILS relies on Debian as an upstream provider. Debian is often far behind on exploit mitigations and bugfixes from upstream since they often don't backport all the security fixes from upstream unless there's a CVE assigned to it.
20:33:50 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, yes, I know now
20:33:57 <TheJollyRoger> In some cases, this backporting of these bugfixes without regard to the code from upstream can end up opening more holes than they patch.
20:34:20 <tronss> :( oh
20:34:32 <hypokeimenon[m]> Are there tails like OSes other than Whonix?
20:35:03 <TheJollyRoger> So when you're using TAILS, that's what's happening, and merely saying "but if I reboot it, it'll give me a fresh start" doesn't help you after the fact /once you've already been compromised/ and possibly your data's been exfiltrated, because with Debian based operating systems the barrier to that is /very low/.
20:35:05 <cyredanthem[m]> > Are there tails like OSes other than Whonix?
20:35:06 <cyredanthem[m]> Use Win2Go and have Tor Browser on there?
20:35:36 <EssentialChaos[m> cyredanthem: Btw, it asks for some personal information, do I just fake it and they won't check?
20:35:47 <parazen616[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Are there tails like OSes other "> Tails and whonix are different.. Tales is amnesic... Whonix isn't
20:35:47 <EssentialChaos[m> Also a company name
20:35:57 <TheJollyRoger> Even if you /could achieve/ a perfectly stateless machine.
20:36:30 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, thanks!
20:36:50 <TheJollyRoger> Which I'm telling you is NOT an easy thing to do, because first you're going to have to invent an open-channel SSD first and get that to initialize before the host does.
20:37:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> Windows to Go has been discontinued cyredanthem
20:37:06 <TheJollyRoger> ...a very difficult thing to do /when the host is installed to it/.
20:37:15 <tronss> So, it's safer using Windows 10 and checking to disable all telemetry, etc...
20:37:47 <tronss> And they respect that chahnges
20:37:51 <tronss> *changes
20:37:55 <tronss> *Those changes
20:38:12 <cyredanthem[m]> Win2USB I think maybe
20:38:44 <TheJollyRoger> While I find the concept of open source very valuable, these days, many people end up repeating the open source security myth of "enough eyes make all bugs findable" to completely crumble the moment you look away from the groupthink.
20:39:07 <cyredanthem[m]> Exactly
20:39:11 <TheJollyRoger> Because simply lowering the barriers to do it and then trusting someone else is doing it doesn't mean someone is going to do it.
20:39:47 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: it also lowers the barrier to entry equally for attackers and defenders
20:39:58 <TheJollyRoger> Syzbot discovers countless memory corruption bugs in the Linux Kernel. Years go by and /these bugs do not get fixed/ nor does the Linux team believe in redesigning Linux's architecture to cage or contain them, because to do so would mean a complete redesign away from--
20:40:00 <TheJollyRoger> AH CRIPES YES
20:40:05 <strcat[m]> for security research / finding bugs
20:40:11 <tronss> TheJollyRoger, well, there are bugs in Llinux that were there a long time ago. It has a lot of code to check!! and maybe few people are able to check it
20:40:13 <cyredanthem[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): that's a very commonly over looked fact
20:40:25 <strcat[m]> so it's cognitive dissonance to say open source does not help attackers much but helps defenders find those same bugs
20:40:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah >_<.
20:40:33 <tronss> I know about that, even being open source
20:40:37 <strcat[m]> it helps both the same amount
20:40:48 <TheJollyRoger> er, sorry, means a complete redesign away from the monolithic design to which Linux owes its performance to.
20:40:56 <strcat[m]> if no one contributes it's not a positive thing
20:41:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
20:41:03 <strcat[m]> if a lot of people contribute in a meaningful way to security
20:41:03 <TheJollyRoger> Or, heh...
20:41:11 <strcat[m]> then it could be a major positive
20:41:19 <strcat[m]> but it's not really clear what the impact is
20:41:28 <hypokeimenon[m]> hence Google
20:41:42 <tronss> strcat[m], what system do you use then?...
20:41:48 <TheJollyRoger> If I was a Nefarious, Scary Agency, I would in fact hire a lot of developers to "contribute" to the code, but contribute shitty code that's gnarled and overcomplicated, unmaintainable, but works.
20:41:54 <tronss> Apart from GOS :)
20:41:58 <TheJollyRoger> In short, I would hire "Fred."
20:42:09 <parazen616[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Syzbot discovers countless memor"> So true
20:42:24 <strcat[m]> also doesn't make sense to claim open source eliminates backdoors especially for any non-trivial code
20:42:46 <strcat[m]> for really simple things you could say it helps a lot with that
20:42:52 <tronss> If I had millions of euros GOS would get more funds and developers... I hope someone will support it with it
20:42:57 <strcat[m]> but when there are millions and millions of line of complex code entangled in complex ways
20:43:03 <strcat[m]> with complex / fragile tools and APIs
20:43:15 <strcat[m]> tons of vulnerabilities everywhere not being found for years
20:43:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> The benefits of open-source outweigh the cons
20:43:21 <TheJollyRoger> If nobody's heard the term "Hire a Fred" then it's story time... TLDR, I had a co-worker that would write the most gnarled and incomprehensible macros that were complete spaghetti, but they worked. So when Fred quit (or was fired, depending on who you asked), all the work he'd done was completely unmaintainable.
20:43:47 <TheJollyRoger> And that was extremely troublesome because our entire workflow depended on the Excel and Inventor macros he wrote.
20:43:49 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: maybe
20:43:56 <strcat[m]> the change to funding model for developers is a big deal too
20:44:01 <strcat[m]> look at the linux kernel
20:44:16 <strcat[m]> 95%+ of people working on it are paid by companies to work on it in their areas of interest
20:44:42 <EssentialChaos[m> <TheJollyRoger "If nobody's heard the term "Hire"> That's like... developer's job 101... /s
20:44:43 <strcat[m]> their interests rarely include security
20:44:52 <strcat[m]> only a few of the companies care much about security like Google
20:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> EssentialChaos[m: oh good gravy just thinking of that makes me want to drink myself into oblivion.
20:45:09 <cyredanthem[m]> In a perfect world closed source is security through obscurity. However in the real world it's the opposite
20:45:11 <strcat[m]> and they only control certain areas
20:45:30 <tronss> strcat[m], an example posted by madaidan[m] some minutes ago...
20:45:38 <strcat[m]> it's largely controlled by anti-security people seeing security as an obstacle to making the kernel support their use cases, improving performance, etc. via ever increasing complexity
20:45:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "In a perfect world closed source"> In the real world it is also obscurity. It's just that there is money involved.
20:45:57 <strcat[m]> the mitigations and so on are a bad thing to many of those companies cause they don't care one bit about security
20:45:57 <tronss> strcat[m], https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8659a0e0efdd975c73355dbc033f79ba3b31e82c
20:46:03 <strcat[m]> so they see mitigating stuff like spectre as a negative
20:46:25 <strcat[m]> tronss: not quite an example of what I mean
20:46:38 <strcat[m]> I mean that they write code deliberately in insecure ways because they don't care and they want performance more
20:46:40 <tronss> I mean about security in one of your comments
20:46:49 <tronss> ah ok
20:47:01 <strcat[m]> and they fight against security features that bump up against what they do
20:47:03 <cyredanthem[m]> We need Zircon
20:47:09 <strcat[m]> they want more and more complexity / attack surface
20:47:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> from what it sounds like strcat (@strcat:matrix.org) this needs to be addressed in education and self-learning resources and a culture shift needs to be encouraged
20:47:16 <strcat[m]> you've got this crazy stuff like eBPF
20:47:33 <EssentialChaos[m> Btw, does anyone know if Windows sandbox is persisten? Does the app data get delete when I close it?
20:47:34 <strcat[m]> where they took BPF and made it into a way more powerful virtual machine and want to use it for EVERYTHING and expose a million hooks to it
20:47:39 <strcat[m]> and rewrite everything in it
20:47:39 <EssentialChaos[m>  * Btw, does anyone know if Windows sandbox is persistent? Does the app data get delete when I close it?
20:47:46 <strcat[m]> the linux kernel is like a web browser now
20:47:57 <strcat[m]> it has a JIT compiler for a complex VM (eBPF)
20:48:12 <strcat[m]> also you know the linux kernel has tons of crazy dynamic code patching and so on
20:48:30 <hypokeimenon[m]> <EssentialChaos[m " * Btw, does anyone know if Wind"> Isn't Windows Sandbox only available on Pro and Enterprise?
20:48:30 <cyredanthem[m]> >  * Btw, does anyone know if Windows sandbox is persistent? Does the app data get delete when I close it?
20:48:30 <cyredanthem[m]> It's gone
20:48:34 <cyredanthem[m]> I don't know I only use Pro
20:48:34 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm implemented a neat feature where they made a hypervisor enforcing that the kernel wasn't modified
20:48:56 <strcat[m]> downstream feature
20:48:59 <strcat[m]> it was enabled on the Pixel 2
20:49:00 <strcat[m]> upstream broke it with dynamic code patching everywhere so that's gone and never existed for Pixel 3 SoC
20:49:04 <strcat[m]> and it's gone for Pixel 2 now too anyway lol
20:49:09 <strcat[m]> for same reason
20:49:41 * TheJollyRoger buries his head in his hands.
20:50:02 <strcat[m]> don't think people realize how insanely complex and huge the linux kernel is
20:50:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> that's a shame, has it been implemented anywhere else successfully?
20:50:07 <strcat[m]> how much attack surface it has
20:50:10 <strcat[m]> and it's so insanely complex
20:50:55 <strcat[m]> do people understand that developers - even people like Linus - largely do not understand huge swaths of the core kernel?
20:50:59 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "don't think people realize how i"> At least there's a couple trillion kconfig options you can configure
20:51:00 <strcat[m]> like all the RCU stuff
20:51:06 <strcat[m]> it's super complicated and it's not understood
20:51:16 <strcat[m]> there are academic research papers still figuring out how that shit works or doesn't work
20:51:43 <strcat[m]> the linux kernel has complex, core data structures/algorithms understood but basically 0 people
20:51:51 <strcat[m]> maybe if you combine the people who work on it there is 1 person who gets it
20:52:01 <strcat[m]> but they are prob wrong
20:52:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> what are some more sanely designed kernels?
20:52:29 <EssentialChaos[m> <hypokeimenon[m] "what are some more sanely design"> seL4
20:52:35 <strcat[m]> https://lwn.net/Articles/777036/
20:53:01 <EssentialChaos[m> There's also Zircon by Google, but I think it's not nearly done
20:53:09 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. seL4: "Linux compatibility? What's that? Yeah let's just throw a Linux kernel on top of it with all its bloated, buggy glory, and call it a day."
20:53:15 <tronss> Team unc0ver Announces iOS 13.5 Jailbreak For All Devices: https://ioshacker.com/cydia/unc0ver-announces-ios-13-5-jailbreak-for-all-devices
20:53:17 <EssentialChaos[m> L4 family actually has several kernels
20:53:22 <madaidan[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "what are some more sanely design"> Microkernels like seL4, RedoxOS, Zircon
20:53:51 <TheJollyRoger> Jokes aside, I am eager to see what these can do.
20:54:20 <EssentialChaos[m> <TheJollyRoger "Jokes aside, I am eager to see w"> You can look into Genode, I think, their Sculpt OS uses an L4 kernel by default
20:54:28 <strcat[m]> and btw
20:54:36 <strcat[m]> the linux kernel intentionally heavily relies on undefined behavior
20:54:38 <strcat[m]> all over
20:54:51 <strcat[m]> it's heavily designed around using undefined behavior even in cases where compilers break it
20:54:55 * TheJollyRoger goes as pale as putty.
20:54:56 <strcat[m]> and they just blame compiler devs
20:54:57 <TheJollyRoger> ...oh god.
20:54:59 <strcat[m]> but fact is it's broken
20:55:18 <strcat[m]> you can see some of this in https://lwn.net/Articles/262464/
20:55:21 <strcat[m]> but there's a lot
20:55:26 <strcat[m]> the linux kernel invented their own memory model and refuses to use the C11 memory model
20:55:33 <strcat[m]> but the compiler does not respect their alternate reality
20:55:41 <strcat[m]> they want things to be a certain way
20:55:43 <TheJollyRoger> Wait wait so they make no effort to even try to mitigate an exploit? They just push all that responsibility onto the compiler?
20:55:44 <strcat[m]> and they pretend they are
20:55:56 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: I'm saying they made an alternate reality
20:56:00 <strcat[m]> of how they want the C standard to be
20:56:02 <strcat[m]> they invented their own memory model
20:56:07 <strcat[m]> they started documenting it
20:56:11 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "the linux kernel invented their "> Wait, does C get new standards still?
20:56:16 <strcat[m]> neither GCC or Clang implements their version of the C standard
20:56:17 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: yes
20:56:22 * TheJollyRoger goes as pale as putty.
20:56:24 <strcat[m]> C11 made a formal memory model with atomics
20:56:37 <strcat[m]> Linux instead invented their own memory model based on all the weird / sketchy undefined stuff they do
20:56:44 <strcat[m]> and compilers do not support it
20:56:50 <strcat[m]> but they use it nonetheless
20:56:56 <strcat[m]> so it's all undefined, super dangerous stuff
20:57:11 <strcat[m]> lot of workarounds and hacks to avoid compilers breaking the code and causing serious disasters
20:57:15 <EssentialChaos[m> How do they even compile the kernel?
20:57:17 <strcat[m]> but compilers are ALLOWED to break it
20:57:19 <strcat[m]> per the standard
20:57:28 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: it's a real mess and tons of hacks are needed
20:57:38 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: that's why it was so painful to get clang support and keep it working
20:57:49 <strcat[m]> also a decent number of kernel devs hate security
20:57:50 <strcat[m]> and some hate clang
20:57:53 <strcat[m]> and they intentionally break it
20:57:54 <strcat[m]> with glee
20:58:02 <EssentialChaos[m> I should go, check out LFS book once again
20:58:26 <strcat[m]> linux literally has core devs thinking of ways to break security shit
20:58:31 <strcat[m]> and stuff like clang support
20:58:32 <strcat[m]> and gleefully doing it
20:58:33 <strcat[m]> it's fucked
20:58:45 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "with glee"> I'm just imaging some kernel developer giggling as he manages to get a patch merged that is secretly backdoored to break Clang
20:58:45 <strcat[m]> maybe it's currently possible to compile x86 linux with clang
20:58:47 <strcat[m]> but believe me
20:58:50 <strcat[m]> they are working on breaking it
20:58:59 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
20:59:06 <strcat[m]> they have broken it over and over
20:59:07 <strcat[m]> on purpose
20:59:23 <EssentialChaos[m> It's the FSF spies! /s
20:59:24 <strcat[m]> sometimes they don't like how compilers do stuff so they break something on purpose to try to force their hand
20:59:40 <strcat[m]> they have a similar more mutual relationship with systemd/udev
20:59:46 <strcat[m]> where they mutually despise each other
20:59:46 <EssentialChaos[m> <madaidan[m] "I'm just imaging some kernel dev"> Imagine Stallman in that place
20:59:49 <strcat[m]> and fuck each other over
21:00:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> > * <@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org> starts drowning his sorrows.
21:00:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> at this point, isn't it healthier to find alternatives to support?
21:00:48 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "and fuck each other over"> OSS is a free-for-all
21:01:18 <strcat[m]> yeah but they fuck over the OS they work on
21:01:18 <EssentialChaos[m> strcat: Btw, what OS do you use? Certainly Linux(?) for development, but otherwise as a daily driver?
21:01:19 <strcat[m]> purposely
21:01:28 <strcat[m]> they purposely make it worse
21:01:32 <strcat[m]> and screw up what other people are doing
21:01:36 <strcat[m]> you have no idea how fucked it all is
21:01:55 <strcat[m]> there is this political / warfare game between projects like GCC and linux
21:01:58 <strcat[m]> and systemd and linux
21:02:09 <strcat[m]> they act like enemies
21:02:47 <tronss> So, if mostly internet works with Linux... we are all...
21:03:11 <madaidan[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "strcat: Btw, what OS do you use?"> I think he said he uses a bunch of different Linux distros, QubesOS and Windows
21:03:12 <nickcalyx[m]> You must say GNU/Linux !
21:03:12 <strcat[m]> http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1510.3/02866.html
21:03:17 <cyredanthem[m]> > strcat: Btw, what OS do you use? Certainly Linux(?) for development, but otherwise as a daily driver?
21:03:17 <cyredanthem[m]> Everything is pretty bad right now I wouldn't recommend anything if I was him.
21:03:25 <EssentialChaos[m> This is some fanfiction-worthy stuff
21:03:28 <strcat[m]> look at this http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1510.3/02866.html
21:03:40 <strcat[m]> so
21:03:47 <strcat[m]> GCC and LLVM provide an API like this:
21:03:48 * EssentialChaos[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/bRrYoMGMvOTfnuvpWutzXELc >
21:03:55 <strcat[m]> add_overflow(a, b, &output)
21:04:02 <strcat[m]> which returns a bool saying if it overflowed
21:04:17 <strcat[m]> this allows you to really easily check for multiplication overflow, signed overflow, etc. in an efficient and correct way
21:04:26 <strcat[m]> it also lets you do well-defined signed overflow as a compiler extension
21:04:34 <cyredanthem[m]> EssentialChaos: anything he says will be taken as such considering the nature of things is my take
21:04:36 <strcat[m]> the linux kernel just has signed overflows everywhere and no one knows which are intentional really
21:04:44 <EssentialChaos[m> Fair enough
21:04:52 <strcat[m]> and they pass -fwrapv / -fno-strict-overflow to turn off it being undefined
21:05:03 <strcat[m]> anyways
21:05:09 <strcat[m]> read http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1510.3/02866.html
21:05:19 <strcat[m]> linus getting super pissed about adding functions for checking for overflow
21:05:24 <strcat[m]> he rarely looks deep into what he merges
21:05:35 <strcat[m]> he loves picking some superficial thing and getting pissed about it and blocking code
21:05:43 <madaidan[m]> Btw strcat did you see the message I sent yesterday about linux-hardened?
21:05:49 <strcat[m]> mostly he merges tons and tons of code and he obviously doesn't review most
21:05:54 <madaidan[m]> I went through every git tag and couldn't find anything missing
21:06:01 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it's not all there
21:06:12 <strcat[m]> there's earlier code including the Android kernels
21:06:16 <strcat[m]> I ported it forward to linux-hardened
21:06:18 <strcat[m]> from the Android kernels
21:06:19 <madaidan[m]> I spent like an hour manually going through each one
21:06:26 <madaidan[m]> It's ingrained into my mind at this point
21:06:32 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: keep in mind we originally used PaX
21:06:39 <strcat[m]> and it went downhill from there
21:06:52 <strcat[m]> and each version I ported less stuff
21:07:15 <madaidan[m]> So I should port Android and PaX changes?
21:07:40 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: there's PaX and there's a bunch of downstream Android stuff including CFI and ShadowCallStack
21:07:46 <xxblitzxx> Asking for a friend...been fortunate, about to start a third (maybe fourth degree), in something that would help with Graphene and the like.
21:08:00 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: linux-hardened repo was my partial port of what remained for like... nexus 5x/6p I guess?
21:08:07 <strcat[m]> I ported forward to a newer mainline branch
21:08:31 <strcat[m]> and I didn't keep all the branches/tags in linux-hardened
21:08:34 <strcat[m]> cause it was remade
21:08:35 <xxblitzxx> Going to enroll in some classes.... Computer Science? or Software Development and Security?
21:08:47 <madaidan[m]> I don't think I'd be able to port CFI/SCS. Sounds too complex and the KSPP is doing that anyway. I might look through PaX for stuff.
21:08:58 <strcat[m]> xxblitzxx: comsci probably
21:09:12 <strcat[m]> I doubt they teach anything useful about software engineering or security in schools
21:09:12 <madaidan[m]> Does Android do any other notable hardening?
21:09:25 <strcat[m]> at least there are decent computer science courses
21:09:39 <strcat[m]> and you just need to teach yourself to program
21:09:49 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: yes and Qualcomm does
21:09:56 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: qualcomm upstreamed some stuff
21:09:57 <strcat[m]> not all
21:10:19 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: like the Pixel 2 kernel had that hypervisor-based kernel code protection... which we could re-enable if we disable an optimization they enabled which forced it off
21:10:25 <strcat[m]> but... it doesn't exist after that
21:10:29 <strcat[m]> so I don't really care
21:10:49 <xxblitzxx> strcat: that's what I was thinking as well... seems that everything else is "putting the cart before the horse".
21:11:09 <xxblitzxx> Thanks for the input, and the project. You guys are great
21:12:13 <strcat[m]> xxblitzxx: computer science is likely to teach you stuff you wouldn't otherwise learn - if it's a real computer science program at least
21:12:25 <strcat[m]> which is basically largely math and often part of the math department
21:12:39 <strcat[m]> and a good portion of courses to get a CS degree (a real one) are math
21:12:40 <xxblitzxx> Looking at university of Maryland
21:12:42 <TheJollyRoger> Woah.
21:12:51 <strcat[m]> you can easily do major in CS minor in math if it's a real CS program
21:12:54 <zaxxa[m]> Yes you need mathematical thinking
21:12:54 <strcat[m]> without really doing any extra courses
21:12:57 <strcat[m]> it's natural to do that
21:13:05 <zaxxa[m]> Logic, discrete maths etc
21:13:19 <strcat[m]> cause you need a ton of math courses anyway and can set it up so you get a degree in it
21:13:25 <strcat[m]> you could even do some extra work and get 2 degrees out of it
21:13:30 <strcat[m]> if you really wanted
21:13:42 <strcat[m]> I personally just taught myself all that stuff
21:13:45 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: yes and Qualcomm does"> How do I differ between upstream and Google/Qualcomm commits? I don't think they do fancy rebasing like linux-hardened. Or am I meant to just create a diff?
21:13:58 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: yeah they don't rebase so...
21:14:04 <strcat[m]> it's this huge history with merge commits
21:14:04 <strcat[m]> gl
21:14:11 <strcat[m]> it's hard to tell what is theirs
21:14:21 <strcat[m]> and it's NOT set up to take something and upstream it
21:14:24 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "gl"> Lol. Thanks.
21:14:26 <xxblitzxx> Well I'm certainly not at the ability level to self teach. But I have the means to get bak into class... again. SO here we go!
21:14:30 <strcat[m]> madaidan.:  on the positive side they have to redo it for each LTS branch
21:14:32 <xxblitzxx> Thanks again for the insight.
21:14:37 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: so it's not an enormously long history
21:14:45 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: and they clean it up a lot when migrating, sometimes
21:14:59 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: but yeah sometimes a feature is spread out over like 50 commits with lots of fixes etc
21:15:05 <strcat[m]> weird merges and conflict fixes
21:15:15 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they backport a ton of upstream features / performance improvements
21:15:19 <strcat[m]> including whole subsystems sometimes
21:15:35 <strcat[m]> I find it really hard to work with that kind of merge hell
21:15:37 <strcat[m]> I need to cleanly rebased
21:15:52 <madaidan[m]> It'd probably be best to just create a massive diff of their sources and mainline then
21:15:56 <strcat[m]> screw having a stable history. I need to be able to review and improve it and actually understand what we have done
21:16:22 <strcat[m]> and how would we port to each new ver
21:16:22 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "I need to cleanly rebased"> Yeah, I love that. It looks so good and is easy to review.
21:16:26 <strcat[m]> if it was some long history of merges
21:16:45 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I regularly rebase it, reorder stuff, split commits apart into different pieces, merge ones that make no sense separately
21:16:53 <strcat[m]> I have it so each commit builds and passes tests
21:17:06 <strcat[m]> and I try to avoid having them depend on each other
21:17:08 <strcat[m]> if 2 different things depend on common infrastructure
21:17:12 <strcat[m]> I try to split that out into a 3rd commit
21:17:19 <strcat[m]> so you can take just that and 1 other
21:17:30 <strcat[m]> it's bad to have like secondary stack ASLR commit depend on library region isolation commit
21:17:48 <strcat[m]> I put a lot of work into making it cleanly rebased / sensible
21:18:00 <strcat[m]> I tend to leave stuff as separate commits for a while then after a month or two it has ended up in various tags and I rebase it into sensible patches
21:18:28 <strcat[m]> so atm in https://github.com/GrapheneOS/kernel_google_crosshatch/commits/10 there are various commits changing build.sh
21:18:39 <strcat[m]> but that'll get rebased in where it doesn't make sense as a separate commit
21:19:02 <strcat[m]> cause for anyone reviewing it as a set of patches it's irrelevant that it didn't used to use clang as HOSTCC, etc.
21:19:10 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: anyways that's how forks of upstream repos are maintained
21:19:17 <strcat[m]> for our own projects we have a stable history
21:19:40 <strcat[m]> cause forks of upstream repos are based on stable tags not a dev branch
21:20:04 <strcat[m]> the branch it is based on changes... it gets rebased onto a new version without a bunch of the previous upstream history (i.e. that stable branch)
21:20:12 <strcat[m]> it just doesn't make sense to not rebase it
21:20:34 <strcat[m]> need to treat forks of upstream repos as exactly that, forks, where a cleanly rebased patch set is maintained and pieces can be upstreamed from the commits
21:20:38 <strcat[m]> and reviewed as a patch set
21:20:58 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: anyway merge commits are horrible I prefer the approach of never having merges - you'll see I don't use merges in our own projects
21:21:07 <strcat[m]> linear history + anything that lands must land as a cleanly applied patch set
21:21:13 <strcat[m]> and ideally every single commit builds and passes tests
21:21:26 <strcat[m]> so you can properly bisect
21:21:27 <strcat[m]> among other things
21:21:37 <strcat[m]> non-linear history is so horrible
21:21:43 <strcat[m]> using git as svn makes a hell of a lot more sense, lol.
21:22:05 <strcat[m]> git is distributed but I don't want the upstream history to reflect that
21:22:17 <strcat[m]> i.e. rebase patch sets before they land
21:22:22 <strcat[m]> give them a sensible, useful history
21:22:28 <strcat[m]> and then land it
21:22:51 <strcat[m]> and the upstream branch is a linear, always building / always working history that makes sense
21:23:28 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I really hate non-linear history, it's hell working with that
21:23:31 <strcat[m]> git is stupid
21:23:53 <madaidan[m]> I agree
21:24:03 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: OpenBSD literally still uses CVS (their own version of it) because it's just a saner workflow than what git encourages
21:24:09 <strcat[m]> I don't think it's good that they do that
21:24:13 <strcat[m]> because CVS is shit software
21:24:27 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: OpenBSD literally sti"> Don't they have git mirrors?
21:24:37 <strcat[m]> but the development model of linear history + applying patch sets cleanly to that is so much better
21:24:50 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: yeah but they don't use that and they kinda view you as crazy if you do I think
21:24:58 <mrxx_0[m]> strcat: Back on my OOM kill when building the kernel, adding more swap memory totally fix the problem
21:25:33 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: yeah but they don't u"> I can't stand anything other than git
21:26:29 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I don't mind git when using it with linear history
21:26:34 <strcat[m]> no merge commits ever
21:26:41 <strcat[m]> it's good at that workflow
21:26:56 <strcat[m]> every pull request needs to be rebased onto the development branch before merging
21:27:05 <strcat[m]> never have merge commits solving merge conflicts
21:27:34 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it's SOOOO horrible having non-linear history where there are 2 branches or more being merged and this totally inscrutable merge commit fixing conflicts
21:28:01 <strcat[m]> I don't want to see conflict resolutions, I want to see a clean set of patches built to be applied on top of the existing history
21:28:13 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: also all these downstreams doing merges...
21:28:30 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: you could merge upstream every day and have a daily merge commit with conflicts resolved
21:28:34 <strcat[m]> sigh
21:29:20 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: the ideal model for an upstream project is having linear history + everything has to rebased onto that before merging via fast-forward, no merge commits ever
21:29:37 <strcat[m]> but it doesn't scale to linux kernel scale at all
21:29:51 <strcat[m]> linux kernel scale uses non-linear history to give the illusion that the development system has scaled
21:30:00 <strcat[m]> it is just a big fantasy
21:30:10 <strcat[m]> the fantasy that there is code review and understanding
21:30:17 <strcat[m]> they developed tools to basically live in a fantasy world
21:30:41 <strcat[m]> so each maintainer submits a tree to linus to merge
21:30:57 <strcat[m]> linus haphazardly goes through all this shit solving merge conflicts
21:30:58 <strcat[m]> you end up with something that sort of maybe works sometimes
21:31:02 <strcat[m]> and each maintainer has downstreams they merge too
21:31:05 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "the fantasy that there is code r"> The only time they seem to "review" code is when it's security features they're rejecting for no reason
21:31:07 <strcat[m]> and those downstreams merge upstream
21:31:11 <strcat[m]> it's incomprehensible
21:31:20 <strcat[m]> try looking through the history and understanding it
21:31:39 <strcat[m]> you can try using a GUI tool that makes a graph
21:31:46 <strcat[m]> it still doesn't make sense
21:32:00 <strcat[m]> and there are all these decisions hidden in merge commits by people who weren't involved in making the code
21:32:04 <strcat[m]> from conflicts
21:32:14 <strcat[m]> not all conflicts get detected ofc just changes touching same lines of code...
21:32:26 <strcat[m]> you can ofc have conflicts where like an API changed in semantics/signature
21:32:30 <EssentialChaos[m> Btw, is it possible to build Graphene in WSL?
21:32:34 <strcat[m]> git isn't going to give you a conflict for that it just breaks
21:32:43 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: in WSL2 I'm sure it works
21:32:53 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: afaik wsl2 is just linux in a hyper-v VM
21:32:59 <strcat[m]> no clue if it works on WSL1
21:33:12 <strcat[m]> it might although the build system makes a build sandbox with namespaces...
21:33:18 <strcat[m]> it's the kind of thing that might break
21:34:00 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: and btw the way a lot of stuff works
21:34:13 <strcat[m]> they change an API and do a massive search and replace / haphazard update across drivers
21:34:19 <strcat[m]> this happens very frequently
21:34:35 <strcat[m]> the APIs change massively between each branch
21:34:45 <strcat[m]> and it's not like this is tested by the people who do it
21:34:55 <strcat[m]> if you upstream a driver it starts being changed constantly by tons of people not testing it
21:35:02 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't actually work a lot of the time
21:35:07 <strcat[m]> it just builds - maybe, if it's enabled in the normal configs
21:35:09 * tronss is amazed
21:35:22 <strcat[m]> the upstreamed drivers constantly break
21:35:25 <strcat[m]> you may have noticed
21:35:36 <strcat[m]> linux kernel always has tons of hardware-specific regressions
21:35:42 <strcat[m]> suspend breaks, audio breaks, GPU stuff breaks
21:35:54 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "they change an API and do a mass"> I'd be too paranoid that I'd replace something I shouldn't have to do that
21:35:55 <strcat[m]> imagine trying to use mainline kernels on a production device where you don't just stick with an LTS
21:36:07 <strcat[m]> and have random people changing your drivers who don't test it cause they don't have the hw
21:36:15 <strcat[m]> and there are no test bots or anything testing it either
21:36:21 <strcat[m]> sometimes
21:36:26 <strcat[m]> whole architectures break for weeks or months
21:36:32 <strcat[m]> major drivers can break for months
21:36:39 <strcat[m]> sometimes things break for YEARS because it takes years for stuff to get into debian / rhel
21:36:45 <strcat[m]> so the people using it have no idea it broke for literally years
21:37:00 <strcat[m]> and then have to figure out when it broke and deal with that
21:37:04 <zaxxa[m]> Why do developers use Linux based systems for development work with all these issues with Linux?
21:37:14 <EssentialChaos[m> I once had a kernel break Intel wifi, 5.2 I think
21:37:17 <strcat[m]> if you've used linux a lot like I have
21:37:21 <strcat[m]> in a rolling release distro
21:37:31 <strcat[m]> you are aware it has constant regressions
21:37:32 <strcat[m]> specific to hardware usually
21:37:34 <strcat[m]> often NEVER fixed
21:37:37 <strcat[m]> it just breaks and is never fixed
21:37:47 <strcat[m]> atm I don't have audio via HDMI anymore
21:37:47 <EssentialChaos[m> <zaxxa[m] "Why do developers use Linux base"> Because of the terminal and speed
21:38:12 <strcat[m]> people who don't use a rolling release are insulated from the churn / breakage in the kernel
21:38:17 <strcat[m]> instead
21:38:19 <strcat[m]> they try updating to new major release and it's broken
21:38:23 <strcat[m]> and they are never going to figure out why
21:38:54 <strcat[m]> but if you actually use each new 'stable' release of linux
21:39:03 <strcat[m]> you experience the endless regressions from the churn and lack of testing
21:39:12 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "and have random people changing "> Reminds me of https://nitter.net/dvyukov/status/1219681450406051841
21:39:12 <strcat[m]> they don't even really test shit at all
21:39:12 <Shippwrecked[m]> <zaxxa[m] "Why do developers use Linux base"> Historically it has had far better dev workflow than windows and you can easily run it on any hardware unlike macOS
21:39:19 <strcat[m]> they don't like unit tests or integration tests
21:39:40 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "I once had a kernel break Intel "> Good thing Manjaro maintains several kernels and has a utility to easily switch between them
21:39:41 <strcat[m]> the people writing most tests are outsiders
21:39:42 <strcat[m]> the tests are mostly separate projects
21:39:50 <strcat[m]> the tests are these separate projects like the linux-test-project or w/e
21:39:58 <strcat[m]> gl landing tests upstream
21:40:02 <strcat[m]> if you do they will break and no one cares anyways
21:40:15 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: yeah well tons of stuff is developed that is never even used
21:40:32 <strcat[m]> and most changes to drivers etc.  end up being by people who don't have the hw and can't test
21:40:51 <strcat[m]> they are just mass search-and-replacing and/or manually editing code to deal with API changes etc.
21:40:56 <strcat[m]> when you do an API change you are responsible for updating all the code across the whole kernel
21:40:57 <strcat[m]> all the drivers
21:41:17 <strcat[m]> the people who actually made and use those drivers prob don't test or use them from mainline
21:41:22 <strcat[m]> so it's not noticed it broke
21:41:34 <strcat[m]> it's hard to put into words how fucking insane the whole thing is
21:41:49 <strcat[m]> this stuff is all in 1 address space
21:42:01 <strcat[m]> no security boundaries
21:42:03 <strcat[m]> no real modularity
21:42:04 <EssentialChaos[m> Aren't there supposed to be maintainers for those drivers?
21:42:04 <zaxxa[m]> EssentialChaos: /dev/null I see thanks
21:42:05 <strcat[m]> linux kernel modules are just dynamic code loading - there is no boundary/isolation between them
21:42:09 <strcat[m]> each one has full access to everything
21:42:21 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: sure but that doesn't mean they actually use mainline kernels
21:42:32 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: most people use LTS kernels
21:42:33 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "it's hard to put into words how "> We need a new word to describe it.
21:42:49 <madaidan[m]> Linuxish
21:42:49 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: upstreaming code == porting from your code in the LTS tree you use to linux-next or some other tree
21:43:01 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: and it lands upstream from there, sometimes it NEVER worked in master
21:43:15 <strcat[m]> it lands broken
21:43:16 <strcat[m]> all it does is reduce the diff you have downstream, eventually
21:43:18 <strcat[m]> when your LTS ends up having this
21:43:29 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: it's a mistaken belief that people actually just use linus' linux
21:43:32 <strcat[m]> ppl don't use that shit lol
21:43:43 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "linux kernel modules are just dy"> I remember some guy tried to tell me Linux is a microkernel because it has kernel modules
21:43:45 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: also linux used to have actual 'stable releases'
21:43:57 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: they did away with that whole thing
21:44:00 <madaidan[m]> It doesn't make sense at all
21:44:02 <strcat[m]> they just renamed the release candidate / dev branch stuff to stable releases
21:44:19 <Shippwrecked[m]> <zaxxa[m] "EssentialChaos: /dev/null I see "> It may no longer be true with WSL
21:44:27 <EssentialChaos[m> Wow, I feel like I don't want to deal with Linux ever again...
21:44:36 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: so basically there's this concept of mainline
21:44:37 <Shippwrecked[m]> WSL may offer an equal dev environment on windows but I haven't used it much
21:44:40 <strcat[m]> that's like
21:44:41 <strcat[m]> 4.1
21:44:42 <strcat[m]> 4.2
21:44:56 <strcat[m]> 4.3
21:44:57 <madaidan[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Wow, I feel like I don't want to"> Wait til you hear about syzkaller's findings
21:44:57 <strcat[m]> 4.1.1 is not mainline
21:45:01 <EssentialChaos[m> <Shippwrecked[m] "It may no longer be true with WS"> And their 3-in-1 terminal
21:45:03 <strcat[m]> that is a downstream fork by stable / LTS branch maintainers not linus' linux
21:45:11 <EssentialChaos[m> <madaidan[m] "Wait til you hear about syzkalle"> I heard
21:45:17 <strcat[m]> they haphazardly backport shit they don't understand
21:45:23 <strcat[m]> and fix conflicts haphazardly
21:45:44 <strcat[m]> they basically scan through the commits for stuff marked as being a good idea for stable to backport
21:45:45 <strcat[m]> or stuff that looks like an important fix
21:45:46 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "I heard"> I even watched the beginning of the video you once linked about it
21:45:50 <strcat[m]> and they backport a lot of that stuff arbitrarily
21:45:58 <strcat[m]> it's really arbitrary and incomplete
21:46:04 <strcat[m]> so that makes the kernel.org stable/LTS forks
21:46:12 <strcat[m]> haphazard mass backporting
21:46:15 <strcat[m]> semi-automated
21:46:23 <strcat[m]> very little understanding of what is being changed, near zero testing
21:46:30 <strcat[m]> especially for anything hardware specific
21:46:40 <strcat[m]> lots of haphzard changes that break stuff or change meaning
21:46:41 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "I even watched the beginning of "> But bugs are one thing, this "development-flow" is another
21:46:43 <strcat[m]> anyways
21:46:58 <strcat[m]> now a distro takes this stable/LTS fork - in the best case, sometimes they just go on their own
21:47:07 <strcat[m]> they fork that into their own thing
21:47:08 <madaidan[m]> I've seen spender criticise upstream's idiotic backporting a lot
21:47:09 <strcat[m]> do whatever weird stuff they do
21:47:12 <strcat[m]> if it's debian they like just freezing stuff
21:47:19 <strcat[m]> and not taking more upstream stable changes
21:47:49 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: yeah but it's not like grsecurity can fix this just backport even more and do a better job
21:48:05 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: and catch some mistakes and fix those
21:48:23 <cn3m[m]> imagine Graphene rebased Fuchsia that would be pretty off the walls security wise
21:48:27 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: and they have a bad relationship with upstream so they rarely ever say something is wrong and when they do it's often unhelpful
21:48:33 <strcat[m]> don't blame them tho
21:48:57 <strcat[m]> it's a mix of upstream's fault and theirs that stuff ended up how it did
21:49:01 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: yeah but it's not lik"> I've heard good things about grsec's backporting
21:49:15 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they do a good job it's just not a problem in the scale they can fix at all
21:49:28 <strcat[m]> and they are not perfect either
21:49:56 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: and they have a bad r"> Spender links broken commits on twitter a lot.
21:50:12 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: yeah but usually to gloat they fixed it 2 years ago or w/e
21:50:39 <strcat[m]> he likes posting a hash after fixing it
21:50:45 <strcat[m]> then much later reveal what they fixed
21:50:55 <strcat[m]> or after discovering some huge problem upstream
21:51:04 <madaidan[m]> I see a lot of security researchers do that
21:51:20 <strcat[m]> anyways linux is totally fucked
21:51:24 <strcat[m]> in many ways
21:51:34 <strcat[m]> also the upstreaming process for drivers doesn't really work
21:51:37 <strcat[m]> companies try really hard to land stuff upstream
21:51:48 <strcat[m]> it takes a year after the hardware is released
21:51:58 <strcat[m]> so it's just not possible to use mainline kernels for newly launched hardware esp. since everyone in reality uses LTS branches of kernels
21:52:04 <strcat[m]> except some Arch users basically
21:52:11 <strcat[m]> and if you're smart you use the LTS kernel on Arch
21:52:18 <strcat[m]> so you never have to deal with shit constantly breaking
21:52:24 <strcat[m]> cause it's 99% the kernel having regressions
21:52:32 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows about what happened with amdgpu.
21:52:44 <TheJollyRoger> I just found that out the hard way :(
21:52:55 <strcat[m]> hardware vendor makes a driver and tries to do things right landing it upstream
21:53:07 <strcat[m]> ends up taking a year or two AFTER hardware launch to get it fully upstream lol
21:53:15 <strcat[m]> then another year for that to be in the LATEST LTS branch
21:53:15 <zaxxa[m]> Lol
21:53:29 <strcat[m]> and then probably 2 more years to get into debian
21:53:36 <strcat[m]> well to be fair maybe 1 year lol
21:53:46 <cn3m[m]> is the long term plan to harden Fuchsia?
21:53:52 <strcat[m]> I don't know
21:54:22 <strcat[m]> not particularly attached to anything
21:54:30 <strcat[m]> the value is mostly research / knowledge especially if there is android app compatibility and all that goes away is the linux kernel
21:54:39 <strcat[m]> and there's just a new kernel with android/linux compat layer
21:54:48 <strcat[m]> I can't imagine they could throw away android apps they even use them on chromeos
21:54:58 <strcat[m]> chromeos is an android distro
21:55:00 <strcat[m]> it qualifies as one
21:55:04 <TheJollyRoger> One of these days, I'm going to have to get one of those model skeletons, put my coat and pirate hat on it, put it at my computer, and then take a picture, and caption it, "When you wait for Debian to be updated..."
21:55:10 <strcat[m]> it ships the entirety of AOSP inside itself
21:55:15 <strcat[m]> it is just bigger AOSP
21:55:16 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "and if you're smart you use the "> I've never used LTS on Arch
21:55:29 <madaidan[m]> I've never had a single issue
21:55:35 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "I can't imagine they could throw"> Could they pull an Apple and just say that the developers should deal with it?
21:55:41 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it's a good idea to use linux-lts and when I maintained linus-hardened I maintained lts branch
21:55:48 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: never had hardware regressions?
21:55:50 <strcat[m]> especially stuff like suspend
21:56:17 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "Could they pull an Apple and jus"> I mean, Android has a rather big market share
21:56:17 <strcat[m]> I guess if you have a really common laptop it's much less of an issue
21:56:23 <cyredanthem[m]> > chromeos is an android distro
21:56:23 <cyredanthem[m]> That's fascinating
21:56:31 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: never had hardware re"> Nope.
21:56:43 <strcat[m]> chromeos has a whole android userspace in a container and proxies stuff out to chromeos infrastructure
21:56:44 <EssentialChaos[m> <madaidan[m] "I've never had a single issue"> I've had, on Manjaro, but the problem was on Arch too
21:56:48 <madaidan[m]> I must just be lucky
21:56:58 <madaidan[m]> I've had more issues on Debian
21:56:59 <strcat[m]> the android container largely just does stuff directly other than graphics, audio, etc. that gets proxied out
21:57:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Samsung could try to replace Google if Google pulled a Fuchsia
21:57:11 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: well you will have more issues on debian for sure
21:57:13 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it's broken as hell
21:57:17 <strcat[m]> but it's the same broken for a long time
21:57:19 <strcat[m]> that's the difference
21:57:28 <madaidan[m]> Fair
21:57:36 <strcat[m]> cause the older software is way worse, way more buggy, missing tons of hardware support
21:57:44 <strcat[m]> plus they love to fuck it up with their insane downstream patching / changes
21:57:53 <strcat[m]> adding their whole own configuration frameworks and distro quirks to everything
21:57:54 <strcat[m]> got to love it
21:57:54 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "Samsung could try to replace Goo"> They don't have a viable alternative, though, do they?
21:58:15 <madaidan[m]> I still don't get why they decided to disable YAMA by default with a patch
21:58:25 <strcat[m]> like apache, nginx, postfix, etc. on debian have all this weird debian shit
21:58:34 <strcat[m]> a2enmod, sites-enabled, all this weird stuff
21:58:43 <strcat[m]> tons and tons of patches to the code and totally new configuration frameworks and stuff
21:58:51 <strcat[m]> all these weird, ignorant changes to stuff with weird as hell comments in the configs
21:58:57 <strcat[m]> really bothers me dealing with it
21:59:05 <strcat[m]> open up this config and see this totally ignorant nonsense where they break security
21:59:45 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "They don't have a viable alterna"> I mean, they have some OS, but it's like Huawei's Harmony: It's kinda there and we've made a TV with it (or, in Samsung's case, a smart watch iirc)
21:59:49 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: you can report a debian bug just reporting some gripe with software and the maintainer might make their own patch 'fixing' it
21:59:54 <strcat[m]> they do some really weird stuff
21:59:57 <cdesai> Huh, sites-enabled is debian?
22:00:05 <strcat[m]> cdesai: yeah that's a debianism
22:00:07 <strcat[m]> not upstream
22:00:13 <cdesai> TIL
22:00:14 <cyredanthem[m]> Frankly speaking what's the drawback of a Chromebook?
22:00:23 <strcat[m]> cdesai: I am just using apache as an example - all that stuff like sites-enabled, mods-enabled, a2enmod and so on is debian
22:00:30 <strcat[m]> cdesai: they patch tons of stuff into everything
22:00:34 <cdesai> Yeah I'm aware
22:00:36 <TheJollyRoger> cyredanthem[m]: the loss of nerd credit!
22:00:41 <strcat[m]> cdesai: they patch nginx less so it's less fucked up in debian
22:00:47 <TheJollyRoger> Can't forget, gotta have that nerd credit :D
22:00:50 <strcat[m]> cdesai: but they added sites-enabled and some weird scripts
22:00:50 <cyredanthem[m]> Haha true
22:00:51 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: you can report a debi"> Make a patch to patch their patches
22:00:53 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "Frankly speaking what's the draw"> Privacy
22:01:06 <strcat[m]> cdesai: if you use debian you're used to a lot of weird debian things
22:01:14 <cdesai> Tbh I like sites-enabled set it up on arch too.
22:01:15 <strcat[m]> cdesai: which you prob think is upstream software stuff
22:01:19 <cyredanthem[m]> I got a MacOS I'm low man on the reputation totempole
22:01:32 <zaxxa[m]> Lol
22:01:36 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
22:01:36 <strcat[m]> cdesai: on debian you're supposed to put your configs into sites-available
22:01:46 <strcat[m]> sites-available is only supposed to be ../sites-available symlinks
22:01:47 <cdesai> Yeah I know I meant both of them
22:01:48 <zaxxa[m]> I have windows home, can't beat that
22:02:03 <madaidan[m]> Does ChromeOS have any interesting kernel hardening patches?
22:02:05 <strcat[m]> cdesai: yeah I don't like that stuff and they add a ton of bad default configs and stuff
22:02:09 <cdesai> Just didn't click it was a debianism at the time.
22:02:10 <TheJollyRoger> cyredanthem[m]: don't worry, I got an old PDP-11 shell and backplane you can put it into :D. Nobody will notice!
22:02:13 <strcat[m]> cdesai: making it modular sure
22:02:20 <cdesai> But yeah I see your point
22:02:35 <strcat[m]> cdesai: with upstream config there's just nginx.conf and some split configs you split stuff out as you wish
22:02:41 <strcat[m]> if you want per-site files, great, do that
22:02:49 <strcat[m]> but it doesn't give you this big config framework with scripts
22:03:06 <strcat[m]> cdesai: debian also loves splitting up packages and making assorted versions of them and using the alternatives infra and stuff
22:03:13 <strcat[m]> cdesai: -dev packages are a debian-ism
22:03:18 <limitless0[m]> "Firefox is insecure" - Refuted
22:03:18 <limitless0[m]> https://reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/gokcis/firefox_is_insecure_refuted/frhq4gv?context=3
22:03:21 <strcat[m]> cdesai: on a normal distro you get headers in the normal library package
22:03:40 <strcat[m]> if you install libwhatever you have what you need to build code using it
22:03:45 <strcat[m]> and you have the docs / man pages
22:03:49 <strcat[m]> it's not split into 3 packages or more
22:04:06 <strcat[m]> cdesai: debian also splits up stuff like python so you only get a fraction of the stdlib and need to install a bunch more packages for stuff
22:04:09 <strcat[m]> just how they do things
22:04:17 <strcat[m]> they patch stuff like python a ton to make it more debianized
22:04:32 <cdesai> I get your point
22:04:34 <strcat[m]> a lot of this stuff is super broken
22:04:56 <EssentialChaos[m> Fedora also has `-devel`
22:04:57 <strcat[m]> and the devs upstream hate it - they've got tons of people using 2 year old versions of their software patched to hell with weird default configs
22:05:00 <strcat[m]> and ppl expect support
22:05:26 <strcat[m]> cdesai: so in general ppl don';t support users on debian
22:05:32 <strcat[m]> instead they get support via debian (mostly they don't)
22:05:36 <strcat[m]> and it encourages them to change stuff more
22:05:37 <strcat[m]> shrug
22:06:02 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh.
22:06:02 <strcat[m]> cdesai: a fair bit of stuff is debian specific really, more than you'd think
22:06:23 <strcat[m]> cdesai: one thing you might not realize is there are 5+ implementations of some tools and distros have to pick which one provides it
22:06:26 <strcat[m]> and some roll their own
22:06:31 <cdesai> And then it goes downstream into Ubuntu too, which is a starting point for many
22:06:43 <strcat[m]> cdesai: yeah ubuntu is a fork of debian unstable tho not stable
22:06:58 <strcat[m]> ubuntu forks debian unstable and makes their own 'stable' branch where 'stable' means old
22:07:01 <cdesai> Yeah I sort of followed the bsd and gnu tar discussion
22:07:01 <EssentialChaos[m> What I really don't get with Debian, is why they don't include /sbin into PATH
22:07:14 <strcat[m]> cdesai: it applies to a lot of stuff like passwd
22:07:15 <strcat[m]> there are 4+ implementations
22:07:24 <strcat[m]> cdesai: also stuff like adduser is a debian script
22:07:31 <strcat[m]> a really fucked up weird script I may add
22:07:48 <cdesai> Yeah I think that's the one I knew after using useradd everywhere else.
22:08:00 <strcat[m]> there is not really any well-defined base OS in these distros
22:08:06 <strcat[m]> just what you assemble out of assorted packages/configs
22:08:21 <strcat[m]> and these projects are super fragmented
22:08:39 <madaidan[m]> adduser is so unnecessarily confusing
22:08:40 <strcat[m]> systemd replaces a lot of it with a single non-distro-specific project by a group of people really ill suited to doing that lol
22:08:55 <madaidan[m]> Just call it usercreate or something
22:09:01 <strcat[m]> cdesai: debian has a really, really poor integration of systemd where most stuff uses auto-converted legacy init scripts
22:09:04 <madaidan[m]> Don't flip around already existing commands
22:09:09 <strcat[m]> cdesai: and they changed a ton of stuff in weird ways
22:09:16 <EssentialChaos[m> <madaidan[m] "adduser is so unnecessarily conf"> Is that the one that asks additional questions? I always forget
22:09:32 <strcat[m]> adduser is a debian script that's just fucked up and they encourage you to use it
22:09:35 <strcat[m]> it's not a standard thing
22:09:45 <strcat[m]> but this applies in a lot of cases even to commands named the same thing
22:09:46 <cdesai> Imagine my confusion when I started aosp dev first, saw everything as one base system, and then with distros it was just packages everywhere.
22:10:00 <zaxxa[m]> Same
22:10:19 <strcat[m]> cdesai: there are other distros that work like AOSP
22:10:42 <strcat[m]> CoreOS as an example before Red Hat acquired and killed their competition and ruined it
22:10:54 <EssentialChaos[m> I guess, this is what you get, when you do it "just for fun" (TM)
22:10:57 <strcat[m]> CoreOS was a container OS using update_engine and dm-verity
22:11:16 <strcat[m]> and a very stateless / distributed approach
22:11:30 <strcat[m]> was interesting
22:11:34 <strcat[m]> dead
22:11:35 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "CoreOS was a container OS using "> CLIP OS looks nice
22:11:50 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "CoreOS as an example before Red "> Can't see blood on red
22:12:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Someone should fork ChromiumOS and add a local account
22:12:26 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "Can't see blood on red"> I don't know why, but I just had to say that
22:13:52 <cdesai> There's some chromiumos forks, maybe one of them has those
22:14:07 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "Someone should fork ChromiumOS a"> I am scared of looking at Riot's code, let alone an OS :( (even then I don't have any experience whatsoever)
22:14:11 <cdesai> As a very poor alternative there's guest mode

22:14:33 <cyredanthem[m]> > There's some chromiumos forks, maybe one of them has those

22:14:45 <cyredanthem[m]> Haha that's fair
22:15:02 <cyredanthem[m]> > I don't even know how to actually contribute to open-source projects
22:15:03 <cyredanthem[m]> Fork, edit, pr
22:15:03 <EssentialChaos[m> Apart from forking the repo and then making a pull request
22:15:06 <cdesai> cyredanthem[m]: couldn't find a fork or one with a local account?
22:15:21 <cyredanthem[m]> Local account
22:15:22 <cyredanthem[m]> Or I'd use that
22:15:57 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "I am scared of looking at Riot's"> I had this idea of making a matrix client, that has a layout similar to Discord, so I went on Github expecting html, css and JS files
22:16:26 <cyredanthem[m]> EssentialChaos: thank God no
22:16:27 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "I had this idea of making a matr"> I mean, I knew Electron is a bit more complicated than that, but still
22:17:00 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "EssentialChaos: thank God no"> I wanted to bring communities to the front
22:17:15 <strcat[m]> cdesai: what I like about Arch is that it's very non-existent as a distro, if that makes sense, it packages the upstream software as it was released - the upstream configs, no downstream patches (other than security fixes)
22:17:18 <strcat[m]> cdesai: doesn't package unmaintained/abandoned software much
22:17:32 <strcat[m]> cdesai: so everything is still fucked and insecure but far less fucked and insecure
22:17:44 <cdesai> Yep, 100% agree. I use it on my main system for all those reasons
22:17:49 <strcat[m]> cause you are only dealing with how screwed up stuff is upstream not also having it frozen for ages + massively screwed up downstream
22:17:52 <strcat[m]> and upstream docs / bug tracker is actually viable
22:18:07 <strcat[m]> I don't know what to use on servers atm
22:18:09 <strcat[m]> there is nothing good, in general
22:18:15 <strcat[m]> I need to figure out a least bad approach
22:18:17 <cdesai> Arch wiki is also really good
22:18:45 <strcat[m]> I was an arch wiki admin for several years
22:18:48 <strcat[m]> before being a packager for the official repos too
22:18:52 <EssentialChaos[m> strcat: What do you think of Void?
22:18:57 <strcat[m]> luckily I have retired from all that hell now
22:19:08 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: *shrug* everything I usually say basically applies
22:19:42 <cyredanthem[m]> <strcat[m] "luckily I have retired from all "> I would use literally anything but Linux
22:19:52 <cyredanthem[m]> Wrong quote
22:19:54 <madaidan[m]> I think Void is nice with musl, LibreSSL, runit etc.
22:20:20 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: swimming against the stream tho
22:20:24 <strcat[m]> and also LibreSSL isn't all around better
22:20:52 <strcat[m]> BoringSSL is basically totally rewritten / refactored with totally new APIs and is very, very sane
22:20:57 <strcat[m]> but that means it has no compatibility with existing software
22:21:11 <strcat[m]> and they also don't intend for people to write software using it and then not keep migrating to improved APIs
22:21:29 <strcat[m]> they reserve the right to remove absolutely everything legacy they don't use and fix all the APIs
22:21:34 <strcat[m]> and they do
22:21:39 <strcat[m]> so if you actually want something good
22:21:44 <strcat[m]> you use BoringSSL
22:22:03 <strcat[m]> but you have to commit to dealing with updating it possibly with intervention for API changes
22:22:08 <strcat[m]> and migrating away from legacy shit
22:22:35 <madaidan[m]> Of course BoringSSL is the best but LibreSSL is still better than OpenSSL and retains compatibility
22:22:47 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it partly retains compat
22:23:01 <strcat[m]> but OpenSSL has since gone a different direction and LibreSSL did make some minor backwards incompatible changes
22:23:09 <strcat[m]> the compatibility will drop over time
22:23:30 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: it partly retains com"> I don't need all the legacy cruft they remove if that's what you mean
22:24:11 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they also don't have *new* stuff OpenSSL adds
22:24:39 <EssentialChaos[m> We are talking about Linux a lot, but am I the only one feeling that GNU is a bit of a bad image? At least the religious part of it?
22:24:48 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: they also don't have "> Most things don't use those yet so I don't really need those either
22:25:21 <hypokeimenon[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "We are talking about Linux a lot"> What do you mean?
22:25:40 <madaidan[m]> E.g. most websites don't use TLS 1.3 AFAIK
22:26:16 <EssentialChaos[m> hypokeimenon: They seem almost too fanatical to me.
22:26:42 <EssentialChaos[m> I won't say, that I personally never behaved like that, though
22:27:24 <madaidan[m]> What do you think of NSS?
22:27:51 <madaidan[m]> It looks nice but Mozilla doesn't exactly inspire confidence
22:28:55 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: a lot of websites use TLS 1.3 and HTTP/2
22:29:06 <strcat[m]> debian stable has both even
22:29:17 <strcat[m]> bleeding edge is QUIC (HTTP/3)
22:29:32 <strcat[m]> QUIC is really sweet
22:29:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "I won't say, that I personally n"> I think they're right that software should be free as in freedom, at least.
22:29:51 <strcat[m]> QUIC is a userspace implementation of a stream protocol replacing TCP
22:30:03 <strcat[m]> it has far superior latency and congestion control
22:30:26 <strcat[m]> it has support for zero extra round trips for TLS since it integrates the handshake into the handshake it does
22:30:35 <strcat[m]> supports multiplexing
22:30:46 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "bleeding edge is QUIC (HTTP/3)"> This is a nice argument to use against people ranting about Google's Internet monopoly, because, if I remember correctly, QUIC is from Google
22:30:50 <strcat[m]> it replaces basically all those homegrown UDP protocols for real-time stuff: games, voice, video
22:31:09 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: QUIC is an IETF standard
22:31:09 <madaidan[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "This is a nice argument to use a"> So is SPDY (HTTP/2)
22:31:19 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: they call the original QUIC gQUIC
22:31:27 <strcat[m]> it's a different incompatible thing
22:31:32 <madaidan[m]> If you want to get away from google, you need to get away from computers in general
22:31:56 <strcat[m]> also gQUIC was only for HTTP and originally used a superior encryption protocol than TLS
22:32:22 <strcat[m]> but they dropped that before standardization started
22:32:38 <EssentialChaos[m> <madaidan[m] "So is SPDY (HTTP/2)"> Ikr, imagine how some people would freak out
22:33:17 <strcat[m]> QUIC replaces SCTP including SCTP-over-UDP
22:33:26 <madaidan[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Ikr, imagine how some people wou"> Google are also some of the biggest contributors to Linux and open source in general
22:33:39 <strcat[m]> and SCTP-over-DTLS-over-UDP which is what WebRTC uses
22:33:43 <madaidan[m]> Just look at stuff like project zero or oss-fuzz
22:33:46 <strcat[m]> because it's soft real time and can't use TCP reasonably
22:34:00 <strcat[m]> games mostly roll their own UDP protocols
22:34:09 <strcat[m]> without authenticated encryption or with totally broken authenticated encryption
22:34:18 <strcat[m]> Zoom and most video/voice stuff does the same
22:34:33 <strcat[m]> cause you can't just use TCP it's garbage
22:34:36 <strcat[m]> and UDP is just raw IP with ports literally
22:34:53 <strcat[m]> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768 this is the whole UDP standard
22:35:38 <strcat[m]> congestion control? reliability? authenticated encryption? streams? multiplexing? that's your problem
22:35:40 <madaidan[m]> I prefer IPoAC tbh
22:35:42 <strcat[m]> and almost always done really, really badly
22:35:45 <strcat[m]> but TCP is super inefficient and high latency so...
22:36:05 <strcat[m]> end up with ton of custom UDP protocols
22:36:29 <strcat[m]> QUIC has better congestion control causing fewer problems and handles lossy links (mobile) far, far better
22:36:46 <strcat[m]> TCP goes into pathological horribly insane mode on lossy links
22:36:59 <strcat[m]> it makes the problem way worse
22:37:06 <EssentialChaos[m> Btw, what's up with Huawei's "New IP" or something? Is the whole concept really bad?
22:37:20 <strcat[m]> and it has multiplexing, i.e. you can have N concurrent streams that do not block each other
22:37:30 <madaidan[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Btw, what's up with Huawei's "Ne"> Huawei usually = bad
22:37:34 <strcat[m]> better latency - especially for TLS, gets rid of all the latency overhead for TLS
22:37:44 <strcat[m]> cause it puts the TLS handshake into the replacement for the TCP handshake
22:38:00 <strcat[m]> unless you certificates are huge
22:38:01 <strcat[m]>  * unless your certificates are huge
22:38:02 <EssentialChaos[m> <madaidan[m] "Huawei usually = bad"> I mean, they can't spy via a protocol concept
22:38:34 <strcat[m]> HTTP/2 is multiplexed but TCP is not so it has blocking/latency issues still, tied to TCP
22:38:49 <strcat[m]> HTTP/3 is HTTP/2 over QUIC basically - minor adjustments to make that work with proper multiplexing
22:39:16 <strcat[m]> QUIC itself is more interesting than HTTP/3, HTTP/3 is a really minor adjustment to make it work on top
22:39:40 <strcat[m]> so atm WebRTC has a custom protocol that is genuinely SCTP-over-DTLS-over-UDP lol
22:39:50 <strcat[m]> with WebRTC's stuff on top of that
22:40:00 <strcat[m]> cause TCP sucks and they needed a multiplexed stream protocol (SCTP)
22:40:10 <strcat[m]> and it needs to be in userspace and compatible with existing routers, etc.
22:40:15 <strcat[m]> so SCTP-over-UDP
22:40:18 <strcat[m]> and you need encryption
22:40:20 <madaidan[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "I mean, they can't spy via a pro"> I'm not even talking about backdoors. Their stuff are usually riddled with vulnerabilities.
22:40:23 <strcat[m]> so SCTP-over-DTLS-over-UDP
22:40:28 <madaidan[m]> A recent example is that HKSP stuff.
22:40:46 <strcat[m]> mediatek is really bad too
22:41:27 <madaidan[m]> My general rule is that anything other than Google/Qualcomm is usually bad
22:41:39 <strcat[m]> mediatek is a special kind of bad tho
22:41:43 <strcat[m]> next tier bad
22:41:54 <madaidan[m]> Ultra bad
22:41:56 <strcat[m]> they put backdoors in everything
22:42:03 <strcat[m]> not maliciously
22:42:08 <strcat[m]> they put like
22:42:09 <strcat[m]> debug backdoors
22:42:16 <strcat[m]> stuff devs used to make it
22:42:27 <strcat[m]> always have various ways to escalate privs and bypass security for debugging they ship in prod
22:42:36 <madaidan[m]> lol
22:42:40 <madaidan[m]> That's silly
22:42:47 <strcat[m]> this is common practice
22:42:56 <strcat[m]> in hardware industry
22:43:08 <strcat[m]> in embedded and stuff like routers particularly
22:43:11 <strcat[m]> but also SoCs, etc.
22:43:35 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/jcase is really good at finding those things
22:43:46 <strcat[m]> he made a lot of phone root exploits based on that stuff
22:43:59 <strcat[m]> the sketchy android OEMs like OnePlus love that stuff too
22:44:10 <strcat[m]> LG
22:44:18 <madaidan[m]> I really need to make a twitter account to follow these guys
22:44:23 <strcat[m]> they looove writing backdoors so they can debug production shit
22:44:33 <strcat[m]> mediatek tho
22:44:33 <strcat[m]> is special
22:44:43 <strcat[m]> really special
22:45:04 <strcat[m]> so like these backdoors
22:45:06 <strcat[m]> it's not malicious, it's not from management or anything
22:45:08 <strcat[m]> the management doesn't know
22:45:15 <strcat[m]> the programmers put the backdoors so they can do their job easier
22:45:34 <strcat[m]> you might be surprised how common this is
22:45:54 <strcat[m]> and often it's quite possible they intended to remove the backdoor and their processes let it accidentally ship
22:46:19 <strcat[m]> there's never really any attempt to hide it or anything
22:46:23 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "congestion control? reliability?"> Udp is the internets fire and forget protocsl
22:46:53 <strcat[m]> it's the building block for sane protocols cause you need compat with existing routers
22:46:54 <strcat[m]> all new stream protocols replacing TCP have to build on UDP
22:46:58 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "you might be surprised how commo"> I assumed most remembered to remove those
22:47:05 <blacklight447[m]> We sent it , and dont care if it arrived properly or at all
22:47:30 <strcat[m]> there is tcp-over-udp
22:47:30 <strcat[m]> lol
22:47:43 <strcat[m]> I just imagined it and googled it
22:47:45 <strcat[m]> it exists
22:50:53 <blacklight447[m]> Lol
22:52:04 <madaidan[m]> Why is github dying rn
22:52:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> <madaidan[m] "Why is github dying rn"> Oh it's not just me getting errors
22:52:55 <madaidan[m]> lmao are they fuzzing a fuzzer https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/syzkaller
22:53:36 <madaidan[m]> That's meta
