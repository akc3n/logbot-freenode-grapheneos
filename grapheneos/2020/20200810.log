00:16:49 <cn3m[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
00:17:30 <cn3m[m]> @andresbs:matrix.org: it is designed to give you privacy it uses https://www.google.com/generate_204 for privacy reasosn
00:17:34 <cn3m[m]> the request has no data
00:17:42 <cn3m[m]> it blends in when you connect say to WiFi
00:18:15 <cn3m[m]> if I go to McDonalds and connect to the free WiFi they will see a call to Google for connectivity check and my random MAC address
00:18:29 <cn3m[m]> they can't tell me apart from any other Pixel user
00:19:19 <cn3m[m]> the main issue is that to provide privacy you have to blend in to some degree
00:19:29 <cn3m[m]> that is why Vanadium stays so true to Chrome fingerprint
00:19:50 <cn3m[m]> you look like every other Pixel user to sites you connect too
00:19:59 <cn3m[m]> if I go to McDonalds and use the free WiFi then browse with Vanadium
00:20:06 <cn3m[m]> I am the same as every Pixel user ever
00:20:11 <cn3m[m]> essentially
00:20:21 <cn3m[m]> which is excellent for privacy
00:21:13 <refragable[m]> The issue to implement connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org/generate_204 checks by default is https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/198
00:23:39 <nickcalyx[m]> The here are very few pixels in the wild
00:23:45 <nickcalyx[m]> There are
00:23:52 <cn3m[m]> "These need use a very common domain and URL in order to bypass whitelisting systems only permitting access to common domains / URLs so a domain like grapheneos.org would likely be inadequate. GrapheneOS leaves these set to the standard four URLs to blend into the crowd of billions of other Android devices with and without Google Mobile Services performing the same empty GET requests. For privacy reasons, it isn't
00:23:52 <cn3m[m]> desirable to stand out from the crowd and changing these URLs or even disabling the feature will likely reduce your privacy by giving your device a more unique fingerprint. GrapheneOS aims to appear like any other common mobile device on the network."
00:23:57 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "The here are very few pixels in "> in the US it is the third largest phone brand
00:24:03 <cn3m[m]> by sales at least
00:24:08 <nickcalyx[m]> Noooo
00:24:21 <nickcalyx[m]> Apple, Samsung, Motorola
00:24:38 <nickcalyx[m]> Even.lg is probably bigger
00:25:14 <nickcalyx[m]> Im always looking at peoples phones in NYC,  its rare to see a pixel
00:25:29 <cn3m[m]> I mean new sales
00:25:35 <cn3m[m]> but yeah not right now
00:25:43 <cn3m[m]> I am pretty sure it was third
00:26:35 <analtenderloin[m> I don't get the criticism people have for apple monitizing repairs, if its what keeps their business from turning to data collection for profit thats a W for me
00:26:36 <entry1[m]> Definitely a growing competitor since they are grabbing a lot of Samsung's market share. I'd say Pixels are 2-4% of phones in the US
00:27:09 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m "I don't get the criticism people"> wrong chat?
00:27:55 <cn3m[m]> https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/north-america
00:28:03 <analtenderloin[m> My b lol
00:28:18 <cn3m[m]> even for North America which would gravitate away from high end phones like Pixels and iPhones
00:28:42 <cn3m[m]> 2.4% for Pixels and they just recently started selling well
00:29:54 * cn3m[m] uploaded an image: image.png (129KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/fpsxoMQrJGCSVWYGKNBrBmDk >
00:29:56 <cn3m[m]> trying to blend in with Pixels is a wonderful idea
00:30:12 <cn3m[m]> that picture is the US specifically
00:30:42 <cn3m[m]> the other thing to consider
00:30:53 <cn3m[m]> everyone of these brands make a ton of phones beside Apple and Google
00:31:04 <analtenderloin[m> I feel the only downside to pixels is they feel cheaper than competitor phones they are definitely good phones but they just dont feel as nice as iphones
00:31:44 <cn3m[m]> Pixels have decent cases too
00:32:19 <cn3m[m]> Pixels are the only option for the project known right now
00:32:36 <cn3m[m]> they also have excellent features to blend in
00:33:04 <entry1[m]> I estimate Pixels getting to 5% by 2025. They are going to get a lot of Samsung switchoff and the have great value budget models. Great data cn3m. I don't see a point of getting a different Android for longevity at this point
00:33:07 <cn3m[m]> most people who use Pixels love Google so they will be using Chrome so that helps Vanadium really blend in and across only a few devices
00:33:48 <analtenderloin[m> assuming its possible would grapheneOS on an iphone be peak mobile security?
00:34:16 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m "assuming its possible would grap"> eh, hardware wise Pixels are really catching up. Daniel did a good write-up on Reddit
00:34:34 <cn3m[m]> Pixels and iPhones with the same OS wouldn't make much of a difference if it was somehow possible
00:35:34 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3+ specifically is quite good
00:35:34 <analtenderloin[m> <cn3m[m] "Pixels and iPhones with the same"> The apple environment is nice though.  With a pixel you just have a pixel but ios competes with grapheneOS AND you get the apple environment
00:36:01 <analtenderloin[m> Im honestly conflicted
00:36:33 <cn3m[m]> I would take this too the off topic room as it is a little off topic
00:37:16 <analtenderloin[m> <cn3m[m] "I would take this too the off to"> I couldnt find it on mobile do you happen to have a link good sir
00:37:28 <cn3m[m]> https://matrix.to/#/!NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=privacytools.io&via=tchncs.de
00:37:39 <cn3m[m]> I can also directly invite you if your app is being mad
00:37:54 <analtenderloin[m> thank you sir
02:34:28 <renlord> strcat[m]: RE: https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1292398497677877249
02:35:07 <renlord> specifically Google Camera app on Pixel, this is only if the app was pre-installed with a special SElinux domain assigned to it yes?
02:36:22 <renlord> sideloading google camera iiuc still uses the default app domains yeah which still require it to use the OS abstraction layer?
02:37:33 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "sideloading google camera iiuc s"> Sideloading uses it iirc
02:37:43 <cn3m[m]> I think it is broken without the domain
02:41:00 <renlord> the app will be broken without the domain?
02:45:25 <renlord> i dont see this google_camera_app domain in our source tree
02:45:27 <renlord> @_@
02:45:43 <renlord> oh nvm
02:45:48 <renlord> i've been looking at the wrong place
02:46:23 <renlord> crosshatch does not have this apparently
02:46:27 <renlord> cn3m[m]: ^
02:47:12 <renlord> eh nvm its in the vendor dir
02:49:05 <strcat[m]> renlord: no it's based on signature
02:49:05 <strcat[m]> and app id
02:49:41 <renlord> ok, so sideloading it on grapheneos does not put it in the privileged domain
02:50:01 <renlord> and still relatively functional
02:50:17 <strcat[m]> renlord: it does put it in the google camera domain
02:50:21 <strcat[m]> because it's based on app id and signature
02:50:49 <strcat[m]> you can check ps -AZ
02:51:38 <strcat[m]> we can probably remove the other special domain too
02:52:29 <renlord> where to see what signature is required for inheriting a domain?
02:52:47 <renlord> mac_permission.xml?
02:53:21 <renlord> ok, it does
02:55:24 <strcat[m]> seapp_contexts
02:55:32 <renlord> i think at the very least some actions need to be changed from allow -> audit
03:53:26 <analtenderloin[m> so what is this news about daniel removing the ability to use google camera?
03:54:12 <renlord> not the ability to remove google camera
03:54:29 <renlord> *removing the ability to use google camera
03:54:59 <renlord> its about removing the special domain that it uses which lets it bypass the OS abstraction layer
03:55:15 <renlord> dont know if it will break the app though
03:55:29 <analtenderloin[m> hopefully not
03:55:33 <analtenderloin[m> best camera by far
03:56:04 <analtenderloin[m> opencamera doesn't even come close despite people trying to tell themselves otherwisxe
03:56:41 <cn3m[m]> Henry did a great video on it
03:56:50 <cn3m[m]> Even the 3a is decent
03:57:30 <renlord> i've found that open camera is very unreliable from using it as a point and shoot camera for travelling
03:58:19 <xohoh[m]> opencamera don't even work properly, it rotate the phone to landscape mode
03:58:27 <renlord> the camera app crashes more frequently than google camera and it is also less featureful than Google Camera
03:59:22 <renlord> and its very difficult to fix since the crashes occur beneath the HAL layer
03:59:41 <renlord> not even sure if the code that is meant to be looked at is open/closed source
04:00:04 <renlord> my 2 cents from attempting to look at fixing it
04:00:53 <analtenderloin[m> hopefully google camera is still around, lucky enough we can deny network access and its still funcitonal
05:05:12 <analtenderloin[m> Hey, so I can't remember, but someone here said that Firefox actively bypasses the hardening measures of vanadium.  For clarification, this applies to tor browser too correct?
05:09:18 <cn3m[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/21
05:11:06 <cn3m[m]> "If GrapheneOS didn't go out of the way to make exceptions to the hardening for non-base-system apps, Firefox wouldn't run at all, since it goes against a lot of good practices and violates many of the rules that GrapheneOS intends to enforce."

05:12:01 <TodorokiShto[m]> Well wouldn't using Vanadium be a better idea for privacy too since you will blend in
05:12:12 <cn3m[m]> analtenderloin: that should get you started into a deep dive
05:12:13 <TodorokiShto[m]> I think the "Blend in" approach to privacy is the best one tbh
05:25:20 <theultron[m]> Is there any reason call recording feature is not there in GrapheneOS? I saw it in LOS dialer.
05:35:36 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "Is there any reason call recordi"> it is not a privacy or security feature
05:35:43 <cn3m[m]> it is probably best to try to get it added upstream
05:36:15 <renlord> it is illegal to record a call without the counter party's consent
05:36:19 <renlord> it wont be upstreamed
05:37:25 <theultron[m]> Depends on country to country.
05:38:08 <theultron[m]> https://www.xda-developers.com/android-11-call-recording/#:~:text=Google%20is%20finally%20adding%20call%20recording%20support%20for,Google%20Play%20Store%20to%20record%20their%20phone%20calls.
05:40:11 <JTL> renlord: I think maybe allowing it with a disclaimer is fine
05:40:56 <analtenderloin[m> <renlord "it is illegal to record a call w"> That is state-by-state
05:41:10 <theultron[m]> renlord: For USA.
05:41:20 * theultron[m] uploaded an image: image.png (64KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/PhCWQNVydGBNDnxMnSFFJtwa >
05:41:27 <renlord> sure, i know for a fact that in australia, it is illegal without informed consent
05:41:35 <renlord> and maybe people cannot be bothered to solicit consent
05:41:49 <theultron[m]> May be enable it region wise like LOS do.
05:42:21 <theultron[m]> Nearly every smartphone shipped in India (my country) comes with in built call recorder.
05:42:46 <renlord> i'm not sure why call recording is a necessary feature at all besides using it to screw over or to hold the counter party accountable
05:42:58 <analtenderloin[m> The latter
05:43:01 <JTL> ^
05:43:08 <renlord> for either purposes, you can transcribe the call in a non-verbatim manner and still have it admissable
05:44:09 <theultron[m]> <renlord "for either purposes, you can tra"> Not every country have law system like USA.
05:44:14 <analtenderloin[m> <renlord "for either purposes, you can tra"> Yeah and I can "transcribe" a criminalizing conversation with someone I don't like, with no further evidence than my transcription, that holds well in court!
05:44:21 <renlord> i can think of so many reasons for it to be used maliciously and in a non-good manner than it being used for righteous reasons, if you need call recording, you should prolly reroute your calls via a professional piece of equipment that actually discloses the fact that the call is recorded
05:44:42 <analtenderloin[m> <renlord "i can think of so many reasons f"> Replace call recording with encryption
05:44:59 <renlord> analtenderloin[m: how does that even help lol?
05:45:36 <ruddo[m]> <renlord "sure, i know for a fact that in "> True.  These laws protect the criminal against the innocent.
05:45:44 <analtenderloin[m> You are making the "since you can do bad stuff with it it shouldn't be allowed" argument, which many people have used for encryption
05:46:51 <analtenderloin[m> <renlord "analtenderloin: how does that ev"> You are making the "since you can do bad stuff with it it shouldn't be allowed" argument, which many people have used for encryption
05:47:26 <renlord> im just saying its unlikely to be accepted upstream because call recording without informed consent is illegal in many jurisdictions.
05:47:47 <JTL> Upstream to AOSP? Sure
05:47:51 <analtenderloin[m> Encryption is illegal in many jurisdictions
05:48:02 <JTL> I could understand Google taking the conservative approach
05:48:13 <renlord> ok i lost.
05:50:27 <analtenderloin[m> <renlord "ok i lost."> We all lose.  Some days I'm the hammer some days I'm the nail.  Nail has been the case for me a lot lately
05:50:58 <renlord> i still vehementlly disagree on the inclusion of call recording as feature
05:51:16 <analtenderloin[m> There are so many situations in my personal life that call recording would have been EXTREMELY helpful, but alas, I don't control what's added.
05:51:19 <renlord> and would be extremely dissapointed if it ended up upstream in aosp or accepted into grapheneos
05:51:37 <JTL> dissapointed?
05:52:00 <renlord> yes
05:52:07 <analtenderloin[m> <JTL "dissapointed?"> It doesn't matter none of us control what is and isn't added upstream.
05:53:09 <analtenderloin[m> If they add it, fantastic.  If they don't, nothings changed.  Best we can do is ask Daniel
05:55:29 <analtenderloin[m> But yeah I've definitely had phones on stockOS with call recording natively enabled so its unlikely legality is an issue. Maybe its because graphene isn't concerned with features like that.  Not really part of the goal anyways.
05:56:32 <renlord> i suppose a good case can be made that if it was implemented properly as a feature, it'd play an automated recording saying that "this call is recorded" on activiation.
05:56:49 <renlord> probably better than people doing crazy hacks and insecure things to get around it
05:57:55 <renlord> then i'm less likely to be dissapointed and annoyed, the main pain point for me (personally) is the potential for my calls to be recorded without my consent
06:04:02 <theultron[m]> <renlord "then i'm less likely to be dissa"> It already happen.

06:07:15 <renlord> probably, everyone shouldnt be making it easier to screw over other people's rights
06:07:49 <analtenderloin[m> <theultron[m] "Your calls get recorded without "> *playing devil's advocate*  There is a big difference between a carrier having your call recorded and an angry-ex girlfriend trying to take stuff out of context
06:08:18 <analtenderloin[m> But I'm still in favor of call recording
06:08:30 <za_warudo-vilfp8> either way SIM voice calls are bad
06:08:51 <za_warudo-vilfp8> and Android 11's screen recording wont help bring consent in the table

15:14:19 <pikey[m]> i manage dto get fastmode and was worried that OS description is wrong thats all
15:15:02 <za_warudo-vilfp8> I'd honestly check the logs then search adb, 60Hz, with user anupristaisno1

15:15:55 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Seems normal tho
15:16:10 <alzxjm[m]> I wonder if I'm having more SELinux problems. This time with Joplin
15:16:30 <za_warudo-vilfp8> What is it?
15:16:30 <alzxjm[m]> I've tried installing from Aurora and the APK from their site. Another possibility is some issue with my Seedvaultbackup being weird.
15:16:31 <alzxjm[m]> Anyone else using Joplin?
15:19:37 <xabi[m]> Can grapheneOS give extra security with Qualcomm dsp vulnerabilities or Qualcomm really did a terrible job securing the DSP and we are vulnerable until they try to fix it?

15:20:45 <za_warudo-vilfp8> A recent tweet of the lead dev has a plan on DSP, something like disabling the access or removing it?
15:20:49 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Wait let me checj

15:23:25 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * A recent tweet of the lead dev has a plan on removing special SELinux domain for QDSP?
15:23:47 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Ok edited according to the tweet.
15:25:12 <alzxjm[m]> Hmm or maybe my Joplin issue is due to the 08/07 timestamp on the build...
15:25:20 <alzxjm[m]> Joplin was working on Graphene before.
15:27:29 <alzxjm[m]> NVM it's working now. No idea what the issue was.
15:28:32 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <pikey[m] "i manage dto get fastmode and wa"> Only fastboot? Have you tried entering recovery
15:29:15 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Then boot from there?
15:36:16 <pikey[m]> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "Only fastboot? Have you tried en"> no, no idea about android. i did google it and says poewr and vol down shoudl go to recovery mode, but thats just what brought up that fastmode. can't seem to get to recovery mode
15:36:36 <pikey[m]> i have no backups though so dont want to force wipe it even if i can manage to do that! not yet anyway
15:45:14 <za_warudo-vilfp8> You can do it from fastboot
15:45:15 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Like volume button to change to Recovery
15:45:15 <za_warudo-vilfp8> From just Start
15:45:16 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Like (press) the volume button to change to Recovery
15:45:52 <pikey[m]> ah ok, will try that thanks
15:46:10 <pikey[m]> i dont want to wipe the phone though, if thats what recoivery mode does
15:46:27 <za_warudo-vilfp8> No not really
15:46:47 <za_warudo-vilfp8> There are options there that can be changed by pressing volume button, then power button to select
15:47:08 <za_warudo-vilfp8> So, once you see the nandroid, hold power off button, then press volume up button
15:47:21 <za_warudo-vilfp8> To see those options iirc
15:47:29 <pikey[m]> what a nandroid?!
15:47:35 <pikey[m]>  * what is a nandroid?!
15:48:58 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Like a lying android with gears and stuff
15:49:57 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Oh, nvm, it was exclamation mark and buttons, not gears and stuff

16:03:35 <za_warudo-vilfp8> A question...
16:03:35 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It's still not clear to me how LineageOS implementation of connect by VPN, WIFI and Mobile Data is not robust as additional or replacement in `INTERNET` permission

16:05:37 <cdesai> that is what we're going to bring it, it is definitely robust
16:05:59 <cdesai> the edits show up as different messages on irc, so I actually see the message thric here.
16:06:46 <cdesai> oh wrong channel to say bring it in just realised
16:07:32 <cdesai> if you turn off both mobile data and wifi on lineageos it should be equivalent to the internet perm here, it's just done at a different level
16:07:40 <za_warudo-vilfp8> My apologies if it sound offensive on my question earlier
16:08:03 <za_warudo-vilfp8> But it wasn't really clear on me, since I read logs of both rooms
16:08:12 <cdesai> it just spams on irc when messages keep getting minor edits - something in a line or two ends up spanning a lot more

17:05:16 <alzxjm[m]> dukkerino: Face unlock works, Project Soli gestures do not work. The display is configured as stock, which is 90 Hz above a certain brightness level and 60 Hz below. There is no way in the Graphene settings to, say, force 60 Hz or 90 Hz.
17:07:41 <alzxjm[m]> dadsocket: Yeah you can use `adb` commands to accomplish this. I was only referring to the Settings dialog.

19:23:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> djee737ejdd: the hour
19:30:23 <morrigan_> Hi, I'm wondering if this is a good place to ask about an issue I'm having, or if there's somewhere else I should do that
19:32:13 <Vicarious[m]> What's the issue, "morrigan_" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_morrigan_:matrix.org)?
19:32:26 <morrigan_> It's a fresh install on a Pixel 2 (nothing seemed to go wrong during flashing) but it's just not reading the SIM card I put in
19:33:35 <morrigan_> There could be something wrong with the phone, it's a few years old and it used to belong to a friend
19:34:01 <Vicarious[m]> Did you try the sim in the phone before flashing GOS?
19:35:11 <morrigan_> No, I wasn't able to activate it until earlier today and assumed it would go smoothly (poor choices made). I was thinking I might revert to Android and see if it works.
19:35:13 <Vicarious[m]> Wiggle the tray a bit, or clean the sim with a bit of isopropyl alcohol, just in case. If the sim works in another phone, then it may be the Pixel 2.
19:36:06 <morrigan_> I don't have another phone to test it on, but I'll play around with it a little,
19:36:09 <morrigan_> Thanks
19:36:09 <Vicarious[m]> Yeah. Shouldn't take too long to revert back to stock using https://developers.google.com/android/images
19:37:16 <Vicarious[m]> Give that a go and see if it works. If it does, let us know :)
19:38:13 <nickcalyx[m]> <morrigan_ "I don't have another phone to te"> Borrow an old phone from someone
19:41:24 <morrigan_> So I have a different SIM card, just tried that and still no info. So I'm assuming it's either the phone or the OS. I'll try reverting to Android after I've made a run to the store
19:41:43 <morrigan_> Thanks again
19:42:05 <morrigan_> nickalyx: will also see if I know someone with an unused phone, thank you
19:42:11 <Vicarious[m]> Good luck!
19:42:54 <morrigan_> Many thanks
19:43:32 <nickcalyx[m]> it seems like almost everyone has some old phone collection in a drawer
19:44:59 <Vicarious[m]> Yeah, it is normal
19:45:14 <morrigan_> I've only owned a couple phones and I only replace them when they're toast. I think the best-condition one I've got is a 2016 Xperia with a shot battery.
19:45:41 <morrigan_> But most people yeah
19:45:53 <Vicarious[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "it seems like almost everyone ha"> 3310 still going strong
19:46:04 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "it seems like almost everyone ha"> iPhone 3GS reporting
19:46:53 <nickcalyx[m]> maybe the problem is the old phones can't use a nano sim
19:47:07 <Vicarious[m]>  Stock SMS app will use barely anything
19:47:42 <Vicarious[m]> Signal only uses lots because it continuously searches for messages.
19:49:29 <cdesai> I've got cutouts from the SIM packaging, which had all 3 sizes - mini, micro and nano
19:49:44 <Vicarious[m]> If you have contacts using Signal, it'll be better as all your messages are e2ee
19:49:52 <Vicarious[m]> <cdesai "I've got cutouts from the SIM pa"> Same, but old simcards
19:50:38 <Vicarious[m]> Can order free ones or pick them up from shops with the cutouts already in them, so just pop the size you want and slip your main sim in
19:51:21 <Vicarious[m]> "nsane" (https://matrix.to/#/@nsane:matrix.org) but if you're just using SMS (which isn't recommended as it isn't end to end encrypted and can be spoofed easily), then the stock app is fine :)
19:52:03 <cdesai> I still like using the stock app for Messaging, and then Signal for e2ee chats. Although I don't really text anyone, here it's mostly all WhatsApp.
19:53:58 <Vicarious[m]> Yeah, same, "cdesai" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_cdesai:matrix.org). Makes a bit of a mess if you get 2FA texts through and whatnot. Prefer to compartmentalise. Luckily, I have got all the peeps I need on Signal.. The rest can sod off :p
19:54:22 <morrigan_> The Pixel 2 takes a nano sim, so I doubt that's it. It's also definitely not the app; all the SIM information is coming up "unknown" in settings.
19:54:34 <cdesai> Vicarious[m]: well, Signal can't really help much with 2fa texts you get.
19:55:21 <Vicarious[m]> Well yeah, lol
19:55:30 <morrigan_> Also I wanted to add, I like the decision to use signify for signing binaries. It's slick, also the trust model actually kind of works.
19:56:12 <JTL> 2FA texts need to go the way of leaded gasoline
19:56:22 <morrigan_> Whoever made that call, kudos etc. Way less of a pain than using gpg
19:56:25 <Vicarious[m]> Was just an example. Also order number, service call SMS etc. Just prefer to not have that showing in Signal. Nice and clean contacts only.
19:56:32 <JTL> fair
19:56:56 <cdesai> Vicarious[m]: oh yeah sorry I read it the other way around. totally agree.
19:57:12 <cdesai> JTL: so only used in the aviation industry then?
19:57:15 <Vicarious[m]> :)
19:57:31 <JTL> Ahahahaha
19:57:34 <JTL> Good one
19:58:09 <JTL> cdesai: Funny enough I just read an article that Boeing uses 3.5" floppy disks to update the waypoint database and other things on the 747 internal computers
19:58:12 <JTL> lol
20:12:55 <tursiops[m]> Hey everyone quick question is the pixel 3a xl compatible with esim ?
20:16:09 <Vicarious[m]> Not on GrapheneOS atm.
20:16:20 <tursiops[m]> OK thanks
20:40:09 <nickcalyx[m]> the esim apk is google proprietary AFAIK
20:41:39 <nickcalyx[m]> they really should have included it as part of AOSP
20:45:11 <nickcalyx[m]> it could if you install some gcam services thing first
20:45:35 <nickcalyx[m]> no
20:45:50 <nickcalyx[m]> it just fakes that google services is there enough for gcam to work
20:47:27 <nickcalyx[m]> you can't really install microg on graphene though
20:47:52 <nickcalyx[m]> anyway Daniel says he wants to remove the selinux stuff that lets gcam access the  pixel visual core
20:48:26 <nickcalyx[m]> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1292405448381997056
20:48:43 <nickcalyx[m]> well as of now it works
20:48:51 <nickcalyx[m]> if you use that gcam services thing first
20:49:20 <nickcalyx[m]> personally I am unhappy without having panorama mode in my camera, and night mode, slowmo and timelapse are fun too
20:49:44 <nickcalyx[m]> I made a fun timelapse of my aquarium the other day, got lots of likes on instagram ;)
20:49:51 <JTL> :D
20:50:41 <Vicarious[m]> I'm in the same boat. GCam is far superior and if the SELinux domain is removed, I shan't be using GrapheneOS anymore.
20:51:08 <nickcalyx[m]> I think it's a shame to not use the best camera in mobile phone business
20:51:15 <nickcalyx[m]> but that's just my opinion
20:51:40 <Vicarious[m]> <dukkerino[m] "i'll look around for those gcam "> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
20:51:43 <nickcalyx[m]> yeah lineage doesn't really count security among their core values
20:51:51 <nickcalyx[m]> I'd say
20:53:19 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS stays in line with AOSP security
20:53:25 <cn3m[m]> I use both
20:54:39 <cn3m[m]> If security and privacy are critical you're probably going to have a little better time with GrapheneOS. Though CalyxOS is doing great work especially on the usability front
20:55:06 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS and GrapheneOS have a solid community overlap
20:55:59 <cn3m[m]> I mean if you need more privacy on CalyxOS don't use microG
20:56:17 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS turns off all the security features that you might not like
20:56:32 <cn3m[m]> Just uses stock + restricted USB
20:57:04 <Vicarious[m]> Well, Facebook have your phone number and metadata
20:57:10 <Vicarious[m]> But it is e2ee
20:57:14 <Vicarious[m]> So you're aight.
20:58:13 <cn3m[m]> Facebook already has your number
20:58:15 <JTL> I think given enouh effort calyx is going to be on par with GrapheneOS in the future
20:58:22 <cn3m[m]> Family uploading it
20:59:19 <Vicarious[m]> <dukkerino[m] "maybe i should ask for a seperat"> I'm an advocate of that
20:59:45 <Vicarious[m]> If work requires you to use certain apps or forms of communication, they should supply the device. End of.
21:01:23 <Vicarious[m]> I use Revolut, from UK
21:01:54 <Vicarious[m]> They have disposable credit cards. Although, this is off topic now lol

22:46:36 <morrigan_> Hey I'm back, so I just tried the SIM card with the stock OS and it's fine
22:47:16 <morrigan_> Picks up the cell network and everything
22:48:04 <morrigan_> Is it possible for the carrier to tell that I'm not using stock Android?
22:48:36 <morrigan_> No, wait, that wouldn't matter anyway, since it wasn't picking up any info about the SIM card at all
23:15:51 <morrigan_> Oh hey the sim card works now
