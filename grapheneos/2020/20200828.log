02:42:30 <spoonhoarder82[m> Since it doesn't look like I can get WiFi calling through any carrier, and since E-sims and google are a no-go, what (if anything) can be used to call phone lines using only WiFi?  Anyone know?

04:46:10 <ham5urg> Is it possible to build GrapheneOS against a Nexus5X?
04:48:18 <nickcalyx[m]> Its theoretically possible if you did all the work to port android 10 to the nexus 5x but why
04:48:19 <louipc> i think that misses a lot of hardware security features that are used now, so you'd have to disable, or strip stuff out at least
04:48:37 <JTL> ^
04:48:56 <ham5urg> I see, better buy a Pixel.
04:49:16 <louipc> i imagine it would be a ton of dev work yea
04:49:38 <cn3m[m]> <louipc "i think that misses a lot of har"> It missed a tremendous amount of security features and around a hundred unfixable security issues
04:49:46 <cn3m[m]> it is pointless to invest the time in
04:50:01 <louipc> what if u just wanna secure flashlight
04:50:35 <louipc> that looks like a phone lol
05:25:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <ham5urg "Is it possible to build Graphene"> No
05:25:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Older devices lack some things like the bootloader passing a random seed
05:26:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> They won't boot
05:26:50 <theultron[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "i'm more so worried about the na"> You can use an automation app like Tasker or Easer if it supports motion. Activate Android's Secure Lock Down (Disable FP/Face Unlock) on high motion activity or using proximity sensor.

11:58:32 <hultan[m]> I am trying to get the Swedish app (BankID) to work, since it is essential to swedes to identify themselves online when banking, etc. One site mentioned "by just disable GMSCore in the settings", but I don't know how to do that. Anyone here have any idea of how to do that? Link : https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/824#issuecomment-536193879
12:05:12 <hultan[m]> I think it is the file com.google.android.gms that need to be disabled (or uninstalled)...
12:08:05 <hultan[m]> I know how to uninstall that package using adb, but it seems simpler to just disable it in the settings if possible.
12:41:59 <drossbox[m]> Hi all. I've been reading about the mac randomization, and am curious if in GrapheneOS it extends to the apps? Looking at the android docs, and app can still request the real mac by calling getWifiMacAddress() rather than  getRandomizedMacAddress(). Does Graphene mitigate this at all, or does the feature only benefit Re access points?
13:25:12 <jpds> drossbox[m]: Apps don't have access to the MAC address: https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers
13:29:42 <drossbox[m]> jpds: Thanks. That'll teach me for not reading properly.
13:41:07 <kickstart> hello
13:41:18 <kickstart> i have a security suggestion
13:41:34 <kickstart> now the phone can be turned off without entering the pin code
13:42:28 <kickstart> i suggest that it must be entered to switch the phone off, i think it will be useful if someone took the phone and tried to hide it and you call it to hear where it is
13:43:11 <theultron[m]> I don't think the above will work as holding the power button can override this.
13:44:42 <kickstart> samsung phones and huawei go this feature
13:45:09 <kickstart> if i have any programming background i would have investigated more
13:47:15 <theultron[m]> I think it was bypassable. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnUATVAw3EE
13:48:33 <theultron[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0ll2lNA7HE
13:51:01 <kickstart> oh not good that is bypassable, but it will make it harder
14:13:16 <ham5urg> Is it possible to randomize at every reboot the MACs (Bluetooth and Wifi) as well as IMEI?
14:19:31 <chef[m]> MAC maybe but if you gonna spoof your IMEI things start breaking
14:30:57 <kickstart> is there a free node privacy and security group for pc

17:03:30 <carl4315[m]> <carl4315[m] "Great, I am going to copy in the"> - I am using a Virtual Machine with Ubuntu installed
17:07:30 <Autopsy[m]> carl4315  sounds like your device is rebooting into fastbootd and then not being found by the VM. Try unplugging and replugging it in when in fastbootd mode. If that doesn't work, either make a live USB of Ubuntu, or run the installer using Windows, which is also supported.
17:08:05 <Autopsy[m]> What problems are you having in Windows?
17:08:27 <carl4315[m]> ABS not finding the USB device
17:08:51 <Autopsy[m]> Have you set up platform-tools correctly?
17:09:18 <carl4315[m]> Fairly certain, I have done it 15+ times, re-downloaded- bootloader unlocked
17:09:38 <Autopsy[m]> Have you tried another USB cable?
17:09:42 <carl4315[m]> The VM seems to recognize the USB because it shows up in my devices
17:09:51 <carl4315[m]> I haven't...
17:10:31 <carl4315[m]> Just the one that came with the phone
17:13:19 <carl4315[m]> When doing the flash too, the phone is going through the rebooting and it's not like it's just sitting there
17:13:35 <Autopsy[m]> What phone you got?
17:13:48 <carl4315[m]> Sorry, I reread your original statement and I get what you are saying. The VM is "losing" the phone after the Fastbootd screen. This seems right
17:13:51 <carl4315[m]> I am going to try that step now
17:14:03 <Autopsy[m]> The USB-C to USB-C cable and the adaptor you get in the box are notorious for failing the GrapheneOS install. It's recommended to get decent quality USB A to C cable
17:14:04 <carl4315[m]> <Autopsy[m] "What phone you got?"> Pixel 3A
17:14:09 <carl4315[m]> <carl4315[m] "Pixel 3A"> not Verizon
17:15:29 <Autopsy[m]> That's fine then. Just wanted to know because of the power cable, but I think they all have that pesky adaptor.
17:16:18 <carl4315[m]> <Autopsy[m] "That's fine then. Just wanted to"> They sent it to me with a USB (old school idk what the hell you'd call it) to USB3.0
17:16:36 <carl4315[m]> But I am not using the adapter. Just the 3.0 from phone to computer
17:19:03 <Autopsy[m]> Gotcha, that should be okay, but depending on the quality of the cable, you might have problems. Maybe it is as simple as the VM not seeing the phone once it boots into fastbootd.
17:20:00 <carl4315[m]> <Autopsy[m] "Gotcha, that should be okay, but"> Thank you, working through that possibility now
17:26:18 <carl4315[m]> <carl4315[m] "Thank you, working through that "> I get the same problem. fastbootd screen comes up on the phone
17:26:40 <carl4315[m]> Seems to stop all the processing that is happening. Unplug and replug does not do anything I can see
17:27:04 <Autopsy[m]> In the VM, you running as root?
17:27:11 <Autopsy[m]> Or did you set up the udev rules?
17:27:25 <carl4315[m]> That is outside my understanding :/
17:27:33 <carl4315[m]> Is there a way to validate?
17:28:13 <carl4315[m]> Btw, when I look up "Devices" in the VM window I can see the Pixel 3a there
17:29:22 <Autopsy[m]> On Ubuntu, can you check
17:29:34 <Autopsy[m]> fastboot --version

17:33:16 <carl4315[m]> <Autopsy[m] "fastboot --version "> fastboot version 30.0.4-6686687
17:33:26 <carl4315[m]> Installed as /usr/local/bin/fastboot
17:40:59 <Autopsy[m]> Hmm okay
17:42:39 <Autopsy[m]> Only other thing I can suggest is a live USB of Ubuntu, install platform-tools as per the guide (not closing the terminal afterwards) and run ./flash-all.sh
17:43:32 <Autopsy[m]> And/or another USB cable
17:45:18 <carl4315[m]> Okay, I appreciate you taking the time. Any clue as to why, when going through windows, ABS would not find the device?
17:48:16 <Autopsy[m]> Drivers, maybe? platform-tools not set up correctly? USB cable? Haven't sacrificed your first born? Could be any number of reasons lol
17:51:24 <carl4315[m]> Hahaha, damnit I just want this shit to work already, I'll keep plugging away
17:52:44 <carl4315[m]> I thought someone told me that the Ubuntu through USB does not work for installing Graphene. Is this not true?
17:53:40 <Autopsy[m]> Works fine as a proper install or live USB
17:53:51 <Autopsy[m]> Worked for me anyways
17:54:15 <carl4315[m]> Okay, cool

19:15:21 <ohbeejay[m]> <Autopsy[m] "Let us know if there's any step "> Well, I'm a command line newb so I didn't use the official tutorial steps, instead I followed the guidance using teklore's video (where you extract, and then copy and paste the contents of the zip file into the adb folder). I then learned that I had to change the flash-all.bat file, which I did, and it appeared to install, but when I start the system I'm just seeing
19:15:21 <ohbeejay[m]> android and no Graphene OS splash screen as I saw on the teklore video.
19:16:48 <Autopsy[m]> Yeah, that's where most people go wrong is following his video.
19:17:06 <ohbeejay[m]> lol I figured. Is the copy and paste technique the issue?

19:30:26 <Autopsy[m]> ohbeejay there's no harm in updating to the latest stock Pixel release first. Wouldn't interfere with it, no.
19:31:28 <Autopsy[m]> Can be done OTA or from Google's site (think that wipes the device, too, but not 100% sure).

20:47:08 <Autopsy[m]> So, on the guide where you've got to set your environment path, people tend to think that they have to go into the platform-tools folder, but it is the folder they've extracted it to, not the platform-tools folder itself.
20:47:21 <Autopsy[m]> That's the main hurdle I've noticed time and time again
20:48:26 <ohbeejay[m]> Maybe with Autopsy's help I can turn his instructions to me into a guide that you can just send that guide to folks or post it somewhere? It was very easy and intuitive to follow. I was a hair away from calling it quits - and more people need to install this OS!
20:50:32 <Autopsy[m]> Next, add the tools to your¬†PATH¬†in the current shell so they can be used without referencing them by file path, enabling usage by the flashing script.
20:50:32 <Autopsy[m]> On Linux and macOS
20:50:47 <Autopsy[m]> We should have something that states in the directory that the folder has been extracted, not the platform-tools folder itself.
20:50:48 <Autopsy[m]> E.g. home/user/downloads/gos/
20:50:48 <Autopsy[m]> Where gos is folder you've created and put all the zip files in
20:51:49 <Autopsy[m]> Typically, I've seen plenty of people run the env path command in .../gos/platform-tools/
20:51:49 <Autopsy[m]> Which won't work.
20:54:23 <Autopsy[m]> Even if we make the guide so it downloads all files into one folder.. e.g. "gos". Makes it so much simpler.
20:54:51 <Autopsy[m]> Anyways, it's late here, but I can have a look at just modifying that ever so slightly tomorrow and see if the changes are okay with peeps?

21:59:05 <dazinism> faxing: you can download a newer signal apk to update it from their apk download page, Google Play (via Aurora Store or otherwise), or a number of fdroid repos listed in the FDroid forum 'Known Repositories' topic
21:59:26 <dazinism> All of them are signed with the same signature
21:59:42 <dazinism> So will update fine
22:00:24 <dazinism> Pretty sure they are all identical (scraped from the apk download page) except the play store version
22:00:41 <dazinism> Play store version doesn't have the code that lets it self update
22:19:32 <faxing[m]> If I re download the apk from their website then won't I temporarily lose my conversations?
22:25:37 <nikitalita[m]1> anupritaisno1: I can test pixel 2, sent you a PM
22:31:40 <dazinism> <faxing[m] "If I re download the apk from th"> No, its the same as doing an update - often do this with some apps

22:36:40 <dazinism> <faxing[m] "thanks a ton for your help"> No probs
22:38:58 <dazinism> <faxing[m] "I keep getting a different signa"> Its not the file hash sha256, but the sha256 fingerprint of the signature
