00:39:28 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: Pixel 4 doesn't have a Pixel Visual Core
00:39:49 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: it has a Pixel Neural Core
00:40:08 <strcat[m]> and the Pixel 5 drops it altogether and switches to just using the SoC ISP, neural network acceleration, etc.
00:40:30 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: Neural Core was a more generic Visual Core that implements the open source AOSP neural net api
00:40:31 <Dylanger[m]> ^ CDSP
00:40:38 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks
00:40:45 <Dylanger[m]> Qualcomm's Turing Engine
00:41:07 <strcat[m]> Pixel 5 didn't need the Visual/Neural core anymore
00:41:10 <strcat[m]> since SoC has advanced
00:41:30 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: Google Camera itself has used various forms of DSP functionality despite the devices having the Visual/Neural Core
00:41:54 <strcat[m]> anyway curious if they made HDR+ into an OS feature on the Pixel 5
00:41:58 <Dylanger[m]> Interesting they dropped it, are they not worried a vendor will just grab the Camera ISP and plop it onto their platform with the same SoC?
00:42:00 <strcat[m]> otherwise it will just be missing
00:42:19 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: ISP == image processor, part of the SoC
00:42:27 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: what Google provides is a bunch of custom DSP code, etc.
00:42:36 <strcat[m]> implementing all their fancy stuff
00:42:52 <strcat[m]> and it's designed / tuned for the specific camera / ISP combination in Pixels
00:43:05 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "and it's designed / tuned for th"> Ah fair
00:43:07 <strcat[m]> so yeah you could presumably rip it out and run it on another Qualcomm SoC of the same variant / generation
00:43:17 <strcat[m]> but doesn't mean it'll produce good results
00:43:24 <Dylanger[m]> You'd get lawyer'd as well
00:43:32 <strcat[m]> yeah you can't do that
00:43:46 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: it's possible Pixel 5 won't be able to do HDR+ for GrapheneOS
00:44:04 <strcat[m]> but it's also possible it will be better and a lot of functionality will have moved into the device support code in the OS
00:44:05 <strcat[m]> I don't know
00:44:46 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: Pixel 2 through 4 provide HDR+ via that hardware and it works in any compatible app
00:44:49 <strcat[m]> including on GrapheneOS
00:45:04 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: it's possible that now they've switched to having Google Camera provide features for other apps - don't know
00:45:10 <strcat[m]> don't really care much
00:45:14 <strcat[m]> our long term focus isn't Pixels anyways
00:45:47 <Dylanger[m]> Are you working with a manufacturer?
00:46:07 <Dylanger[m]> Guess you're just hanging out for AMSS packages
00:48:08 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "our long term focus isn't Pixels"> Seems like the reason you've gone with Pixel is because Google is the only vendor that correctly implemented AVB2
00:48:31 <Dylanger[m]> But you're loosing out on customizing lower level firmware
00:51:56 <strcat[m]> we'd only get to do that on our own hardware
00:52:01 <strcat[m]> har
00:52:16 <renlord[m]> who's gonna maintain that firmware :/
00:52:17 <strcat[m]>  * hardware shipped in a production state doesn't let you do that
00:52:28 <strcat[m]> the vendors as usual
00:52:31 <strcat[m]> we'd just be signing it
00:53:08 <renlord[m]> dont think there are many vendors that can implement things correctly
00:53:12 <strcat[m]> we'd ideally partner with a good manufacturer and have a variant of an existing device of theirs which basically meets our standards already
00:53:21 <renlord[m]> most are just too busy profiteering
00:53:31 <strcat[m]> and they'd flash our sec image at the factory
00:53:34 <strcat[m]> so it'd be our keys
00:54:14 <strcat[m]> flash our factory images + sec image basically
00:54:21 <strcat[m]> so our root of trust for the SoC firmware
00:54:25 <strcat[m]> and then the OS from there
00:54:45 <renlord[m]> cant we do that with qualcomm already? just order some SoCs from them
00:54:53 <strcat[m]> renlord: not really how it works
00:54:58 <strcat[m]> you partner with Qualcomm and are an OEM
00:55:00 <strcat[m]> you pay them to be an OEM
00:55:17 <strcat[m]> you can even get a reference design phone from them and have a manufacturer produce it
00:55:20 <strcat[m]> but in all likelihood
00:55:32 <strcat[m]> we'd partner with a manufacturer that's a Qualcomm partner, and partner with Qualcomm
00:55:38 <strcat[m]> that's how it works
00:55:43 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "and they'd flash our sec image a"> This is why I was asking about MRC earlier
00:55:56 <Dylanger[m]> Graphene + Google Pixel device
00:56:00 <Dylanger[m]> If you could swing that
00:56:05 <strcat[m]> unlikely
00:56:09 <renlord[m]> would google be open to that?
00:56:11 <renlord[m]> kek
00:56:31 <strcat[m]> it's also currently unlikely we could work with any Android OEM
00:56:41 <strcat[m]> but we could work with manufacturers that are not Android OEMs themselves
00:56:56 <strcat[m]> i.e. they are not Open Handset Alliance members etc
00:57:20 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "the vendors as usual"> OEMs get a bunch of source, you'd want the AMSS packages that Qualcomm provide
00:57:37 <strcat[m]> I know what they get
00:57:46 <strcat[m]> the userspace sources and boot chain
00:57:55 <renlord[m]> huawei? they got kicked out of android kek
00:57:57 <strcat[m]> and the tools for setting up fuses
00:58:02 <Dylanger[m]> Modem too
00:58:05 <strcat[m]> I have it on my workstation
00:58:15 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: a normal OEM doesn't get modem *sources* anymore
00:58:16 <Dylanger[m]> SecTools is the best
00:58:25 <strcat[m]> they do get to sign it
00:58:57 <strcat[m]> a normal OEM just gets images you bundle into a modem image and sign
00:59:06 <Dylanger[m]> Maybe the OEM you have experience doesn't, I've seen modem sources before on newer SoCs
00:59:15 <strcat[m]> I don't know what is required to get modem sources but I don't think most have it anymore
00:59:16 <Dylanger[m]> * Maybe the OEM you have experience with doesn't, I've seen modem sources before on newer SoCs
00:59:34 <strcat[m]> Google has Google Fi
00:59:38 <strcat[m]> which has special requirements
01:00:02 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: I don't think it's part of the normal licensing is all
01:00:14 <Dylanger[m]> Ah right, fair
01:00:26 <strcat[m]> also Google might not need custom modem anymore
01:00:34 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm might have just standardized it
01:00:52 <strcat[m]> Nexus 5X and early Pixels had custom Qualcomm Wi-Fi firmware and drivers too for Wi-Fi anonymity
01:00:58 <strcat[m]> but I expect it's just standard now
01:01:13 <strcat[m]> the custom modem stuff was just for Google Fi multi carrier support stuff
01:01:21 <strcat[m]> and I assume that's on the other Fi supported phones
01:01:54 <Dylanger[m]> Have you looked at XBLSEC?
01:02:05 <Dylanger[m]> AKA, Qualcomm hijacking RoT from OEMs
01:02:25 <strcat[m]> you mean their CA?
01:02:43 <Dylanger[m]> No, XBLSEC is the first stage bootloader
01:02:51 <Dylanger[m]> It's signed by Qualcomm, not the OEM
01:03:09 <Dylanger[m]> It's inside XBL
01:03:31 <Dylanger[m]> Runs at EL3
01:03:32 <renlord[m]> whats XBL
01:04:00 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: I mean regardless they're a trusted party
01:04:16 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: I've mostly looked at this code and worked on it with much older versions
01:04:27 <Dylanger[m]> What if I (OEM) wanted to set some some super cool EL3 registers!?
01:04:27 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 era
01:05:13 <strcat[m]> some devices use a Qualcomm CA as the root of trust anyway
01:05:43 <Dylanger[m]> The ole days of MSM, it was all yours
01:06:47 <Dylanger[m]> Did you ever see those QFPROM fuses called PBL_BOOT_ROM_PATCH? 😱
01:11:52 <strcat[m]> no
01:12:52 <Dylanger[m]> Sounds like a real hoot
01:13:14 <Dylanger[m]> Anyway, have you pinned down a manufacturer?
01:17:13 <strcat[m]> no
01:17:21 <strcat[m]> have been in touch with various ones before
01:17:25 <strcat[m]> but nothing has progressed very far
04:36:56 <tailing> can we ask for help in this channel?
04:37:43 <somenerd[m]> yeah, sure
04:37:51 <somenerd[m]> as long as it's about GrapheneOS
04:39:55 <tailing> I have a pixel 3, had graphene installed a few months but have an issue with notification
04:40:40 <tailing> Often SMS and other notifications will only appear when I unlock the phone
04:43:02 <tailing> Like the phone goes into a deep sleep mode after a while
04:44:44 <tailing> Phone calls are fine but I often miss important texts, maybe there's a setting I need to change?
04:45:42 <somenerd[m]> not really sure...
04:45:49 <somenerd[m]> maybe check the setting?
04:52:11 <bend[m]> I think the default in the privacy setting is "don't show any notifications on lock screen"
04:53:03 <bend[m]> And there is an option available for "show all notifications"
05:14:28 <tailing> I have "Show conversations, default and silent" set
05:15:15 <tailing> maybe switching them off then back again might trigger something
05:18:53 <tailing> but what tends to happen is if the phone has been used recently the notification will come through, if it's been locked for a certain period of time they don't come through
07:15:38 <mistazaki[m]> Hi, I bought pixel 4a today. I must update android 11 first and install Graphene or just continue to install Graphene?
09:06:48 <dazinism> mistazaki: general advice is update to latest stock Android before flashing
09:07:18 <mistazaki[m]> <dazinism "mistazaki: general advice is upd"> android 11?
09:07:31 <somenerd[m]> yeah
09:07:39 <somenerd[m]> ( I think)
09:09:35 <dazinism> Yes, update to latest as it should have any new improvements for compatibility with fastboot, if there are any. Theres no disadvantage.
09:35:39 <mistazaki[m]> <dazinism "Yes, update to latest as it shou"> Thanks. Any tips for me after install Graphene?
09:39:10 <BenchTed[m]> Tell everybody how awesome you are
09:40:59 <dazinism> mistazaki: this may be useful https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
09:41:11 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
09:42:24 <BenchTed[m]> BTW does default keyboard have aosp swiping support?
09:42:45 <dazinism> mistazaki: make sure you do `fastboot flashing lock` at the end of flashing
09:42:47 <strcat[m]> there is no AOSP swiping support
09:42:54 <strcat[m]> question isn't correct
09:43:49 <BenchTed[m]> I have havocos and it comes with with swiping by default
09:43:56 <strcat[m]> there's no AOSP swiping support
09:43:58 <strcat[m]> that's not AOSP
09:44:08 <BenchTed[m]> Dam
09:44:21 <BenchTed[m]> In description it says aosp
09:44:29 <strcat[m]> it's not AOSP
09:44:35 <strcat[m]> AOSP doesn't have swiping support for the keyboard
09:45:17 <strcat[m]> it's clearly a fork of AOSP, not AOSP, it doesn't matter whether they change the name of the keyboard
09:51:58 <projectmoon> more specifically, the AOSP keyboard support(ed) swipe typing but only if a proprietary google library is present on the system. some roms include it. most don't. then google took the aosp keyboard and made gboard out of it
09:54:11 <strcat[m]> not quite
09:55:53 <strcat[m]> AOSP keyboard doesn't support loading that library
09:57:32 <strcat[m]> the sources include support for building a libjni_latinime library
09:57:50 <strcat[m]> there is no support for building or loading a library for gesture typing in AOSP keyboard, it's not supported
09:58:32 <strcat[m]> the reason it has UI code for it (but no implementation of the feature) is because Google Keyboard used to be an extension of AOSP keyboard (Gboard is not, they forked off from Google Keyboard a long time before even publishing it)
09:58:57 <strcat[m]> they took a new approach with Gboard and that meant AOSP keyboard was no longer actively developed aside from bug fixes
09:59:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Did some poor soul actually flash havoc?
09:59:20 <projectmoon> so does havoc have some patch to the aosp keyboard that implements the swipe typing then?
09:59:47 <strcat[m]> go look, I'm sure they patch it to load a library which they just take from legacy Google Keyboard or whatever
09:59:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> <projectmoon "so does havoc have some patch to"> Havoc is a terrible ROM FYI
10:00:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> They just randomly git cherry-pick not understanding what they even pick
10:00:21 <strcat[m]> this is off-topic now
10:00:48 <mistazaki[m]> <dazinism "mistazaki: this may be useful ht"> Thanks so much
10:00:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Short version is
10:01:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> No we are not going to add code from havoc unless you can prove it works well
10:02:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> We'd also run into other issues adding code from havoc. They do not preserve attributions and the original authors either so we'll probably have trouble with original authors contacting us to fix the author
11:31:58 <duggalsu[m]> Hi, do you plan to integrate / implement something like gotify/openpush as an alternative to FCM
11:47:59 * mistazaki[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20201028_194734.jpg (84KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/eKogQcwaNADuNEBhlfNEtnmx/IMG_20201028_194734.jpg >
11:48:33 <dazinism> duggalsu: something like that needs the messaging app developers to support it. Its outside what GrapheneOS has the resources to take on.
11:48:43 <mistazaki[m]> is auditor app not supported on pixel 4a?
11:49:39 <dazinism> Not yet no.
11:51:31 <duggalsu[m]> <dazinism "duggalsu: something like that ne"> OK, seems like gotify is a popular alternative currently,  will look at it and see if its worthwhile integrating
11:52:20 <dazinism> duggalsu: its not really necessary to have an alternative centralised push server
11:52:36 <duggalsu[m]> * OK, seems like gotify is a popular alternative currently,  will look at it and see if it can be integrated
11:52:56 <duggalsu[m]> * OK, seems like gotify is a popular alternative currently,  will look at it and see if it can be integrated
11:52:58 <dazinism> Just need apps to implement their own decent push notifications
11:53:27 <dazinism> Like Telegram, WhatsApp, Conversations does
11:53:52 <dazinism> Then have an app which synchronises the device wakeup
11:53:55 <duggalsu[m]> won't that be more work for each app developer?
11:54:21 <dazinism> So they don't all do that at their own tempo and waste battery
11:55:13 <dazinism> The apps would have to talk to the synchronisation app
11:55:52 <dazinism> <duggalsu[m] "won't that be more work for each"> Someone could name an open source library that does this
11:55:59 <dazinism> *could make
11:56:36 <dazinism> Apps could include that
11:57:09 <dazinism> Or copy the open source implementation from conversations
11:57:51 <duggalsu[m]> I think the gotify app works that way, haven't tried it myself
11:58:05 <dazinism> Whatever way needs work from the messenger developer to support push - weather its gotify/open push or their own
11:58:37 <dazinism> *whether
11:59:00 <duggalsu[m]> Ok
11:59:10 <duggalsu[m]> Thanks
12:01:35 <fragaria[m]> I've seen a video from the "techlore" channel ( https://tube.privacytools.io/videos/watch/0a806760-29fb-4653-8146-c3e599a34545 ), that made few benchmarks between grapheneOS, calyxOS and Stock; and it shows that grapheneOS is slower than the others, i was curious why..
12:02:26 <somenerd[m]> cool
12:02:34 <somenerd[m]> I didn't know that he uploaded
12:11:13 <somenerd[m]> also, I think it's because of the hardening in the ROM
12:14:31 <somenerd[m]>  * also, I think it's because of the hardening in the ROM (btw, this is I THINK, not KNOW, and I have no sources yet about this)
12:16:02 <somenerd[m]>  * also, I think it's because of the hardening in the ROM (btw, this is I THINK, not I KNOW, and I have no sources yet about this)
12:16:31 <nscnt> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory
12:27:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <fragaria[m] "I've seen a video from the "tech"> He is benchmarking the wrong things
12:29:23 <somenerd[m]> wdym?
12:34:54 <fragaria[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "He is benchmarking the wrong thi"> what should he have benchmarked? and why the area that he have benchmarked are slower?
12:39:05 <somenerd[m]> yeah
12:40:10 <nscnt> Regarding app opening see https://grapheneos.org/usage#exec-spawning
12:41:20 <somenerd[m]> oh yeah
12:41:43 <somenerd[m]> I think the 3a is the only one with this problem
12:42:45 <alex-resist> I have to say it's really not that bad on the 3a, unless you're very impatient
12:43:01 <alex-resist> Everyone should be able to handle a few 100 ms delay
12:44:55 <somenerd[m]> yeah, and like the 4a is better (and even the 2)
12:45:09 <somenerd[m]> but the other benchmarks idk
12:48:11 <nscnt> I have the Pixel 3a, too. The spawning is totally fine
12:48:43 <nscnt> I use dark mode for everything. When it's dark and I spawn an app, I'll be blinded for a few ms, but whatever
12:49:09 <nscnt> White screen before it spawns in dark mode
12:50:05 <nscnt> That's the budget hardware I bought. It's stupid to except something different. Maybe use your phone less in general if you're pissed by that
12:50:16 <nscnt> *expect
12:54:29 <somenerd[m]> hmmmm
13:00:22 <somenerd[m]> > That's the budget hardware I bought. It's stupid to except something different. Maybe use your phone less in general if you're pissed by that
13:00:22 <somenerd[m]> yeah, stock/calyx works better though
13:00:41 <somenerd[m]> and so it's a bit understandable (for the average person)
13:03:25 <fragaria[m]> <nscnt "That's the budget hardware I bou"> i just asked why is slower, i'm not pissed by that, i'm just curious; the Exec spawning solved one mystery
13:03:26 <nscnt> Define "works better". GrapheneOS implements a spawning that's more secure. That's better for me
13:04:49 <nscnt> fragaria[m]: Yea, sure. The being "pissed" wasn't addressed to you. Just in general
13:05:17 <somenerd[m]> I meant from a different perspective : performance
13:05:23 <somenerd[m]>  * I meant that from a different perspective : performance
13:06:32 <somenerd[m]> like (for the average user) the phone running faster is a bit more important than permission models.
13:07:20 <somenerd[m]> (emphasis on "for the average user" because for security minded people, the compromise may be worth it)
13:19:27 <redu321[m]> I want to buy a pixel phone pure for one chat messenger. No other apps. I am thininking between a pixel 4 or a pixel 3a. I may have asked this before but what phone is better for using with graphene os for coming year max 2 years? I just want safety i dont need fancy cameras or nice display. Is the pixel 3a then the best value for me? Or is the pixel 4 better security?
13:21:08 <somenerd[m]> 4a I think is supported?
13:22:00 <revelation1318[m> <somenerd[m] "like (for the average user) the "> I'm always wondering what the average user really is though. I, and most people I know, don't do anything demanding on the phone.
13:22:53 <somenerd[m]> hmm
13:22:57 <strcat[m]> 🍓🍓🍓: do you understand that GrapheneOS implements substantial privacy and security hardening?
13:23:22 <strcat[m]> CalyxOS and the stock OS use an insecure spawning model copying the same template for each app which causes substantial security regressions and some privacy issues
13:23:37 <strcat[m]> seems you don't understand that GrapheneOS is a privacy and security project
13:23:41 <strcat[m]> not just a branded build of AOSP
13:24:02 <strcat[m]> techlore has a grudge against the project and spreads spin and attacks on it
13:24:10 <strcat[m]> he's incredibly biased and acts maliciously
13:24:30 <somenerd[m]> "grudge"? He suggested people to try GrapheneOS first
13:24:41 <strcat[m]> he made an installation video against our wishes and holds a grudge since we didn't applaud it
13:24:42 <somenerd[m]> and then see if it fit them or not
13:25:06 <somenerd[m]> hmm
13:25:13 <fragaria[m]> strcat: i know that, i was just asking what is slowing these benchmarks, and btw isn't necessary to be aggressive about it
13:25:17 <somenerd[m]> what about The Hated One?
13:25:31 <strcat[m]> 🍓🍓🍓: nothing aggressive is happening
13:25:44 <strcat[m]> somenerd: I suggest finding better sources than non-technical 'influencers'
13:25:52 <somenerd[m]> hmm
13:26:01 <strcat[m]> this is off-topic for this channel
13:26:17 <somenerd[m]> yeah moving to the off topic room
13:26:37 <somenerd[m]> (for the "influencer" conversation)
13:26:40 <strcat[m]> redu321: there is an FAQ section on recommended devices: 4, 4 XL, 4a, don't buy a past generation device
13:26:45 <strcat[m]>  * redu321: there is an FAQ section on recommended devices: 4, 4 XL, 4a, don't buy an older generation device
13:27:09 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
13:27:49 <strcat[m]> 🍓🍓🍓: https://grapheneos.org/usage#exec-spawning about application spawning time
13:28:07 <fragaria[m]> strcat: alright.. i agree that seems quite biased, but my question is why in that kind of benchmark is slower
13:28:09 <strcat[m]> using the Zygote spawning model has substantial security problems
13:28:24 <fragaria[m]> <strcat[m] "🍓🍓🍓: https://grapheneos.org/u"> yeah , i've already read that
13:28:26 <strcat[m]> 🍓🍓🍓: read the https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc documentation too
13:28:39 <strcat[m]> okay so you know why application spawning is slower
13:28:55 <strcat[m]> and you can read the documentation on our other privacy and security features
13:29:12 <strcat[m]> including hardened_malloc which provides substantial protections against the most common vulnerabilities (heap corruption vulnerabilities)
13:29:28 <strcat[m]> the whole point of GrapheneOS is providing these privacy and security features
13:29:45 <strcat[m]> that's the basics of what the project is
13:29:57 <strcat[m]> it's not a branded build of AOSP
13:30:06 <strcat[m]> I think our documentation explains this well including the content on the main page
13:31:02 <redu321[m]> <strcat[m] "redu321: there is an FAQ section"> ""The Pixel 3a and 3a XL are budget devices meeting the same security standards as the more expensive flagship devices""You should get one of the budget devices if these things aren't compelling to you.""Does this mean that if i dont care about
13:31:07 <strcat[m]> the video you posted is spin from someone with a grudge against the project who is not presenting the topic in an at all neutral, fair or accurate fair
13:31:16 <strcat[m]> redu321: read the earlier content in the section
13:31:20 <strcat[m]> again, get a 4, 4 XL or 4a
13:31:27 <strcat[m]> do not buy an older generation device
13:31:32 <redu321[m]> <redu321[m] """The Pixel 3a and 3a XL are bud"> good camera or fast prosessor i just can buy a pixel 3a for good security?
13:31:40 <strcat[m]> redu321: no, read the FAQ section in full
13:31:46 <strcat[m]> don't read only the part that appeals to you
13:32:24 <redu321[m]> <strcat[m] "redu321: no, read the FAQ sectio"> Yess i see. What is the differnce in security between like a pixel 4 or a pixel 3a if i may ask?
13:32:44 <strcat[m]> better hardware, firmware and kernel security
13:32:46 <strcat[m]> longer support
13:33:10 <redu321[m]> Allright thank you
13:33:12 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 and 2 XL will soon be end-of-life and 3, 3 XL and then 3a will be considered legacy devices
13:33:29 <fragaria[m]> strcat: yeah, i know that the video isn't a technical one, and it is biased, if not i wasn't asking here the reasons of that benchmark results
13:33:34 <strcat[m]> 3a also doesn't have a proper SSD which doesn't mix well with some of our security features
13:33:55 <strcat[m]> 🍓🍓🍓: hardening features
13:34:08 <redu321[m]> allright tnx
13:34:10 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/README.md is good reading
13:34:18 <strcat[m]> and that's just one of the things we ship
13:34:27 <strcat[m]> we ship hardened_malloc in the default very security-focused configuration too
13:34:43 <strcat[m]> security vs. performance compromises are something that have to be made a lot
13:34:45 <mrxx_0[m]> strcat: Do you think we can expect the same "performance" with the 4a compared to the 3a ? 4a hasn't a high end cpu
13:34:51 <fragaria[m]> strcat: alright i'll try to read better the doc
13:35:04 <strcat[m]> 4a will have substantially better performance than a 3a
13:35:10 <strcat[m]> our documentation recommends buying a 4, 4 XL or 4a
13:35:18 <strcat[m]> cannot recommend enough against buying a past generation device
13:35:24 <strcat[m]> you aren't saving money when you get a year less of support
13:35:50 <strcat[m]> I'll delete the old content talking about the 3 / 3 XL vs. 3a since that's apparently confusing
13:36:04 <mrxx_0[m]> Yeah yeah I read what you said, it was by simple curiosity
13:36:06 <strcat[m]> only need to compare the recommended current devices
13:37:10 <redu321[m]> I was just wondering because the price between a pixel 4 and a pixel 3a is different and i only wanted to use 1 application on the phone. But if u say that there is a big different in security i will consider the pixel 4.strcat
13:37:46 <mrxx_0[m]> <strcat[m] "I'll delete the old content talk"> Yes I think it is, 3/3XL are two years old now
13:38:51 <mrxx_0[m]> People are looking to price instead of hardware/support when comparing 3/3XL/3a vs 4/4XL/4a
13:39:58 <mrxx_0[m]> They want (not everytime) a cheaper solution without thinking about the benefit to get the new generation
13:40:31 <strcat[m]> redu321: compare a Pixel 4a to a 3a, not a Pixel 4 to a 3a
13:41:00 <strcat[m]> you're comparing an expensive high end device with a mid tier device
13:41:15 <strcat[m]> the Pixel 4a is the only budget device to consider for GrapheneOS
13:41:26 <strcat[m]> there is nothing cheaper supported
13:41:38 <strcat[m]> we can mark 3, 3 XL and 3a as legacy devices on the site if that would help make things clearer
13:43:02 <redu321[m]> Allright tnx
13:47:58 <alex-resist> strcat as a user of a 3a, I would disagree. Second hand it's available for much cheaper than the 4a and it still has over 1.5 years of support left. I agree with the recommendation for the 4a, but I would only mark devices as "legacy" if they have less than one year of support left.
13:48:46 <somenerd[m]> yeah but 1.5 isn't helpful to new users
13:48:52 <somenerd[m]> only problem
13:49:00 <redu321[m]> <alex-resist "strcat as a user of a 3a, I woul"> strcat: How do you look at this?
13:49:01 <alex-resist> That's why it wouldn't be recommended. But it's not yet legacy
13:49:11 <somenerd[m]> yeah
14:00:41 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: we marked the Pixel 2 and 2 XL that way to substantial security improvements on the newer devices
14:00:50 <strcat[m]> and due to the lack of maintenance for them and lack of focus on them
14:01:00 <strcat[m]> + they were nearing end-of-life
14:16:00 <algebro[m]> Has anyone been having issues with the pixel 3 rebooting randomly since the last stable update? My device has suddenly rebooted without warning 6 or 7 times in the last few days
14:16:25 <algebro[m]> Haven't found a rhyme or reason to it yet, curious if its just me before I start digging
14:23:17 <fuchs[m]> Hi, I will switch with my pixel 3 to GraphenOS but read that there are obviously no G apps but also the push service not available for the OS.
14:23:17 <fuchs[m]> How are you using the elements app or Telegram on your device? I've had the issue in the early development phase of riot.im that the app was using to much battery because of no push service.
14:24:41 <alzxjm[m]> fuchs: The F-Droid version of Element has fine-grained battery settings. I have found that notifications are timely, and Element never gets above 1-3% battery usage by the end of the day on my Pixel 4 XL.
14:24:55 <alzxjm[m]> (I don't know that the Play Store/Aurora version of Element doesn't have those settings, btw.)
14:25:46 <alzxjm[m]> fuchs: Settings > Notifications > Background synchronization > Background sync mode > Optimized for battery
14:26:09 <alzxjm[m]> I don't use Telegram.
14:26:38 <fuchs[m]> alzxjm:  but I don't uses the push functionally right?
14:26:38 <fuchs[m]> The client is requesting new messages at the server?
14:26:43 <alex-resist> Afaik Telegram, Signal, Conversations and apparently also Element work fine without Google services
14:27:47 <fuchs[m]> But that's good news, because switching the OS is important to me.
14:27:47 <fuchs[m]> Just a bit afraid of the process. 😂
14:29:27 <projectmoon> Element's battery friendly notifications are relatively recent
14:29:35 <projectmoon> But they work mostly fine yes
14:31:29 <fuchs[m]> Thanks for the confirmation guys.
14:32:11 <fuchs[m]> Any Tipps for a bloody beginner in installing new OSs to phones?
14:33:16 <alzxjm[m]> fuchs: Really pay attention to the install guide and make sure that when you call fastboot and adb it's pointing to the correct versions.
14:33:54 <alzxjm[m]> Lots of people get hung up on this. They follow the instructions to obtain the newest/correct version of fastboot but either skip or misuse the $PATH modifications and end up calling the fastboot installed by the system's package manager.
14:34:07 <alzxjm[m]> fuchs: What OS are you using to flash GrapheneOS?
14:34:33 <fuchs[m]> Ubuntu 20.04
14:35:12 <alzxjm[m]> fuchs: Use the [install guide](https://grapheneos.org/install) and pass the commands to the letter.
14:35:27 <alzxjm[m]> Be careful about that and you will be fine.
14:36:04 <alzxjm[m]> It can be intimidating the first time you flash a different OS but Pixels (as I understand it) are fairly hard to brick and are forgiving. Please feel free to PM me for help.
14:38:31 <projectmoon> Cable also important. I have many cables, but only one A to C seems to work for flashing the 4a.
14:38:41 <fuchs[m]> alzxjm: that's nice, thank you!
14:38:41 <fuchs[m]> I can just start tonight CET, if I have a bit of time to concentrate.
14:38:49 <clox[m]> The installation went very well. I just only left the signify out since I did had difficulty to install that properly with linuxmunt.
14:38:49 <clox[m]> But overall I am very happy with grapheneos and easy to use
14:38:59 <clox[m]> Keep on the good working guys
14:39:26 <alzxjm[m]> <projectmoon "Cable also important. I have man"> I'm happy my machine has a USB-C port so I can use the stock cable.
14:40:04 <projectmoon> i tried using the usb-c cable, but it didn't work. although that wasn't for graphene. might depend on the usb-c port as well. fastboot is very finicky
14:40:29 <fuchs[m]> Ubuntu: package is both broken and out-of-date, do not use (see paragraph above)
14:40:45 <fuchs[m]> So, what to use them? ADB?
14:41:23 <projectmoon> download a newer version of the platform tools
14:43:32 <alzxjm[m]> fuchs: It means don't use `android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot` or whatever to get `fastboot` and `adb`
14:43:44 <alzxjm[m]>  * fuchs: It means don't use `apt install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot` or whatever to get `fastboot` and `adb`
14:44:46 <alzxjm[m]> The versions of `fastboot` and `adb` which would be installed by Ubuntu's package manager are outdated and will potentially cause a failure.
14:44:53 <fuchs[m]> Aah, so the repo packages are out of date. Got it
14:45:35 <alzxjm[m]> Follow [these instructions](https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools) instead, making sure to run `export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"` after you download the tools.
14:46:16 <alzxjm[m]> Make sure to run `fastboot --version` and (optionally) `which adb` afterward to make sure that `adb` and `fastboot` call the versions you have just installed.
15:20:47 <user51[m]> I am running Graphene on a Pixel 3a
15:21:31 <user51[m]> There seems to be a volume control bug
15:26:33 <user51[m]> After connecting my bluetooth headset (Plantronics PLT E50) the volume control changes only during the first 5 steps
15:26:56 <user51[m]> the remaining 20 steps dont work
15:27:39 <user51[m]> The problem persists after disconnecting thr headset, until the phone is rebooted
15:32:24 <user51[m]> i would like to file a bug
15:32:38 <user51[m]> Any idea how to obtain the error log?
16:36:30 <NorbertTretkowsk> Got my new work phone, a Pixel 4a yesterday, installed GrapheneOS, realized how smooth it works, and just made a donation. Thanks guys!
16:36:58 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> Nice
16:37:32 <makingaliasesisa> yeah i love graphene. i haven't had any problems with my 4a yet.
16:39:25 <NorbertTretkowsk> On my Pixel 3 the camera app crashed from time to time, haven't had this issue with my 4a yet...

18:09:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> What else did it say?
18:10:52 <Schnyd> Thats all, when I run the script by double clicking, it opens and closes. The above is what I see when I run it from the command line.
18:29:16 <busysec[m]> Hey Everyone. I'm planning on getting a 4a 5G. Will the 4a image work on that?
18:33:10 <mrxx_0[m]> <busysec[m] "Hey Everyone. I'm planning on ge"> No, they are different devices
18:54:05 <strcat> busysec[m]: no, 4a 5G is a different phone
18:54:38 <strcat> they are as different as a Pixel 4 and Pixel 4a
18:55:10 <strcat> it should be called the Pixel 5a
18:55:14 <strcat> I don't know why they used that stupid naming
18:58:42 <Schnyd> Are there instructions to manually flash instead of relying on the script? When looking at the script I feel like I could just work my way through the fastboot commands.
19:01:01 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: that won't help you
19:01:14 <strcat[m]> if your fastboot is genuinely too old that is a problem
19:01:18 <strcat[m]> it's good that the script is telling you
19:01:24 <strcat[m]> it also reports that error if you don't have fastboot at all
19:01:40 <strcat[m]> you need to follow the instructions at https://grapheneos.org/install as written there, in a single shell, not across multiple
19:01:52 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you closed it and now fastboot isn't in PATH so you don't have a usable fastboot command
19:01:59 <strcat[m]> it is not enough to have fastboot somewhere on your computer
19:02:14 <strcat[m]> you have to follow what's written there to add it to the PATH of the current shell and then use it in that shell
19:02:43 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have you install anything or make any permanent changes to your environment
19:02:53 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't make sense to do that with that platform-tools zip
19:03:08 <Schnyd> I understand, but I did just use it to unlock the boot loader, and the platform tools are freshly downloaded from google.
19:03:19 <strcat[m]> there is a self-updating SDK which can be used with or without Android Studio and which can install packages like that platform-tools package and keep them updated
19:03:37 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: doesn't mean you have a working fastboot in the shell you're trying to use now
19:03:46 <strcat[m]> run `fastboot --version` there
19:03:49 <strcat[m]> per instructions
19:04:02 <Schnyd> fastboot version 30.0.4-6686687
19:15:13 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: so what happens when you run ./flash-all.bat
19:15:15 <strcat[m]> in that shell
19:15:42 <strcat[m]> same shell

19:21:35 <redu321[m]> I see that the pixel 4a is experimental. What does that mean? The auditor app is not working i see but is the security etc good like the other pixel 4 devices?

19:26:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> No not yet
19:30:13 <carlpoppa> hey, is it safe to install from a live usb?
19:43:23 <redu321[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "No not yet"> When is it safe to use a pixel 4a with graphene? Already a date for that?
19:45:22 <Schnyd> <strcat[m]> I'm going to delete everything and start from scratch. I must have missed something. Thank you for the help.
19:51:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <redu321[m] "When is it safe to use a pixel 4"> It's safer than stock already

20:25:14 <ruski[m]> for gcam i think you'll need microg

20:29:37 <ruski[m]> by "maintain my own build" do you mean that you manually install updates?
20:30:03 <Dylanger[m]> Build Graphene, manually apply required patches and sign myself
20:32:31 <fuchs[m]> and what does that mean for a non techy person?  😇
20:33:55 <Dylanger[m]> That means
20:33:55 <Dylanger[m]> "No soup for you"
20:34:16 <louipc> in what language
20:34:32 <Dylanger[m]> Lol you probably shouldn't do what I'm doing, goes against the ethos of Graphene, I'm just doing it because I'm happy with trade off
20:35:03 <fuchs[m]> ok
20:35:31 <fuchs[m]> but, to come back to my question:
20:35:31 <fuchs[m]> is there a better camera app you can suggest?
20:37:28 <louipc> 'Open camera'?
20:37:45 <ruski[m]> open camera is like 60% as good as gcam
20:37:52 <ruski[m]> but the UI is awful
20:38:35 <ruski[m]> but you need to go into its settings, scroll to the bottom, select Camera API, and choose Camera2API
20:41:09 <louipc> ouch
20:41:51 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: Signal notifications work fine on official GrapheneOS
20:41:59 <ruski[m]>  * you need to go into its settings, scroll to the bottom, select Camera API, and choose Camera2API
20:41:59 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: as do most other open source apps
20:42:31 <strcat[m]> it's quite strange that Protonmail implemented custom support for FCM while not support IMAP's standard push system
20:42:45 <strcat[m]> perhaps they don't even use IMAP at all
20:43:05 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah Protonmail is important, I missed some important ones a few days ago
20:43:12 <Dylanger[m]> That and Threema
20:43:16 <jpds> strcat[m]: They don't: https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/imap-smtp-and-pop3-setup/
20:43:18 <Dylanger[m]> Polling sucks
20:43:37 <louipc> i think they have imap now, but they used to not have any imap or anything
20:44:18 <louipc> oh bridging app
20:45:00 <ruski[m]> <louipc "ouch"> 60% is a compliment btw
20:45:46 <louipc> ouch²
20:46:04 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: really no need for mail clients to do polling though
20:46:16 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of email apps with IMAP IDLE support
20:46:16 <Dylanger[m]> Threema polls
20:46:36 <louipc> just need to check. when you check your phone :p
20:47:14 <Dylanger[m]> <louipc "just need to check. when you che"> Lol this isn't my workflow, personally anyway

21:13:38 <fuchs[m]> You mean this?
21:36:57 <Dylanger[m]> GCam should just work, if you `adb install` it
21:44:27 <projectmoon> and then it doesn't need the gcam services provider?
21:50:55 <fuchs[m]> hm, no this is not what i was searching for
21:51:16 <fuchs[m]> this is what i need:
21:51:17 <fuchs[m]> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera
21:51:39 <fuchs[m]> can it be used without worried about my data?
21:53:30 <coffeebag[m]> Trying to build Gallery2, do i also need 16Go ram minimum if i want to build it ?
21:54:02 <coffeebag[m]> If i can't have 16Go RAM, which are my options ?
21:55:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <coffeebag[m] "Trying to build Gallery2, do i a"> For the first build yes
21:55:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> You need to build some of the runtime as a minimum
21:56:12 <coffeebag[m]> argh
21:56:31 <coffeebag[m]> i will try something

22:13:05 <alzxjm[m]> fuchs: https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
22:13:06 <alzxjm[m]> Install that.
22:13:13 <alzxjm[m]> I believe only Google Camera v7.4 worka.
22:13:16 <alzxjm[m]> works.
22:13:22 <alzxjm[m]> I think v7.5 does not.
22:14:34 <Wonderfall[m]> <alzxjm[m] "I think v7.5 does not."> It does now (only on Android 11).
22:16:00 <alzxjm[m]> Wonderfall: how? Mine doesn't.
22:16:16 <alzxjm[m]> version 7.5.107.326355469
22:16:26 <fuchs[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Install that."> OK, an now?
22:16:46 <fuchs[m]> The camera apk?
22:17:30 <Wonderfall[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Wonderfall: how? Mine doesn't."> Update "GCam Services Provider", it was recently updated. I compile it from source personally
22:19:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just install microg
22:19:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then uninstall it when you're done
22:20:41 <fuchs[m]> it works
22:29:45 <alzxjm[m]> Wonderfall: thanks!
22:39:39 <coffeebag[m]> Youhou build completed :DDD
