00:08:23 <strcat[m]> no
00:08:41 <strcat[m]> Android and ChromiumOS both run on x86
00:08:55 <strcat[m]> verified boot on x86 is problematic on most hardware though, doesn't really work well
00:09:15 <strcat[m]> Chromebooks are designed for it
00:09:27 <strcat[m]> Windows only has good verified boot if you count the xbox as Windows
00:09:32 <strcat[m]> it's a work in progress for laptops
00:09:53 <strcat[m]> but it's making progress
00:10:03 <strcat[m]> needs to be one of their 'secured core' laptops to have any hope
00:10:03 <strcat[m]> otherwise it's a hardware issue
00:10:31 <concat[m]> Forgot to state specifically for desktop equating Android out. I didn't really know ChromiumOS verified boot on x86 to be honest.
00:11:34 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "needs to be one of their 'secure"> Yeah I've heard some hype about the secured core laptops
00:12:39 <strcat[m]> ChromiumOS is just what they build ChromeOS from with their added stuff
00:12:46 <alzxjm[m]1> So does CloudReady get the blessing from the Graphene community?
00:12:56 <strcat[m]> just like AOSP vs stock OS but much less different
00:12:57 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: no
00:13:22 <concat[m]> what's wrong with CloudReady
00:14:32 <strcat[m]> the same reason putting current AOSP on a Nexus 5 doesn't make it secure
00:15:00 <strcat[m]> all of this is off-topic and getting boring anyway
00:17:13 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "the same reason putting current "> Sure, but I'm not sure that is exactly an accurate equivalence. You still have the ChromiumOS security model and (some) verified boot. For desktop it's a severe upgrade from Linux.
00:17:31 <concat[m]> You still have the virtualized Crostini environment
00:18:08 <strcat[m]> you don't get verified boot without proper hardware support
00:18:09 <strcat[m]> which most machines don't really have
00:18:09 <strcat[m]> and as I said
00:18:10 <strcat[m]> it's like putting current AOSP on a Nexus 5 in most cases
00:18:12 <strcat[m]> the purpose of it is flawed
00:18:39 <strcat[m]> hardware without firmware updates, etc. isn't fixed by putting another OS on it
00:19:39 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "hardware without firmware update"> That's not why people use CloudReady
00:19:54 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "you don't get verified boot with"> CloudReady does support some of the security features that comprise Verified Boot
00:19:56 <strcat[m]> concat: also seems verified boot is totally broken for them
00:20:19 <strcat[m]> concat: they allow disabling it - so how the hell is it supposed to work when it can be disabled from persistent state?
00:20:20 <strcat[m]> they allow disabling it from the OS
00:20:28 <strcat[m]> and they have transitions to root within the OS
00:21:22 <strcat[m]> why would an attacker care about verified boot if there's a switch in persistent state to turn it off
00:22:27 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "they allow disabling it *from th"> You mean disabling rootfs with crosh?
00:22:57 <strcat[m]> disabling it at all via persistent state
00:23:03 <strcat[m]> means it was never doing anything in the first place
00:23:57 <concat[m]> Ok, can you show me that?
00:24:10 <strcat[m]> show you what
00:24:49 <strcat[m]> they document that it can be disabled within the OS persistently
00:24:57 <strcat[m]> and it's apparent that the OS exposes persistent root access too
00:25:05 <strcat[m]> so there's no meaningful verified boot
00:25:27 <concat[m]> I haven't seen that in their documentation.
00:25:52 <strcat[m]> and if that's the approach - i.e. security theater and pretending to have features while having a totally useless implementation with a switch for the attacker to turn it off when they have the control that the feature is supposed to contain
00:25:53 <concat[m]> If that's true, then that does suck. But would that negate all of the other system hardening?
00:26:09 <strcat[m]> when they completely ruin stuff like this in such an obvious way
00:26:22 <strcat[m]> doesn't bode well for the rest of it
00:26:35 <strcat[m]> makes it apparent they don't care / don't know what they're doing
00:27:08 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "they document that it can be dis"> Do you have a link to the documentation you're referring to? I tried doing some searching, didn't find it there.

00:28:55 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "makes it apparent they don't car"> If that's true, regardless I'm unclear how this ultimately rejects the virtualized Crostini environment and ChromiumOS own security model which for the most part to my knowledge hasn't been tampered with. I'm taking what you're saying with consideration as well.
00:29:04 <strcat[m]> https://cloudreadykb.neverware.com/s/article/Disabling-RootFS-Verification?r=5&ui-force-components-controllers-recordGlobalValueProvider.RecordGvp.getRecord=1
00:30:02 <strcat[m]> what I'm saying is when they so obviously break the entire purpose of a core security feature
00:30:06 <concat[m]> strcat Yeah, so that's with crosh that I asked you earlier.
00:30:07 <strcat[m]> that doesn't bode well for the rest of it
00:30:39 <radixed9[m]> This is the impression I got of CloudReady too. They are not entirely sure what they are doing. They are based on a solid base. I am concerned they will mess up their Android support
00:30:49 <strcat[m]> concat: having a way to disable it within the OS means it has a branch on persistent state to decide if it should use it
00:30:54 <strcat[m]> therefore the feature doesn't work
00:31:38 <concat[m]> <radixed9[m] "This is the impression I got of "> They're just porting ARC++ for Android support, I thought.
00:32:29 <strcat[m]> there's a reason you can't unlock the bootloader inside AOSP, and there's a reason why unlocking wipes data
00:33:40 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "concat: having a way to disable "> You need developer mode to do this
00:34:42 <concat[m]> Without developer mode you can't disable the verity
00:35:29 <strcat[m]> chromebooks have special hardware support to deal with that stuff
00:36:59 <TheJollyRoger> hmm. Wonder if there's something special or special arguments that need to be passed to ./build.sh for coral? I'm getting this: https://jollyrogers.ca/public/coral-build.txt
00:37:15 <concat[m]> So if an attacker can get developer mode on CloudReady then it's game over already, not just verified boot. Developer mode in general adds so much attack surface
00:37:52 <strcat[m]> concat: they have developer mode by default
00:37:58 <strcat[m]> also an attacker doesn't need to 'get it'
00:38:14 <strcat[m]> you seem to be missing the whole point of verified boot
00:38:40 <concat[m]> strcat No they don't.
00:38:51 <strcat[m]> Chromebooks have special hardware support to implement developer mode
00:39:01 <concat[m]> strcat My developer mode has always been disabled, and I tried disabling verity just now.
00:39:03 <concat[m]> strcat I launched crosh and I am running as a yellow uesr

00:48:25 <strcat[m]> you can't do configuration to change this
00:48:27 <strcat[m]> that's the whole point
00:48:39 <strcat[m]> that misses the point of verified boot
00:48:45 <concat[m]> Must've done something to get the ``shell`` to malfunction
00:49:04 <concat[m]> If the documentation contradicts that
00:49:23 <strcat[m]> you're assuming that other hardening is still in place as it would be
00:49:28 <strcat[m]> and that they use comparable kernels, etc.
00:49:33 <strcat[m]> I'm not going to make that assumption
00:49:45 <strcat[m]> especially when I can see verified boot is not intact
00:50:01 <radixed9[m]> That's why I don't recommend ChromiumOS
00:50:01 <concat[m]> strcat Me and my friend have grep'd a good amount of their work.
00:50:01 <strcat[m]> anyway it's not a discussion I want to have - it's off-topic
00:50:11 <defconanon12[m]> So I have a question is it true that Tor Project and Graphene are working close together or is that just a rumor?
00:50:26 <concat[m]> Not to be anecdotal but for the most part almost everything seems identical

00:50:55 <defconanon12[m]> strcat: Thanks for the clarification.
00:50:56 <strcat[m]> on Chromebook there is hardware support for the hardware-based security features

00:54:50 <TheJollyRoger> If the device is compromised to the point you need to physically keep it isolated physically, you might as well use thermate, because then it could simply store what it wants to exfiltrate, wait until it gets reception again, and then dial out.

02:58:12 <defconanon12[m]> I am probably just going to stick with the desktop Discord it is more user friendly and can work on it better.
02:59:19 <defconanon12[m]> I used Tails. Just never had a reason to use Mat2.

05:52:01 <greenmoon[m]> I'm just using that open source app Simple Camera there is an option to take pictures without saving Exit data, but not sure if the photo quality is the best

07:42:51 <dazinism> interceptingfist: had a look at the multiple users toggle. It apparently doesnt shut down active user profiles, just hides the icon to select them.
07:45:08 <dazinism> Think the safe/easy way to shut down user profiles is to restart the phone.
08:11:48 <dazinism> Flicking the toggle at the bottom of the work profile app draw does kill everything running in the work profile
08:24:57 <dazinism> > The freezing is a client side check don't expect much
08:25:54 <dazinism> cn3m: thing I found interesting is how much shelter froozen apps disappear from the OS.
08:26:23 <dazinism> Dont show up in the app draw, or in settings>apps
08:29:00 <dazinism> But yes, the big issue with work profile / shelter is that shelter app has device admin permission for the work profile. Has more power there than the user.
08:29:29 <dazinism> Shelter being compromised would be very bad for anything running there.
08:37:50 <dazinism> <dazinism "cn3m: thing I found interesting "> Also worth considering other apps in the work profile can't see them when they are frozen.

09:41:26 <athyla> hey guys! a quick question. I have a Pixel 3 running GrapheneOS. When the phone starts up there is a warning saying that a custom OS is about to start on the phone. Is this normal or have I done something wrong when setting up GrapheneOS?
09:42:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> "athyla" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_athyla:matrix.org): no all is fine

11:12:40 <hitchhooker[m]> Since trust is not needed between the device and the server, updates work well over VPNs and Tor.
11:12:40 <hitchhooker[m]> What its this supposed to mean?

13:37:30 <jfbourdeau> K9 notification problem : I am having a hard time to have k9 mail sent me notification on new eMail when phone is Locked / not used. Battery savin is off, k9 is setup to Fetch email every minute but still, When the screen is turned off/phone locked, my new GrapheneOS Pixel 3a install is perfect except for not getting my new eMail notification.   And k9 sometime show Sycning disabled....  Anyone has went trough this and have some steps I could check ?
13:37:30 <jfbourdeau> it's something basic but crucial to me.
13:38:07 <jfbourdeau> Noobie question I know...
13:38:17 <jalb66> jfbourdeau, yes, wait
13:39:00 <jalb66> In the general configuration (I don't know how it is in English language), go to Network and choose Always. Done.
13:39:16 <jalb66> Synchronize in second hand or something like that
13:40:05 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, in k9 (accounts setting or k9 general setting) ? or Setting of Grpahene ?  I am presently looking for it
13:40:14 <jalb66> K-9
13:40:22 <jalb66> General setting
13:40:28 <jfbourdeau> ok found it
13:40:55 <jfbourdeau> I will see how it goes with this setting   Tk you so much jalb66 for taking the time to reply to that simple question...
13:40:55 <jalb66> I think it was that problem, I can't remember very well now, try it
13:41:16 <jfbourdeau> will do tks have an nice day !
13:41:23 <jalb66> In the new version I can't see the Accounts setting
13:41:28 <jalb66> No problem
13:53:26 <jfbourdeau> jalb66,  it's working perfectly well !  tks  I don't have to fect folder every 1 minute as I tried... ONly doimng what you said fixed my problem !  I work from home and now if I go in car or working outside, I won't miss important work emAils because of your help !
13:53:54 <jalb66> jfbourdeau, glad it worked 🙂
13:54:16 <jalb66> I discoverd it some time ago, I was like you before
13:54:25 <jalb66> I discovered it some time ago, I was like you before
14:00:59 <jfbourdeau> now I am testing your setting with Battery saver on... But I think it's not working, so I will turn off Battery saver
14:02:09 <jalb66> jfbourdeau, it works
14:02:19 <jalb66> Ah ok, sorry
14:02:25 <jalb66> I thought you meant about optimizing apps
14:02:32 <jfbourdeau> you mean if battery saver is ON, it should still work ?
14:02:39 <jalb66> NO, sorry, IDN
14:02:53 <jalb66> I mean that I'm optimizing K-9 and it work
14:02:57 <jalb66> I mean that I'm optimizing K-9 and it works
14:03:07 <jalb66> I don't need to make an eception in it
14:03:37 <jfbourdeau> non it doesn't... At least according to my tests. Tks ! I am still happy... About App optimizing, I need to read / play with that ( come from the IOS world... A lord to learn in Android and Graphene)
14:03:59 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, about " I mean that I'm optimizing K-9 and it work " What do you mean it work ?
14:04:30 <jfbourdeau> in settings Battery or somewhere else that Battery Optimizing thing ?
14:06:10 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, where do you that " I mean that I'm optimizing K-9 and it work "  ? And what work ?
14:06:15 <jfbourdeau> not sure to get it...
14:06:32 <jalb66> If you go to Advanced permissions
14:06:37 <jalb66> The first option
14:07:23 <jalb66> Settings - Apps - Advanced - Special access for apps or something like that (IDN in English)
14:07:44 <jalb66> BAttery optimization?... I use Spanish language, sorry
14:08:00 <jfbourdeau> I see it
14:08:14 <jalb66> Normally if you don't want problems you add your app there
14:08:17 <jfbourdeau> so you mean to put my k9 or whatever app I want to run, to "NOT OPTIMISED" ?
14:08:21 <jalb66> But with K9 is not necessary, it works without it
14:08:43 <jalb66> I think it's not optimised, check it
14:09:12 <jfbourdeau> by default it'S " OPTIMISE"  I will set it to not optimise tks !
14:09:36 <jalb66> Sorry, wait
14:09:55 <jalb66> No, it's the opposite
14:10:35 <nikoleos[m]> Hi, is it possible to change the OS accent color in Graphene OS other than green teal one ?
14:10:41 <jalb66> When you want an app (like your messenger app, etc) to be very active you choose Not optimised
14:10:55 <jalb66> In this case, even being K9 optimised, it works well
14:11:25 <jalb66> And it's the default option, you don't need to "Not optimise" this app
14:11:41 <jfbourdeau> in battery, Battery saver on your phnoe,m Battery saver is on or off ?
14:12:16 <jfbourdeau> If Battery Saver is on, then I don't get the notification when phone locked, I " think ", will try again...
14:12:52 <jfbourdeau> now the battery shows in RED at the top right of the screen when battery saver is " ON"
14:13:14 <jalb66> Battery saver?: always off
14:13:52 <jalb66> With battery save on all many background apps won't work correctly, maybe your alarm won't sound, etc
14:13:55 <jfbourdeau> Yes because if On, then when phone locked, k9 do not fetch (get email and do not notify me)
14:14:07 <jfbourdeau> that is what I noticed
14:14:09 <jalb66> With "battery save on"  many background apps won't work correctly, maybe your alarm won't sound, etc
14:14:16 <jfbourdeau> Do you use Whatsapp, Telegram or signal ?
14:14:25 <jalb66> It's something normal
14:14:34 <jalb66> No, Conversations (xmpp)
14:14:52 <jalb66> Using it right now to write here with a bridge from xmpp to irc
14:15:30 <jfbourdeau> xmpp, will google it :-)
14:16:23 <jalb66> https://list.jabber.at/
14:16:29 <jalb66> https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html
14:16:41 <jalb66> Conversations is the best in my opinion
14:17:11 <jalb66> But I use an account from another server (it costs money if you want an account from Conversations server)
14:17:19 <jalb66> F-droid to download the app
14:17:28 <jalb66> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.siacs.conversations
14:18:35 <jfbourdeau> ok taking not tks !!
14:18:58 <jalb66> But Signal is probably the best. The problem is I don t want to give my phone
14:20:32 <jfbourdeau> " The problem is I don t want to give my phone " I understand... I found something recently cool that do not require our phone one sec...
14:21:11 <jalb66> Yes, there are many apps like that, I tested a lot
14:21:39 <jalb66> But in what I need I only use Conversations: some channels, few friends and my wife
14:22:17 <jfbourdeau> https://briarproject.org/how-it-works/   (for Android)
14:22:28 <jalb66> Ah Briar, yes!, very good and decentralized
14:22:32 <jalb66> I tested it
14:22:33 <jfbourdeau> retroshare.cc  ( for Computer Win or Linux)
14:22:37 <jalb66> And loved it
14:22:49 <jalb66> TEsted too, and also qTox in Linux
14:23:36 <jalb66> xmpp is not so safe but in individual messages Omemo as encryption is very good
14:23:52 <jalb66> channels are not encrypt
14:24:06 <jalb66> But you can create a small group (not channel) encrypted
14:24:14 <jalb66> And it's very fast
14:24:23 <jalb66> This app isn't optimised
14:24:31 <jalb66> An exception
14:35:00 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, when we change an App from OPtimized to " not optimized" can we do that with any Apps from what you know ? Of they need to have been coded for it, meaning, "yes we can do it in the interface" but may be not all App can be set to " optimized" ?
14:35:52 <jfbourdeau> Whatsapp ( in Shelter / work profile mode  / isolated) stop updating itself, unless I clicked it.... trying to understand why... May be it simply absolutly need microG to run well in the background ( or when phone locked)
14:36:24 <jalb66> IDN but normally the developer includes a warning to choose the option in the Settings to be Not optimise
14:36:48 <jfbourdeau> ok
14:36:50 <jalb66> Whatsapp needs Google services I think
14:37:00 <jalb66> I don't use Shelter, IDN
14:37:04 <jfbourdeau> I just tried setting Whatsapp to " not optimized " to see if it now work better when phone locked
14:37:44 <jfbourdeau> I am new to android, but the concept behind shelted made sense to me ( not access my contacts, media, etc) so we can isolate an Dangerous App in a more CLOSED environnement
14:37:48 <jalb66> Maybe it's something only Google services can do, if the app includes that code, I don't use it, sorry
14:38:06 <jfbourdeau> but all Apps in the shelter WORK profile /Mode  can all access eachother infos if they try ( are malicious)
14:38:08 <jalb66> Maybe another member could help you with that
14:38:16 <jfbourdeau> ok tks
14:38:23 <jalb66> I use a different user
14:38:30 <jalb66> Only for Tor browser
14:39:05 <jfbourdeau> yes someone told me " Profile", was may be safer than SHELTER... I didn't tried it yet. not even sure how to anyway LOL (Google)
14:40:13 <jfbourdeau> WHATSAPP QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS :  Do some of you use Whatsapp ? I use WhatsApp within Shelter Work profile, and when phone is locked, whatsapp stop updating... I then need to unlock phone, lick whatsapp, and then it update itself...  Anyone was able to find a fix, workaround for that ? I would love to not use it, but TONS of people around me use it for work...
14:40:21 <jalb66> Shelter could be dangerous if you give admin permission
14:41:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> "jalb66" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_jalb66:matrix.org): no
14:42:01 <jfbourdeau> I was guessing than having 2 profiles was complicated, as on a PC' log to the other profile to use this or this app etc... But I should try... We do that in settings, Accounts ? wHERE ? it's even more secure than Shelter I think,... COuld install all my dangerous apps there instead of using shelter
14:42:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> > WHATSAPP QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS :  Do some of you use Whatsapp ? I use WhatsApp within Shelter Work profile, and when phone is locked, whatsapp stop updating...

14:42:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> "lick whatsapp"
14:43:27 <jalb66> anupritaisno1[m],  does shelter has device admin permission for the work profile?
14:43:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Epic
14:43:35 <hitchhooker[m]> using whatsapp in separate profile right now to not be able contacts and files, but its kinda painful for ux
14:43:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
14:43:54 <jfbourdeau> tks anupritaisno1[m] and hitchhooker[m]
14:44:07 <jalb66> anupritaisno1[m], and isn't it dangerous if the app is compromised?
14:44:26 <jfbourdeau> Whatsapp with Shelter ( isolated) is simple and cool...Buty stop updating  if not active
14:44:54 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, "  does shelter has device admin permission for the work profile "  I will look, not  sure where to look though LOL
14:45:30 <jfbourdeau> So what they call WOrk profile (it's all the app in that are dangerous, you put them there)... And those in personal profile have more access ( contacts, media etc)  simple to use...Secure ?  I hope
14:47:58 <jfbourdeau> ANDROID noobie question PROFILE : jalb66 where do we create a 2nd profile, I can google to but as you're already talking about this... I would try to put Whatsapp there to see if it's convenient / easy to use... And easy to move from one profile to the other, if we get notification from apps in the other profile ( surely not... )
14:50:52 <jalb66> System- Advanced- Users
14:51:43 <jfbourdeau> ok LOL Shame on me.... tks
14:52:51 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, and they fastest / easy way to move from one user to the other  is ?
14:53:08 <jfbourdeau> ok I found it
14:53:13 <jfbourdeau> forget it :-)
14:54:25 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, most of the time, when do you use your 2nd user  ? When using dangerous apps or doing " special" stuff ? SO this profile do not acces any of your personal infos ?
14:54:26 <jalb66> Yes, in the place where notifications are 🙂
14:56:17 <jfbourdeau> and last question ( I can move from one user to the other easily now), how do we LOGOUT that user so it doesn't consume CPU, Memory etc ? if we're to not use it for a while ?
14:57:38 <fordude[m]> New grapheneos user here (last night) on Pixel 3 XL
14:58:47 <jfbourdeau> fordude[m], : me tool Pixel 3a.   I am long time IOS user and tried 1 /e/ 1 month on an old MOTO E phone I bought and now just bough a Pixel 3a used and installed GrapheneOS and love it
14:59:06 <jfbourdeau> 1 day old GraphenOS user and 1 month old, android user LOL
14:59:07 <fordude[m]> Any suggestions to get notifications in Slack?  I have to unfortunately for work purposes.
15:00:43 <fordude[m]> Nice jfbourdeau !
15:02:32 <fordude[m]> So far liking GrapheneOS!  Been android user for a long time
15:03:33 <jfbourdeau> SHELTER or 2 profiles ( question experienced Graphene/Android user ) : I am new to Android and Graphene but experience IT consultant ( not at the App level). AM I loosing my time using Shelter to put Apps like FaceBook, WHatsapp, Telegram and ot her in it  ?  or yes, it worth using Shelter ( Better than nothing) so dangerious apps do not access all our personnal info ( Contacts, Phone logs, Media etc) I am sensible to security but still, need a "
15:03:33 <jfbourdeau> functionnal phone LOL"... I am forced, for work to use Whatsapp, Facebook, Messenger, Telegram etc).  So Shelter = " GOOD" or " BAD " ?
15:04:45 <jalb66> jfbourdeau, it consumes ram, the user is active, not possible to logout
15:05:31 <dallemon[m]> <fordude[m] "Any suggestions to get notificat"> No, it only supports GCM/FCM for notifications
15:05:37 <jfbourdeau> ok jalb66  I will continue with Shelter, unless someone tells me it's stupid  / illusion of security / isolation of malicious apps... Shelter is more convenient
15:06:36 <jfbourdeau> dallemon[m],  I am sensible / interested to the " Notification topics" So the right working is : if an app uses GCM / FCM or MicroG( can we say that LOL?) then notifications won't work well ?
15:06:49 <jfbourdeau> I meant Right " wording " dallemon[m]
15:07:12 <jfbourdeau> I am a noobie, but experience IT, trying to learn fast and not bother all of you with noobie question LOL
15:07:50 <fordude[m]> Thanks dallemon!  I may have to investigate some middleware for notifications.
15:08:29 <dallemon[m]> Yes. Many applications have alternative implementations that work fine. But if they only have GCM/FCM then you won't get notifications. Some apps even refuse to work.
15:09:34 <fordude[m]> So far slack works normal.  Just no notifications.
15:09:50 <jalb66> jfbourdeau, it doesn't consume much, it's ok to use another user
15:10:09 <jfbourdeau> ok
15:10:59 <jfbourdeau> dallemon[m], does GCM/FCM = microG ? Or not, an app could run well without microG and GCM/FCM do not need microG ? ( trying to learn )
15:11:41 <jfbourdeau> I am asking that because it will influence which application I install so they work well and notification works well
15:12:18 <jalb66> Maybe you need another system: calyxos, and GrapheneOS is not what you were looking for
15:12:25 <jfbourdeau> if my question si not clear, is GCM/FCM a " microG thing"
15:13:07 <jalb66> microg is like amulation of it
15:13:35 <jalb66> Something to make those apps work, but if you use GrapheneOS maybe you shouldn't use apps with Google services
15:13:53 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, I don't know if you were talking to me but I do like Graphene...   I tried /e/ 3.fundation that is cool but I wanted to go farther / more secure... Even if some Apps would cause problem to me
15:14:38 <jalb66> I mean that Grapheneos doesn't include Google services and you use apps with Google services
15:15:08 <jalb66> SO many ot them will not work or they won't receive notifications
15:16:15 <jalb66> GOS is secure but also avoid Google services
15:16:26 <dallemon[m]> jfbourdeau: MicroG pretends to be Google Play Services, so that most apps that require GSF work without problems. MicroG is incompatible with GrapheneOS.
15:17:13 <dallemon[m]> Many apps that use GSF work fine on GrapheneOS, just without notifications
15:17:21 <jfbourdeau> ok I get it jalb66  but still, will continue with Graphene for now... But so many choices... what are prox and cons of calyxos.org ???? THere are several choices ( Graphene, LineageOS, /e/) LOL  I heard a lot of good about graphese, one of the most secure etc etc...So I went with graphene
15:17:43 <jfbourdeau> ok tks dallemon[m] (notifications)
15:18:12 <jfbourdeau> sorry for my typos !! ( I'm french and typing too fast)
15:19:05 <dallemon[m]> <jfbourdeau "sorry for my typos !! ( I'm fren"> Used to it here, many people do it on purpose to try and reduce tracking.
15:19:33 <jalb66> GOS is more secure, Calyxos has verified boot and other features they share in common but it also uses microg, F-droid, etc: https://calyxos.org/
15:20:06 <jalb66> LineageOS and /e are not secure
15:20:13 <jalb66> LineageOS and /e/ are not secure
15:20:50 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, this is what I though I learned / understood... Tks for confirming... So my choice is Good GOS (tks for the acronym !!)
15:21:14 <jalb66> jfbourdeau, Gos is the best now 😉
15:21:50 <jalb66> But maybe you must change your apps or IDN, sometimes I know it's difficult if you want more privacy but your friends donj't care about it
15:22:02 <jalb66> But maybe you must change your apps or IDN, sometimes I know it's difficult if you want more privacy but your friends don't care about it
15:22:17 <jfbourdeau> the installation steps were even good for a noobie like me ( unlock my boot loader, install, locked back the boot loader etc) If an IOS guy was able to do it, then GOS is not only for " Nerds or programmer / coder"
15:22:43 <jalb66> Yes, I"m no expert but I installed it without problems
15:23:01 <jfbourdeau> yea... Some apps I am forced to keep but try to minimize the risks ( Shelter)....
15:24:53 <jalb66> I was using a Nokia 7.1 disabling Google apps and only apps without Google before 🙂 And I was looking for a more secure OS, so I found GOS
15:25:02 <jalb66> Nokia 7.1: android one
15:25:27 <jfbourdeau> my first Android / e/ experience was with /e/ on an Moto E 2nd generation XT1527, so slow LOL LOL but wanted to see if I liked ANdroid... After 1 month, I was going crazy and bough a pixel 3a   OMG  it runs smoothly. I have some apps that lost some features with GOS but it's tolerable ( Example my TESLA APP ) LOL
15:25:34 <jalb66> Bought a Pixel 3a and installed it
15:25:55 <jalb66> Going root and without verified boot is dangerous
15:25:59 <jalb66> If you value security
15:26:47 <jalb66> ANd more problems like updates, firmware updates, etc
15:26:54 <jfbourdeau> oops not sure to get it jalb66   I bought a used Pixe 3a, as it was listed as compatible and recommended by GOS site, I followed instruction and installed GOS... I am not secure ??
15:27:02 <jalb66> I'm more than happy with GOS 🙂
15:27:19 <jalb66> Yes, of course you are, like me, I did the same
15:27:29 <jalb66> I mean about LIneageOS and /e/
15:27:42 <jfbourdeau> ha ok... ok I agree and now understand.
15:28:35 <jfbourdeau> ok tks all, will talk to you another day... need to work outside, now that my notification works LOL  I learned a lot with you today and took some notes
15:29:30 <jalb66> See you

15:30:55 <nikoleos[m]> Very similar to , i started my degooglesing with /e/ on redmi note 5 pro and a week ago bought a pixel 3a for GrapheneOS
15:32:04 <jfbourdeau> cool nikoleos[m]   similar story ;-)  (I'm from Canada)
15:40:46 <jfbourdeau> jalb66, k9 notificaiton / syncing stopped working LOL :-(   If I find why I will let you know.  If I open it it shows syncing disabled, for I don't know what reason
15:41:08 <jfbourdeau> forn ow I am trying with OPtimise OFF but it doesn't seemed to be the problem
16:01:34 <jalb66> jfbourdeau, you must check the options. Go to the options in your account and check if you have Notify sinchronization enabled
16:01:51 <jalb66> Inside the Notificacions options
16:02:00 <jalb66> But IDN all your other options in K9
16:02:02 <jalb66> Sorry
16:02:55 <jalb66> And also change the time you'll receive them
16:03:19 <jalb66> I hope you have battery saver off
16:05:07 <jalb66> And frequency of verification, mine is at 15 min
16:05:20 <jalb66> Sorry, I must leave now, I'm working
17:16:47 <packetup[m]> <dannyknoll "EteSync, Davx^5, DecSync"> I highly recommend EteSync
17:17:29 <packetup[m]> You can self host if you wish.
17:37:36 <TheJollyRoger-M> anupritaisno1: woah fingers crossed!! Thank you!
17:42:48 <nikoleos[m]> Is it possible to enable voLTE in  GOS and how because i don't find the proper setting
17:47:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> "nikoleos" (https://matrix.to/#/@nikoleos:matrix.org): the setting probably isn't there
17:47:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Set to 4g only and make a call
17:47:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> If the call goes through

18:02:52 <hapssmak[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I personally don't support micro"> Why not?
18:04:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nobody updates it anymore
18:04:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's like it just works
18:04:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Building it is also getting increasingly difficult
18:04:39 <cdesai> isn't that the best kind of software? ;)
18:05:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <hapssmak[m] "Sadly not a choice for everyone."> Mind me asking your usecase? I like to keep a personal list of what apps are holding people hostage to the Goog.
18:05:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not to add there are several breakages that unofficial forks by organizations like nogoolag are trying to fix

18:19:08 <alzxjm[m]1> I have a lot of bill credits on Google Fi, and I have a Pixel 4 XL so I'm kinda stuck on non-Graphene OS's for a bit.
18:20:05 <alzxjm[m]1> Danny@WorkOrderPro: Pretty much just that. Android Auto is nice, too but not a deal-breaker.
18:29:49 <aragorndr[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Mind me asking your usecase? I l"> While I use gos, i really miss my bank app. It was compatible with the major banks from my country. I could send people money throw the phone number. I had discounts or free drinks if I paid with it
18:40:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Not a perfect solution, but for these uses, I carry another device, and turn on/hotspot to it as needed.
19:23:44 <defconanon12[m]> Is there any other ways someone could break out of guest mode other than restarting the phone?

19:40:34 <radixed9[m]> no
19:40:57 <radixed9[m]> You can even use screen pinning
19:42:04 <defconanon12[m]> Well I have that enabled if they turn off my phone. If they were a more technically inclined user they could break the pin. I need to safeguard it more.
19:42:34 <cn3m[m]> The Titan M will rate limit attempts
19:42:51 <cn3m[m]> It would be much easier for your friends to hack you than that tbh
19:42:58 <cn3m[m]> Hidden camera
19:44:09 <defconanon12[m]> What is the limit? All I am seeing is 30 seconds time frame based on the screwed up attempts. Is there a certain point where it wipes the data from the phone?
19:44:17 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: I have something for you.
19:44:50 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger: So do I actually.
19:45:01 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/GrapheneOS-Security-Q%26A.md#does-graphene-allow-me-to-nuke-my-data-if-say-the-phone-gets-ten-incorrect-guesses-at-the-pincode This is what it will do. TLDR - even a 4-digit pincode on a Pixel 3 would take ~650 years to brute force.
19:45:25 <TheJollyRoger> Assuming it's not something like your birthday, your high school graduation year, etc.
19:45:36 <TheJollyRoger> And has been chosen with perfect randomness.
19:46:00 <defconanon12[m]> Heh not a novice but I will read up on that.
19:46:00 <dominusart[m]> Which is never the case
19:46:09 <defconanon12[m]> Thanks.
19:46:24 <TheJollyRoger> You could use some D&D dice to generate the password.
19:46:28 <TheJollyRoger> *the pin code.
19:46:35 <TheJollyRoger> or an EFF Diceware sheet.
19:46:50 <TheJollyRoger> and some game dice.
19:47:02 <dominusart[m]> That is an idea, but 4 digit pincodes are meh.
19:47:17 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS supports passwords of up to 64 characters in length.
19:47:47 <TheJollyRoger> Which is great for me because I find it easier to memorize four words, rather than four nonsensical numbers.
19:47:56 <dominusart[m]> Yeah, if you have the option to use a normal password, why would you use a pin?
19:48:19 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger:  You were talking about light bulbs and I think we should know about this if you haven't already.
19:48:19 <TheJollyRoger> Simply put, Google took a very pragmatic attitude with this and realized that for many users, that's what they /expect/.
19:48:23 <defconanon12[m]> https://www.wired.com/story/lamphone-light-bulb-vibration-spying/
19:48:24 <cn3m[m]> Pin is fast
19:48:36 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: yep!
19:50:04 <TheJollyRoger> dominusart[m]: TLDR, Google realized that most users not only expect, but take for granted bombproof security out of a four digit pin code. The lengthening timer and the hardware bound key derivation function is their way of doing their best to protect users who expect that a short pincode will be enough.
19:50:34 <TheJollyRoger> And bolstering the cryptographic strength of that four digit pincode.
19:51:17 <TheJollyRoger> Because let's be honest, a majority of users aren't going to create EFF diceware passphrases for their phones, and it's entirely unrealistic to expect them to.
19:51:40 <alzxjm[m]1> Related question: if you don't expect to be coerced by law enforcement, why is it generally recommended to avoid biometric authentication on Pixel phones?
19:52:24 <TheJollyRoger> alzxjm[m]1: It's not. In fact, I suggest using the fingerprint reader because of the increasing prevalence of insecure "home surveillance" or "home security" cameras.
19:52:37 <TheJollyRoger> Or people looking over your shoulder on the subway.
19:53:29 <qyo3462572445[m]> Plus its easy to quickly enter "lockdown" mode to require passcode if needed.
19:53:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <alzxjm[m]1 "Related question: if you don't e"> In certain jurisdictions, L.E. are legally allowed to use your biometrics to open your device for collection of evidence.
19:53:45 <TheJollyRoger> Which I think is a FAR more realistic threat than someone using microfine fingerprint dust and a cyanoacrylate mister to lift your fingerprints off the glass you touched at last night's party.
19:54:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But I like TheJollyRoger's train of thought
19:54:03 <radixed9[m]> I use a PIN and have no shame in that
19:55:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I've gotten into the habit of covering with one hand while entering my pattern
19:55:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> For shoulder-surfers and cameras of all kinds, sky, pole, and building-based
19:56:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Paranoid? Sure. Effortless? Also sure.
19:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> Let me put it this way: when you threat model, stop thinking about "the sexy" attacks involving superpowered ninjas from the Nebulous Secret Government Bio Tech Laboratory and start thinking about what's an attack that could be relevant right now, because it's those that'll be tried first.
19:56:20 <TheJollyRoger> And it's those where people mess up.
19:56:34 <dominusart[m]> There is not shame in that, it's just not the best option. Also the google pin thing someone mentioned above applies only to Google, my banking app has pin as the only option and they sure as hell don't have the google approach to it.
19:56:45 <defconanon12[m]> Biometric can be great but don't rely on it. Just like with anything.
19:57:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> dominusart: Wait - your bank has PIN only, no password?
19:57:46 <dominusart[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "dominusart: Wait - your bank has"> Mobile app, yes :)
19:57:48 <defconanon12[m]> If you go the fingerprint route use a less common finger.
19:57:51 <TheJollyRoger> This unfortunately's going to be the problem with your bank :(
19:58:10 <dominusart[m]> Which is retarded if you ask me
19:58:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <dominusart[m] "Mobile app, yes :)"> Ah, okay, so not the account itself, just opening the pre-auth'd app. Makes sense. There are still some non-western banks that use a 6 digit PIN as their entire password...........................
19:58:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Was hoping someone here was not using one of those, lol
19:58:52 <TheJollyRoger> The banks here where I am are pretty lackadaisical towards security.
19:58:52 <defconanon12[m]> Don't use the mobile app unless the website is the same? dominusart
19:58:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <dominusart[m] "Mobile app, yes :)"> Good news is, you still have to get into your device to get to that app, so
19:59:17 <TheJollyRoger> For years, Royal Bank of Canada had its landing page in plaintext, without SSL.
19:59:19 <dominusart[m]> Yeah, but it's still kind of meh.
19:59:43 <TheJollyRoger> Then you'd have to click "Log in" to go to the login page, and the URL was so hugely long it was effectively un-memorizable.
19:59:47 <defconanon12[m]> Banking mobile apps usually do.
20:00:00 <dominusart[m]> <defconanon12[m] "Don't use the mobile app unless "> Website is actually pretty good, you have to authorise a device to even login to the web panel
20:00:26 <TheJollyRoger> So it would've taken one BGP hijack to simply get everyone from the landing page to a phishing site.
20:01:22 <TheJollyRoger> And they also didn't even have STARTTLS when they E-mailed you your banking reciept so the last couple digits of your credit card and your entire account balances were essentially public on the Internet.
20:01:47 <TheJollyRoger> Along with your real name.
20:02:28 <TheJollyRoger> I'd like to give whoever thought that was good enough a stern lecture.
20:03:24 <dominusart[m]> I don't think anyone thought it was a good idea, they just didn't give a shit.
20:03:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <dominusart[m] "I don't think anyone thought it "> Their board probably did
20:04:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Because their checks kept clearing
20:04:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Which ties into the "Upton Sinclair" not giving a shit idea you mentioned lol
20:04:52 <alzxjm[m]1> > I don't think anyone thought it was a good idea, they just didn't give a shit.
20:04:52 <alzxjm[m]1> I think this statement explains most problems in the world.
20:20:55 <defconanon12[m]> That wouldn't be my prefer. Banking on the go. It is convenient but that usually comes with more security threats. You don't want to leave yourself more vulnerable when you are out in the wild than you are already are.

If you don't trust strangers around you don't enter your password if one decides to glance over. This also depends on how well your area is monitored.
