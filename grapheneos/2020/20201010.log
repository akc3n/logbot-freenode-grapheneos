00:36:58 <mj12daedalus[m]> Hello, I'm having trouble sending and receiving text messages on a fresh install of graphene.
00:37:09 <mj12daedalus[m]> Nothing goes out, except through Signal to other users of Signal.
00:37:31 <mj12daedalus[m]> it just sticks on "downloading".  Is there a help file somewhere I could read?
00:40:27 <mj12daedalus[m]> I have a feeling I'm missing something incredibly simple.
00:58:27 <dazinism> mj12daedalus: your trying to SMS via Signal?
00:59:01 <mj12daedalus[m]> Through that and messenger
00:59:16 <mj12daedalus[m]> signal to signal works just fine, but SMS through signal or through Messenger is a no-go
01:01:07 <xander-salamande> signal-to-signal won't be SMS unless you manually choose SMS, it could be SMS just isn't working at all on your phone
01:01:29 <dazinism> Think messenger can be a bit buggy. Not tried signal for SMS, but think many folks use it for that
01:02:01 <dazinism> Its a weird issue as sending and receiving are handled differently
01:06:18 <xander-salamande> <mj12daedalus[m] "Hello, I'm having trouble sendin"> hmm... can you make and receive regular phone calls?
01:06:29 <mj12daedalus[m]> I can do normal phone calls
01:06:34 <dazinism> mj12daedalus: normal calls work OK?
01:06:46 <dazinism> lol
01:07:36 <xander-salamande> which phone network/provider?
01:07:49 <dazinism> Try typing *#*#4636#*#* in the dialer
01:07:57 <dazinism> Then phone info
01:08:11 <dazinism> Then down the bottom
01:08:25 <dazinism> SMSC
01:08:36 <dazinism> Press the refresh button
01:08:48 <dazinism> Then try sending again
01:08:55 <dazinism> Sending an SMS
01:09:03 <mj12daedalus[m]> I'm on the phone with Sprint tech support right now
01:09:16 <mj12daedalus[m]> and they are not helpful, but I will try this as soon as I get off the phone with them
01:12:48 <dazinism> Should show a number when you press refresh. May need to press update after that.
01:15:18 <mj12daedalus[m]> Huh, after pressing "update" I get "update error" instead of a string of numbers
01:16:21 <mj12daedalus[m]> and SMS still will not go out
01:17:37 <mj12daedalus[m]> already you are more helpful than the gentlemen at Sprint, who had me reset my phone's wifi and bluetooth, and nothing else
01:17:59 <Sheru[m]> <mj12daedalus[m] "already you are more helpful tha"> Oh, Sprint
01:18:22 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, and their invasive way to activate SIM
01:18:59 <Sheru[m]> Doubt it is supported due to it requiring dangerous permission (see: device admin)
01:21:49 <mj12daedalus[m]> well, each time I try to refresh it gives me a number and after I hit "update" it displays "update error"
01:22:02 <mj12daedalus[m]> frustrating.
01:28:54 <mj12daedalus[m]> well thank you all very much for your help, I think I'll just take this to one of the stores and hope someone there can fix it
01:29:14 <mj12daedalus[m]> Have a pleasant evening.
01:29:18 <Sheru[m]> Is the SIM Sprint?
01:29:26 <mj12daedalus[m]> Yes.
01:29:37 <Sheru[m]> If it is, it will not work
01:29:53 <mj12daedalus[m]> what will not work?
01:30:49 <Sheru[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200730#c4574572
01:31:02 <Sheru[m]> "Sprint is not supported by GrapheneOS as they require crap installed"
01:31:09 <mj12daedalus[m]> oh well balls
01:31:17 <mj12daedalus[m]> time to swap to someone else then
01:31:17 <Sheru[m]> And that app requires dangerous permission, I'd advise to change SIM
01:31:35 <Sheru[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200731#c4584675

01:32:39 <mj12daedalus[m]> huh
01:32:44 <mj12daedalus[m]> well I feel silly.
01:33:32 <Sheru[m]> That's alright, we learn something new everyday
01:33:55 <Sheru[m]> Unfortunately, some companies have these bad decisions for privacy-conscious people
01:34:00 <mj12daedalus[m]> Guess I need to change carriers. Is there one that isn't as shitty as Sprint?
01:35:59 <mj12daedalus[m]> Digging through that first log you linked it looks like t-mobile?
01:40:47 <Sheru[m]> <mj12daedalus[m] "Digging through that first log y"> It's what they said. As long as it does not need some privacy-invasive apps, it's better
01:56:05 <haterade[m]> I feel like the bit about sprint should be included on the website somewhere
01:57:16 <haterade[m]> I can open an issue on the bugtracker
02:00:03 <Sheru[m]> Nah, it will not be supported, don't bother about it
02:00:26 <Sheru[m]> Until they remove the privacy-invasive app requirement
02:00:30 <Sheru[m]> (they - Sprint)
02:13:19 <haterade[m]> i just meant to be clear on the website that it isn't supported
02:15:47 <haterade[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/issues/136
02:34:24 <Sheru[m]> No offense, bur if one would install some other OS, research and testing must be done if feasible, no?
02:34:58 <Sheru[m]> Is A (could be carrier/apps/soke hardware) compatible to this OS?
02:35:09 <Sheru[m]> * No offense, but if one would install some other OS, research and testing must be done if feasible, no?
02:35:38 <Sheru[m]> Also, it's not like any OS fault that Sprint has such app
02:36:43 <Sheru[m]> * Is A (could be carrier/apps/some hardware) compatible to this OS?
05:29:34 <ealavta23[m]> Hi, are you guys planning to release a version for the pixel 5, and if so then when? Thanks!
06:06:22 <mrxx_0[m]> <ealavta23[m] "Hi, are you guys planning to rel"> When we will have AOSP resources and when a maintainer will work on it. If no one step up and maintain, there will be no pixel 5 support.
07:52:42 <Sheru[m]> 4a does not even have a maintainer yet

09:24:27 <Sheru[m]> <lpcvoid[m] "Does anybody have some pointers "> Start building the OS as is
09:30:29 <lpcvoid[m]> oof, need tot free up some space haha
10:30:36 <uchihaitachi[m]> Is Vanadium available for desktop (e.g: MacOS, GNU/Linux, etc.) ?
10:31:07 <Sheru[m]> <uchihaitachi[m] "Is Vanadium available for deskto"> Nope
10:31:55 <uchihaitachi[m]> Thanks!
12:42:30 <bender> good morning fine people
12:42:46 <bender> I'm hoping someone in here is able to give me some tech advice to point me in the right direction
12:43:16 <bender> I'm trying to get grapheneos running in an emulator, I've downloaded the sources and built RP1A.201005.006.2020.10.06.02
12:43:45 <bender> when I try and start it, this is what I get:
12:43:48 <bender> $ emulator
12:43:48 <bender> emulator: ERROR: Can't get kernel version from the kernel image file: '/home/ben/gitProjects/grapheneos-RP1A.201005.006.2020.10.06.02/prebuilts/qemu-kernel/arm64/ranchu/kernel-qemu'
12:44:02 <bender> does that mean I missed a step somewhere?
12:45:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> <bender "does that mean I missed a step s"> Yee
12:45:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> <bender "does that mean I missed a step s"> Yes
12:45:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> lunch the x86-64 target
12:50:32 <bender> ah ha, does that mean I need to rebuild the project to use the aosp_x86_64 target? or can I get away with just passing an extra parameter to the emulator?
12:52:00 <bender> anupritaisno1[m] ^
13:00:04 <ruddo[m]> I too want to know the answer to that question, in detail if possible, thanks ðŸ˜˜
13:05:24 <louipc> i hope you will research :)
13:05:46 <bender> well, I tried running "$ emulator -kernel prebuilts/qemu-kernel/x86_64/current/kernel-qemu2" to see what would happen and although the emulator started, I got the message "running an x86-based image is 10x faster. We strongly recommend creating a new AVD" (paraphrased from memory)
13:06:03 <bender> and the screen of the emulator is just black, no activity whatsoever
13:06:13 <bender> so, I imagine the answer is "rebuild the project"
13:10:36 <louipc> depends on what you want to do. but yea i'd rather build for x86 if im gonna use it there.
13:13:43 <louipc> but it wont have the full security or official support
13:14:51 <bender> I'm not trying to do anything earth-shattering, I'm in the market for a new phone and I like the idea of graphene, but I want to try it out because fully de-googling is intimidating
13:15:13 <bender> so I wanted to emulate it so I could see how well f-droid and aurora can work for me
13:15:40 <bender> if I build x86_64, can I still install apks from f-droid and aurora? or would I need to build for arm for compatibility?
13:18:11 <louipc> depends on the app i'd think. at least you wont get any optimisations
13:19:55 <bender> that's ok. I don't expect my emulator to be speedy, I can look past performance issues
13:21:41 <louipc> i'd dare you to disable google play services on current phone and see how it goes
13:21:52 <louipc> can always reenable
13:26:14 <lpcvoid[m]> why is degoogling intimidating?
13:26:21 <lpcvoid[m]> google is intimidating lol
13:27:07 <bender> that thought occurred to me but my current phone has so many issues that it wouldn't be a fair test. it fails to receive calls half the time. switching to a new tab in firefox has a fair chance of hardlocking the device. just examples. if I disable google services and an app subsequently misbehaves, is it because of the missing service, or because my device needs replaced anyway?
13:27:23 <louipc> ouch
13:28:03 <lpcvoid[m]> at that point i'd launch it into orbit
13:28:18 <bender> yeah, I've been living with the pain for awhile, but finally enough is enough
13:28:24 <louipc> cheaper to buy a new phone
13:28:57 <lpcvoid[m]> cant recommend p4xl with graphene enough. I get like 3-4 days battery with mild use
13:30:25 * lpcvoid[m] uploaded an image: it's absolutely insane imo (201KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/eYMSXxuCBaJaBVFxWDXXJPEL >
13:31:18 <bender> lpcvoid[m], in a perfect world I'd like to degoogle, but they do give some nice quality of life features. I enjoy google maps (although maybe that could live in a browser). I use google voice (although less these days now that most of my friends/family use signal). I have a smartwatch that uses wear OS... not sure how well that would work in a de-googled environment. I wrote my own watch face that uses google services to sync some data and
13:31:18 <bender> files from my phone, so I imagine that would likely stop working.
13:32:19 <bender> I know the google stuff comes "at what cost?" so that's the angle I'm considering. yes there will be some inconvenience, but... maybe it's worth it
13:32:31 <lpcvoid[m]> for maps, I recommend osmand, which works well for me (I only use it in cities I don't know though), maybe you like it too
13:32:35 <bender> still, I'd like to try it out first. I know an emulator won't answer all my questions, but it will help
13:32:41 <louipc> google maps works apparently
13:34:11 <bender> yeah, I'd like to play around with all options. for maps, maybe the google app still works, maybe I find a 3rd party app that's even better, who knows
13:34:22 <bender> I know the microg project exists, maybe that changes the game somehow?
13:34:48 <louipc> well then maybe you would prefer calyxos rather than grapheneos
13:34:49 <bender> and I'd love to find out if the wear app still works so my watch doesn't lose functionality (although an emulator won't be able to tell me that)
13:34:59 <lpcvoid[m]> microg requires signature spoofing and is generally a huge downgrade in security
13:35:19 <bender> yikes, I did not know that
13:35:22 <lpcvoid[m]> basically what louipc said yeah
13:36:53 <bender> I hadn't heard of calyxos before. thanks for the tip, I'll check it out
13:54:59 <Sheru[m]> Hey, why not use maps at website
13:56:34 <Sheru[m]> I like CalyxOS, but it is not worth an app to downgrade to substantially lower security from GrapheneOS to CalyxOS, and some privacy sacrifice thanks to Firebase push notifications
13:56:46 <bender> Sheru[m], yep, that would be one valid option
13:57:22 <bender> I am still going to check out graphene as my first choice, my x86 rebuild is halfway done already
13:58:25 <Sheru[m]> Not to mention the leaks of VPN in secondary usera still not fixed in CalyxOS, no secondary users logout, password capped at 16 there (please confirm)
13:58:30 <bender> I saw lpcvoid[m] recommended the p4xl earlier, that is probably the best device that is supported *today*... would it be a terrible idea to get a pixel 5 and use it stock until graphene supports it?
13:58:57 <Sheru[m]> Hard for me to justify a measly app to use lower security and privacy OS
13:59:05 <Sheru[m]> When there is browser to open it anyways
13:59:47 <Sheru[m]> <bender "I saw lpcvoid recommended the p4"> Not too bad, 4xl is already nice enough to use with longest support tbh
14:00:27 <Sheru[m]> <bender "I saw lpcvoid recommended the p4"> But, if now access to GrapheneOS is necessary, getting 4xl is recommended
14:00:55 <bender> "longest support" what does that mean? looking at the past or looking at the future?
14:02:05 <bender> wait I think I understand. there's technically guarantee that p5 will be supported at all, so p4xl is the strongest device available and should be supported for many more years
14:02:15 <bender> *no guarantee
14:03:31 <Sheru[m]> Well, no guarantee for 5 will be supproted
14:03:46 <Sheru[m]> Right now, 4 has the longest supported in GrapheneOS
14:04:07 <bender> yep, I understand
14:04:54 <Sheru[m]> Cheers, then
14:05:37 <bender> thanks all for the advice and insight
14:05:54 <bender> louipc lpcvoid[m] Sheru[m] :)

14:06:56 <lpcvoid[m]> np :)
15:28:37 <christian-h> Does the game minetest work for you? I installed it from Aurora droid and it crashes after the loading screen.
15:29:54 <lpcvoid[m]> just tested, no, it crashes

15:34:54 <lpcvoid[m]> after that blue fullscreen
15:35:03 <lpcvoid[m]> around 3 seconds in
15:35:22 <lpcvoid[m]> oh it does seem to ask for permissions for like 200ms
15:35:28 <lpcvoid[m]> but it never waits for the input
15:35:33 <lpcvoid[m]> that could be the reason
15:36:06 <lpcvoid[m]> nah, still crashes after filesystem permissions are given

20:36:31 <haterade[m]> Try to disable battery optimization on the apps?
20:37:16 <haterade[m]>  * Try to disable battery optimization on the apps? That allows apps to continually check for notifications instead of how they used to be woken up by GCM
20:49:01 <zachmartin[m]> Okay, figured it was because play services was missing. That's fine.
20:49:58 <zachmartin[m]> Couldn't get Snapchat to work because no play services, tried version back to v3
20:55:34 <zachmartin[m]> Anyone tried to spin up a homeserver on a Pi yet?
21:06:41 <zachmartin[m]> I'm working on a project where I need to anon host a website and matrix homeroom so my solution is to build a small Solar/Pi box and stash it on some free open WiFi. So just curious. I got a homeroom setup on Ubuntu 20 server so should be the same concept.
21:09:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> zachmartin ot
21:26:10 <analtenderloin[m> zachmartin: I gave up on getting Snapchat to work.  It has a hard dependency and also I believe it relies on safetynet which also isn't included in graphene.
21:43:05 <zachmartin[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "zachmartin ot"> What does ot mean?

21:43:40 <louipc> please join #grapheneos-offtopic
22:37:07 <xander-salamande> anyone know about GrapheneOS on qemu/kvm? Google has failed me ðŸ˜•
22:37:42 <xander-salamande> (not as a permanent solution, I just wanna see what it's like before installing on a real phone)
22:49:30 <louipc> you will have to build it yourself
22:50:05 <louipc> see https://grapheneos.org/build#build-targets
22:50:56 <xander-salamande> ah, got it
22:51:06 <xander-salamande> time to do some reading
23:34:30 <dazinism> analtenderloin: zachmartin think theres  Snapchat on the Huawei app store
23:34:54 <dazinism> doesn't have safetynet so should work
23:35:24 <dazinism> Also maybe Amazon app store will have it
23:35:26 <dazinism> Also won't have safetynet
23:35:42 <dazinism> sp should/could
23:36:31 <dazinism> Had a look on apkmirror as I thought they ma have the Huawei Store version, but apparently not
23:38:14 <dazinism> Don't really like/trust either store.
