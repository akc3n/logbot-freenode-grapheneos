00:05:45 <entry1[m]> <the5000[m] "Okay so get Android 11 then flas"> You aren't using the Sprint network and have the access for developer options correct?
00:19:29 <the5000[m]> Yes and I'm on t mobile
01:07:17 <the5000[m]> It says Sprint and t mobile merged is this a problem with graphene or Android 11?
01:17:18 <gorrin[m]> Hey I'm a new one, I try to install the OS via Windows and I get this on the phone: "Downloading... Do not turn off target", I'm watching a tutorial on YouTube and I don't think I should be seeing that. I wrote in the cmd "adb reboot bootloader" and "fastboot flashing unlock", as a result it says bellow "< waiting for any device >". ? Sorry if I interrupt the conversation above
01:24:54 <thestranger> You shoildnt use adb, that not what the official guide is
01:25:22 <thestranger> You should follow these step
01:25:26 <thestranger> https://grapheneos.org/install
01:27:06 <thestranger> On windows you should use this command before installing
01:27:09 <thestranger> Remove-Item Alias:Curl
01:27:30 <thestranger> If u use powershell
01:28:30 <thestranger> Adb is not needed to instalk
01:28:33 <thestranger> Install
01:33:58 <the5000[m]> Hey gorrin j had the same problem as you. Are you using USB c to USB c?
01:34:20 <the5000[m]> You need to use USB 2.0 to USB c. It won't recognize it if it's not
01:36:30 <gorrin[m]> The end of one side is USB c and the other end goes in the phone, I don't know the specifications really but it's smaller, for a Samsung Galaxy
01:37:01 <ayaen_t[m]> gorrin: does your computer have a usb c port
01:37:29 <ayaen_t[m]> in case it has just use the cable that came wigh the device
01:37:43 <the5000[m]> It will not work with that cable Gorrin. I tried with someone's Chromebook and it didnt work because it was USB c to USB c
01:38:19 <ayaen_t[m]> the5000:  first let him respond
01:38:21 <the5000[m]> It didn't recognize the device on minimal adb as well. I used techlores guide on youtube
01:38:37 <ayaen_t[m]> the5000: there is no need for adb here
01:39:05 <ayaen_t[m]> anyways let the person respond first
01:39:35 <gorrin[m]> I think I'm using the cable that came with it, otherwise what should I do?
01:39:42 <the5000[m]> Yes I tried it the same way as him someone else tried to walk me through it with powershell and it still didn't recognize. If it's USB c to USB c it's the cable if not these guys will know. It took me like a whole hour to find it out
01:40:31 <ayaen_t[m]> gorrin:  just use the usb c to usb c cable that came with the pixel device
01:41:39 <ayaen_t[m]> did you follow the instructions on https://grapheneos.org/install word by word or did you improvise somewhere?
01:43:03 <gorrin[m]> I'm trying to understand the instructions shown in there, as of now I think I should be using fastboot
01:45:16 <ayaen_t[m]> gorrin:  just follow the instructions as theyare given in https://grapheneos.org/install and you should be fine if you dont understand some part it is alright you can come and ask here and it will be all the more easier to figure ouy what went wrong if you had followed the instructions till wherever you get stuck
02:18:44 <the5000[m]> Does anyone know why that guy asked me if I was on sprints network with installing Android 11 before putting graphene on a pixel?
02:20:28 <somenerd[m]> I think that they thought that your phone was locked
02:21:21 <somenerd[m]> (i.e. unable to flash alternative OSs
02:21:28 <somenerd[m]> * (i.e. unable to flash alternative OSs)
02:23:59 <strcat[m]> the5000: "minimal adb" is some out-of-date third party code posted by someone on XDA
02:24:05 <strcat[m]> use the official guide
02:24:16 <strcat[m]> don't use misguided third party instructions, we can't support that here
02:24:31 <strcat[m]> you'll need to uninstall / remove any third party software like this that you've installed and follow the official guide
02:25:18 <strcat[m]> you're having problems because you aren't following the official guide
02:25:25 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install from the top and then ask for help if you have issues
02:25:42 <strcat[m]> if you use unofficial guides / instructions, you need to ask the people who made those for support and can't get support here
02:27:38 <the5000[m]> Okay
02:28:04 <the5000[m]> So I have my Android back to normal. I'm on Android 10 with Sprint. Should I upgrade to a Droid 11?
02:28:18 <the5000[m]> Then reinstall graphene?
02:28:53 <the5000[m]> It's on T-Mobile I mean. But they merged with Sprint. Someone asked if I was using Sprint. The phone is unlocked in developer mode
02:32:08 <louipc> if you already have grapheneos should be no need to reinstall
02:33:48 <strcat[m]> the5000: very unclear what you're trying to do...
02:34:08 <strcat[m]> the5000: strongly recommend reading the official install guide, you seem very confused - maybe you're not clear on what GrapheneOS is either?
02:34:58 <strcat[m]> if you've already installed GrapheneOS you can verify that with Auditor
02:35:48 <strcat[m]> if you still need to install it follow https://grapheneos.org/install from start to finish
02:36:20 <strcat[m]> ask questions after attempting to follow it if you have any issues - which you shouldn't if you follow exactly what's written there
02:36:22 <the5000[m]> I'm on Android 10 someone said update it to Android 11 and reinstall it. I used the minimal adb method the first time
02:36:35 <strcat[m]> remove the third party adb
02:36:39 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install
02:36:43 <the5000[m]> I did
02:36:50 <strcat[m]> okay, so follow the official guide
02:37:03 <strcat[m]> start at the top
02:37:09 <strcat[m]> prerequisites section
02:37:16 <the5000[m]> Now I'm still on Android 10. Should I get Android 11 first then install it?
02:37:33 <strcat[m]> just follow the official guide
02:37:35 <strcat[m]> covers all that
02:37:47 <the5000[m]> Okay
02:39:05 <brenneke[m]> <strcat[m] "log in, switch to a user and log"> Please let me know if you require logs or any other info for keyboard not coming up when switching users.
02:39:22 <the5000[m]> Says its best to update to the latest stock firmware so I'll get Android 11 then
02:39:25 <louipc> the proper way is to fully update the stock device, then install grapheneos
02:40:12 <strcat[m]> > It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running into bugs, missing features or other differences in older firmware versions. You can either update the device via over-the-air updates or sideload a full update, which for Pixel phones can be obtained from the full update package page.
02:40:21 <strcat[m]> it's a recommendation in the guide - not mandatory, but recommended
02:40:39 <strcat[m]> explains why it's a best practice
02:40:44 <the5000[m]> How do I do that then
02:40:53 <strcat[m]> just update it normally within the OS
02:41:06 <strcat[m]> I'm sure you can figure out how to update the stock OS
02:41:06 <the5000[m]> Okay easy then
03:15:44 <somenerd[m]> not sure if this is on topic (about GrapheneOS on r/privacy)

05:45:31 <mutualpoison[m]> Hi everyone, I've looked on the website and can't seem to find device support timelines. I want to buy a Pixel 4 XL, but I'd like to know how long the maintainers plan to support the device... I've seen that "3 years" has been thrown around here, but is that 3 years from device release or 3 years since GrapheneOS started supporting the device? Sincere thanks to everyone, I will be donating to GrapheneOS on a
05:45:31 <mutualpoison[m]> recurring basis :)
05:49:59 <Liakdeuser[m]> <mutualpoison[m] "Hi everyone, I've looked on the "> Three years since the device is released
05:50:40 <mutualpoison[m]> Awesome, thanks!
06:01:18 <mutualpoison[m]> Sorry for the double question, but how long has it generally taken historically to support a device? I'd love to have another year of support by waiting for the 4a 5G to be supported, but with my current phone breaking more and more every day, I'm not sure I'll be able to wait :(
06:02:12 <somenerd[m]> It really depends
06:02:19 <somenerd[m]> each device needs a maintainer
06:02:28 <somenerd[m]> who builds GrapheneOS for the phone
06:04:20 <mutualpoison[m]> That makes sense, and with the changes between generations I assume it will be a fair amount of work (even after a maintainer volunteers).... but in general, is it usually closer to 4 months after release or 8 months (for instance)?
06:04:37 <somenerd[m]> I believe it took 6 months last time
06:04:39 <somenerd[m]> let me check
06:12:37 <somenerd[m]> not sure, I wasn't able to find a link
06:12:43 <somenerd[m]> but it really depends on maintainers
06:14:16 <tryingraphene> hi, first time here, having issues with getting secondary profile to work with text messages
06:14:18 <mutualpoison[m]> Thanks somenerd that gives me a good idea of the timeline... I think I'll get a 4XL just to be safe! :)
06:15:06 <louipc> pixel 4a 5g and 5 still not merged into main aosp last i heard too
06:15:39 <louipc> so either grapheneos would have to do that huge work, or wait for google/aosp
06:16:02 <mutualpoison[m]> louipc: That's valuable info.... thanks!
06:16:16 <tryingraphene> i am using owner profile just to manage profiles. I setup a secondary profile to serve as my 'main' profile. I set it to share sms and phone. I am using signal as my default sms app this secondary profile.
06:16:25 <louipc> regular 4a is supported
06:16:41 <strcat> tryingraphene: dpm
06:16:47 <strcat> don't use Signal as your SMS app
06:16:58 <strcat> it's broken
06:17:09 <tryingraphene> I am able to send sms through signal on this secondary profile, however i can't receive sms through signal on the secondary profile
06:17:12 <strcat> use Signal for E2E encrypted texts/calls and just keep insecure legacy SMS separate
06:17:20 <strcat> tryingraphene: yeah, it's broken, use Messaging for SMS
06:17:24 <tryingraphene> oh i see
06:17:41 <strcat> tryingraphene: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5151
06:17:47 <tryingraphene> it works on owner profile just fine but not secondary profile, is that how it is broken?
06:17:48 <strcat> Signal bug, probably, happens on any Android OS
06:17:54 <strcat> tryingraphene: yes, look at that issue
06:17:59 <tryingraphene> thanks!
06:18:00 <strcat> they blamed it on Android instead of fixing it
06:18:14 <tryingraphene> yeah sounds like it would probably happen on any android
06:18:21 <strcat> well, specifically, they blamed it on the specific Android variant those people were running
06:18:26 <strcat> but it happens on AOSP and the stock OS on a Pixel too
06:18:37 <strcat> and Messaging works fine
06:18:50 <strcat> tryingraphene: in general, I'd recommend just keeping SMS separate anyway
06:19:24 <tryingraphene> what irc client do you suggest to use for graphene? i haven't used irc for years, just using this through web browser
06:19:37 <strcat> I don't really have a specific recommendation
06:19:57 <tryingraphene> ok i'll check some out on f-droid
06:20:03 <strcat> Matrix might work better on mobile via Element
06:20:07 <strcat> not sure if there are decent IRC clients
06:21:29 <tryingraphene> so i used signal to import all my text messages through old phone and put on my new graphene phone, but now that i am going to use just standard messaging app any advice on getting that text history into messaging app?
07:17:31 <tryingraphene> other question i have is- what is the most desired / secure way of running graphene os- using owner profile as main profile for daily use and use other profiles for more secure activities such as cryptocurrency wallets, banking, etc?
07:18:27 <tryingraphene> or setup a secondary profile for main use (this is what I have seen suggested before) and always using that secondary profile as daily driver?
07:19:34 <Liakdeuser[m]> <tryingraphene "or setup a secondary profile for"> This one. Keep primary user empty if possible, and just for remote attestation (on that user profile itself) and making new secondary users
07:19:50 <tryingraphene> i'm not sure of the difference since I am going to be in whichever profile i'm using 100% of the time. For instance i'm always going to be in whichever profile my daily driver profile is
07:19:52 <Liakdeuser[m]> primary, as in the owner profile
07:20:31 <tryingraphene> ok yes this is how i'm setting it up, was just wondering what the advantage of it was
07:20:31 <Liakdeuser[m]> You can logout that profile and flush its encryption keys
07:21:05 <tryingraphene> i don't think i'd ever log out of it though aside from when i reboot phone
07:21:36 <tryingraphene> if it is serving as my main profile where texts are, phone calls are made from, etc
07:21:42 <Liakdeuser[m]> It's more advantageous on separating the use cases, storage and apps
07:22:21 <Liakdeuser[m]> <tryingraphene "if it is serving as my main prof"> Secondary users can receive texts when toggled in owner user profile, not much experience if there are delays or something
07:22:52 <tryingraphene> i see. so maybe apps i trust less like google store apps with trackers i can put in separate profile that have no contacts / photos etc
07:23:00 <Liakdeuser[m]> Yeah
07:23:24 <Liakdeuser[m]> Also, you can separate a user for something like Newpipe that needs full storage access
07:24:03 <tryingraphene> ok cool. would be nice to see a safety mechanism on multiple user page that makes it much harder to delete your main user (ha ha)
07:28:25 <Liakdeuser[m]> <tryingraphene "ok cool. would be nice to see a "> Pull requests are welcome to do such thing
07:30:43 <tryingraphene> yeah i'll have to learn how to do that as i would love to contribute as much as i can to projects like this
07:50:11 <tryingraphene> does seedbackup backup all profiles on the phone or just the owner profile?
07:58:12 <Liakdeuser[m]> Owner only
07:58:31 <Liakdeuser[m]> (by default, no adb)
08:00:06 <tryingraphene> oh i see. hmmm because of that as well as signal not working well on second profile, i may want to use owner profile as my main profile and use secondary profiles just to offload more sensitive and / or less trustworthy things
08:00:19 <tryingraphene> is there any negatives to speak of in doing this?
08:02:45 <somenerd[m]> possible compromise of the owner profile
08:02:59 <somenerd[m]> (affect)
08:03:47 <somenerd[m]>  * (afaict)
08:04:01 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
08:04:09 <tryingraphene> i see, so if there was an errant app it could do some damage in the owner profile
08:04:11 <strcat[m]> explains the advantage of using a secondary profile as your main profile
08:04:29 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: that's not the reason we suggest to use another profile
08:04:54 <tryingraphene> yeah i read and re-read that page and i did see that it was suggested to do that, just didn't know exactly why
08:08:07 <tryingraphene> "Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile. It also allows putting it at rest without rebooting the device." But if my 'seondary profile' is my regular usage profile, i'm never going to be putting it at rest
08:08:30 <tryingraphene> unless i'm missing something
08:09:35 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: for example, consider being somewhere where you don't want to have your main profile unlocked
08:09:41 <strcat[m]> if your main profile is the owner profile, you can't use your phone
08:09:58 <tryingraphene> oh i see
08:10:39 <strcat[m]> if your main profile is a secondary profile you can boot up the phone and avoid unlocking it
08:10:49 <strcat[m]> or use end session to fully log it out (and purge the encryption keys)
08:11:23 <strcat[m]> that way you can still actively use the phone with all of your important data remaining at rest
08:11:49 <tryingraphene> so does the titan m chip operate the same as regards lockscreen password guesses, etc with other profiles as it does with rebooting phone?
08:12:10 <strcat[m]> yes each profile has separate encryption keys and there's a Weaver slot for each profile
08:12:22 <tryingraphene> (just bought a pixel 4a for use with graphene os)
08:12:31 <tryingraphene> nice, i see
08:13:07 <tryingraphene> i also saw fingerprint is not suggested to be used for profiles, is that just main profile or all?
08:13:23 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: we don't really make a suggestion on that
08:14:31 <strcat[m]> for sensitive data, if you use a strong passphrase for the profile, you don't depend on the secure element for protection against a sophisticated attacker
08:15:02 <strcat[m]> but even with a random 6 digit PIN, you get a lot of security via the secure element, and only an attacker able to successfully exploit / extract data from the secure element could bypass it - not just exploiting the OS
08:15:33 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: fingerprint unlock is a *secondary unlock* mechanism, it can't be used for the initial unlock (decryption) of a profile anyway
08:15:37 <ayaen_t[m]> fingerprint is convenient but over some days youll find that you leave fingrtprints on the device and so in case your device is stolen the thief might find a pristine finger print.
08:15:50 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: and there are only 5 attempts via fingerprint unlock before permanent lockout on GrapheneOS
08:15:54 <ayaen_t[m]> just might
08:16:02 <tryingraphene> oh yes i see that is what i was wondering is if fingerprint data was housed in titan m as well
08:16:13 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: also times out after 48h since last primary unlock
08:16:19 <tryingraphene> i see
08:16:25 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: fingerprint data is in the TEE (TrustZone) atm
08:16:38 <strcat[m]> the fuzzy hash
08:17:16 <strcat[m]> it doesn't actually store an image, it stores a fuzzy hash based on a combination of the images it has gotten in the past from successful unlocks (it adjusts over time, you can slowly teach it to learn more of your finger)
08:17:36 <tryingraphene> yes i figured well an attacker could lift a fingerprint off phone, but i believe sensor is not optical so would probably use up the 5 tries before success anyways
08:17:45 <strcat[m]> so for example
08:18:25 <strcat[m]> you could make a convenient profile for heading out and doing stuff outside with fingerprint unlock and a 6 digit PIN, and have your more private stuff separate from that with a strong passphrase
08:18:29 <strcat[m]> totally up to you how you do it
08:18:36 <strcat[m]> lot of tradeoffs
08:19:33 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: with any profile, you can use lockdown to disable secondary unlock mechanisms (fingerprint / face unlock), with secondary profiles you can also fully log out at any time
08:19:35 <tryingraphene> i see- so that was a big question i had too with the hardware titan m chip- do i need to have a super long complicated password randlomly generated like i used to with older phones or with titan m is a random 20 char fine?
08:19:44 <ayaen_t[m]> well i learnt something bout fingerprinting. sorry for that,
08:19:49 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: depends what your goal is
08:20:28 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: the Titan M Weaver implementation quickly throttles to 1 attempt per day at decryption
08:20:48 <strcat[m]> a random 6-digit PIN would take a ridiculous amount of time to bypass without compromising the secure element
08:20:55 <strcat[m]> it has an internal, hardened timer for this
08:20:59 <tryingraphene> i read the titan m will ramp up timeouts for guesses but in my recent tests of guessing patterns wrong 30 times in a row with a newly created profile it was still at 30 seconds per guess
08:21:14 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: you're not testing enough
08:21:20 <tryingraphene> ah i figured
08:21:21 <strcat[m]> it ramps up exponentially
08:21:30 <strcat[m]> exponential means the initial growth is tiny
08:21:46 <tryingraphene> yes it first allowed 5 tries then 30 sec timeout
08:21:58 <tryingraphene> then after 10 tries it allows only one try per 30 sec
08:22:16 <tryingraphene> i'm assuming maybe after 50 tries it would go to one per min
08:23:31 <strcat[m]> no
08:23:33 <strcat[m]> you're just not testing enough
08:23:39 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libese/+/master/apps/weaver/card/src/com/android/weaver/core/CoreSlots.java#195 is what the Pixel 2 uses
08:23:53 <strcat[m]> 140+ failures is 1 day per attempt
08:24:01 <strcat[m]> it quickly ramps up to that
08:24:15 <strcat[m]> it's designed so that you don't notice until you've failed a bunch because of exponential growth
08:24:37 <strcat[m]> 30 attempts is where it starts changing
08:24:38 <tryingraphene> i made a test profile to try it out it is interesting this hardware chip :)
08:24:53 <strcat[m]> look at the list there
08:24:57 <tryingraphene> shoot i stopped right where it was going to get interesting
08:25:16 <strcat[m]> 5 attempts with 0 delay, 30 attempts with 30s delay, then it starts ramping up and by 140 it has 1 day per attempt
08:25:35 <strcat[m]> that's for the Pixel 2 security chip at least, probably similar for Titan M
08:26:05 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: but yeah it's intentionally set up this way so it's not noticed by people
08:26:19 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: once you get over 30 it'll start becoming really apparent that it's ramping up
08:26:28 <tryingraphene> sweet! so i guess i could be fine with what would have been way low entropy password (without a hardware chip like my old 6p) to something much shorter and convienient
08:27:14 <tryingraphene> because the way i understand it you can't even really bypass the titan m even taking the phone apart
08:27:37 <strcat[m]> per that formula, 50 attempts is already 120s, 60 has gotten up to 240s, 80 is 960s, 100 is 3840s, etc.
08:27:53 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: it's a hardened secure element with secure internal storage + timer and anti-tampering
08:28:10 <strcat[m]> if you try to disassemble it, apply electricity to it, heat, etc. it detects tampering
08:28:16 <strcat[m]> it's designed to be really hard to do that
08:28:26 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: a very sophisticated attacker could invest substantial resources in doing it
08:28:31 <strcat[m]> so against them, you want a strong passphrase
08:29:05 <tryingraphene> that is what i really like too is that it can't be easily offloaded to say a gpu array and bruteforced because it has to go through the titan m
08:29:21 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: even without the Titan M, there's hardware-bound key derivation
08:29:28 <strcat[m]> so you would need to extract that key from the SoC to offload the work
08:29:53 <strcat[m]> it uses scrypt in the OS + hardware-bound key derivation in the SoC
08:30:10 <strcat[m]> Weaver (Titan M on Pixels) for the exponential throttling via secure element is an extra thing on top of that
08:30:37 <tryingraphene> this is good info, hmmm might be able to get away with much shorter password than usual. it sucks learning a new 32 char password, having to carry around the handwritten note for a few weeks
08:30:51 <Liakdeuser[m]> Passphrases
08:31:03 <Liakdeuser[m]> At least five random words
08:31:23 <tryingraphene> i like completely random generated strings (well as random as an rng is capable of anyways)
08:31:32 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene:  it takes too long to type them
08:31:36 <Liakdeuser[m]> If you can help it, multiple languages and mixed with random characters and numbers
08:31:43 <strcat[m]> and speed / ease of typing is what matters
08:31:50 <strcat[m]> because if it's easier to type it can be longer
08:32:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lia (kde user): multiple languages is useless considering how it's actually implemented in most cases
08:32:31 <tryingraphene> true but more disadvantaged to dictionary attacks which counters the extra length? i'm not sure, i'm not a pro security researcher
08:32:35 <strcat[m]> so for example, with a dictionary of 4096 words, adding 1 more word adds 4096 possibilities
08:32:59 <strcat[m]> it's easier to type a short word than dealing with entering a symbol
08:33:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like "√√•π√÷×¶∆₹&@" isn't really any more secure than  "$¢¢=={}}{{}\\\[[]]["
08:33:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> If anything good luck typing the first one on a keyboard
08:33:38 <tryingraphene> ha ha yeah
08:33:42 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: make a wordlist of 4096 short words and randomly choose words, each one is 4096x possibilities
08:33:44 <strcat[m]> as an example
08:34:22 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: it's a lot easier to type a extra few words that were randomly chosen than dealing with weird characters
08:34:26 <Liakdeuser[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Lia (kde user): multiple languag"> You mean the small subset of word pools?
08:34:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "tryingraphene: make a wordlist o"> But why not just pick any word at random from a dictionary and pick 12 of these randomly?
08:34:45 <Liakdeuser[m]> <Liakdeuser[m] "You mean the small subset of wor"> (In dictionary)
08:34:53 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: 12 is overkill with any dictionary word
08:35:01 <tryingraphene> many ways of skinning the same cat i suppose
08:35:19 <strcat[m]> 12 random words with 2048 possible words is 128-bit entropy, that's a strong key without needing key derivation beyond a basic cryptographic hash
08:35:26 <somenerd[m]> > anupritaisno1: 12 is overkill with any dictionary word
08:35:26 <somenerd[m]> I think that's like seedvault level
08:35:40 <strcat[m]> there is no point in having more than 128-bit entropy for a totally random key
08:35:56 * Liakdeuser[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XMlegaQraKlckUxstbvRbOty/message.txt >
08:36:01 <strcat[m]> that is the upper limit on what you should have for a random key if you aren't just playing security theater games
08:36:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: how much entropy is a 112 char password?
08:36:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Assume everything is there
08:36:13 <tryingraphene> i've always been surprised with bip39, i have been used to 24 word seeds for so long with crypto
08:36:29 <somenerd[m]> > Seedvault seemed to have smaller pool of words?
08:36:29 <somenerd[m]> 2048 words I believe
08:36:38 <strcat[m]> Lia (kde user): the BIP39 wordlist is 2048 words, 12 words is 132 entropy if it was fully random, but last 4 bits are a checksum so it's 128 bit
08:36:47 <tryingraphene> i believe 112 char password would be upwords in 350 to 400 or more entropy
08:36:49 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: Bitcoin keys are 128-bit, no point of a > 128-bit entropy seed phrase
08:36:59 <tryingraphene> thats a good point
08:37:02 <strcat[m]>  * tryingraphene: Bitcoin keys have 128-bit security, no point of a > 128-bit entropy seed phrase
08:37:34 <somenerd[m]> > Seedvault seemed to have smaller pool of words?
08:37:34 <somenerd[m]> yeah it's even more than seedvault
08:37:47 <strcat[m]> 256-bit EC keys are equivalent to 128-bit random (symmetric) keys
08:37:50 <strcat[m]> and that's what Bitcoin uses
08:38:17 <strcat[m]> if you have a wordlist of more than 2048 words, you don't need as many words for that 128-bit entropy target
08:38:32 <strcat[m]> the reason for it being 2048 words is to use easy to remember, common words
08:39:00 <strcat[m]> and also BIP39 wordlist has no 2 words starting with the same 4 letters
08:39:10 <tryingraphene> shoot just generated a 112 char password in keepass it is 689 bits lol (well according to it's algorithm)
08:39:10 <strcat[m]> so 4 letters of each word is enough to disambiguate it
08:40:01 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: try using only lowercase letters and adjust it to be 128-bit security
08:40:16 <strcat[m]> using uppercase letters too only doubles the per-character entropy
08:40:24 <strcat[m]> when typing on that virtual keyboard
08:40:29 <tryingraphene> oh yeah i used symbols and everything
08:40:38 <strcat[m]> you can probably enter entropy fastest with only lowercase
08:40:46 <tryingraphene> but but quantum computing just kidding
08:41:27 <strcat[m]> so, with just the usual ascii letters, that's 26 possibilities per character
08:43:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> tryingraphene: how do you see that?
08:43:56 <strcat[m]> so you take the log26(2**128), rounded up
08:43:56 <tryingraphene> whats that, in keepass?
08:44:10 <strcat[m]> 28 random lowercase latin letters is > 128-bit security
08:44:40 <strcat[m]> if you use uppercase, it reduces the length for > 128-bit security to 23 characters
08:44:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "so you take the log26(2**128), r"> What's this
08:44:58 <strcat[m]> I seriously doubt it's easier to enter 23 lower or uppercase random letters than 28 lowercase
08:45:02 <strcat[m]> especially on that virtual keyboard
08:45:21 <strcat[m]> and you don't actually need >128-bit entropy
08:45:24 <tryingraphene> yep i just generated a 28 ch password in keepass it is ~ 118bits so about right
08:45:39 <strcat[m]> I'm just saying for max security where cracking it is not even an option regardless of having a supercomputer and 200 years
08:46:26 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: log is the reverse of exponentiation
08:46:30 <tryingraphene> yeah i figure a 20 character randomly generated password that i memorize is totally cool since the titan m chip is present. for my threat model at least
08:46:38 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: 2**11 is 2048, log2(2048) is 11
08:46:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> I mean what's the formula thay you came at
08:46:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Aware what logarithm is
08:47:01 <somenerd[m]> I believe it's the entropy formula
08:47:06 <somenerd[m]> saw it somewhere
08:47:18 <strcat[m]> calculating # of possibilities is N**M where N is the number of possibilities per choice and M is the number of choices
08:47:56 <strcat[m]> so for example, if you do 204812, you'll see it's the same as 2132, but the last 4 bits of a BIP39 seed phrase are a checksum so it's really 2**128
08:48:07 <strcat[m]>  * so for example, if you do 2048**12, you'll see it's the same as 2**132, but the last 4 bits of a BIP39 seed phrase are a checksum so it's really 2**128
08:48:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> <somenerd[m] "I believe it's the entropy formu"> There are several entropy formulae lel
08:48:12 <somenerd[m]> lol
08:48:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I'm talking about fully random choices
08:48:22 <somenerd[m]> idk why I wrote "the"
08:48:28 <somenerd[m]> saw it on wikipedia
08:48:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "calculating # of possibilities i"> So if I use only lower then n=26?
08:48:36 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yes
08:48:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> And the length of my password = m?
08:48:47 <strcat[m]> yes
08:48:57 <strcat[m]> 26**28 is 4161536836220038342098551818958537752576
08:49:10 <strcat[m]> 2**28 is 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 (lower)
08:49:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: so when exactly is 256-bit enc useful?
08:49:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or is it just theater
08:49:59 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's used to provide a ridiculously large security margin
08:50:19 <somenerd[m]> future proofing?
08:50:32 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: 128-bit entropy for a seed is enough
08:51:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> How weird is 33 chars btw?
08:51:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's the max on the trezor rn
08:51:10 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: using more than 128-bit entropy is essentially theater
08:51:36 <strcat[m]> AES-256, etc. are not really theater since that's guarding against a future AES compromise if that happens, so you still have 128-bit+ security even if AES is fairly severely broken
08:51:51 <strcat[m]> that's the idea behind it
08:52:52 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: if only thinking about the short term (15 years) then yes it's theater
08:53:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> (sarcasm) ah yeah Imma pass my trezor down to my family for the next 2000y
08:53:58 <strcat[m]> >>> math.ceil(math.log(2**128, 26))
08:53:58 <strcat[m]> 28
08:54:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Thanks btw
08:54:10 <strcat[m]> \>\>\> math.ceil(math.log(2**128, 26))
08:54:11 <strcat[m]> 28
08:54:26 <somenerd[m]> > (sarcasm) ah yeah Imma pass my trezor down to my family for the next 2000y
08:54:26 <somenerd[m]> lol
08:54:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have a feeling python will crash my workstation
08:54:48 <strcat[m]> that's how you can calculate it in Python (just bear in mind that's using double precision floats, it's fine for this)
08:55:00 <strcat[m]> anyway you can check it with integer math
08:55:29 <strcat[m]> you can see for yourself that 2628 is higher than 2128, and 26**27 is lower
08:55:40 <strcat[m]>  * you can see for yourself that 26**28 is higher than 2**128, and 26**27 is lower
08:55:45 <strcat[m]> matrix markdown support is really irritating
08:55:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Thanks
08:56:11 <strcat[m]> and yeah I think you can see for yourself that when generating a random passphrase
08:56:17 <strcat[m]> you might as well just use lowercase letters
08:56:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why .ceil instead of .floor?
08:56:25 <strcat[m]> if you aren't limited in length
08:56:36 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: because I'm calculating the length needed to be at least 128-bit security
08:56:44 <strcat[m]> so need to round up
08:56:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sounds a little optimistic, no?
08:56:59 <strcat[m]> > you can see for yourself that 26**28 is higher than 2**128, and 26**27 is lower
08:57:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> But I'll do some reading first
08:57:09 <strcat[m]> there is no optimism involved
08:57:10 <strcat[m]> you seem confused
08:57:33 <strcat[m]> 26**28 is a precise calculation on the number of possibilities for random strings of 28 characters with lowercase letters
08:57:37 <strcat[m]> it is not a guess, it's a precise calculation
08:57:54 <strcat[m]> you can see that 2627 is lower than 128-bit security, 2628 is higher
08:58:02 <strcat[m]>  * you can see that 26**27 is lower than 128-bit security, 26**28 is higher
08:58:06 <strcat[m]> not guesswork or estimate involved here
08:58:11 <strcat[m]>  * no guesswork or estimate involved here
08:58:31 <strcat[m]> ceil is used to obtain the length that provides more than 128-bit security instead of just below
08:58:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> So let's say I pick 6 words from a dictionary
08:59:04 <strcat[m]> I never said anything about dictionary words
08:59:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> That is enough securitu?
08:59:11 <strcat[m]> you're changing the question now
08:59:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> * That is enough security?
08:59:28 <strcat[m]> we were talking about randomly choosing letters
08:59:30 <strcat[m]> not words
08:59:46 <somenerd[m]> > That is enough security?
08:59:46 <somenerd[m]> same calc
08:59:48 <strcat[m]> also 128-bit entropy is not really needed as I said before
09:00:10 <strcat[m]> 128-bit is already overkill for a random key, that's the point
09:00:19 <strcat[m]> and we're talking about a passphrase used to derive a key with key derivation
09:00:24 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/uTxASVpxHVVSgCaWZrlALUXV/message.txt >
09:00:29 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you can't change the question
09:00:30 <strcat[m]> no
09:00:31 <somenerd[m]> and log
09:00:34 <strcat[m]> no
09:00:41 <strcat[m]> please don't misinterpret what I said
09:00:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I was talking about choosing random letters, you can't change the question to words and reuse that
09:00:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm not, just trying n**m
09:01:07 <strcat[m]> so N is the number of words in the wordlist
09:01:13 <strcat[m]> M is the number of words you are using
09:01:17 <tryingraphene> on an off-topic question- i personally have not liked the idea of email apps (and other apps for that matter) storing credentials in plain text on an android phone. however, I am told that with disk encryption it isn't a big deal
09:01:24 <somenerd[m]> 2048^6
09:01:29 <strcat[m]> we are assuming the attacker knows how you generated the passphrase
09:01:37 <somenerd[m]> (assuming that the list is 2048 words)
09:01:39 <strcat[m]> bad idea not to assume that
09:01:47 <strcat[m]> yeah but he would be using far more than 2048 words
09:01:50 <strcat[m]> he said dictionary words
09:02:01 <somenerd[m]> yeah
09:02:16 <somenerd[m]> something like 5000-50000 depending on the dictionary
09:02:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: that's 413976684737889000000000000000000 a huge number lol
09:02:18 <somenerd[m]> (or more)
09:02:22 <tryingraphene> my concern, is if there is a questionable app doing questionable things isn't it a good idea to store user credentials encrypted on device?
09:03:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> tryingraphene: hardware backed keystore exists
09:03:07 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: don't understand the question
09:03:24 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: your phone is going to be a lot more secure than your desktop
09:03:40 <strcat[m]> apps are sandboxed
09:03:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: you can't change "> Sorry
09:03:48 <strcat[m]> an email app is going to store the credentials internally
09:04:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let's assume you hypothetically got root, you'd still have to deal with selinux and there is a hardware backed keystore from where you really can't extract any secrets
09:05:02 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense as a question
09:05:05 <strcat[m]> just end the conversation there
09:05:10 <tryingraphene> sorry what i mean is- if there is a misbehaving app on the device that is capable of, lets say, defeating sandbox just wondering if it is worth having an app store user credentials encrypted and only decrypting them when checking email with a user key entered
09:05:32 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: so you're saying, it exploits the OS on the device
09:05:40 <strcat[m]> gains full kernel level access via a kernel exploit exposed to the sandbox
09:05:51 <tryingraphene> yes i'm assuming that is the only way it could access the info
09:06:03 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: if your email app is able to be checking for emails it has the credentials
09:06:13 <strcat[m]> they are available to the OS
09:06:13 <tryingraphene> ha ha yes improbable i see
09:06:28 <strcat[m]> it has to provide the credentials each time to connects to the server
09:06:33 <strcat[m]> as soon as the connection dies it has to provide them again
09:06:39 <tryingraphene> i'm so used to dealing with rooted phones in the past
09:06:40 <strcat[m]>  * it has to provide the credentials each time it connects to the server
09:07:15 <tryingraphene> i got freaked out when i used to use k9 email app and just used my file explorer and pulled from the sql database my password plain as day in base64
09:07:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> tryingraphene: afaik from what I know you can't really get root on a user aosp build
09:07:36 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: apps can't access each other's data
09:07:39 <strcat[m]> not how it works
09:07:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is no permissive domain you could transition to
09:07:57 <tryingraphene> will take a while for me to adjust to grapheneos (and non rooted android in general) security model
09:08:10 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: exploiting the kernel
09:08:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: needs a chain for selinux, no.
09:08:33 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense
09:08:34 <tryingraphene> kind of mind blowing i used to run a rooted phone
09:08:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> * strcat: needs a chain for selinux, no?
09:08:37 <strcat[m]> exploiting the kernel
09:09:13 <strcat[m]> exploiting a code execution vulnerability in the kernel
09:09:19 <strcat[m]> that's exposed within the sandbox
09:09:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "exploiting a code execution vuln"> Then everything is done for
09:09:50 <strcat[m]> yes, that gives you kernel-level access, that's beyond (contained) root access
09:10:10 <strcat[m]> anyway the conversation doesn't make sense as I said before
09:10:24 <strcat[m]> would rather not continue a nonsensical conversation
09:10:30 <strcat[m]> it's not helpful to keep adding misleading statements to it
09:10:51 <strcat[m]> I don't want to sit here having to correct stuff for a discussion that doesn't make sense in the first place
09:11:02 <strcat[m]> apps can't access each other's data without a serious OS exploit chain
09:11:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: I wonder how much CFI protects
09:11:27 <marahelm[m]> tryingraphene: Dont talk to these people they are dicks. Lookup online
09:11:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> From what I get some exploits are really just code written to accidentally facilitate the exploit and for the compiler that would seem like expected behaviour, no?
09:12:11 <strcat[m]> marahelm: how is that helpful?
09:12:26 <strcat[m]> I think tryingraphene is happy with the information that has been provided
09:12:37 <somenerd[m]> they themselves said that they were used to the weaker rooted security model
09:12:45 <tryingraphene> yeah for sure, i appreciate all the info!
09:12:45 <strcat[m]> just feel anupritaisno1 is taking the conversation in a pointless direction
09:12:46 <Liakdeuser[m]> <marahelm[m] "tryingraphene: Dont talk to thes"> Oh, the same person who ranted on CalyxOS room.
09:12:49 <strcat[m]> and overcomplicating it
09:12:55 <somenerd[m]> aaaaaaaaaaaand they left
09:13:07 <strcat[m]> more concern trolls from CalyxOS trying to cause drama here
09:13:09 <strcat[m]> doesn't surprise me
09:13:10 <strcat[m]> there are many
09:13:30 <somenerd[m]> wow
09:13:58 <tryingraphene> yes i'm just starting to appreciate more about not having a rooted phone, before things like that were a large concern for me, like storing user credentials un-encrypted because essentially there was no security model
09:14:12 <tryingraphene> well supersu did some but definitely wasn't bulletproof
09:14:30 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: it's not clear what you mean by encrypted
09:14:36 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: not clear how you think that helps
09:14:57 <somenerd[m]> I believe they were talking about having a rooted phone
09:15:05 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: if you've totally broken the OS security model and given an app root access you've fully trusted it with everything not just file access
09:15:06 <somenerd[m]> not GrapheneOS (where apps are sandboxed)
09:15:08 <tryingraphene> for instance r2mail2 was an email app i switched to because it used android keystore to encrypt credentials of email logins
09:15:36 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene: and real root can just grab the key out of the app's memory, or use the keystore key
09:15:44 <tryingraphene> true ha ha
09:15:49 <strcat[m]> that's what I mean
09:15:57 <tryingraphene> i guess in my mind at the time it was more secure
09:16:08 <strcat[m]> encryption does NOTHING vs. an attacker with kernel/root access unless the data at rest
09:16:14 <strcat[m]> and as soon as the data is decrypted they get it
09:16:44 <tryingraphene> right, thats what i like about the memory allocation hardening graphene os has done
09:17:05 <somenerd[m]> isn't that unrelated? (I may be wrong though)
09:17:18 <strcat[m]> an app using the keystore to encrypt data locally doesn't protect against an attacker that has gained root/kernel level access
09:17:19 <tryingraphene> such as if i'm using keepass unlocked on graphene i feel it will be more secure with database unlocked in memory
09:17:24 <tryingraphene> vs your typical os
09:17:41 <strcat[m]> tryingraphene:  it's more secure because it's a lot harder to exploit the app, or the OS
09:17:50 <tryingraphene> nice
09:18:09 <strcat[m]> but if an attacker has gained root/kernel access via an exploit chain (which would be harder)
09:18:21 <strcat[m]> they can do anything the OS / apps can do
09:18:27 <strcat[m]> any data that's not at rest is available to them
09:18:53 <strcat[m]> encrypting stored data with the keystore doesn't protect against an attacker that has exploited the OS
09:19:07 <strcat[m]> if an app can use that keystore key, so can an attacker with root/kernel level access
09:19:13 <strcat[m]> it's not part of what that protects against
09:21:21 <tryingraphene> thanks for all the great info, I appreciate it! I'm out for now
11:31:18 <pythagonist[m]> Hello, I wanted to ask, if I can costumize the size of the graphene keyboard?
11:31:37 <pythagonist[m]> Because I am kinda better with a smaller one
11:33:51 <ayaen_t[m]> pythagonist: i dont think so.
11:33:56 <cfow8391[m]> Dont think so but i think you can download some app for itpythagonist
11:34:23 <ayaen_t[m]> why dont you try AnySoft keyboard ?
11:34:41 <jpds> pythagonist[m]: OpenBoard has a keyboard resizing option
11:34:46 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ?
11:34:49 <ayaen_t[m]> and deny unnecesary oermissions
11:35:09 <ayaen_t[m]> kay.
11:37:16 <pythagonist[m]> thanks all of you
11:37:46 <cfow8391[m]> :)
11:42:23 <cfow8391[m]> Stupid thing to ask but in settings clicking the "Check for updates" is not giving any output like "Searching for updates" so is this normal?
11:42:44 <somenerd[m]> Probably because there aren't updates
11:43:04 <cfow8391[m]> Oh okey thanks
11:48:19 <Thatcher[m]> <cfow8391[m] "Stupid thing to ask but in setti"> It will notify you when there are updates. It checks for updates every 4 hours automatically.
11:48:45 <cfow8391[m]> Oooh okeyy
11:51:48 <cfow8391[m]> Also is there like roadmap or upcoming features list or something like that?
11:51:56 <asgood_sam> Hi, what's the best way to  keep updating vanadium and vanadium webview apks on a pixel 2 running Graphene? Any plans to publish them to fdroid or similar?
11:52:46 <cfow8391[m]> <asgood_sam "Hi, what's the best way to  keep"> Not sure but I think they update on the software update
11:53:00 <nscnt> asgood_sam: It's currently only updated by system updates. An app to handle a first party repository for such apps is planned
11:53:10 <Albakham[m]> <cfow8391[m] "Also is there like roadmap or up"> https://grapheneos.org/faq#roadmap
11:53:31 <cfow8391[m]> <Albakham[m] "https://grapheneos.org/faq#roadm"> Thankss
11:55:17 <Albakham[m]> So it's mainly https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
11:56:58 <strcat[m]> asgood_sam: there will be probably be a few more OS updates on the Pixel 2 anyway
11:57:10 <strcat[m]> asgood_sam: it's not getting a higher security patch level though due to lack of newer firmware, etc.
11:58:01 <cfow8391[m]> <Albakham[m] "So it's mainly https://github.co"> thanks you :)
11:58:09 <cfow8391[m]> * thank you :)
12:01:40 <asgood_sam> Thanks - that's a shame. strcat[m] that sounds great. It's a shame that the AOSP patches can't be applied against the older firmwares but I presume it needs someone to do all the leg work
12:03:44 <strcat[m]> asgood_sam: it's not about AOSP patches
12:04:00 <strcat[m]> asgood_sam: Android security bulletins are half AOSP, half stuff like firmware
12:04:20 <strcat[m]> asgood_sam: regardless of what kind of device you have, you need updates to firmware, drivers, etc.
12:04:33 <strcat[m]> and that stuff is not actively developed anymore for the Pixel 2 SoC, etc.
12:06:49 <cfow8391[m]> What about pixel4? How long is it going to be developed
12:07:49 <strcat[m]> the minimum guarantee is currently 3 years after the product launch
12:07:58 <strcat[m]> becoming 4 years for next generation devices
12:09:51 <asgood_sam> https://endoflife.date/pixel
12:10:35 <asgood_sam> Ah, maybe that is manufacture rather than software... but it still has release dates
12:10:56 <cfow8391[m]> <strcat[m] "the minimum guarantee is current"> Okey
13:04:22 <pacman37[m]> <strcat[m] "becoming 4 years for next genera"> You mean the devices after pixel 5?
13:05:32 <strcat[m]> yes
13:05:35 <strcat[m]> the minimum guarantee is going up
13:54:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> asgood_sam: Is there something like that site but for guaranteed OS updates
14:04:30 <Liakdeuser[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "asgood_sam: Is there something l"> Isn't it already there ("software update"?)
14:16:23 <nscnt> hypokeimenon[m]: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en
14:43:58 <hypokeimenon[m]> I guess there's no guarantee there will be an OS upgrade ~Q3 every year, so they can only say 'three years/four years' of software updates.
15:02:13 <fll[m]> hypokeimenon🖤‍❤️🏳️‍🌈: it says android updates though...
15:19:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> <fll[m] "hypokeimenon🖤‍❤️🏳️‍🌈: it says"> I wanted to know specifically, what is the latest Android version you will have.
15:22:05 <Liakdeuser[m]> Android version at release + 3 usually
15:30:19 <fll[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "I wanted to know specifically, w"> For that they would have to know android version numbers 3 years in advance and the numbering could, in theory, change. Just because they release 1 number each year now, doesn't mean it's the same in 3 or 4 years

20:09:30 <EncryptedSnowsto> Hello?
20:10:09 <nscnt> EncryptedSnowsto: Hello
20:10:26 <Baobab> The xmpp bridge worked
20:10:28 <Baobab> noice
20:10:31 <EncryptedSnowsto> Great it worked
20:15:04 <EncryptedSnowsto> So with GrapheneOS, I can block an app from internet access from the permission manager instead of needing an app like netguard?
20:15:32 <MysticalOwl> yes Snow
20:16:48 <EncryptedSnowsto> Awesome. I'm thinking about getting the Galaxy Buds for cheap on eBay, but the app to control them...yeah I don't know bout that
20:18:03 <LinusSexTips[m]> The vast majority of play store apps will work fine, you just may not receive notifications
20:19:49 <EncryptedSnowsto> Yeah I meant more so I don't trust it lol
20:21:01 <LinusSexTips[m]> Just disable the network permission then
20:21:30 <LinusSexTips[m]> I have some Anker wireless earbuds that have an app, so I just disabled all the permissions
20:22:01 <Baobab> Ear buds have network permissions?
20:22:31 <Baobab> Or have I completely misses the point?
20:22:31 <EncryptedSnowsto> Yeah :) that's why I asked. I just hope they come with updated firmware cause I would need to give the app internet for that
20:22:45 <EncryptedSnowsto> > Ear buds have network permissions?
20:22:45 <EncryptedSnowsto> > Or have I completely misses the point?
20:22:45 <EncryptedSnowsto> The app to control the earbuds
20:22:55 <LinusSexTips[m]> No the app
20:23:04 <Baobab> Oh.
20:23:31 <EncryptedSnowsto> That was weird, did the double message show up for you guys too?
20:23:40 <LinusSexTips[m]> My earbuds have an app to tweak them
20:23:52 <EncryptedSnowsto> > That was weird, did the double message show up for you guys too?
20:23:53 <EncryptedSnowsto> Must be the bridge
20:24:04 <MysticalOwl> yes
20:24:05 <LinusSexTips[m]> Not for me
20:24:15 <MysticalOwl> when u see double there is trouble
20:24:25 <EncryptedSnowsto> Yeah its when I do quotes. I guess the bridge don't like that
20:24:26 <MysticalOwl> its a glitch in the matrix
20:24:42 <EncryptedSnowsto> Prepare for trouble!
20:24:59 <EncryptedSnowsto> And make it double!
20:25:15 <Baobab> I think in freenode you can only make one line of text per message.
20:26:01 <EncryptedSnowsto> Oh yeah
20:27:43 <MysticalOwl> lol
20:29:24 <[czar]> Anyone know a good way to restore my IMEI? I messed up my installation now I can't use SIM cards
20:57:30 <EncryptedSnowsto> Anyone know of another Home Launcher, ya know, isn't spyware. The GrapheneOS Launcher has basically no customization at all
20:57:40 <EncryptedSnowsto> Anyone know of another Home Launcher, ya know, isn't spyware? The GrapheneOS Launcher has basically no customization at all

21:12:30 <the5000[m]> Can I use Windows 7 to install graphene?
21:13:21 <Baobab> Is Windows 7 deprecated?
21:13:35 <Baobab> or am I thinking of Windows XP?
21:13:48 <the5000[m]> I never used powershell before I don't know if I would know how to do this
21:15:06 <nscnt> the5000[m]: Windows 7 isn't officially supported. In the past a user had problems with some commands if I remember correctly
21:15:25 <nscnt> the5000[m]: On Windows 10 and PowerShell it's pretty much just copy & paste
21:15:51 <the5000[m]> How can I install graphene on Windows 7 then
21:16:31 <Baobab> You can probably use a vm if you can't install GrapheneOS via Windows 7.
21:16:40 <nscnt> the5000[m]: Not sure, that's up to you to figure out as it's not officially supported
21:17:21 <nscnt> Baobab: VMs aren't recommended
21:20:54 <nscnt> Everyone can get Windows 10 and use it for free forever. You may not be able to personalize it etc., but that's it
21:21:23 <nscnt> Officially
21:21:47 <Baobab> I personally don't like Windows.
21:23:43 <r0tt0r[m]> <Baobab "I personally don't like Windows."> i flashed via linux and its nothing special if you follow the commandline and advices how to proceed
21:25:11 <nscnt> It was just an offtopic side note
21:25:29 <the5000[m]> I'm just going to use the minimal adb method then. It worked last time
21:25:33 <Baobab> Yeah, sorry for that.
21:26:33 <nscnt> Well, I was more referring to myself ^_^
21:28:47 <nscnt> the5000[m]: Don't know if that was a typo, but adb isn't official as well
21:29:50 <the5000[m]> I know it's not. If someone had trouble with win 7 and it then I wouldn't know how to do it. It got the job done anyways. I just followed a YouTube guide
21:30:31 <the5000[m]> I don't know that much about computers. I just care about privacy and security. I want to get into qubes and Linux sometime in the future
21:31:29 <EncryptedSnowsto> Is there any reason to use the default keyboard over openboard? I assume its just like this because they didn't want to include 3rd party software
21:31:39 <nscnt> the5000[m]: I think it has been said before to you, but following any other guide isn't recommended
21:32:40 <nscnt> the5000[m]: Typing commands in your terminal from a random tutorial isn't a very secure practice in my opinion
21:34:23 <nscnt> the5000[m]: But you have been told all this in the past. Just don't expect support then
21:34:56 <Baobab> I have flashbacks from when I wanted to something in linux and every once in a while I found somewhere online "just do this: rm -rf /* --no-preserve-root"
21:34:56 <the5000[m]> I can run powershell on 7 and do It then?
21:35:48 <nscnt> the5000[m]: Probably, but you need to figure out any errors yourself. As I said, some commands didn't work for a user in the past using Windows 7
21:36:14 <TheJollyRoger> the5000[m]: Please do not use a third party or "minimal" adb/fastboot, unless you would like to know how the "unbootable device" screen looks.
21:36:56 <TheJollyRoger> ie: softbricked.
21:37:42 <TheJollyRoger> the third party or "minimal" fastboot versions don't support A/B autodetection and can up writing to the wrong partition.
21:38:57 <TheJollyRoger> Resulting an an unbootable operating system.
21:40:40 <Albakham[m]> Anyone used fastboot/adb on NixOS to flash GrapheneOS?
21:41:10 <r0tt0r[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install i followed this step by step
21:42:29 <mike-of-earth> I am wondering if anyone has given the pixel 5's a shot yet. I used to run GrapheneOS on a pixel 3 I had, and am considering coming back.
21:43:02 <mike-of-earth> It'd be nice to pickup the newer 4 or 5 for the 5g
21:43:15 <r0tt0r[m]> only difference is in the fastboot doqnloaded folder i use ./fastboot to use the one from the downloaded folder
21:48:04 <whatisthematrix[> <Albakham[m] "Anyone used fastboot/adb on NixO"> I would suggest just curling the packages mentioned in the guide then removing them after.
21:48:34 <whatisthematrix[> I am pretty sure my distro has the right packages and versions but I still follow the guide. Not a single problem
21:49:06 <nscnt> Well, the guide suggests to use the package available by the distro if it's not broken
21:50:08 <whatisthematrix[> F at me.
21:50:55 <louipc> should probly just suggest to download it to make the guide simpler
21:51:00 <nscnt> The standalone platform-tools are just a workaround because most distros' packages are broken and/or out of date
21:51:04 <nscnt> louipc: No
21:51:27 <nscnt> I had this idea myself, but strcat explained why it's the bad direction to go
21:51:28 <louipc> "because most distros packages are broken"
21:51:37 <louipc> ohlol
21:52:07 <r0tt0r[m]> ye distro mayhem is quiet an issue
21:52:11 <louipc> multiple directions just cause confusion tho
21:52:52 <nscnt> louipc: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201220#c6234163
21:53:59 <louipc> trusting distro package is trusting a 3rd party tho..
21:54:16 <louipc> getting direct from google would be less middlemen
21:54:28 <louipc> thx for the link

22:56:11 <fivndim3[m]>  * Has anyone experienced issues using graphene with mint mobile?
22:56:11 <fivndim3[m]> Let me expand. Using a 3xl with grapheneos and Mint Mobile and just don't get any service. Talked with Mint Mobile twice now and no luck.
23:19:13 <fll[m]> fivndim3: did they give you APN settings, so you try adding it manually?
23:19:32 <EncryptedSnowsto> Alright well I'm switching to openboard
23:22:37 <strcat[m]> when you're answering questions about GrapheneOS on various platforms, try to link to a section on the site with more details about the topic like https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
23:24:51 <fivndim3[m]> <fll[m] "fivndim3: did they give you APN "> They tested with specific APN settings yes. Used settings provided by Mint Customer Care and matches what's on their website
23:25:08 <fivndim3[m]> Still fails to actually get any service
23:25:49 <fivndim3[m]> I think it briefly connected for all of 10s at one point and I was able to make a call but then it dropped service again
23:26:02 <fivndim3[m]> No intermittent service since then either...
