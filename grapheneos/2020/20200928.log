00:25:56 <k3tan> anyone having issues with the notification dropdown on latest graphene? some parts are transparent, newpipe doesn't have the music functions
00:30:49 <strcat[m]> it's normal that some is transparent now, the default style just changed
00:30:58 <strcat[m]> we have a fair bit of control over how it's configured if we decided to change it
00:31:15 <strcat[m]> i.e. we don't need to change the code to change assorted configuration for it
00:32:34 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YbMZmQdOHSuuoAekseGQGlIL/message.txt >
00:32:35 <strcat[m]> for example
00:33:32 <strcat[m]> k3tan: not sure what you mean about newpipe, are you sure you can't just expand the notification with the arrow?
00:40:04 <k3tan> https://ibb.co/H7qbP6V
00:40:50 <k3tan> there used to be buttons
00:40:58 <k3tan> for play, pause, next track etc
00:41:12 <strcat[m]> k3tan: https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/4031
00:41:15 <strcat[m]> looks like a bug they just fixed
00:41:35 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/3178
00:41:36 <k3tan> my bad, thank you!
00:41:47 <strcat[m]> maybe they were using targetSdkVersion 30 without updating to the new way of doing media controls
00:42:01 <strcat[m]> k3tan: might not be in a release yet, they just fixed it
00:42:18 <k3tan> yeah, i understand, thanks, appreciate the help
00:42:21 <strcat[m]> k3tan: ah maybe try the release candidate they mention there? if it's out
00:42:35 <k3tan> i'll just wait, it's no big deal
00:51:27 <jimbobobjoe[m]> new android 11 update- anyone know where to update APN?
00:51:52 <qt_pie[m]> ik this seems stupid, but is the pleading face emoji gone?
00:53:44 <jimbobobjoe[m]> <qt_pie[m] "ik this seems stupid, but is the"> on the default keyboard?
00:57:22 <qt_pie[m]> yeah I cant find it, if someone can plz screenshot. I might just be missing it.
00:58:48 <jimbobobjoe[m]> ðŸ¥º this one?
01:00:32 <jimbobobjoe[m]> Cant find it on mineðŸ¤” I'm using openboard
01:02:24 <strcat[m]> qt_pie: default keyboard doesn't have nearly all the supported emojis in the OS
01:02:52 <strcat[m]> it doesn't support changing the gender / skin tone and is missing newer generations of them
01:03:20 <strcat[m]> adding the newer ones would be simple but it probably makes more sense to find a new keyboard to use
01:03:59 <jimbobobjoe[m]> Fdroid has a decent selection
01:07:30 <qt_pie[m]> strcat: is that the case in AOSP?
01:10:16 <qt_pie[m]> like can I use that keyboard and is there any security implication?
01:18:52 <jimbobobjoe[m]> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.dslul.openboard.inputmethod.latin/
01:20:21 <jimbobobjoe[m]> its open source, which is good, and doesn't need internet access
01:30:12 <strcat[m]> qt_pie: AOSP keyboard has security support and basic bug fixes
01:30:21 <strcat[m]> qt_pie: and some basic maintenance
01:30:26 <strcat[m]> but it's not actively improved atm beyond that
01:30:40 <strcat[m]> it's just meant to be a basic keyboard that works
01:30:42 <strcat[m]> not something fancy
01:31:29 <qt_pie[m]> what would it take to get all the emojis?
01:31:57 <strcat[m]> add them into the list but it probably needs to be reorganized / improved a bit if a bunch is going to be added
01:32:27 <strcat[m]> there are assorted forks of it with more features and various improvements
01:32:36 <strcat[m]> they may also make bad choices for privacy and security though
01:32:42 <strcat[m]> don't know
02:13:56 <xiaocutezi[m]> Anyone know if there are any known way to hide status bar or immersive/expanded mode on Android 11?
02:13:56 <xiaocutezi[m]> I'm able to do in on Android 9 on non GrapheneOS but using the adb method doesn't work in GrapheneOS/Android 11
02:16:18 <strcat[m]> what do you mean?
02:16:20 <strcat[m]> apps can hide it
02:18:02 <xiaocutezi[m]> I tried systemui to hide it but can't. My intention is to hide it globally across all apps
02:39:43 <null[m]> <strcat[m] "apps can hide it"> I think they want to hide it regardless of what app they're in, all the time.
02:43:36 <xiaocutezi[m]> Yup. This is not a deal breaker by any means but would help to improve longevity of my Pixel 4. I dealt with amoled burn in on other phones hence went to reduce chances on current phone.
02:44:01 <xiaocutezi[m]> I'll look around XDA some more meanwhile
02:46:11 <renlord> xiaocutezi[m]: do you keep your phone running 24/7?
02:47:48 <xiaocutezi[m]> <renlord "xiaocutezi: do you keep your pho"> Doesn't need 24/7. I read a lot of RSS and Twidere so the screen tend to stay on for prolonged period
02:48:07 <xiaocutezi[m]> Content is dynamic but status bar us not
02:48:27 <xiaocutezi[m]> Not to mention now with Matrix also. Lol
02:49:32 <renlord> some random source i pulled up suggeest you need the same layout for >200 hours before burn in starts
02:50:06 <renlord> i dont think any reasonable person can have their screen on for >200 hours straight. (shrugs)
02:53:12 <xiaocutezi[m]> <renlord "i dont think any reasonable pers"> As a matter of fact, you wouldn't need that long. Oled TVs have the same issue also with sports logo n such. I only got my Pixel 4 XL yesterday. I prefer to do it ASAP and be on the safer side
03:13:32 <anupritaisno1[m4> [xiaocutezi](https://matrix.to/#/@xiaocutezi:matrix.org): pm me I have something for you
03:20:56 <null[m]> Couldn't you just... PM them? Lol
03:40:32 <anupritaisno1[m4> [null](https://matrix.to/#/@0x000000:tchncs.de): no
03:46:50 <null[m]> Understandable have a nice day
03:51:14 <xiaocutezi[m]> Sorry I'm quite new to Matrix..not sure how to PM. Lol! Gimme a while to figure out.
03:58:31 <anupritaisno1[m4> I need people who can help test on pixel 4a
03:58:37 <anupritaisno1[m4> Pm me if you can
05:23:12 <cyborgninjaneer[> Big thank you to strcat for the Android 11 update!
05:25:10 <sphinxcat[m]> strcat is not the only developer, you know.
05:46:48 <xiaocutezi[m]> Just curious. Strcat is Daniel MacKay?
05:47:45 <sphinxcat[m]> xiaocutezi: yes, and 'thestinger' on GitHub.
05:51:23 <xiaocutezi[m]> Ahh. I know his handle on reddit but weren't sure of over here and github. I  take note of it. Thanks
05:57:30 <cn3m> xiaocutezi: Daniel Micay(strcat or thestinger), renlord, anupritasino1, aeonsolutions, and several others are all very active on the project
06:01:17 <xiaocutezi[m]> cn3m sphinxcat Thanks! Its good to know that this place is active with dev input. I will be sure to hang out around here more often. I'm no dev but quite active on reporting issues on Github for other projects.
06:02:12 <cn3m> Reporting bugs, (and if you are in a position to) beta testing, are great ways to help the project
06:03:20 <xiaocutezi[m]> I be sure to help out in any way I can
06:04:19 <xiaocutezi[m]>  Please read our rules: https://jollyrogers.ca/public/grapheneos-channel-rules.txt

06:10:22 <xiaocutezi[m]> got it. thanks
06:27:58 <mistazaki[m]> Can i install WhatsApp at grapheneos?
06:29:53 <fll[m]> mistazaki: yes
06:30:09 <mistazaki[m]> Not problem?
06:30:29 <mistazaki[m]> just download aurora and install whatsapp apps?
06:30:55 <fll[m]> No problem. Works fine. Best to install via Aurora Store to easily keep up to date
06:32:07 <xiaocutezi[m]> > No problem. Works fine. Best to install via Aurora Store to easily keep up to date
06:32:08 <xiaocutezi[m]> it works just that without gapps services, there will be no push notifications. Notifications come in automatically once the phone is unlocked
06:33:46 <fll[m]> Oh. Don't they have their own push implementation anymore? I didn't use WA for the last 2 years or so
06:37:28 <xiaocutezi[m]> WA depends on Google push services so without it, push notifications cannot work for all apps unless they do periodic polling and / or refresh manually. Telegram on FDroid is one that using a background service to poll for new messages.
06:40:26 <fll[m]> I thought WA did the background polling too.
06:41:24 <xiaocutezi[m]> I'm not sure of this as I did not see such an option defined explicitly but if it does, then you will need to ensure that battery optimization is turned off for it also
06:41:46 <xiaocutezi[m]> otherwise if it is in Doze mode, it will not be able to receive new messages

07:40:41 <mistazaki[m]> Signal app, but keyboard
07:42:15 <mistazaki[m]> Is the way to setup or install the os wrong?
07:45:35 <zyxt128[m]> This is weird
07:45:35 <zyxt128[m]> It looks like either the OS is ingoring the FLAG_SECURE on these screens, or these apps are not utilizing it at all. Have you tried these apps on a regular phone?
07:50:14 <mistazaki[m]> How to true setup?
07:54:09 <zyxt128[m]> This is not something that's under the user's control. The FLAG_SECURE is set programmatically in a view on an app that wants to protect a screen from screen captures. So, either the app developer should be aware of this in order to protect his screen, or this is a OS issue and has to be fixed in the source code.

07:55:54 <zyxt128[m]> That's why I asked you if you have a similar experience on a regular phone, because if you have the same experience, it the app developer responsibility to resolve this.

07:56:58 <Sheru[m]> Sort of offtopic, but I rather have it disabled (screen recording)
07:57:35 <Sheru[m]> (As it does not utilize FLAG_SECURE, on lockscreen, or on KeepassDX where screenshot is not allowed, but screen recording is)
07:57:51 <Sheru[m]> More upstream issues yay /s
07:59:41 <Sheru[m]> As in on screen recording. It should have not been allowed in the first place, maybe?

08:57:26 <dreth[m]> is anyone else getting system UI not responding on pixel 3XL
08:57:31 <dreth[m]> maybe a memory leak?
09:11:53 <dazinism> xiaocutezi: WhatsApp, signal, conversations.im(xmpp) all have implementations of their own push notification, rather than polling, that they use if they don't detect Play Services on the device
09:14:58 <xiaocutezi[m]> dazinism I'm inclined to disagree though. I'm using WhatsApp and Telegram Fdroid on not just GrapheneOS but also on Omnirom and OxygenOS. On Omnirom which has microg, push notification works fine for all apps. For phones without microg or with disabled polling service like Signal and Telegram, once those are off, there are no notifications once said apps go into doze
09:16:02 <xiaocutezi[m]> In order for push notifications to work, it must be signed with the respective app store encryption keys
09:26:23 <dazinism> xiaocutezi: need to have battery optimisation off. Not sure what you mean by 'disabled polling services'
09:27:13 <dazinism> conversations.im has had a good implementation of polling for years
09:27:29 <dazinism> Sorry... good implementation of push
09:28:25 <dazinism> Big apps like WhatsApp and Telegram have their own push so they get good battery behavior on devices without Play
09:28:36 <dazinism> Like Amazon Fire tablets
09:29:09 <dazinism> Or the countless AOSP based phones in Asia which don't have Play services

09:33:10 <xiaocutezi[m]> This needs to enable. And then it will appear permanently on status bar.
09:34:07 <xiaocutezi[m]> Telegram Fdroid has no push service unless this is enabled
09:41:28 <mavic321[m]> Today i will get a pixel 4 and want to install graphene os on it. Is the pixel 4 already fully supported for graphene os and are there some bugs or trouble i will get with the os?
09:43:15 <xiaocutezi[m]> <mavic321[m] "Today i will get a pixel 4 and w"> For context, I just got my Pixel 4 XL yesterday and got into GrapheneOS within the first 30mins. Pixel 4 should be inside the download section also
09:45:21 <mavic321[m]> How is your experience for now xiaocutezi ? Everything is smooth? No bugs or struggles as so far?
09:47:36 <xiaocutezi[m]> None that I'm aware. I bought this phone on impulse especially just for GrapheneOS.
09:47:36 <xiaocutezi[m]> For one, I lose Magisk Root but I'm prepared for it from the start
09:48:49 <xiaocutezi[m]> Everything is smooth so far, battery is pretty awesome so far but I didn't get the chance to test it with stock ROM also
09:48:50 <mavic321[m]> I doubt between graphene os and Calyxos. Dont really know what the best for me would be. If i will use Calyxos i will not ise MicroG so maybe someone can advise me what will be a better option. I want to keep the security high but not wanna lose things like good camera etc.
09:49:12 <mavic321[m]> <xiaocutezi[m] "Everything is smooth so far, bat"> niceee
09:52:00 <cn3m> GrapheneOS has far better privacy and security and CalyxOS has marginally better performance and a lot more compatibility mavic321:
09:52:11 <cn3m> GrapheneOS will support Google Camera and even if the domain is removed it will still work

09:53:06 <cn3m> GrapheneOS and CalyxOS are both great projects that target different users. I consider them both secure, private, and usable

09:54:51 <cn3m> I used APKMirror personally
09:55:17 <xiaocutezi[m]> I rem this was mentioned in Reddit and Daniel mentioned he want to close this loophole
09:55:54 <strcat[m]> upstream issues: I mean, you can *see* the screen yourself, I'm not sure what you're concerned about
09:56:07 <cn3m> <xiaocutezi[m] "I rem this was mentioned in Redd"> The SELinux domain is different
09:56:15 <mavic321[m]> Thanks for all the explanation! What is the biggest difference in security between graphene os and calyx?
09:56:43 <strcat[m]> mistazaki: I think screen recording is working as intended for this initial version of it, it doesn't offer many options yet
09:57:26 <cn3m> <mavic321[m] "Thanks for all the explanation! "> That is a very long list. CalyxOS is using stock AOSP for security beside the USB restriction patch. Essentially everything GrapheneOS adds is something CalyxOS doesn't have security patch wise(beside the aforementioned usb restriciton)
09:57:45 <cn3m> security hardening patch*
09:58:25 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: you're not correct about push notifications, apps DO NOT require any special signatures or system privileges to do push properly, they just need to use a foreground service + ask for a battery optimization exception, like Signal does, and they can do it as efficiently as FCM can itself if they care to implement it well
09:58:46 <cn3m> CalyxOS of course has all the standards like verified boot, rollback protection, and latest patches from AOSP
09:59:48 <cn3m> things like hardened_malloc, hardened exec spawning, the hardened-linux kernel, vanadium would be the biggest security changes on GrapheneOS
09:59:55 <strcat[m]> mavic321: the whole point of GrapheneOS is that it provides a substantial set of privacy and security enhancements on top of the AOSP baseline
10:00:15 <strcat[m]> mavic321: I think you're misunderstanding and missing the point of the project if you don't get that
10:00:24 <strcat[m]> this is not a way to get builds of AOSP
10:02:14 <mavic321[m]> <strcat[m] "mavic321: I think you're misunde"> I get it and understand the project. I was just doubting between both OS but i see its really a choice between better security or better user experience. Correct me if i am wrongðŸ˜‡
10:02:39 <strcat[m]> mavic321: what's better about the user experience there?
10:04:00 <strcat[m]> unless you simply mean having F-Droid bundled
10:04:04 <strcat[m]> but you can just install it yourself
10:04:10 <xiaocutezi[m]> <strcat[m] "xiaocutezi: you're not correct a"> I just checked Google Firebase. Apparently apps do not need that on Android whereas for iOS for push notification to work, it has to be signed by Apple. My bad for confusing the two
10:04:23 <strcat[m]> and I do not think having the privileged extension really provides a better experience due to bugs
10:04:49 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: apps do use FCM for push on the stock OS - but they are *capable* of doing it themselves to handle it without FCM when it's not available
10:05:40 <mavic321[m]> <strcat[m] "mavic321: what's better about th"> Like i did some reasearch on internet and saw that Calyx looks like it looks fasterwith loading apps etc.
10:06:05 <cn3m> Yes CalyxOS uses a broken implementation of process spawning that is much faster for app cold starts
10:06:33 <cn3m> it comes at a security and privacy loss, but it is faster on low end devices(3a and 3a XL) for cold start of apps
10:06:51 <cn3m> different goals of the projects
10:06:56 <strcat[m]> mavic321: suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/usage#exec-spawning
10:07:18 <strcat[m]> mavic321: spawning apps after the first start is not any noticeably slower on GrapheneOS only the first start is slower
10:07:24 <strcat[m]> why? because serious privacy and security issues otherwise
10:08:24 <strcat[m]> this is the point of GrapheneOS, and I really don't think something like this that only impacts 1st start of an app makes the user experience worse, it's 200ms of your time, once per boot (unless the app is pushed out of memory)
10:08:33 <strcat[m]> and on a flagship device it's 100ms or less
10:08:33 <blacklight447[m]> I wonder, do you actually use fdroid strcat ?
10:08:42 <cn3m> CalyxOS is very focused on user experience especially the less tech savvy. In general they are meant for different kinds of people
10:09:00 <strcat[m]> if you get a Pixel 4 you aren't going to notice exec spawning
10:09:11 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 and 4 XL are also the only devices with maintainers
10:09:19 <cn3m> even a Pixel 4a ditches the eMMC
10:09:24 <mavic321[m]> Thanks strcat for your explenation. its clear now
10:09:35 <cn3m> so the exec spawning would be much faster if that is supported in the future
10:09:45 <xiaocutezi[m]> Maybe you can educate me on this. My base understanding for push notification is that a said server is polling for new messages on the phone's behalf.
10:09:46 <xiaocutezi[m]> When a new message is found. The resulting message is forwarded to the user's phone. Hence when an app is not signed by the respective store, said message cannot be forwarded.
10:09:46 <xiaocutezi[m]> So when you said a phone is capable of doing that, doesn't that mean that the phone need to be polling for new messages? And also hence the reason why when a phone is in doze mode, a high priority message can still go through and wake the phone?
10:09:48 <strcat[m]> unfortunately people (including here especially recently) spread FUD about things they don't know about
10:09:56 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: no, that's not how push works
10:10:23 <strcat[m]> there is no polling on a server or otherwise
10:10:27 <strcat[m]> it's push, that's the point of it
10:10:41 <cn3m> CalyxOS is a great project and they do excellent work. The target audience is very different though so it makes direct comparisons hard. Very hard
10:10:55 <xiaocutezi[m]> <strcat[m] "xiaocutezi: no, that's not how p"> Noted. I go read up again
10:11:12 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: this is how push notifications are implemented (with or without FCM): a connection is kept open from the phone to a server, the server pushes notifications through the connection, the phone is responsible for making sure the connection stays alive
10:11:42 <renlord> long lived sockets ^
10:11:55 <renlord> so server can push to the device
10:12:04 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: to make sure the connection stays alive, the implementation has to listen for network change events and reconnect afterwards, along with running a timer using an OS timer API to ping the connection at a regular intervals based on the type of the connection
10:12:19 <strcat[m]> for example, with an IPv4 mobile connection, pinging it every 3 minutes might be fine
10:12:26 <strcat[m]> for IPv6, it can probably do it every 10+ minutes
10:12:57 <renlord> curious how it works when theres lots of handover between cell towers when travelling at high speeds
10:13:11 <strcat[m]> also it can detect if the connection is dropped and dynamically adjust the interval it checks based on whether it's working to keep the connection alive
10:13:12 <strcat[m]> that's what a good implementation will do
10:13:14 <renlord> i assume there's an emitted event to restart the sockets
10:13:21 <strcat[m]> renlord: doesn't change your IP or break connections
10:13:37 <mavic321[m]> I have only one last question before i am fully sure to use graphene. It will be normal that u will not always get all the notifications or will it get notification like after every 10 minutes or something? And will the camera work u think on the pixel 4?
10:13:54 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: FCM uses a connection to Google's cloud push server, non-FCM connects to the app server, implemented the same way either way
10:14:15 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: the FCM server just acts as a middleman and the app has to upload notifications there via an API instead of doing it themselves
10:14:25 <strcat[m]> FCM is not any more magically efficient than what an app can do themselves
10:14:27 <cn3m> mavic321: notifications work if they don't require proprietary code and usage of Google servers which is not end to end encrypted
10:14:56 <strcat[m]> mavic321: I just explained above that apps can do push without GrapheneOS, read what I wrote above, I gave a detailed explanation afterwards too
10:15:10 <strcat[m]>  * mavic321: I just explained above that apps can do push without FCM, read what I wrote above, I gave a detailed explanation afterwards too
10:15:35 <strcat[m]> many apps like WhatsApp and Signal have support for push notifications without FCM, many others don't, it varies by app
10:15:36 <cn3m> The Pixel 4 camera works just fine
10:15:52 <strcat[m]> some implementations are more efficient than others, the way I described above is how to do it as efficiently as FCM does it
10:16:13 <strcat[m]> mavic321: https://grapheneos.org/usage#camera
10:16:46 <cn3m> If notifications don't work with an app on GrapheneOS it is usually a good thing as they aren't done in a way to respect your privacy
10:17:06 <cn3m> I would consider it an anti feature to have compatibility with that
10:18:39 <xiaocutezi[m]> <strcat[m] "many apps like WhatsApp and Sign"> Not challenging your understanding but currently for WhatsApp and Telegram and Signal, i have no notification unless I open the app myself compared to when with microg and Play services installed
10:18:52 <strcat[m]> you're incorrect
10:19:12 <renlord> xiaocutezi[m]: pls complain to the app developers
10:19:27 <renlord> they dont handle the absence of play services correctly
10:19:28 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: remove microG if you have installed it, it does not work on GrapheneOS and will break your apps
10:19:45 <strcat[m]> WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram all have push on GrapheneOS
10:20:03 <renlord> yea, it was so noisy, i had to disable them
10:20:09 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: remove microG / Play services if you've tried to install them, that won't work and will just break your apps
10:20:32 <strcat[m]> they are not regular apps that can be installed as third party apps
10:20:54 <strcat[m]> they require privileged permissions only available to system apps with those permissions explicitly whitelisted, and they require being whitelisted for various other things too
10:20:59 <rainme[m]> no issues with telegram notifications, installed via aurora store
10:21:14 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS does not include support for Play services, whether it's the Google implementation or the very incomplete microG implementation
10:21:24 <xiaocutezi[m]> <renlord "xiaocutezi: pls complain to the "> Err....so with microg and Play services installed, all said apps works fine and then without, I should complain to all the app developers cause its their fault?
10:21:24 <strcat[m]> push in Telegram, WhatsApp and Signal works fine though
10:21:46 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: if you have installed microG or Play services, you need to remove them, and that is what is causing your problems
10:21:57 <xiaocutezi[m]> <strcat[m] "xiaocutezi: remove microG if you"> I'm not talking about microg on Grapheme. Its on my other phones
10:22:12 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: push works fine in Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp on GrapheneOS
10:22:16 <xiaocutezi[m]> <strcat[m] "WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram al"> How to get it to work?
10:22:20 <mavic321[m]> <strcat[m] "GrapheneOS does not include supp"> But i can still download apps with aurora store to get some apps from the playstore right?
10:22:24 <strcat[m]> it works out-of-the-box
10:22:27 <strcat[m]> mavic321: yes
10:22:54 <strcat[m]> xiaocutezi: to make it work during Doze, they need a battery optimization exception like Play services has for FCM
10:22:56 <strcat[m]> Signal asks for that itself
10:23:07 <strcat[m]> don't know if the other 2 do but you can grant it yourself
10:23:19 <strcat[m]> other than that, it works fine
10:23:29 <renlord> whatsapp's push is really aggresive
10:23:44 <strcat[m]> nothing needs to be configured in Signal for it to work
10:23:47 <renlord> drains battery really fast when batter optimization is switched off for it
10:24:02 <strcat[m]> it works though
10:24:08 <renlord> yes, it does
10:24:25 <strcat[m]> efficiency varies by app, I posted above how apps can do it efficiently to match what FCM does
10:24:28 <strcat[m]> suggest people read that
10:24:36 <renlord> i think when i last checked battery usage, it was responsible for 30% battery drain
10:24:40 <strcat[m]> please don't ask questions about this that were just answered above
10:24:42 <renlord> its really shit
10:24:54 <mavic321[m]> And u will still get all the updates for android right? The phone will still goes with the latest updates. Or only when graphene makes a update?
10:25:06 <strcat[m]> you will get GrapheneOS updates, if you are using GrapheneOS
10:25:14 <alzxjm[m]1> Signal's seems really efficient. Element's is slightly worse, but the new F-Droid version allows you to tweak the notification settings for battery.
10:25:30 <engulf[m]> <renlord "i think when i last checked batt"> Are you using mobile data or wifi?
10:25:32 <strcat[m]> mavic321: https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
10:25:38 <renlord> engulf[m]: wifi
10:25:42 <strcat[m]> mavic321: look at that, look at the release changelog below
10:26:01 <NorbertTretkowsk> renlord: same for Signal, it drains the battery extremely when using mobile data
10:26:04 <strcat[m]> mavic321: if you use GrapheneOS, you get GrapheneOS updates
10:26:19 <renlord> NorbertTretkowsk: signal is better compared to whatsapp
10:26:30 <renlord> less battery drain
10:26:31 <strcat[m]> Norbert Tretkowski: sounds like you have a poor mobile data connection, and FCM would cause a similar battery drain for you
10:26:39 <strcat[m]> Norbert Tretkowski: Signal is not much more inefficient than FCM
10:26:50 <strcat[m]> FCM also has to keep alive a connection to the server, it functions the same way
10:26:56 <strcat[m]> it is not magic
10:27:01 <strcat[m]> it works the same way, as explained above
10:27:03 <alzxjm[m]1> Signal rarely goes above 1-4% for me.
10:27:16 <strcat[m]> please scroll up and read what I wrote about efficient push, I explained in-depth how it should be implemented
10:27:36 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone know if android system webview should be updated. It's just come up on my aurora store
10:27:36 <mavic321[m]> <strcat[m] "mavic321: if you use GrapheneOS,"> Are graphene OS comes often with updates?
10:27:41 <strcat[m]> most apps implementing it do not bother doing everything I mentioned - they tend not to bother implementing throttling or making the checks slower on IPv6 where there isn't NAT screwing it up
10:27:47 <strcat[m]> mavic321: look at the changelog on the site
10:27:52 <renlord> bypassbobby[m]: no
10:27:55 <strcat[m]> mavic321: https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
10:28:08 <renlord> bypassbobby[m]: webview is shipped in OS update relases
10:28:17 <renlord> s/relases/releases
10:28:21 <renlord> s/relases/releases/
10:28:21 <strcat[m]> mavic321: you can see for yourself all the updates that have been released and the approximate date since the updates are named after the date
10:28:43 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: you can't update it that way because it's signed with our key
10:28:56 <bypassbobby[m]> OK cool
10:28:57 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: there isn't a security update available for the WebView, there's just an inconsequential minor update
10:29:12 <strcat[m]> in general, only the major versions have security updates with some exceptions in emergencies
10:29:33 <strcat[m]> usually we ship the Vanadium WebView
10:29:41 <mavic321[m]> <strcat[m] "mavic321: https://grapheneos.org"> thanks looks good. And the updates will just pop up a notification in your phone and u can download it then automaticly right? No need for manual updates with pc or someting.
10:29:57 <strcat[m]> mavic321: it will automatically download and install the update in the background
10:30:05 <strcat[m]> it won't break if you turn off the phone in the middle of an update
10:30:21 <strcat[m]> mavic321: read through https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
10:30:42 <strcat[m]> if you don't want automatic updates you have to go out of the way to disable the Updater app during periods where you don't want them
10:31:07 <strcat[m]> it's fully automatic other than requiring you to reboot when it's done (it will let you know via the notification which has a reboot button)
10:31:43 <strcat[m]> you can optionally turn on the reboot while idle feature in the Updater app which will automatically reboot to boot up the new OS version as soon as the phone enters deep idle state
10:31:48 <strcat[m]> although then your profile won't be logged in
10:32:06 <strcat[m]> that's not on by default since it would be really annoying to have your profile logged out during deep idle after an update
10:32:39 <strcat[m]> but it's there as an option for people who want to get the security updates applied fully automatically even if their phone is sitting there plugged in for a week untouched
10:33:17 <strcat[m]> the updater app goes out of the way to use direct boot / device encrypted storage to be able to run before your unlock the main profile
10:33:43 <strcat[m]>  * the updater app goes out of the way to use direct boot / device encrypted storage to be able to run before you unlock the main profile
10:34:01 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't require profiles to be decrypted to work
10:34:19 <strcat[m]> meaning if you left a phone sitting there for 3 months with the reboot while idle feature enabled
10:34:25 <strcat[m]> the phone would be fully up-to-date when you got back to use it
10:34:35 <strcat[m]> (but that's not on by default)
10:34:47 <mavic321[m]> Thanks for the explanation strcat
10:35:55 <mavic321[m]> I also have read that u can use remote attestation. What does that mean?
10:36:57 <alzxjm[m]1> mavic321: You can answer a lot of these questions by reading https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Auditor and searching this thread.
10:37:08 <alzxjm[m]1> mavic321: https://attestation.app/about

10:45:47 <eenno[m]>  I got the latest OTA for my Pixel 2 XL. I set the alarm for this morning and it worked. But the screen that fills up the entire screen, letting you snooze or dismiss the alarm is no longer showing. Is this an issue or was it removed from AOSP? I can still dismiss/Snooze, but have to unlock the phone and do it from the notification.
10:50:32 <Sheru[m]> Have the same issue. Need to unlock the phone to turn off the alarm
10:50:49 <Sheru[m]> I can't reproduce the camera app not opening at 3a
10:50:53 <Sheru[m]> (Latest version)
10:59:36 <strcat[m]> DeskClock received a substantial update as part of Android 11
10:59:49 <strcat[m]> maybe they changed the UI, or maybe some of it was not ported over to the new way of doing things
11:00:06 <strcat[m]> it now targets a newer API level
11:00:30 <strcat[m]> if we reverted it back to how it was in Android 10, it would work as it did then
11:00:32 <strcat[m]> but we probably don't want to do that
11:00:46 <engulf[m]> There is no longer a fullscreen alert but seems that you can still dismiss or snooze an alert from that lockscreen notification
11:01:34 <engulf[m]>  * There is no longer a fullscreen alert but seems that you can dismiss or snooze an alert from the lockscreen notification
11:02:05 <strcat[m]> upstream issues: is there more than 1 person who reported a camera issue? atm there's just the one person on the issue tracker who has an issue on 3a that we can't reproduce
11:02:16 <strcat[m]> and since we know everyone has an identical install of the OS
11:02:21 <strcat[m]> it seems possible that it's a hardware issue
11:02:43 <strcat[m]> also try opening camera and flipping back and forth between front and rear camera over and over
11:02:54 <strcat[m]> that used to cause memory corruption hardened_malloc would detect
11:02:56 <strcat[m]> no longer does
11:03:16 <eenno[m]> <engulf[m] "There is no longer a fullscreen "> I was just trying that (to see if I could dismiss it without having to unlock my phone). Funny enough, if I double tapped that notification on the lock screen, I got the good old full screen view again. Interesting.
11:03:18 <strcat[m]> so in my experience the camera is working much better now since these memory corruption issues are fixed now
11:03:33 <strcat[m]> eenno: it may just be that the UI works differently now
11:03:53 <eenno[m]> strcat: Most likely yes.
11:04:01 <strcat[m]> someone did a major overhaul of DeskClock upstream
11:04:13 <strcat[m]> I don't know how the UI is supposed to look
11:04:33 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/DeskClock/+log/2668d8066a9c25ff7214b91419e8f6f3e6253b2c
11:06:11 <strcat[m]> it got updated to targetSdkVersion 29 and then that seems to have been partially reverted due to problems
11:06:31 <strcat[m]> should be working fine now
11:07:33 <strcat[m]> we could update DeskClock to the version in master
11:07:40 <strcat[m]> where it got fully migrated to Kotlin
11:08:12 <strcat[m]> anyways this is what happens when an AOSP app is actively developed again: they make changes, some of which people don't like
11:10:37 <engulf[m]> eenno: Yeah, but the bottom of the screen (like 1,5cm or 2cm) is blank when you open the notification which was not the case with the old one, weird
11:12:44 <engulf[m]>  * eenno: Yeah, but the bottom of the screen (like 1,5cm) is blank when you open the notification which was not the case with the old one, weird
11:12:53 <eenno[m]> engulf: Yep. It's not perfect. But will do for a sleepy brain, not having to unlock the phone in the morning :)
11:12:53 <eenno[m]> Another change is also that the notification that appears (maybe it's 30 min before the next alarm, can't remember) emits a sound now - even when DND is enabled. You can hear a notification sound the second before the alarm starts sounding.
11:17:29 <strcat[m]> eenno: well you can configure notifications
11:17:38 <strcat[m]> so you could turn off that sound
11:18:36 <strcat[m]> we could update DeskClock to the newer version from master which has a lot more changes but that might not be stable
11:22:20 <strcat[m]> since it was rewritten in kotlin we can't really backport specific changes, we'd have to fully switch
11:22:48 <eenno[m]> strcat: Yeah, I changed it to silent (when long pressing on the alarm notification), but it still plays a sound whenever it shows up. But again, just reporting as a FYI. Not the biggest issue in the world :)
11:22:48 <eenno[m]> I'm just thankful and impressed with the speed you delivered 11 on to the Pixel 2XL. Big thanks!
11:23:35 <strcat[m]> not sure why setting sound off wouldn't work that way
11:23:45 <strcat[m]> it might have multiple notification channels
11:23:48 <strcat[m]> check the other channels
11:24:06 <strcat[m]> it might put one in another channel as a placeholder 1st
11:24:13 <strcat[m]> when it's about to go off
11:25:13 <eenno[m]> Yes it does. But I expected it to silence all those channels. When I go into see the difference channels/notification types, I always thought those toggles were to disable it completely - as in hiding it from even showing up.
11:25:13 <eenno[m]> Also, as you say, it is populating the different channels with a lot. Let me screenshot.
11:25:42 <strcat[m]> there is a toggle in channels for sound
11:25:54 <strcat[m]> the actual alarm sound isn't from the notification
11:25:58 <strcat[m]> it's from the app itself
11:27:04 * eenno[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200928-132543.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/TbUUKtooYpczUOmkpTcWjojP/Screenshot_20200928-132543.png >

11:27:39 <strcat[m]> eenno: try clearing the app data, it might have used different channel names before and it didn't bother deleting them
11:27:59 <strcat[m]> so 2/3 of those are probably unused
11:30:09 <strcat[m]> don't need to clear it but it will make it easier to configure
11:30:18 <eenno[m]> Ah. I long-pressed on the one that appeared when the alarm was going off. Put that to silent. That made the notification sound that was played when setting an alarm go away - and the notification sound playing just before the alarm went off.
11:30:35 <eenno[m]> So I was, like you said, silencing the wrong channel/notification. Thanks!

14:31:25 <Sheru[m]> Well, shoulder surfing need no phone recording?
14:33:10 <Sheru[m]> It's an issue for a long time. Screen recording has a notification when it is done. When the OS is compromised, there are way greater issues than just recording the password anyways (saying this for it is built into the OS from AOSP)
14:33:43 <anupritaisno1[m4> <mistazaki[m] "When i type password visible on "> Bs dude. Bs
14:34:17 <anupritaisno1[m4> If somebody guessed your password and added a keylogger that records the screen
14:34:17 <anupritaisno1[m4> 1) auditor will let you know
14:34:17 <anupritaisno1[m4> 2) at that point you're already in deep shit
14:34:52 <Sheru[m]> The possible threat model I see is app silently recording the screen and uploading it somewhere, but screen recording must be approved by the user assuming the OS is not compromised?
14:34:52 <zyxt128[m]>  mistazaki  I respect that and I hope that somenone can answer more thoroughly your issue. At least for the locked screen that you ask, I can only assume that the code there is not modified at all in GOS and it's actually pure AOSP code. Still I'm not the proper person to guarantee you that the lock screen code is not modified at all.

14:35:50 <Sheru[m]> (Anyways, my complaint there is it does not respect FLAG_SECURE at some apps, or am I missing something that Signal blackens the screen recording, while KeepassDX does not)
14:36:41 * Sheru[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ViPFZfYQhNQdGQPGYVrXoNpv/message.txt >
14:37:09 <Sheru[m]> But it should notify the user if it actually records something, if not granted dangerous permission?
14:37:19 <zyxt128[m]> ^ This is indeed weird, FLAG_SECURE is AOSP and it shouldn't be modified at all
14:37:20 <jpds> Sheru[m]: KeepassDX does set FLAG_SECURE
14:37:44 <Sheru[m]>  But the screen can be recorded?
14:37:57 <Sheru[m]> Signal also has FLAG_SECURE
14:38:12 <Sheru[m]> But when screen recording, the app itself outside the keyboard is pitch black?
14:38:25 <jpds> Sheru[m]: Just tried it, I get a black video
14:38:50 <Sheru[m]> Not sure what code difference are there, maybe it's not the code that causes it. If it is, there is an issue
14:40:05 <jpds> Well, keepassdx doesn't even let me take a screenshot
14:40:16 <jpds> So FLAG_SECURE is indeed working there
14:42:05 <anupritaisno1[m4> <Sheru[m] "But it should notify the user if"> Accessibility service would be required for apps to actually type in the password
14:42:32 <anupritaisno1[m4> Draw over other apps that might be used to spy can be easily disabled by resetting app preferences in safe mode
14:48:52 <Sheru[m]> It's not really a threat as long as third-party apps can't access it right?
14:49:32 <Sheru[m]> (Genuine question, unsure how iOS has handled it securely)
16:18:32 <xiaocutezi[m]> Idle for 30 days will get kicked? As in not chatting or joining the room?
16:46:35 <Sheru[m]> Possibly a found upstream bug: Not sure if this applies in third-party apps, but Android R's easter egg bubble don't appear at non-main user

17:00:00 <anupritaisno1[m4> Show me the threat model
17:02:54 <zyxt128[m]> Any potential malware that can take screenshots while the user is typing on the keyboard on that screen can capture the password/PIN and maybe the pattern
17:03:12 <zyxt128[m]> Isn't that enough?
17:03:52 <anupritaisno1[m4> [zyxt128](https://matrix.to/#/@zyxt128:matrix.org): and what then?
17:04:35 <anupritaisno1[m4> Let's say the password is known
17:05:06 <anupritaisno1[m4> What next
17:05:33 <zyxt128[m]> Oh I got you
17:05:34 <zyxt128[m]> You mean that even if someone is taking screen captures from that screen, what will the attacker do with this information
17:07:12 <zyxt128[m]> Well, if the user is using the same PIN or password in a banking app, I assume that the attacker can correlate the various input of the user and access his/hers bank acout
17:07:29 <zyxt128[m]>  * Well, if the user is using the same PIN or password in a banking app (or any other target application), I assume that the attacker can correlate the various input of the user and access his/hers bank acout

17:11:07 <anupritaisno1[m4> Example why can I not just take those credentials from the banking app then?
17:12:43 <zyxt128[m]> If the banking app has protect the sensitive screen with that flag, the attacker should find another workarround to get them.
17:12:57 <anupritaisno1[m4> Also how would said malicious app make it onto your device?
17:13:15 <zyxt128[m]> By user mistake
17:13:45 <anupritaisno1[m4> <zyxt128[m] "By user mistake"> We cannot protect the user from himself
17:13:56 <zyxt128[m]> The user cannot or should be not protected by his own mistakes anyhow from the system? Then why should someone get into the trouble to create a secure system, if it is intended to be used by experienced users?
17:14:03 <jpds> zyxt128[m]: If the malware is already on your device, it's probably too late
17:14:36 <anupritaisno1[m4> If you enable accessibility or draw over apps
17:14:48 <anupritaisno1[m4> You're already doubt something unsupported
17:15:00 <anupritaisno1[m4> It is also highly unlikely a bank app will use flag secure
17:15:26 <anupritaisno1[m4> Because then people who actually have issues and need accessibility will not be able to log in
17:15:43 <zyxt128[m]> <jpds "zyxt128: If the malware is alrea"> I don't believe that having a single point of failure is a good practice at all. In any kind of system.

17:17:10 <anupritaisno1[m4> We also can't stop them from unlocking the bootloader and installing another ROM that isn't secure for instance

23:45:57 <strcat[m]> and it sounds like you downloaded platform-tools with a browser to a different location than what you're using to set the path
23:46:20 <strcat[m]> there's a reason it has people do the whole process in powershell - it avoids having to teach people how to navigate around directories with the shell, etc.
23:46:28 <strcat[m]> if you use exactly the commands it has in the guide, it will work
23:46:46 <strcat[m]> the issue is you're coming up with your own way to do it or you're following someone else's unofficial guide

23:51:57 <webb[m]> I think it might have to do with the general chugging I've been experiencing lately
23:52:20 <secretsecrets[m]> So it's something wrong with graphene os probably?
23:52:36 <systemctl[m]> Because everyone uses Google push services and graphene doesn't have Google play services
23:52:48 <secretsecrets[m]> Oh I see
23:53:48 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: apps need to implement push themselves as a fallback when FCM is not available, apps like WhatsApp, Signal, etc. do that
23:53:49 <webb[m]> I've personally had problems with Matrix and some other apps not showing notifications post update
23:53:56 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: sometimes it needs to be manually enabled
23:53:59 <webb[m]> I forgot about that
23:54:05 <webb[m]> *Element not Matrix
23:54:11 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: in the app's settings
23:54:35 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: also not all apps know how to ask for a battery optimization exception for their push implementation (but that's only relevant if they have a push implementation that can run in the background)
23:55:16 <secretsecrets[m]> strcat: I feel like I've already manually done that but do you know if there's a guide anywhere on how to do it?
23:57:03 <strcat[m]> it's a per-app thing

23:57:07 <strcat[m]> which app is a problem for you
23:57:20 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: the app needs to have a push implementation other than only FCM
23:57:30 <secretsecrets[m]> Protonmail isn't showing notifs for me
23:57:45 <strcat[m]> they only support FCM for push notifications
23:57:48 <strcat[m]> atm
23:58:05 <secretsecrets[m]> So it's up to them to add other support?
23:58:11 <strcat[m]> yes, IMAP itself supports push
23:58:24 <strcat[m]> so all an email client has to do is use standard IMAP push with a foreground service
23:58:41 <strcat[m]> you keep open the IMAP connection, enable push (assuming server supports it, but they control the server in this case)
23:58:48 <strcat[m]> and it pushes updates
23:59:05 <strcat[m]> and you do a regular keep alive check on the connection so it doesn't die (which can be throttled to save power)
23:59:09 <strcat[m]> that's all the app has to do
23:59:12 <bbqcore[m]> strcat: yes, what I am missing?
23:59:14 <strcat[m]> it's an app issue that it doesn't
23:59:33 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: also it needs to prompt the user for a battery optimization exception to let it run during doze
23:59:40 <strcat[m]> but if they reject that it will still work outside doze
23:59:49 <strcat[m]> (deep idle state when phone isn't in use)
