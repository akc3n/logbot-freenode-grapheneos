02:48:00 <unsafeoppa[m]> <renlord "unsafeoppa: do you have a stock "> Sorry no
02:49:45 <unsafeoppa[m]> I'm trying to figure it out ATM. It seems the cert is being denied somehow by Grapheneos? I've checked my radius server for logs and it's pretty much empty.

11:05:50 <Smelly_cat> Hey! Sorry if this is a question that's already been answered elsewhere, but are there any resources on what UK phone providers Graphene supports? I know relying on a SIM reduces your anonymity but I'm not able to move 100% away from having a regular Mobile num
11:07:29 <alzxjm[m]1> Smelly_cat: GrapheneOS does not change/affect which mobile providers support your Pixel. It will be the same as the stock Android OS.
11:07:55 <Smelly_cat> Fantastic! Thanks for the quick reply
11:08:35 <Smelly_cat> While I'm here, are there any good resources out there for moving away from a regular SIM?

11:13:40 <Sheru[m]> <Smelly_cat "While I'm here, are there any go"> For eSIM, it is dependent on Play services, thus unsupported in GrapheneOS
11:19:00 <blacklight447[m]> <anupritaisno1[m4 "Delete those before somebody is "> why would they need to reset their device
11:19:35 <Smelly_cat> Honestly I'm not 100% certain what my question is. I took a look through the subreddit a few weeks ago and saw a few posts talking about how using a SIM and connecting to a Cell network obviously makes you easier to track. I guess the question is "Can I have a unchanging mobile number and stay private?" I understand that's probably a stupid
11:19:36 <Smelly_cat> question, but I'm only looking to improve anonymity, not make it total

12:20:23 <Sheru[m]> For your use case, you might want to consider CalyxOS which has microG installed.
12:20:46 <ransome> To use MicroG you need an Android that allows signature spoofing,which is sometimes considered as a security risk and afaik GrapheneOS considers it as a sec issues and won't allow it
12:21:21 <redu321[m]> I really like graphene. Are there good chat apps who dont have notification issues?
12:21:30 <Sheru[m]> Not only security risk, also privacy risk by sending push notification through Google's server in microG
12:21:40 <Sheru[m]> <redu321[m] "I really like graphene. Are ther"> Signal
12:22:02 <ransome> But some apps have a polling function that asks the server in specific intervalls for update. That might be working for you

12:30:09 <Sheru[m]> Maybe enable notification, but unsure if that works
12:30:15 <bypassbobby[m]> What's the difference between aurora droid and aurora store?
12:31:00 <Sheru[m]> Aurora Store has Play store apps, Aurora Droid has F-Droid and other repositroy apps
12:31:32 <sphinxcat[m]> <ransome "But some apps have a polling fun"> I think it's not called 'polling'... https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200928#c5261944
12:35:13 <ransome> but isn't strcat talking about server the side? What I mean is basically the app, that has kind of a cron job that asks the server regulary. I am no app developer though, dont want to spread false information
12:44:28 <ransome> let's take Signal for instance. I have it running on Graphene and it sends me notifications shortly after a message arrived. And that works without Play Services, so I assume there is a scheduler implemented in Signal that asks the server every X minutes if there are any updates. I don't need to have Signal open for that.

13:11:02 <dazinism> If you've tried to install the microG Services Core app on GrapheneOS you won't get a working microG, but it may make apps try to use Googles Push services (which it may keep trying, but will never be able to connect) rather than using their own push implementation

15:12:27 <Sheru[m]> Not sure, I just read what's on github. Ask inthewaves, they're the one testing it
15:13:23 <dazinism> Oh it is tested in A11and apparently doesn't leak
15:13:26 <Sheru[m]> I'd love to check it out myself, but currently attempting building Vanadium (with a preliminary attempt to stop links being opened without INTERNET permission)
15:13:29 <dazinism> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/258
15:14:13 <dazinism> Actually I may be getting confused....
15:15:07 <Sheru[m]> (Secondary users being logged out seems nice if implemented)
15:15:17 <dazinism> upstream issues: oh that would be nice   to block that in vanadium
15:15:52 <Sheru[m]> <dazinism "Oh it is tested in A11and appare"> It's on natural logout (limit 3 users running on background)
15:17:46 <Sheru[m]> * I'd love to check it out myself, but currently attempting building Vanadium (with a preliminary attempt to stop links being opened without INTERNET permission)
15:17:46 <Sheru[m]> Based on: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/issues/37#issuecomment-623024280
15:17:48 <dazinism> Guess thats a cludge way to logout, just keep opening more users...
15:17:59 <bypassbobby[m]> How do u take a screenshot in the latest update it used to be power off then click screenshot its disappeared
15:18:35 <dazinism> Hold power and volume down for a couple seconds
15:18:41 <Sheru[m]> Change to 3 button or navigate gesture then switch apps, or the good old volume down + power button
15:18:58 <bypassbobby[m]> Thanks
15:19:12 <Sheru[m]> <dazinism "Guess thats a cludge way to logo"> Then delete the users you opened. Have like 3 reserved slots for that purpose
15:19:18 <Sheru[m]> Quite inconvenient
15:20:19 <dazinism> Yeah probably easier just to restart the device
15:20:30 <Sheru[m]> Lol, yeah
15:24:29 <Sheru[m]> Not sure if somebody else noticed that restarting takes longer
15:25:16 <null[m]> ...was I pinged here? I was off for a couple of days and I got a notif when I logged back it but I can't find it now.
15:46:00 <strcat[m]> ransome: no, you're wrong, you need to reread what I wrote
15:46:36 <strcat[m]> ransome: Signal doesn't poll, it implements push, including without Play services
15:48:25 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: upstream issues: people can't install an updates to an app that isn't signed with the same key anyway
15:49:14 <redu321[m]> Does someone know if its possible to go from graphene os to calyxos in one time? Can i just flash calyxos like how i flashed graphene? Or do i need to go back to android first or do other things? I want to try that os for a few days.
15:49:56 <jpds> redu321[m]: You can flash what you want when it's unlocked
15:50:05 <alzxjm[m]1> redu321: You can go straight between.
15:50:09 <alzxjm[m]1> redu321: No need to go to stock first.
15:50:50 <alzxjm[m]1> redu321: I never run the `fastboot erase avb_custom_key` command when I'm going b/w Calyx and Graphene, either though I suppose it couldnt' hurt.
15:51:48 <xiaocutezi[m]> Is there any merit to using Riru+AppOps in GrapheneOS? Intention is for clipboard control in other apps?
15:51:48 <xiaocutezi[m]> Or AppOps functionality is not possible due to Graphene OS hardening anyway?
15:51:52 <strcat[m]> redu321: WhatsApp notifications work fine as long as you enable support for keeping open a background connection in WhatsApp, it's a configuration issue
15:52:48 <strcat[m]> redu321: you received several pieces of misinformation in responses earlier
15:52:55 <strcat[m]> anyway, what you're asking is off-topic now
15:53:17 <redu321[m]> <strcat[m] "redu321: WhatsApp notifications "> tnx for your help. I tried this Os now for a few days and wanna try clalyxos now. I wanna look what os for me is the best to use.
15:53:28 <strcat[m]> okay and it's off-topic
15:53:59 <redu321[m]> <strcat[m] "okay and it's off-topic"> tnx for still anwering the older topic
15:55:21 <kits07[m]> I wonder where the name GrapheneOS came from
16:07:09 <xiaocutezi[m]> > <@xiaocutezi:matrix.org> Is there any merit to using Riru+AppOps in GrapheneOS? Intention is for clipboard control in other apps?

16:07:09 <xiaocutezi[m]> Would this be ever considered? If yes I will log in GitHub. Thanks
16:20:39 <NewRedsquare> Hello everyone; ik everyone got the same same question concerning pixel 5 and i read the awnsers, but i've got one question for you : i still have an old samsung galaxy s7 and it's near to death. I'd like to have a truly secured smartphone. So i though about GrapheneOS. The problem is, should i get the pixel 5 and pray for a support or try to buy a
16:20:40 <NewRedsquare> pixel 3a or pixel 4 (but it'll have 2yrs of updates only, i want a durable smartphone concerning the software updates)
16:20:51 <NewRedsquare> quite a dilemma
16:22:10 <NewRedsquare> not interested of some chinese brands that have sometimes slow updates, below average security etc.
16:22:29 <redu321[m]> I just flashed my new os into my phone and locked the device back. When i press start it wont boot into my new os. What did i do wrong?
16:23:28 <louipc> kits07[m]: graphene more advanced and hi-tech than copper I guess?
16:27:58 * redu321[m] uploaded an image: Knipsel11.PNG (5KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nJQPwhSRYMVDkUxcpXQmuzTm/Knipsel11.PNG >
16:28:20 <gofigga[m]> [NewRedsquare](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_NewRedsquare:matrix.org): at the moment, probably best to go with the latest supported device, which is pixel 4 or pixel 4 XL. Support for the 4a and 5 are not a sure thing
16:28:37 <redu321[m]> <redu321[m] "Knipsel11.PNG"> When i flash the os it gives me this error. someone who can help?
16:29:06 <zyxt128[m]> redu321: is this a pixel phone?
16:29:13 <redu321[m]> <zyxt128[m] "redu321: is this a pixel phone?"> pixel 4
16:31:36 <dazinism> redu321: are you following the installation instructions on the website? Best not to use other instructions/guides
16:32:05 <dazinism> Also what zip file are you trying to flash
16:32:34 <dazinism> *what zip file did you download?
16:38:56 <NewRedsquare> gofigga[m] : The problem with pixel 4 / xl is first : their low battery, ugly design ( but not mandatory for my choice ). My biggest issue would be the remaining update life of the device, released soon for a year already; it means one year less of updates. I don't want a less durable smartphone by the mean of updates :/
16:39:55 <NewRedsquare> Nothing in the android world is as secure as the Pixel line
16:40:30 <redu321[m]> <dazinism "*what zip file did you download?"> nvm i fixed it
16:44:49 <zyxt128[m]> just out of curiosity, what was it?
16:54:16 <Sheru[m]> <NewRedsquare "gofigga : The problem with pixel"> Might want to wait for 4a support? Or rather, somebody here needs tester on 4a for its support
16:55:15 <dazinism> Think it needs someone to commit to maintaining it also
16:55:55 <Sheru[m]> That as well. Somebody said they'd do it
16:56:48 <Sheru[m]> (But are silent now for unknown reasons, probably kernel issues)
16:57:04 <Sheru[m]> Not sure where did they go
16:59:45 <NewRedsquare> i checked the github, yup actually one issue concerning the memory protection that fails at the kernel layer
17:00:55 <NewRedsquare> Will be there an advantage to take the pixel 5 over the 4a like the 3a that had only software optimization and the pixel 4/4XL that have nearly same photo quality as stock ROM
17:00:57 <NewRedsquare> ?
17:01:15 <strcat[m]> there are device-specific issues uncovered for any device that we could possibly support
17:01:35 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 has kernel hardening that is not available for the older devices and yes, that uncovers problems, including compatibility issues with other features
17:02:00 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 and 4 XL are also the only devices with dedicated maintainers so there will be more activity for those in terms of filing and fixing issues
17:02:02 <NewRedsquare> some said that pixel 3a photo quality is below stock ROM cuz it doesn't have software google camera on GOS
17:02:28 <NewRedsquare> do someone understood what i meant concerning photo quality ? :D
17:02:32 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3a doesn't have the Pixel Visual Core / Pixel Neural Core so it doesn't support hardware-based HDR+ with GrapheneOS
17:02:52 <NewRedsquare> exactly what i meant
17:02:58 <strcat[m]> if you want a device with the longest support and best security, the Pixel 4 is the best option available
17:03:04 <NewRedsquare> so same question for pixel 4a and pixel 5
17:03:13 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
17:03:22 <strcat[m]> we don't support either and the Pixel 5 isn't even released
17:03:32 <NewRedsquare> but now only 2 years upgrades since pixel
17:03:40 <NewRedsquare>  4 has been released a year ago ?
17:03:49 <NewRedsquare> here is my problem
17:03:52 <strcat[m]> a bit over 2 years of minimum guaranteed support left
17:04:34 <Sheru[m]> well, one can go 4a, install Calyx, wait for Graphene (with longer support), or buy 4 with shorter support
17:04:42 <strcat[m]> you seem to be making the assumption that the Pixel 5 would become magically supported when it's released
17:04:46 <strcat[m]> upstream issues: this isn't the CalyxOS channel
17:04:57 <strcat[m]> CalyxOS is not comparable to GrapheneOS
17:05:02 <Sheru[m]> Oh.
17:05:06 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, of course
17:05:13 <Sheru[m]> Just giving an option
17:05:18 <NewRedsquare> strcat[m] that wasn't the meaning. i knew that every single device needs maintainer
17:05:35 <strcat[m]> the point of GrapheneOS is that it provides substantial privacy and security improvements over AOSP
17:05:38 <NewRedsquare> ik
17:05:52 <Sheru[m]> <NewRedsquare "strcat that wasn't the meaning. "> And it takes months to port the changes, fyi
17:06:08 <Sheru[m]> Or maybe,not at all without maintainer
17:06:30 <strcat[m]> if someone stepped up to work on support for a device like the Pixel 4a
17:06:35 <strcat[m]> they would be able to get it done in a week
17:06:44 <strcat[m]> but it also requires their commitment to long-term support for the device
17:06:52 <strcat[m]> and that's assuming they can dedicate enough time to it
17:07:10 <strcat[m]> 4a would already be supported if someone had stepped up and dedicated substantial time to it over the course of a week
17:07:29 <strcat[m]> it is wrong to assume that just because a new Pixel is released, someone is going to step up to do the work of supporting it
17:07:32 <NewRedsquare> Still better to take pixel 5 than other brand that doesn't have all those securites ?
17:07:45 <strcat[m]> Pixel 5 is not released
17:07:57 <strcat[m]> and it's not a GrapheneOS-supported device
17:08:08 <NewRedsquare> strcat[m] it is wrong to assume that just because a new Pixel is released, someone is going to step up to do the work of supporting it
17:08:09 <strcat[m]> I don't know how it could be when it's not released
17:08:32 <NewRedsquare> strcat[m] pixel 5 announced in less than two hours
17:08:49 <louipc> what kind of testing besides CTS before you decide to release to stable?
17:08:51 <Sheru[m]> No AOSP branch yet
17:09:03 <strcat[m]> NewRedsquare: won't mean it's actually released
17:09:14 <Sheru[m]> Not to mention, new kernel, new porting work, new issues
17:09:32 <Sheru[m]> Probably
17:09:32 <strcat[m]> NewRedsquare: and then it will be supported in an AOSP device support branch - GrapheneOS is not going to be making separate branches for device support
17:09:50 <strcat[m]> so we'd wait until a future maintenance release supports it
17:10:03 <strcat[m]> and by wait, I mean before we would be able to accept support for it from a maintainer
17:10:15 <strcat[m]> I don't mean that any of the existing developers is going to work on it
17:10:41 <NewRedsquare> strcat[m] the switch over my old smartphone is urgent, that's why i'm so hurried . Sorry about that
17:10:42 <strcat[m]> if you buy a Pixel 5, you could be waiting a year for a GrapheneOS support, and it may never be supported
17:11:00 <Sheru[m]> Then go for 4?
17:11:00 <strcat[m]> we are likely going to support the 4a but there is no timeline (it does not have a maintenance team with enough time to dedicate to it)
17:11:06 <NewRedsquare> still better than taking a pixel 4 that will last only a bit more than  2 years
17:11:13 <strcat[m]> we've said nothing about support for the Pixel 5, it's not released, and no one has shown any interest in supporting it once it is
17:11:15 <NewRedsquare> ?
17:11:29 <strcat[m]> if you want GrapheneOS
17:11:33 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 is the latest supported device
17:11:36 <NewRedsquare> ok
17:11:46 <NewRedsquare> last anwser, understood.
17:11:46 <strcat[m]> we do not have a timeline for the Pixel 4a being officially supported with official releases
17:11:52 <strcat[m]> there are no current plans to support the Pixel 5
17:13:59 <louipc> what happens when support for a device is officially ended?
17:14:28 <louipc> do you push a release de-branding it as grapheneos, with some kinda nice flashy warning?
17:14:34 <hiroshi[m]> folks what is the case for pixel 2 which is in legacy mode for GrapheneOS
17:15:01 <hiroshi[m]> I mean for how long is GrapheneOS an option on the pixel 2?
17:15:26 <Sheru[m]> At least until next month
17:16:06 <Sheru[m]> For November and beyond, there is no guarantee
17:17:16 <NewRedsquare> just to know; when pixel 4 has been released, how long did it take before first release ? I mean pixel 4 was not quite popular due to issues. Maybe similare case with the P5 ? just speculating , strcat[m] ik your answer :D
17:17:31 <NewRedsquare> just collecting your opinions
17:17:47 <hiroshi[m]> upstream issues: thanks for the reply
17:18:40 <Sheru[m]> <NewRedsquare "just to know; when pixel 4 has b"> 8 months?
17:19:08 <Sheru[m]> One can check the release date at grapheneos.org/releases
17:19:15 <NewRedsquare> oh ok
17:19:17 <NewRedsquare> oopsie
17:19:36 <strcat[m]> NewRedsquare: what "issues"?
17:20:07 <strcat[m]> hiroshi: GrapheneOS Pixel 2 support has been marked legacy since Pixel 2 support was added back to the revived GrapheneOS
17:20:15 <NewRedsquare> low battery, ugly design . Those type of issues
17:20:22 <strcat[m]> hiroshi: it hasn't ever not been legacy since using the GrapheneOS name
17:20:38 <strcat[m]> NewRedsquare: has good battery life relative to the other supported devices, so unsure what you mean by that
17:20:42 <strcat[m]> and I don't know what about it is ugly
17:20:53 <strcat[m]> I could see why you would think the 3 XL notch is ugly
17:21:05 <strcat[m]> what about the Pixel 4 / 4 XL do you think is ugly?
17:21:27 <strcat[m]> I have a bunch of phones sitting here and I can barely even tell them apart, I tell which one is the Pixel 4 from the power button and weight
17:21:42 <NewRedsquare> the top of the pixel 4/4XL
17:22:14 <strcat[m]> I'm looking down on a Pixel 3a XL and a 4 XL
17:22:17 <NewRedsquare> and battery assumed to be 4080mah on pixel 5 compared to the 2800mah ... ( ik about weaker cpu )
17:22:22 <strcat[m]> they look almost exactly the same
17:22:54 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3, 3a, 4 look pretty much the same
17:22:57 <NewRedsquare> mostly is : one year less updates ( ik 10th time i said it ) xD
17:23:10 <strcat[m]> 4 has a white power button, other than that any visual differences are subtle
17:23:30 <strcat[m]> 2 and 2 XL are less rounded, especially 2, and the non-XL 2 has huge bezels
17:23:55 <strcat[m]> 3 XL has the notch to have statusbar in some extra real estate at the top
17:24:09 <strcat[m]> beyond that all the devices look almost identical from the front
17:24:20 <strcat[m]> I can't even easily tell the difference, I tell apart the 3a / 3a XL from lack of bottom front speaker
17:24:52 <strcat[m]> 4 and 4 XL via white power button
17:25:03 <strcat[m]> I don't get how you can claim phones that look like all the others are ugly shrug
17:25:14 <NewRedsquare> look at the 4a design
17:25:16 <NewRedsquare> :D
17:26:08 <Sheru[m]> Nah, I hate that
17:26:16 <NewRedsquare> really ?
17:26:16 <strcat[m]> 4 has a smaller bottom bezel than 3a XL and more rounded screen corners
17:26:33 <strcat[m]> otherwise looks almost identical from the front (speaker grill is smaller too)
17:27:07 <strcat[m]> from the back 4 is all glass, 3a XL has glass only at the top, which I could see some people thinking is ugly (not the reverse)
17:27:21 <strcat[m]> and 4 camera definitely looks better / more refined from the back
17:27:32 <strcat[m]> so, compared to all the other devices, I really can't see how you think it's ugly, lol.
17:27:46 <Sheru[m]> <NewRedsquare "really ?"> (4a) because can't cover camera as easily, (my preference, I know the OS can handle it)
17:28:11 <Sheru[m]> (Front, that is)
17:28:26 <Sheru[m]> It's that superficial, pretty much
17:28:31 <NewRedsquare> on s7 i have a switch to cut off all sensors in the developers options for example
17:29:06 <NewRedsquare> strcat[m] mostly the top bezel i hate on the 4/4xl
17:29:22 <Sheru[m]> Not really meant for normal usage but ok. SELinux handles it anyways
17:31:49 <strcat[m]> NewRedsquare: developer options are not supported ways of doing things and can disappear at any time, they're for development / testing
17:32:04 <strcat[m]> and often do not do what you would assume as someone not familiar with the intention of the features provided for developers
17:32:21 <strcat[m]> especially since many of them are for OS developers, not app developers
17:32:28 <strcat[m]>  * especially since most of them are for OS developers, not app developers
17:33:27 <strcat[m]> the supported ways of disabling sensors are the body sensors permission (AOSP) which is not granted by default and GrapheneOS 'other sensors' toggle (granted by default for compatibility)
17:33:52 <strcat[m]> there is also a low-level 'activity recognition' permission and we don't currently promote that to a user-facing permission but it doesn't do much
17:34:27 <strcat[m]> (a dedicated step counter sensor if the device has it uses activity recognition)
17:34:42 <strcat[m]>  * a dedicated step counter sensor if the device has it uses activity recognition
17:34:56 <strcat[m]> and our other sensors permission is for all sensors without their own permissions
17:37:21 <mrxx_0[m]> > from the back 4 is all glass, 3a XL has glass only at the top, which I could see some people thinking is ugly (not the reverse)
17:37:21 <mrxx_0[m]> 3a xl is all plastic
18:11:45 <alzxjm[m]1> If an app with denied Network permission manages to access the internet through indirect means (via IPC or some other way) would Android attribute the data transfer to that app under Settings > App > Mobile data & Wi-Fi?
18:12:55 <alzxjm[m]1> I.e. would the undesirable data exfiltration be detectable post hoc?
18:15:00 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: I think you're confused about what the issue is
18:15:09 <strcat[m]> question doesn't make sense based on what you're asking
18:15:24 <strcat[m]> why would data transfer by app B be attributed to app A?
18:15:33 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense
18:15:44 <alzxjm[m]1> Because app A made the request
18:16:00 <strcat[m]> if you open a URL in Signal which it passes to the browser
18:16:18 <strcat[m]> the connection is made by the browser - there's no connection to Signal anymore
18:16:25 <strcat[m]> why would downloading that site be attributed to Signal?
18:16:53 <strcat[m]>  * the connection is made by the browser - there's nothing involving Signal anymore
18:17:15 <strcat[m]> again, I think you're misunderstanding this issue in the first place
18:17:27 <strcat[m]> and many people also seem to incorrectly think that this is something specific to the Network permission toggle
18:18:30 <strcat[m]> it's nothing to do with the Network permission specifically
18:18:45 <strcat[m]>  * it has nothing to do with the Network permission specifically
18:20:02 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: if you press share in Signal and send along an image to your email client, why would a subsequent email you send with that app have something to do with SIgnal?
18:20:29 <strcat[m]> you seem to have the wrong model of what's happening
18:20:57 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: if an app has the Network permission denied, it cannot connect to the network itself, that is what the permission does
18:21:34 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: similarly, if an app doesn't have the Contacts permissions, it can't read/write contacts itself and can only request case-by-case contact choices from the user
18:22:23 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: if you trust app B with contacts access, you trust it with that access, flat out
18:22:47 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: it is not limited in what it can do with that access, the OS does not magically inspect the network connections, communication with other apps, etc. and somehow prevent it from doing things you don't want with it, that's not possible
18:22:58 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: if you trust an app with data, you trust it with that data
18:22:58 <strcat[m]> in general
18:24:11 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: if app A and app B are in the same profile and choose to communicate via an API, nothing stops app B from sharing your contacts data with app A if you've granted it access to that data
18:24:26 <tony32> Hi folks. I just upgraded my pixel 3 to build number RP1A.200.720.009.2020.09.25.00 and am having an issue with voicemail. T-Mobile is my provider and the phone will no longer download the voicemail to the phone so I can play it on the device.
18:25:04 <tony32> It is now requiring me to call in through the dialer to access the voicemail over the phone line.
18:25:54 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: if 2 apps are allowed to communicate (i.e. they're in the same profile and both consent to it) they are allowed to communicate
18:26:06 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: you don't need complex analysis beyond that
18:28:17 <strcat[m]> the OS is in control of whether apps can communicate, it is not possible for it to enforce rules on what they could send, they could just be sending encrypted blobs of data or whatever, it's entirely opaque, it's not how things work
18:29:06 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't matter if it did try to enforce something, it wouldn't do anything, if they are allowed to communicate they can communicate
18:30:01 <strcat[m]> similarly even if apps couldn't communicate via mutual consent if you gave them access to the same data they could just communicate via that data
18:30:17 <strcat[m]> if you gave 2 apps access to the same file they could just communicate via the file
18:30:26 <strcat[m]> if you gave 2 apps access to contacts they could just communicate via contacts
18:31:01 <strcat[m]> if you give app A access to an image file and app B access to the same image file there is no limit on what information they can send back and forth through the image file
18:31:18 <strcat[m]> this isn't something specific to Android
18:31:49 <alzxjm[m]1> Thanks. This is very helpful and educational.
18:31:53 <alzxjm[m]1> Users with no/limited familiarity with how the OS works, like me, find things like the Network toggle appealing because sometimes we want to run apps that have features we don't like (trackers) and we think the Network toggle will allow us to use the app and not have to worry about it sending sensitive data over the internet.
18:33:36 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: if you give an app access to sensitive data
18:33:37 <alzxjm[m]1> It has been made clear by yourself and others that denying an app Network doesn't necessarily make it "safe" to use the app in that way.
18:33:38 <strcat[m]> it has access to sensitive data
18:33:49 <strcat[m]> it can do whatever it wants with that data
18:33:52 <strcat[m]> if you give it access to contacts and photos
18:33:54 <strcat[m]> it can take your contacts and shove them into a photo
18:34:01 <strcat[m]> it could encode a photo into contacts information
18:34:15 <strcat[m]> apps within a profile can communicate via mutual consent
18:34:36 <strcat[m]> it can take that information and send it to APIs provided by other apps
18:35:15 <strcat[m]> Android 11 (API 30) makes it like iOS where apps have to declare what they communicate with in their manifest but that doesn't give users any more insight or control over it just like it doesn't on iOS
18:35:25 <strcat[m]> they can still communicate with whatever they want on iOS (and with API 30+ on Android)
18:35:29 <strcat[m]> they just have to declare it
18:35:34 <strcat[m]> in the manifest
18:36:04 <strcat[m]> and anyway there are other ways for them to communicate besides talking to the other app directly
18:36:21 <strcat[m]> such as if they both have access to some shared resource in the profile like a file you granted access to, or contacts, etc.
18:39:16 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: or as another example, an app could store data in the clipboard, then switch focus to another app, and since that app is now focused it can read the clipboard
18:39:21 <strcat[m]> but that's hardly the only example of a shared resource within a profile
18:39:33 <strcat[m]> you have to reason about these things logically
18:39:36 <NewRedsquare> strcat[m] here you go , pixel 5 release ;)
18:39:45 <NewRedsquare> released*
18:39:57 <strcat[m]> NewRedsquare: announced, doesn't mean they are available yet
18:40:09 <NewRedsquare> available the 15th
18:40:13 <NewRedsquare> october
18:40:28 <alzxjm[m]1> So an app with no permissions requested and no permissions granted shouldn't be able to communicate with other apps or access the network at all, then.
18:40:37 <strcat[m]> NewRedsquare: yeah, so not released
18:40:37 <alzxjm[m]1> There's no way for it to share data
18:40:50 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: that doesn't make sense
18:41:12 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: app A has contacts, app B has location permission
18:41:18 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: so you think those 2 apps should be able to communicate
18:41:27 <mrxx_0[m]> 629‚Ç¨ + Bose QC 35 II in my country for the Pixel 5 preorder
18:41:30 <strcat[m]> but app C with neither should not? that's not a reasonable way to design the OS
18:41:53 <NewRedsquare> yup same mrxx_0[m]
18:41:56 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: so you can't open URLs or share anything or copy to the clipboard in apps that don't have dangerous permissions?
18:42:02 <strcat[m]> it just doesn't make sense
18:42:02 <NewRedsquare> but wtf, NO NEURAL CORE omg
18:43:01 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: apps within a profile on Android can communicate, apps on iOS can communicate too (via extensions, among other APIs, and via shared resources)
18:43:12 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: this is the basis for how many things work
18:44:17 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: if you're interested in what our plans are for future privacy features you should look through the issue tracker
18:44:49 <alzxjm[m]1> strcat: Thanks for spending so much time on that response. I learned a lot. I will check out the issue tracker.
18:45:24 <NewRedsquare> strcat[m] please confirm me that ; the photo quality on the 4/4XL remains similar as stock rom cuz it has neural core right ?
18:45:35 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: when you trust an app with a permission, it can't be avoided that you trust it with that permission
18:45:48 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: it has access to whatever that provides, it can do whatever it wants with it
18:46:12 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: so sure, if you revoke the Network permission, the app can't make network connections, can't use DownloadManager or other APIs requiring the INTERNET permission, etc.
18:46:35 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: but it can still do whatever else it wants with that data including sending it to another app or putting it into a shared resource like a file you granted it access to
18:47:47 <strcat[m]> for modern API levels, apps can only communicate via intents (including making a more direct connection via an intent) and things that require permissions or explicit access grants from the user
18:48:07 <strcat[m]> so the OS is in the position that it could stop apps from communicating but what would the UI for that look like
18:48:48 <strcat[m]> do you want a UI like a list of every non-system app and then you select it and see a list of every other non-system app and you can toggle off communication between them? seems ridiculously hard to use / manage
18:49:51 <strcat[m]> i.e. app communication settings -> list of every non-system app -> click one and see a nested list of every other non-system app with a toggle (which toggles communication between those apps in either direction)
18:50:00 <strcat[m]> totally possible to do something like that just not really usable / sane
18:50:32 <mastercakex[m]> Pixel 5 out. Finally something with moving away from 3XL. All the gens in between were failing all my expectations
18:50:51 <mastercakex[m]> * Pixel 5 out. Finally something worth moving away from 3XL. All the gens in between were failing all my expectations
18:50:53 <strcat[m]> no one has expressed interest in supporting the Pixel 5 for GrapheneOS
18:51:01 <strcat[m]> mastercakex: it's not out yet anyway
18:51:07 <strcat[m]> it's just announced
18:51:25 <mastercakex[m]> Support will come out eventually
18:52:01 <mastercakex[m]> As it always happens. Someone buys phone, someone starts testing and eventually Graphene OS is supported
18:52:18 <mrxx_0[m]> I did :)
18:53:40 <NewRedsquare> mrxx_0[m] update : the pixel 4a 5g is also available with the bose qc 35 II
18:54:02 <NewRedsquare> but release only in november
18:54:06 <NewRedsquare> dunno why so far
18:55:09 <strangefinder[m]> hey, clock alarm the alarm screen is not shown?
18:55:09 <strangefinder[m]> where i can  snooze or stop.
18:55:09 <strangefinder[m]> or?
18:55:12 <strcat[m]> mastercakex: it doesn't just happen magically
18:55:19 <strcat[m]> strangefinder: press the notification
18:55:36 <strcat[m]> mastercakex: if there isn't a maintenance team for the Pixel 5, it will never be supported
18:55:50 <strcat[m]> mastercakex: we're no longer adding support for devices without a committed maintenance team
18:56:10 <strcat[m]> that's why the 4 and 4 XL took so long to be supported and why the 4a isn't supported
18:56:30 <strcat[m]> until there is a dedicated maintenance team, we cannot support a device, otherwise I end up doing all the work and I do not have time for that
18:56:48 <strcat[m]> it's a major issue that the 2, 2 XL, 3a, 3a XL, 3 and 3 XL do not have maintainers
18:57:38 <strcat[m]> in practice that means we can't wait to drop all of those and will be happy if they're not supported past the minimum guaranteed support date because we do not have maintainers to do the work, only the 4 and 4 XL have maintainers but all future devices but have maintenance teams too
18:57:51 <strcat[m]>  * in practice that means we can't wait to drop all of those and will be happy if they're not supported past the minimum guaranteed support date because we do not have maintainers to do the work, only the 4 and 4 XL have maintainers but all future devices must have maintenance teams too
18:58:53 <strcat[m]> if you report a device-specific issue on a Pixel 3 there is no maintainer to look into it, compared to the 4 and 4 XL which actually have maintainers and active work on fixing issues
18:59:12 <strcat[m]> we won't be adding any more devices without having maintainers and it's far from guaranteed that new Pixels will be supported
18:59:19 <mastercakex[m]> I don't get how calyx manages that with support team? They are less known than grapheneos yet they manage to roll out every single pixel device
18:59:53 <strcat[m]> CalyxOS doesn't have the privacy and security hardening in GrapheneOS
19:00:02 <alzxjm[m]1> strcat: I think it would be helpful to have a FAQ/resource for people who are interested in being device maintainers but do not know what the work would look like or how much of a time commitment it would be.  Do you know of such a resource? I have the interest and the time. I doubt I have the skills though I'm happy to learn.  But I haven't been able to figure out what the workload requirements of being a device
19:00:02 <alzxjm[m]1> maintainer are.
19:00:02 <strcat[m]> CalyxOS isn't based on Android 11
19:00:35 <strcat[m]> CalyxOS doesn't have to deal with compatibility issues caused by adding privacy and security features
19:01:01 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: if people don't have an idea of what is required and aren't capable of figuring it out themselves
19:01:05 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: they are not an appropriate maintainer
19:01:17 <strcat[m]> a maintainer has to be able to do their own research and dive into unfamiliar code / problems
19:01:22 <strcat[m]> and learn everything necessary as they go
19:01:46 <strcat[m]> if people need me to explain in detail a basic overview of what maintaining a device involves they are not going to be able to do it, and the problem is not something that I can teach or explain to them
19:01:58 <strcat[m]> the problem is lack of the appropriate mindset and self-directed way of learning
19:03:04 <strcat[m]> if I have to walk them through absolutely everything they're not really maintaining the device, I am
19:03:28 <mrxx_0[m]> Yep this is a problem you have to be self taught
19:03:40 <mrxx_0[m]> Otherwise you can't do much
19:03:44 <strcat[m]> I think it's clear enough what is involved to anyone that is interested and is going to be capable of doing it
19:04:41 <duggalsu[m]> Does this look viable to support push notifications in the future? Maybe good for apps in graphene app store once its ready?  https://github.com/gotify/android
19:04:46 <strcat[m]> there is not a prerequisite list of skills for a maintainer to have other than knowing how to program and being a self-directed learner capable of diving into a bunch of unfamiliar things and learning it
19:05:03 <strcat[m]> they will become more familiar with common things over time and more productive
19:05:18 <strcat[m]> but it will ALWAYS involve diving into unfamiliar code, protocols, software stacks, whatever
19:05:46 <mrxx_0[m]> The thing is I need a phone to maintain, can't do it with my primary one x)
19:06:10 <strcat[m]> so, lets say someone reports a Bluetooth issue, the maintainer has to try to reproduce that and look into it
19:06:19 <strcat[m]> maybe it turns out there's some kind of memory corruption bug in a certain library
19:06:24 <strcat[m]> they'll have to figure that out and resolve it
19:06:44 <strcat[m]> there are all kinds of device-specific issues that can occur, the maintainer is not going to be familiar with most of the code they are working with, that's the point
19:06:51 <strcat[m]> they have to learn as they go and deal with whatever comes up
19:07:11 <strcat[m]> if people can't figure out what it involves from all the info available I don't think they can do that
19:08:14 <strcat[m]> on the other hand maybe that Bluetooth issue a resource configuration issue requiring comparing factory images vs. AOSP and adding a missing value to the XML configuration
19:08:24 <strcat[m]> maybe it's some kind of higher-level bug in some code
19:08:33 <strcat[m]> maybe it's C, maybe it's C++, maybe it's Java, who knows
19:09:01 <strcat[m]> maybe it's caused by one of our other hardening features, like code that's incompatible with exec-based spawning
19:09:18 <strcat[m]> they'll have to figure out what causes it by narrowing it down and then investigating it, investigating it can take many forms
19:09:49 <strcat[m]> anyway I don't really see the point of trying to explain in depth what being a maintainer involves because I think anyone capable of doing it can figure that out already
19:10:11 <mrxx_0[m]> Besides full time devs, are they maintainers for Graphene?
19:10:16 <strcat[m]> it means they are responsible for support for that device and fixing all issues with it whatever they may be, there is otherwise not a limit on the scope
19:10:28 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 and 4 XL have maintainers (2 people)
19:10:52 <strcat[m]> devices will only be added if they have maintainers, there can be multiple maintainers for a device / device family sharing the workload
19:11:05 <mrxx_0[m]> But 3/3xl 3a/3a XL don't?
19:11:12 <strcat[m]> 2 and 2 XL don't either
19:11:21 <strcat[m]> only 4 and 4 XL do
19:11:58 <strcat[m]> you can already build GrapheneOS for the 4a, it's missing the device-specific hardening changes and a custom kernel build
19:12:00 <nullnode[m]> Who else is working on bonito?
19:12:17 <nullnode[m]> you and ren?
19:12:18 <strcat[m]> but we're not going to start doing releases for the 4a until there is a maintainer and the initial work is done so it's on par with support for other devices
19:12:45 <strcat[m]> nullnode: 2, 2 XL, 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL don't have maintainers - I just end up doing nearly everything for them
19:13:26 <strcat[m]> nullnode: sometimes other people help with some aspects of it
19:14:08 <strcat[m]> nullnode: right now if someone reports an issue like their camera crashed on a 3a, there is no one responsible for that device to get logs from that user and look into it
19:14:10 <nullnode[m]> wow no one else has sent upstream android-prepare-vendor except you
19:14:20 <nullnode[m]> what the fuck are other projects doing?
19:14:32 <strcat[m]> nullnode: that's not what I'm saying
19:15:01 <strcat[m]> 4a has android-prepare-vendor support already
19:15:05 * nullnode[m] uploaded an image: image.png (52KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/BiPyjRMvhornugxyjZjcFUex/image.png >
19:15:15 <strcat[m]> still needs a GrapheneOS maintainer (and fixing issues in that would be one thing they're responsible for doing)
19:15:21 <strcat[m]> nullnode: that upstream for android-prepare-vendor is dead
19:15:24 <strcat[m]> we maintain it in AOSP Alliance now
19:17:10 <nullnode[m]> no wonder my shit went fucked a while back
19:21:00 <strangefinder[m]> <strcat[m] "strangefinder: press the notific"> i cant find it. small tip where?
19:23:11 <strcat[m]> when the alarm goes off it shows a notification, press that
19:23:49 <strcat[m]> we're aware that the alarm clock has had substantial changes in Android 11 and has some differences and minor annoyances like the default notification configuration
19:24:02 <strcat[m]> haven't seen any major issues or bugs though
19:24:21 <strcat[m]> we could consider updating to a newer version of the clock app with more changes
19:24:32 <strcat[m]> not doing that in the next couple weeks though
19:35:19 <zugzwang[m]> strcat How can You find the sheer will ,passion and dedication still after so many years and many setbacks and not to burn out its beyond me. You will go down on history mate
19:36:13 <Sheru[m]> <zugzwang[m] "strcat How can You find the shee"> Hence, a reason it's hard to find maintainers
19:37:00 <Sheru[m]> Not only one needs to have the right mindset, and knowledge, there is also the factor of resources required
19:37:12 <strcat[m]> they have to commit to supporting it for 3+ years
19:37:24 <strcat[m]> the longer devices end up being supported, the longer the commitment
19:37:34 <strcat[m]> if we find a maintainer and then they stop supporting it what do we do
19:37:37 <strcat[m]> we can't necessarily find another
19:37:40 <strcat[m]> do we drop the device?
19:37:47 <strcat[m]> I'm not going to take over maintenance of a device for long
19:38:07 <strcat[m]> we depend on people stepping up and contributing
19:38:11 <signalarch[m]> Why does the default calendar have zero functionality.. Am I missing something?
19:38:25 <strcat[m]> signalarch: you don't have a calendar service provider installed
19:38:56 <zugzwang[m]> <Sheru[m] "Not only one needs to have the r"> Wasnt talking just about maintainers. Just the overall work of it in general
19:38:58 <strcat[m]> signalarch: it does work, it's not a particularly good calendar frontend though
19:39:06 <strcat[m]> and we don't ship a backend
19:39:10 <strcat[m]> just install Etar
19:39:17 <Sheru[m]> <zugzwang[m] "Wasnt talking just about maintai"> That also counts
19:39:37 <signalarch[m]> Gotcha thanks
19:39:40 <Sheru[m]> Would be quite a work, but hey, it's better than working with some closed curtain companies
19:39:40 <strcat[m]> we'll probably hide the Calendar launcher in a future release so people don't use it and it continues to serve the intended purpose of being able to run and pass the calendar test suite in the CTS
19:40:21 <strcat[m]> the sole purpose of Calendar is really just to make it possible to test the calendar functionality in the OS
19:40:26 <strcat[m]> although it does work as a calendar frontend
19:41:05 <strcat[m]> similar to the included Music app which is mostly not user-facing anyway (other than providing the UI when you play a music file if you haven't installed a better app to do it)
19:45:06 <signalarch[m]> And would there be any good reason 2 apps I use do not work at all from Aurora, but do from fdroid? They don't use google service or anything
19:47:52 <dazinism> signalarch: don't start or other functionality?
19:48:05 <dazinism> What apps?
19:48:08 <dazinism> Also this may be handy for you https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
19:49:18 <signalarch[m]> One doesn't start the other is blank. Noice and simplelogin email
20:11:16 <kingkong22[m]> Does anyone know if SnapChat runs in Graphene ?
20:13:18 <alzxjm[m]1> <kingkong22[m] "Does anyone know if SnapChat run"> Snapchat does not run in Graphene.
20:13:43 <kingkong22[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "Snapchat does not run in Graphen"> Ok thanks
20:38:10 <strcat[m]> axx: no, it hasn't been removed
20:38:24 <strcat[m]> axx: the option in the Settings app was missing in the last release, it's fixed in the new one that will be pushed out soon

22:17:24 <LABB[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) do you have a date to when you'll be dropping support for Pixel 2 devices?
22:19:33 <strcat[m]> after they're end-of-life
22:19:36 <strcat[m]> we don't have that date
22:20:17 <LABB[m]> ok! thank you for the responsiveness
22:21:52 <strcat[m]> probably won't be supported for much longer though
22:22:05 <strcat[m]> neither has a GrapheneOS maintainer either
23:34:19 <brockin042[m]1> Hmmm pixel 4a 5g and pixel 5. Has anyone used 5g? Is it super great as all of these cell providers make it out to be?
23:37:46 <strcat[m]> I don't think it's very broadly supported
23:43:07 <brockin042[m]1> I'm on pixel 2 xl. Need a upgrade. I can't choose lol. Pixel 3a is going for the same price as Pixel 4a. Even when you compare Google store and EBay. Pixel 4a 5g just dropped for $499.  The pixel 4
23:43:37 <brockin042[m]1> a would be the way to go with graphene
23:44:27 <meow_please[m]> Fuck 5G. It's just going to allow more granular tracking and increase available bandwidth which device and software manufacturers will use to increase the amount of data being pushed. The worst if it will be when current mobile and 5g tech + data pricing becomes cheap enough for manufacturers to opt in for that instead of your typical wireless networking. I.e smart tvs and other iot devices will be able to download
23:44:27 <meow_please[m]> ads without internet, or bypassing networks/firewalls/VPNs to communicate directly.

If you were a device manufacturer that puts ads in devices, and a mobile chip + data was cheap enough, you would consider it if the advertising revenue was big enough. With the amount of adblocking becoming normal, it will eventually be a consideration.
23:52:44 <louipc> offtopic
23:52:48 <meow_please[m]> And the nature of cell phone towers requires tracking. 5G increases the number of these towers therefore you can have more granular tracking. Not a conspiracy theory.
