00:29:53 <adeus[m]> Hi everyone
00:30:18 <adeus[m]> Does anyone here use Privacy Browser??? I really like it
00:30:40 <adeus[m]> I know it‚Äôs uses the Android System webview
00:30:53 <adeus[m]> So it should be ok to use right?
00:31:11 <adeus[m]> It‚Äôs not like using Firefox is what I mean
00:31:26 <adeus[m]> ... Won‚Äôt compromise device security
00:32:44 <kaeshy_kir[m]> What do you mean about "Privacy Browsers"?  TOR?
00:33:25 <adeus[m]> Stoutner.com/privacy-browser
00:33:36 <adeus[m]> Also on Fdroid as ‚ÄúPrivacy Browser‚Äù
00:33:54 <adeus[m]> Since it uses the default web engine I figure it should be safe
00:34:58 <adeus[m]> It has every privacy feature you can think of
00:35:01 <adeus[m]> Per tab control
00:35:19 <adeus[m]> For cookies and other stuff like proxies so you got isolation between different sites
00:35:33 <adeus[m]> Block lists, etc
00:52:23 <kaeshy_kir[m]> Really i¬¥ve never heard about it, i¬¥m sorry
00:52:55 <kaeshy_kir[m]> i¬¥ve used brave, firefox and TOR
01:53:06 <strcat[m]> the new beta release should be available soon, and that should take care of the issues people encountered with the previous beta
01:53:06 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.11.14
01:53:40 <strcat[m]> just need to be patient, getting too many messages directed at me about it
01:59:44 <strcat[m]> it's possible that previous beta update was more problematic than realized
02:00:04 <strcat[m]> really appreciate people who do beta testing but you need to be aware that what you're doing is testing potentially unstable code
02:02:03 <strcat[m]> unfortunately when updating from the previous beta to this current beta, it triggers the recovery mode due to being unable to handle the data
02:02:33 <strcat[m]> may be necessarily to reinstall
02:04:40 <strcat[m]> at the moment, it appears that if you installed the previous beta release you'll be needing to factory reset after updating
02:05:10 <strcat[m]> unsure what exactly the issue is, perhaps some kinda of incompatible filesystem change in the kernel
02:05:36 <strcat[m]> don't know, but the previous release was cancelled and we're not going to be able to develop a way of handling an issue for a cancelled beta release
02:06:45 <strcat[m]> so, unfortunately going to be a hard lesson for anyone using beta that wasn't really prepared for what that means
02:08:15 <strcat[m]> going to start pushing it out pretty soon so unless someone can identify why this would be an issue and propose a solution, the solution will just be a factory reset
02:14:02 <strcat[m]> yeah I don't see any reason that would happen
02:14:33 <strcat[m]> these devices don't have maintainers so no one to work on it
02:17:19 <strcat[m]> as I said before, help is wanted
02:27:57 <strcat[m]> I need help testing an upgrade from 2020.08.07.01  to 2020.09.11.14 on the Pixel 3a
02:28:10 <strcat[m]> to make sure the same issue doesn't occur for others for that upgrade path
02:28:23 <strcat[m]> so need someone with a 3a on 2020.08.07.01  to volunteer as an early tester
02:39:53 <M0xC0ncord[m]> strcat: I can do it. I can just sideload the release zip from the releases page?
02:44:34 <strcat[m]> it's not there yet since it's not pushed out
02:45:08 <strcat[m]> https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-factory-2020.09.11.14.zip
02:45:14 <strcat[m]> https://releases.grapheneos.org/bonito-factory-2020.09.11.14.zip
02:45:15 <strcat[m]> er
02:46:13 <strcat[m]> https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-ota_update-2020.09.11.14.zip
02:46:28 <strcat[m]> https://releases.grapheneos.org/bonito-ota_update-2020.09.11.14.zip
02:46:52 <strcat[m]> need to confirm that upgrading from 2020.08.07.01 to these on 3a and 3a XL works properly
02:47:12 <strcat[m]> don't think much can be done about that failed beta
02:47:23 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Alrighty. I'm on sargo. Will let you know how it goes
02:48:58 <lickidysplit[m]> So the new beta will force us to factory reset if we've already upgraded? üòÇü§ò
02:49:23 <lickidysplit[m]> Wahhhhh I just got everything right again after my last fresh Install, ahh well
02:49:54 <strcat[m]> if the issue happens across all the devices
02:50:00 <strcat[m]> it wasn't ever released for Pixel 4 or 4 XL
02:50:09 <strcat[m]> so far I've experienced it on 3a and 3a XL
02:50:12 <lickidysplit[m]> I guess since I'm not using GSM at all ( no sim ) and everything else works I could just skip the ota and wait for the stable ü§î mine doesn't have any audio issues
02:50:18 <strcat[m]> those devices don't have maintainers
02:50:21 <lickidysplit[m]> Ah OK
02:50:25 <strcat[m]> so there isn't someone to investigate and develop a workaround
02:51:10 <strcat[m]> so instead we more heavily rely on beta tests
02:51:13 <strcat[m]> for non Pixel 4 devices
02:53:12 <httplov3craft[m]> Is the pixel 4a in the plan for official support, or is it pending a maintainer?
02:53:50 <cn3m[m]> <httplov3craft[m] "Is the pixel 4a in the plan for "> pending a maintainer
02:54:58 <strcat[m]> 0xC0ncord: any update?
02:55:15 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <strcat[m] "0xC0ncord: any update?"> Still downloading the zip actually
03:08:28 <cn3m[m]> https://nitter.net/saleemrash1d/status/1304612880747290625 this is really cool
03:09:05 <cn3m[m]> No backporting issues and no arbitrary 3-4 year support cap for Android
03:09:19 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: check this out
03:09:35 <cn3m[m]> looking forward to the Pixel 6
03:09:49 <cn3m[m]> (also MTE)
03:10:32 <strcat[m]> there's a DoS attack on the releases server unfortunately
03:18:53 <strcat[m]> 0xC0ncord: how far is the dl
03:19:09 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <strcat[m] "0xC0ncord: how far is the dl"> Finished. It's sideloading now
03:20:02 <Vappy[m]> Pls Sir grapheneOS has VoLTE?
03:22:16 <strcat[m]> on carriers where it's supported
03:24:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Vappy: it depends
03:24:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> It does not work for me at all
03:25:18 <M0xC0ncord[m]> strcat: 3a rebooted fully on 09.11 with no problems so far
03:26:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: wait what
03:26:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've had similar DOS attacks on glassrom servers this week
03:30:48 <strcat[m]> 0xC0ncord: ok I think I have to just release it thenm
03:30:52 <strcat[m]>  * 0xC0ncord: ok I think I have to just release it then
03:30:58 <strcat[m]> sorry to people who updated to the aborted beta...
03:40:37 <lickidysplit[m]> This is why we test betas tho right ? To get a stable version to the masses
03:40:41 <lickidysplit[m]> üòÅ
03:44:48 <strcat[m]> only seems to be an issue for 3a and 3a XL btw
03:44:50 <strcat[m]> not 3 and 3 XL
03:44:56 <strcat[m]> probably not 2 and 2 XL either
03:45:02 <strcat[m]> I'll try to delay the 3a and 3a XL beta to figure it out
03:45:07 <strcat[m]> it sucks how much is going wrong
03:45:34 <strcat[m]> lickidysplit: yeah this is why the betas are there
03:45:44 <strcat[m]> I don't catch it all in my own testing especially with 8 devices
03:45:50 <strcat[m]> so it's outsourced to beta testers
03:45:59 <strcat[m]> and I also do a lot of the testing after it's in beta
03:46:09 <strcat[m]> can't just delay it for a day to do my own testing 1st
03:46:23 <strcat[m]> also for example I don't have 8 SIMs
03:46:39 <strcat[m]> I won't notice if mobile data doesn't work on a 3a, etc.
03:46:57 <strcat[m]> beta channel is really important
03:47:16 <cn3m[m]> do you need a sim to be a device maintainer?
03:47:33 <strcat[m]> you need to be able to test and work on generic mobile data issues
03:47:41 <strcat[m]> you don't need to be able to handle testing on more than 1 carrier
03:47:48 <strcat[m]> a device doesn't need to be maintained by 1 person though
03:47:55 <strcat[m]> so responsibilities can be shared
03:48:01 <cn3m[m]> true ^
03:48:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW strcat what about September firmware?
03:48:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> And vendor
03:48:13 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: will be with the Android 11 release
03:48:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> That might be why 3,3a need a reset BTW
03:48:23 <strcat[m]> not shipping any of the Android 11 bits early now
03:48:35 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I think you might be misunderstanding the issue
03:48:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah OK
03:48:57 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: we shipped a beta with Android 11 kernels for 2, 2 XL, 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL
03:49:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Reading it
03:49:04 <strcat[m]> it was cancelled for 4 and 4 XL before shipping
03:49:13 <strcat[m]> then problems came up and we cancelled this beta
03:49:34 <strcat[m]> now we're doing another beta with just the September 01 patches, not the Android 11 kernels
03:49:50 <strcat[m]> and on the 3a and 3a XL, going from the aborted beta release to the new beta release forces a factory reset
03:50:00 <strcat[m]> it doesn't happen on the other devices, doesn't happen on 3 / 3 XL
03:50:14 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't happen for 3a on the previous stable -> this new beta
03:50:19 <strcat[m]> it's only for the aborted beta -> this beta
03:50:32 <strcat[m]> only difference should be using our Android 10 kernel instead of 11
03:50:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh
03:50:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Have you considered that they merged in f2fs upstream?
03:51:08 <strcat[m]> the changes for Pixel 4 are extensive
03:51:13 <strcat[m]> it's not nearly as extensive for the older kernel;s
03:51:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe that set some RO_COMPAT flag on f2fs
03:51:24 <strcat[m]> I don't think there's an f2fs update
03:51:28 <strcat[m]> for crosshatch
03:51:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah okay
03:51:37 <strcat[m]> look at the diff for our Android 10 -> Android 11 crosshatch kernel atm
03:51:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> There should be though
03:51:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because they do merge it in their common kernels
03:51:57 <strcat[m]> also
03:52:02 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3 and 3a are the same kernel tree
03:52:08 <strcat[m]> but this only impacts the 3a
03:52:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW something I've noticed on R don't know what this is
03:52:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can't get adb logs off the device at all until after it finishes booting
03:53:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even if I've set the key to always accept
03:53:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> On Q I could always accept the adb key and start debugging right from bootanimation
03:53:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just makes things harder to debug
03:55:19 <strcat[m]> ah there is an f2fs update
03:55:24 <strcat[m]> but why would it only impact 3a not 3
03:56:36 <strcat[m]> anyway
03:56:39 <strcat[m]> it was a beta release
03:56:50 <strcat[m]> we can't spend a bunch of time figuring it out and developing some kind of migration hack
03:56:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Still pretty serious
03:57:10 <strcat[m]> so people who updated to the aborted beta on impacted devices just need to factory reset
03:57:15 <strcat[m]> there is not much else that can be done at this point
03:57:23 <strcat[m]> what's the alternative?
03:57:32 <strcat[m]> don't release the September update?
03:57:41 <strcat[m]> and wait until Android 11 GrapheneOS to ship next update?
03:57:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well there's a problem that's going to kill me on R pretty soon tbh
03:57:57 <strcat[m]> really can't do that just to spare pain for people who were explicitly beta testing
03:58:29 <strcat[m]> I think unfortunately I just need to accept that something bad happened with a beta release
03:58:31 <strcat[m]> and move on from that
04:02:24 <fomijafi[m]> We all knew what we were in for. Seems like the right choice. We're in beta for this very reason and at least it didn't happen to the many on stable
04:03:37 <aeonsolution[m]> <strcat[m] "I need help testing an upgrade f"> ready to upgrade

04:06:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: you might have to port the grapheneos changes to downstream glassrom BTW
04:06:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm 100% sure I won't have much time for glassrom
04:07:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it's important
04:08:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> That one gets shipped with gapps. It's helped identify at least 2 bugs that broke several apps and went unnoticed on graphene
04:22:41 <Vappy[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It does not work for me at all "> üò≠
04:22:59 <Vappy[m]> No volte, how will the Sir cope
04:24:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Vappy: I fixed it
04:24:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> But the "fix" needs cleanup
04:25:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's low priority for now
04:25:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll send in the fix for review after the bringup for R is done
04:36:57 <Vappy[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Vappy: I fixed it "> I never expected my xda circlejerk joke to result in you actioning some code tbh

05:18:29 <strcat[m]> okay
05:18:31 <strcat[m]> pushing out this new beta
05:18:43 <strcat[m]> sorry about what happens to a subset of people on 3a / 3a XL with the previous beta
05:43:37 <strcat[m]> seems like breaking changes in f2fs or something along those lines
05:43:43 <strcat[m]> don't see another option than just moving forward
06:14:03 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <strcat[m] "and on the 3a and 3a XL, going f"> I dont notice any problems with the new Beta on my 3a, can i just use it until the new update?
06:16:05 <strcat[m]> shdudbdjdj: as in the previous beta?
06:16:08 <strcat[m]> you could continue using it
06:16:26 <strcat[m]> I could potentially just not release the 3a / 3a XL version of this beta if it doesn't break calls or anything
06:16:28 <strcat[m]> it's a bit late now
06:16:33 <shdudbdjdj[m]> ahh yes sorry. The first update
06:16:38 <strcat[m]> do calls work?
06:16:43 <strcat[m]> and sound works?
06:16:56 <strcat[m]> you could just wait til the Android 11 update
06:17:00 <strcat[m]> and that will probably work fine
06:17:04 <shdudbdjdj[m]> yes
06:17:10 <shdudbdjdj[m]> Both
06:17:14 <strcat[m]> all this new beta does is roll back the kernel update for now
06:17:23 <lickidysplit[m]> 3axl VoIP and all the other sounds work fine on my dev. Seems only some are affected
06:17:46 <strcat[m]> seems it doesn't impact 3a / 3a XL but that previous release was still problematic and has to be replaced
06:17:52 <lickidysplit[m]> But I can't test Gsm calls so can't test that part of it
06:18:07 <strcat[m]> so unfortunately can't really avoid the fallout of people using beta without following the project or being prepared for problems getting a bit screwed
06:20:34 <shdudbdjdj[m]> Timezone problem. Just woke up and have no clue what happened üéâ
06:22:50 <strcat[m]> the previous beta release was really problematic
06:22:53 <strcat[m]> so there's a new one
06:23:10 <strcat[m]> but unfortunately going from the previous beta to the new one causes some users on the 3a / 3a XL to need to wipe data
06:23:17 <strcat[m]> due to backwards incompatible f2fs changes I think

06:28:05 <lickidysplit[m]> I finally figured out what the fek this is used for üòÇ
06:28:17 <shdudbdjdj[m]> Kay, just switched to Stable release channel because i have no problems. Can i stay on this setting without getting the update thats currently beta later? I dont want to wipe my data
06:28:48 <lickidysplit[m]> That's exactly right shdud.
06:29:02 <lickidysplit[m]> Just swap it to stable and wait till android 11 release
06:31:58 <strcat> shdudbdjdj[m]: this will end up being moved to stable
06:32:06 <strcat> you could disable the updater app until the Android 10 update is in stable
06:32:09 <strcat> I guess
06:32:18 <strcat> you'd need to be careful about enabling it only after it's available
06:32:24 <strcat> I can't guarantee nothing with go wrong
06:32:53 <strcat> this whole series of issues has been really stressful, luckily beta exists to prevent it getting out to stable
06:32:56 <strcat> that'd be a real disaster
06:33:06 <strcat> still bad to have stuff go seriously wrong in beta but way less bad
06:35:31 <lickidysplit[m]> Hnnng phones updating. If I don't come back on this matrix its because phone reset üòÇ
06:39:50 <lickidysplit[m]> Force stop seamless updates ü§î I'm not prepared to lose a good few hours of work
06:40:54 <strcat> you can stop it by just rebooting during it
06:41:00 <strcat> it 's not harmful
06:41:05 <strcat> or just disable the Updater app right now
06:41:10 <strcat> interrupting the update is harmless
06:41:13 <strcat> because of A/B updates
06:41:27 <lickidysplit[m]> Sweet üí©
06:41:31 <strcat> there's no point at which the phone losing power, etc. will break it
06:45:52 <Quan7um> I have another beta update coning through.
06:46:23 <Quan7um> I noted the comments above.
06:46:52 <strcat> if you're on a Pixel 2, 2 XL, 3 or 3 XL then I don't think there's any issue with updating to it
06:46:57 <strcat> 3a and 3a XL have issues
06:47:02 <strcat> going from last beta to current
06:49:30 <strcat[m]> beta testing is unfortunately risky
06:50:58 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <strcat "or just disable the Updater app "> I just disabled the seamless update client (:
07:32:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> propertype: you installed prerelease software. Are you seriously telling me you did so on a locked bootloader?
07:33:18 <strcat[m]> using a locked bootloader with beta is expected
07:33:30 <strcat[m]> using beta is definitely not risk free though
07:33:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's pretty stupid tbh
07:33:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> What if it bricks
07:34:03 <strcat[m]> it's tested before going into beta to at least boot and be able to upgrade
07:34:05 <strcat[m]> it's just that in this case
07:34:16 <strcat[m]> rolling back the changes broke backwards compatibility
07:34:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well use seedvault
07:34:21 <strcat[m]> so testing the upgrade path wasn't relevant
07:34:29 <strcat[m]> propertype: you can temporarily disable the Updater app per the usage guide
07:34:31 <strcat[m]> and back up
07:34:45 <strcat[m]> propertype: if you really wanted you could try waiting for Android 11 based GrapheneOS
07:34:54 <strcat[m]> and upgrade to that once it's fully released
07:35:15 <strcat[m]> I don't have a recommendation really
07:35:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Actually that's a pretty nice option
07:35:29 <strcat[m]> propertype: likely not? no guarantees since it won't be a tested upgrade path
07:35:46 <strcat[m]> I don't know exactly what went wrong in this case
07:36:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well did have the same issue here
07:36:06 <strcat[m]> it seems likely it was f2fs format changing in a backwards incompatible way so that the old kernel can't boot it anymore
07:36:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seedvault didn't back up anything at all
07:36:36 <strcat[m]> it doesn't back up your home directory just app data
07:36:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just pulled apks
07:36:36 <strcat[m]> and not for apps that disable backups
07:36:48 <strcat[m]> you need to back up your home directory yourself for the time being with seedvault
07:36:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah I learned my lesson after that
07:36:55 <strcat[m]> it just enables you to do something you can't: backing up apps
07:36:58 <strcat[m]> app data I mean
07:37:09 <strcat[m]>  * it just enables you to do something you can't: backing up add data
07:37:09 <strcat[m]>  * it just enables you to do something you can't: backing up app data
07:37:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh this time I just used a rooted solution
07:37:24 <strcat[m]> sorry to anyone on the 3a / 3a XL using beta about the hassle of this
07:37:30 <strcat[m]> just the reality of beta releases
07:37:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> I know that it really isn't possible to make seedvault backup anymore
07:37:47 <strcat[m]> this was a particularly weird situation where we shipped a set of changes that we then had to back out
07:37:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> At the same time like
07:37:57 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it works it just doesn't know how to back up home directory yet
07:37:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Last time was a close call
07:38:01 <strcat[m]> it's meant to do that just not implemented
07:38:15 <strcat[m]> propertype: we do always test the upgrade path from betas too
07:38:16 <strcat[m]> but...
07:38:28 <strcat[m]> we test upgrading to another release built from the same code
07:38:38 <LinusSexTips[m]> ah, so I just updated and cant boot
07:38:43 <strcat[m]> we don't roll back changes and test downgrading stuff - not really expected to work when intentional backwards incompatible changes are made
07:38:50 <LinusSexTips[m]> pixel 3aXL beta release channel
07:38:51 <strcat[m]> so
07:39:04 <strcat[m]> unfortunately we had to roll back a bunch of the changes
07:39:14 <strcat[m]> due to issues uncovered in beta testing
07:39:30 <strcat[m]> and rolling back the changes broke compatibility on some devices with the updated data partition from that cancelled beta release
07:39:51 <strcat[m]> so the current beta release should be totally fine - none of these issues, the problem is it's not backwards compatible with that aborted beta release
07:39:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: BTW could we force UDC beta releases?
07:40:00 <strcat[m]> I don't really see what else we could have done
07:40:07 <LinusSexTips[m]> okay I was able to boot on the 4th try
07:40:18 <strcat[m]> Linus Sex Tips: that probably rolled back the update
07:40:26 <strcat[m]> you'll just need to upgrade again and you'll hit the same issue
07:40:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically make betas rollback all changes to data every reboot
07:40:34 <strcat[m]> you're not going to be able to avoid needing to factory reset to upgrade
07:40:49 <strcat[m]> you just don't suddenly lose your data or anything
07:40:52 <strcat[m]> because the update system is robust and automatically rolls back an update that doesn't boot N times
07:40:59 <strcat[m]> it gives you a choice if you want to wipe
07:41:09 <strcat[m]> you can either wipe or let it keep failing to boot until it rolls back the upgrade
07:41:16 <strcat[m]> and then it will work fine but... it'll just start the upgrade up again
07:41:25 <LinusSexTips[m]> so wiping will let me upgrade?
07:41:28 <strcat[m]> so it's inevitable that you're going to need to back up and wipe
07:41:38 <strcat[m]> Linus Sex Tips: no, rather, you need to upgrade, and then accept it saying it has to wipe
07:41:40 <strcat[m]> after the upgrade
07:41:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW what happens if you enter the no valid slot to boot when bootloader is locked?
07:42:03 <LinusSexTips[m]> Yeah sorry I meant wiping on that error screen
07:42:06 <strcat[m]> Linus Sex Tips: it successfully upgrades but then fails to boot, and says you have to wipe, if you don't wipe, it'll just keep failing to boot until it rolls back the upgrade
07:42:07 <strcat[m]> yes
07:42:18 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <strcat[m] "sorry to anyone on the 3a / 3a X"> Thank you for your amazing work. Sometimes things go wrong, but thats part of life <3  I will make more Donations for the project. I am glad that im part of this community.
07:42:18 <LinusSexTips[m]> that I got after restarting
07:42:20 <strcat[m]> so you have an opportunity to back up
07:42:22 <strcat[m]> right now
07:42:25 <strcat[m]> then upgrade again
07:42:29 <strcat[m]> then accept it asking to wipe
07:42:31 <strcat[m]> and then it'll work fine
07:42:40 <strcat[m]> it's not this release with the issue but rather the previous beta release
07:42:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "BTW what happens if you enter th"> strcat
07:42:50 <strcat[m]> it upgraded your data to a new format that the release can't handle no
07:43:00 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: not really possible
07:43:09 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: that only happens when unlocked and flashing stuff with fastboot
07:43:25 <strcat[m]> if you're updating with OTA upgrades the whole thing is atomic and very safe
07:43:42 <strcat[m]> it can always be rolled back unless it successfully boots up the OS, mounts the data, loads it successfully, etc.
07:43:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> What if the OTA is 2 stage?
07:43:55 <strcat[m]> once it successfully boots and mounts data you can't roll back
07:43:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not grapheneos but
07:44:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Those do exist
07:44:05 <strcat[m]> there are only A/B updates
07:44:08 <strcat[m]> for us
07:44:10 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: A/B updates can be rolled back
07:44:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes there's a 2 stage OTA for A/B too
07:44:31 <strcat[m]> previous update system did not have rollback and was not atomic so if it was interrupted partway, then just like a Windows, macOS, iOS, etc. upgrade it could fail
07:44:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> System_other is written in a deferred manner
07:44:41 <strcat[m]> or most traditional package managers
07:44:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: system_other isn't necessary though
07:44:51 <strcat[m]> so that doesn't really change anything
07:44:55 <strcat[m]> it's an optional thing
07:45:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes but what does that mean if the only slot with a system now won't boot
07:45:21 <strcat[m]> but that's what the 2 stage aspect is
07:45:25 <strcat[m]> it doesn't overwrite that until it booted
07:45:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because the 2 stage process clearly wiped the other slot
07:45:30 <strcat[m]> it doesn't change that it can roll back
07:45:42 <strcat[m]> once the OS has successfully booted, it disables rollback anyway, regardless of this
07:45:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah ok
07:45:50 <strcat[m]> because you can't just upgrade to a new release, including migrating the data format
07:45:52 <strcat[m]> and then roll back
07:45:59 <strcat[m]> rollback is ALWAYS disabled before data migration
07:46:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW how would you recover if that were to happen?
07:46:11 <strcat[m]> it's disabled at the latest possible point before it's irreversible
07:46:15 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: if what were?
07:46:21 <strcat[m]> as I said you can't really end up in that situation
07:46:29 <strcat[m]> because it doesn't disable rollback until it has successfully booted
07:46:44 <strcat[m]> the 2 stage thing doesn't change these properties it just adds another step at the end after rollback is disabled
07:47:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let's say I got the recovery to process fastbootd commands and erased boot for both slots even when locked
07:47:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Technically I wouldn't be stupid but just assume I did it
07:47:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> What's the recovery mechanism now?
07:47:37 <strcat[m]> it's still not bricked if it's locked
07:47:41 <strcat[m]> unless OEM unlocking is also disabled
07:47:56 <strcat[m]> and toggling off OEM unlocking doesn't really improve security since someone can just wipe in recovery and toggle it off
07:47:57 <strcat[m]> and unlocking wipes
07:48:09 <strcat[m]> semantically it does not add security
07:48:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> So at that stage it is bricked if unlocking is off?
07:48:14 <strcat[m]> it does add some defense in depth
07:48:32 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: if it's locked + OEM unlocking is off and you have a weird build where you can somehow wipe the boot image? yeah
07:48:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah I do have such a weird build
07:48:56 <strcat[m]> doesn't seem relevant to beta releases that we test by booting, basic tests and upgrading them to a sample future release
07:49:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Good thing I didn't lock again after the first unlock
07:49:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically recovery reads kernel commandline to see if bootloader is locked
07:49:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can make the recovery think it isn't locked when it is
07:51:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Of course you need to build and sign something so weird
07:52:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> So it's not exactly a risk
07:52:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> (Saying this because people are stupid and might think that I'm talking about one)
07:54:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: also what is the rescue mode?
07:55:28 <strcat[m]> the rescue mode is when data can't be mounted
07:55:29 <strcat[m]> it offers to wipe it
07:55:36 <strcat[m]> if you say no, it tries to boot again and ends up in the same place
07:55:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not that
07:55:51 <strcat[m]> if it fails to boot N times, it rolls back the upgrade, which will successfully boot up the old version again in this case
07:56:00 <strcat[m]> that is the rescue mode
07:56:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a rescue mode option in the bootloader
07:56:04 <strcat[m]> that is it
07:56:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> It boots some kind of a recovery
07:56:15 <strcat[m]> yeah that's what I am talking about
07:56:31 <strcat[m]> it automatically boots into rescue mode
07:56:37 <strcat[m]> rescue mode is a recovery mode that offers to wipe data
07:56:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wait so how is that recovery different?
07:56:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or where does that recovery sit?
07:56:45 <strcat[m]> it just has 2 menu entries
07:56:51 <strcat[m]> it's the same recovery
07:56:53 <strcat[m]> it's just a menu
07:57:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Interesting
07:57:11 <strcat[m]> if data fails to be mounted, it goes to rescue mode, which is a menu in recovery
07:57:15 <strcat[m]> which says do you want to wipe data, it's corrupted
07:57:25 <strcat[m]> if you say no, it'll just reboot and fail to boot again and end up in the same place
07:57:32 <strcat[m]> if boot fails N times on a fresh upgrade, it rolls back the upgrade
07:57:40 <strcat[m]> so if you reject wiping data, it rolls back the upgrade
07:57:46 <strcat[m]> if you accept wiping data, it'll successfully boot
07:58:16 <strcat[m]> the way the update / rescue system works means that people can reject wiping + automatically be safely rolled back to old version
07:58:18 <strcat[m]> where they can back up
07:58:22 <strcat[m]> then upgrade again and accept the wipe
07:58:47 <strcat[m]> so the previous beta was very problematic but the nice upgrade system means it's not the worst thing in the world
07:58:54 <yepodi[m]> for clarification, my pixel 3a is on the 09.10.05 beta and if I install the 09.11.14 beta there is a chance I will have to factory reset my phone?
07:59:14 <strcat[m]> yepodi: yes you'll need to factory reset to complete the upgrade
07:59:21 <strcat[m]> if you say no to factory reset a few times, it'll roll back the upgrade
07:59:27 <strcat[m]> and will boot up the old problematic beta release again
07:59:38 <yepodi[m]> ahh okay, I guess I should back up my data
07:59:39 <strcat[m]> so I recommend backing up everything and doing the upgrade + wiping
07:59:52 <strcat[m]> it'll prompt you to wipe data
08:00:01 <yepodi[m]> okay I do that
08:00:03 <strcat[m]> and you can say no which forces rollback when you say no multiple times causing boot to fail multiple times
08:00:22 <strcat[m]> so generally most users are going to say no a few times at least trying to make it work
08:00:25 <strcat[m]> and it'll roll back the upgrade
08:00:32 <strcat[m]> they won't really know the upgrade was rolled back
08:00:38 <strcat[m]> but they'll see it start wanting to upgrade again
08:00:41 <strcat[m]> hopefully they figure out what happened
08:00:53 <strcat[m]> but yeah, perils of beta software
08:01:10 <strcat[m]> incompatible f2fs file format update that was part of changes we had to roll back
08:01:28 <strcat[m]> if we had noticed it was backwards incompatible like this
08:01:34 <strcat[m]> we wouldn't have tried to ship these new kernels early
08:01:53 <yepodi[m]> it's fine, after all it's the dangers of beta software
08:01:57 <strcat[m]> generally kernel upgrades are expected to be backwards compatible with the old ABI but multiple things changed this time around
08:02:04 <strcat[m]> caused multiple issues
08:02:14 <strcat[m]> broken sound, broken calls, and on the 3a / 3a XL this f2fs issue
08:02:23 <strcat[m]> perhaps we could have invested substantial time into coming up with a workaround
08:02:35 <strcat[m]> don't have the resources to invest time in upgrade paths from a botched beta release tho
08:07:10 <dazinism> Feeling lucky I lost sound and calls on the 3XL now! Especially as my mates 2 year old magicked away my usb adaptor... so no seedvault for me right now
08:07:19 <dazinism> Thanks as always for all your work strcat
08:09:07 <dazinism> On a side note I think seedvault backups to Nextcloud may still be tenuous. Use USB flash for seedvault
08:09:45 <dazinism> Think this may of just been fixed, but that version isnt in GrapheneOS yet
08:11:49 <strcat[m]> yeah
08:11:53 <dazinism> Or use adb backup. Which I think is reliable now?
08:11:57 <strcat[m]> I think it's all fine now and this new release will likely be pushed out to stable
08:12:08 <strcat[m]> dazinism: adb backup is reliable but it has bad error reporting so if you pass invalid arguments, etc
08:12:10 <strcat[m]> you might not realize it
08:12:27 <strcat[m]> dazinism: I would use adb backup to back up app data only, and back up your home directory (or directories, if multiple profiles) yourself
08:12:54 <strcat[m]> a common mistake people make is trying to restore data on a different build of the app like F-Droid vs. Play
08:13:03 <strcat[m]> and it has a sanity check for the signing key by default
08:13:09 <strcat[m]> which you'd have to manually override by editing the backup
08:13:36 <dazinism> I was wondering about that
08:13:37 <strcat[m]> one time I did that to migrate to a different build of a 2FA TOTP app
08:14:13 <strcat[m]> F-Droid -> Play build
08:14:22 <strcat[m]> required overriding the signing key in the backup so it'd restore on the Play build
08:15:07 <dazinism> FDroid didnt sort out v2+ signing in time. And SDK 30 apps from the fdroid repo disappear if you upgrade to Android 11
08:15:29 <dazinism> Theres not many SDK 30 apps on fdroid
08:15:44 <dazinism> Somewhat luckily
08:16:07 <CEZM[m]> Is it redownloading and attempting to install the same (broken) update indefinitely? After X number of "try again" it'll boot and begin downloading again.
08:16:07 <CEZM[m]> Will I be able to update eventually, or are we left no choice but to factory reset for updates to work again?
08:16:53 <dazinism> CEZM: if you are on 3a or 3aXL you need to factory reset
08:17:02 <dazinism> Backup data first if its important
08:17:58 <dazinism> Think seedvault onto USB flash is the best/easiest option for backing up app data
08:21:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: wait what
08:21:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Aren't TOTP apps purely based on keystore?
08:22:16 <CEZM[m]> The perils of beta testing, bummer. Can't backup the keystore, auditor will fail.
08:22:44 <Ultron[m]> Can seedvault backup apps which use keystore?
08:25:28 <CEZM[m]> Still, fantastic update failsafes. Someone mentioned re-enabling OEM unlock triggers a soft-brick, that's kind of cool too.
08:25:33 <dazinism> Apps which have are in a force stopped state won't backup with seedvault
08:25:37 <dazinism> https://github.com/stevesoltys/seedvault/wiki/Known-Issues
08:26:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> <CEZM[m] "Still, fantastic update failsafe"> What
08:26:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> What device is this happening on?
08:27:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Who reported this?
08:28:26 <dazinism> * Apps which are in a force stopped state won't backup with seedvault
08:29:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <CEZM[m] "Still, fantastic update failsafe"> strcat
08:31:42 <dazinism> Guess the non backing up of force stopped apps is likely to be the same with adb backup also
08:33:26 <lickidysplit[m]> Shit so we will have to force wipe when upgrading from the old beta to new anyway?
08:33:43 <lickidysplit[m]> Meh may as well just > to the latest release üòé
08:55:03 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Ahhh the joys
09:01:55 <_12> so i just read the caveat with the new 3a beta release, mine is already at the stage where it's asking me to reboot to apply the update. should i just backup my data now or should disabling seamless update be enough to stop it being installed?
09:02:31 <strcat[m]> _12: you should really just backup and migrate but you won't be forced to wipe when you reboot into the new upgrade
09:02:47 <strcat[m]> you can say no to wiping each time it asks and it'll give up and roll back the upgrade
09:02:57 <strcat[m]> it has a certain # of boot attempts before it rolls back an upgrade
09:03:08 <strcat[m]> the rollback system is not directly related to the rescue menu asking you to wipe
09:03:31 <strcat[m]> after N attempts (varies by device) failing to boot to late userspace
09:03:33 <strcat[m]> it rolls back the upgrade
09:03:53 <strcat[m]> so regardless of how it fails (rejecting wipe, holding power button, whatever) it counts up the failures then rolls back
09:04:17 <strcat[m]> it still has the full old OS installed and doesn't disable rolling back until it makes it to late userspace
09:04:25 <mrxx_0[m]> Guys I have a big problem with my 3A XL I just made the update, reboot the phone and I have a message saying "Cannot load Android system, Your data may be corrupt. If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory data reset and erase all user data stored on this device" :(
09:04:35 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote above
09:04:44 <strcat[m]> it's caused by the previous beta release having an incompatible fs change
09:04:46 <_12> strcat: noted, and thanks for the info
09:04:58 <mrxx_0[m]> Ok I am gonna read
09:05:00 <strcat[m]> if you say no to wiping N times, it'll roll back the upgrade to the previous problematic release
09:05:03 <strcat[m]> and then you can back up
09:05:17 <strcat[m]> you ultimately need to do the upgrade + wipe data though
09:05:36 <strcat[m]> major annoyance, I know, just how things are with beta testing in rare cases where something horrible does go wrong
09:06:40 <mrxx_0[m]> And if I have no backup x) ?
09:06:49 <strcat[m]> > if you say no to wiping N times, it'll roll back the upgrade to the previous problematic release
09:06:57 <mrxx_0[m]> Damn Ok
09:07:03 <strcat[m]> you have an opportunity to say no to wiping and back up now
09:07:08 <mrxx_0[m]> It's all good
09:07:14 <strcat[m]> but then you have to upgrade again and wipe
09:07:17 <mrxx_0[m]> 3 times saying no for 3a xl
09:07:39 <strcat[m]> yeah I don't remember the exact number of failure attempts for each device variant before rollback
09:07:40 <strcat[m]> it varies
09:07:52 <strcat[m]> it's designed around it booting up, crashing in some way, and automatically rebooting
09:08:04 <strcat[m]> it just happens to be the case that the failure here has a menu that tries to help you
09:08:23 <strcat[m]> before the menu existed, it'd have just boot looped N times itself then rolled back
09:08:26 <mrxx_0[m]> You know what caused this ?
09:08:29 <strcat[m]> yes
09:08:49 <strcat[m]> the old beta (the one you were on before) shipped backwards incompatible changes mistakenly
09:09:00 <strcat[m]> including backwards incompatible f2fs format change for Pixel 3a
09:09:13 <strcat[m]> those changes had to be rolled back, the new beta release is fine
09:09:22 <strcat[m]> the problem you're seeing is from the old beta
09:09:31 <strcat[m]> so there's nothing for us to fix now, it's just an unfortunate situation for people who installed the old beta
09:09:39 <strcat[m]> since the upgrade path requires a wipe
09:09:48 <mrxx_0[m]> Oh ok I see, the problem was with the old beta that's it
09:09:54 <strcat[m]> yeah
09:09:54 <mrxx_0[m]> Thank you Daniel :)
09:10:40 <strcat[m]> and for some reason only impacts 3a / 3a XL in this way
09:10:45 <mrxx_0[m]> It's only on 3a ?
09:10:47 <strcat[m]> maybe the f2fs feature was only enabled there
09:10:47 <mrxx_0[m]> x)
09:10:47 <strcat[m]> yeah
09:10:48 <mrxx_0[m]> Ok
09:10:58 <strcat[m]> 3 and 3 XL had broken sound
09:11:08 <strcat[m]> 3a and 3a XL have this more serious problem breaking the upgrade path
09:11:18 <strcat[m]> all should be fixed now with this new release
09:11:27 <strcat[m]> computers are weird
09:11:31 <mrxx_0[m]> haha
09:11:35 <mrxx_0[m]> Less than humans
09:11:56 <strcat[m]> it was a mistake to try shipping the Android 11 kernels for Android 10 due to there being a few little breaking changes
09:12:03 <strcat[m]> so things largely worked but there were a few issues
09:12:09 <strcat[m]> this is fallout from that
09:12:45 <strcat[m]> would have been nice if it was just completely broken so we wouldn't have pushed it out via beta
09:12:59 <strcat[m]> but it 99% worked
09:13:12 <mrxx_0[m]> That's why there is the beta channel !
09:13:25 <strcat[m]> yeah I do testing before pushing to beta but
09:13:33 <strcat[m]> it's not very extensive due to time constraints
09:13:50 <mrxx_0[m]> We know it could break sometimes, we pray that we are not in the 1% when there is a fail
09:13:52 <mrxx_0[m]> Of course
09:14:15 <mrxx_0[m]> If one phone is ok, you can't be sure for the next 99
09:16:43 <mrxx_0[m]> Anyway I wanted to make sure to write the exact error message in this channel if this happens again, people could search in the log and have your answer and the rest of the explanation
09:27:39 <paufggs[m]> guys i don't know for you put i can't even make calls on pixel 3
09:27:52 <paufggs[m]> beta channel
09:28:05 <strcat[m]> update
09:28:11 <Seplx[m]> How do I unlock the bootloader after installing Graphene and locking the bootloader? Just like on stock?
09:28:16 <strcat[m]> yes
09:28:22 <mrxx_0[m]> yes
09:28:27 <mrxx_0[m]> It's exactly the same
09:28:41 <paufggs[m]> <strcat[m] "update"> There's an update already ?
09:28:47 <Seplx[m]> Thanks
09:28:53 <strcat[m]> paufggs: update to the latest release
09:28:59 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.11.14
09:29:34 <strcat[m]> are you on 2020.09.11.14 or the previous 2020.09.10.05 release
09:29:59 <strcat[m]> if there are still issues on 2020.09.11.14 I need to know, but if you're on 2020.09.10.05 you need to update
09:29:59 <paufggs[m]> ah yes thank you
09:30:19 <paufggs[m]> no I was on 09.10.05
09:57:35 <dazinism> I've started a page on backups, which I guess may be useful
09:57:39 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
09:58:31 <dazinism> I'll be adding more later today
10:11:21 <_12> btw strcat thanks for continuing to make grapheneOS, happy to continue using the beta version to test and report issues even if potentially unstable parts are going to be a part of it.
10:13:01 <Cyrinux[m]> "dazinism" (https://matrix.to/#/@DzzzzzzR:matrix.org): you can maybe add https://mailcow.email/ for contact/calendar sync. Easy to deploy selfhosted mail/calendar/contact solution.
10:13:50 <propertype[m]> I am now using the latest beta release on a pixel 3a xl. It's working fine so far. No crashes or sound problems
10:14:00 <propertype[m]> Hat to factory reset
10:16:56 <propertype[m]> * Had to factory reset
10:26:58 <strcat[m]> _12: thanks
10:27:09 <strcat[m]> glad people mostly understand that stuff can go wrong with beta
10:58:58 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "glad people mostly understand th"> Ive veen noticing a shift that people see beta s as a "cool early birds club" where they expect everything to be perfect and have acces to new features before everyone else
10:59:38 <blacklight447[m]> Look at how many folks were bitching about ios 14 being buggy
10:59:39 <blacklight447[m]> Even if it was still in a closed beta
11:10:38 <CEZM[m]> <strcat[m] "all should be fixed now with thi"> It no longer requires a wipe to upgrade?
11:11:01 <strcat[m]> that's an issue with the previousbeta rrelease not the current release
11:11:04 <strcat[m]>  * that's an issue with the previousbeta release not the current release
11:11:20 <strcat[m]> the problem is solved for the new release and isn't going to be a problem for people upgrading from the previous stable release to it and then future releases
11:11:45 <strcat[m]> the goal of the beta channel is identifying bad releases and aborting them before they make it to the stable channel
11:11:52 <strcat[m]> which is what happened here
11:12:04 <strcat[m]> a release goes to the testing channel, then beta, then stable
11:12:17 <strcat[m]> sometimes serious issues get into the beta channel which is why we need it
11:12:30 <strcat[m]> choosing to use the beta channel is making a sacrifice to help GrapheneOS
11:13:06 <strcat[m]> it's not a way to get releases earlier, it's a way to sacrifice stability and risk having things go wrong to contribute to the project through testing and catching problems
11:19:24 <mrxx_0[m]> A small price to pay to help :)
11:20:14 <louipc> yo you hear about this new riscv board coming out? https://rioslab.org/show.php?id=9&main=45
11:34:39 <CEZM[m]> <strcat[m] "it's not a way to get releases e"> Makes sense, I'll get over it and continue testing.
11:39:04 <rip_mca[m]> Recommendations for a twitter app under grapheneos?
11:40:15 <inrdrna[m]> nitter
11:44:16 <dazinism> Some nitter site can be good for viewing
11:45:05 <dazinism> Twidere is a pretty good Twitter app. Also supports multi account and mastodon/activitypub etc.
11:46:30 <dazinism> Lots of people use twitter as a progressive web app
11:50:49 <rip_mca[m]> THX. Twidere seems to be what I was looking for
11:56:54 <louipc> are there any commercial efforts to market/sell/support grapheneos yet?
11:59:10 <dazinism> Think some folks sell devices with it on, and I guess may give support also.
11:59:22 <Ultron[m]> But there is no official tie up.
11:59:46 <dazinism> The decent ones will contribute cash/dev time
12:00:25 <status_offline[m> guys, can anyone confirm if the clipboard feature from KDE Connect works on GrapheneOS? I believe Android 10 removed clipboard sharing and maybe Android 11 will do it too
12:02:46 <dazinism> Not tried KDE connect for a fairly long time, but clipboard is accessible to the focused app, so imagine it'll work
12:05:13 <dazinism> rip_mca: Twidere works good without ever granting it storage permission
12:28:40 <Autopsy[m]> <dazinism "Not tried KDE connect for a fair"> A bit annoying to get set up, what with the permissions and read/write things. Always get "failed" transfer as I forget to set up access to certain folders on GrapheneOS. Might be an Android 10 thing, though, idk.

12:40:51 <Autopsy[m]> <status_offline[m "Oh really? humm, love KDE Connec"> It does work, but it's always a little finicky. At least for me. There aren't any alternatives I know.

12:52:47 <strcat> can probably push out the new beta to stable now
12:52:53 <strcat> going to do one final upgrade path test
13:01:01 <status_offline[m> <Ultron[m] "Yeah. At least it's from your OS"> That's true
13:43:56 <dazinism> Backups wiki updated. Maybe useful for folks who ended up on the first beta with a 3a or 3aXL
13:44:00 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
13:49:53 <dazinism> <Cyrinux[m] ""dazinism" (https://matrix.to/#/"> It is a wiki, and contributions are most welcome, I'll stick it in.

15:10:22 <zedding[m]> –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç
15:14:38 <jpds> If I'm on the broken Android 11 kernel, would I just wait until there's another such kernel update?
15:15:58 <aeonsolution[m]> factory reset and flash the new version
15:16:57 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] factory reset and flash the latest version
15:27:10 <strcat[m]> jpds: it's covered in the release notes on the site now
15:27:23 <strcat[m]> you have the option of doing the factory reset after the upgrading or waiting for the Android 11 based release
15:28:41 <strcat[m]> couldn't think of a better way to do this since the new release is the proper one, and the issue was caused by the previous cancelled release
15:28:47 <strcat[m]> just how beta is going to be sometimes
15:29:45 <kickstart> i'm on stable channel i don't have to do a thing right
15:31:32 <jfbourdeau> Need some help. The last GOS update didn't go well.  It said a seemless update had been done, to reboot and at reboot it says it can't load Android system. 10/QQ3A.200805.001/2020.09.10.05  I now have option to TRY AGain (that doesn' t work) or FACTORY RESET.  Where a factory reset would bring me ? My original Pixel OS or GOS ?
15:32:20 <jpds> jfbourdeau: GOS, see the releases page
15:32:23 <jpds> strcat[m]: Thanks
15:33:46 <jfbourdeau> tks jpds   finally a 3rd time Trya again, worked ! Weird
15:35:03 <strcat[m]> jfbourdeau: no, it downgraded to the previous release
15:35:07 <strcat[m]> please read the release notes
15:35:27 <strcat[m]> if an update fails to boot several times, it reverts the upgrade to the previous release
15:36:54 <jfbourdeau> ok tks strcat[m]
15:37:05 <strcat[m]> if you're using the beta channel you should expect to sometimes run into problems, and the previous release had issues which forced rolling back changes
15:37:23 <strcat[m]> and now it isn't possible to upgrade from that cancelled release to the fixed current release
15:37:33 <jfbourdeau> oops :-(
15:37:40 <strcat[m]> the previous release was cancelled and didn't leave the beta channel
15:37:49 <jfbourdeau> so next step ?
15:38:00 <jpds> jfbourdeau: On the releases page
15:38:04 <strcat[m]> read the paragraph on the site about it
15:38:24 <strcat[m]> there isn't an upgrade path from the cancelled beta release -> current release without doing the factory reset
15:38:42 <jfbourdeau> ok
15:38:47 <strcat[m]> alternatively you can wait for the Android 11 based GrapheneOS
15:39:23 <strcat[m]> you could potentially disable the Updater until then (covered in the usage guide)
15:39:35 <strcat[m]> don't really have a specific recommendation
15:39:37 <jfbourdeau> ok tks
15:39:46 <strcat[m]> it's what the beta channel is for, catching problems like this
15:40:08 <strcat[m]> this is the first time a release has actually had to be cancelled due to beta testing but that is why it exists after all
15:41:07 <strcat[m]> particularly annoying problem since for the 3a and 3a XL there isn't a nice upgrade path until we release Android 11-based GrapheneOS
15:41:25 <jfbourdeau> I have a pixel 3a.  Did other reported having the same issue ?
15:41:44 <jfbourdeau> " Android 11 based GrapheneOS"   weeks ? months ?
15:44:14 <strcat[m]> it's an issue for the 3a and 3a XL
15:44:37 <jfbourdeau> ok
15:44:45 <strcat[m]> there were issues caught in the cancelled release, which is why it was cancelled, and unfortunately for the 3a and 3a XL the new kernel made backwards incompatible fs format changes
15:45:05 <jfbourdeau> Hooo ok :-/
15:45:09 <strcat[m]> the f2fs update was not meant to be rolled back
15:45:46 <strcat[m]> for the 3a and 3a XL, due to their configuration, it's a one way trip without wiping data
15:46:22 <strcat[m]> so the OS is giving you the option to either wipe data (since it doesn't support it) or say no and end up triggering rollback to that cancelled release
15:46:45 <jfbourdeau> " Android 11 based GrapheneOS" that you talked about is what I should wait ? and it will require a fresh install ? ( available in weeks, months ?)
15:46:51 <strcat[m]> opting in to doing Beta testing means taking a risk to help the project
15:46:55 <strcat[m]> no it won't require a fresh install
15:47:03 <jfbourdeau> ok
15:47:48 <strcat[m]> if you aren't running into any major issues with the cancelled release you could wait until Android 11-based GrapheneOS
15:47:54 <ruddo[m]> Hey @strcat I hope the family emergency is sorted out favorably.ü§óü§óü§ó
15:47:59 <strcat[m]> which will have the upgraded kernel again
15:48:02 <strcat[m]> ruddo: kind of
15:48:30 <jfbourdeau> ok tks a lot strcat[m]    how long (I ma not up to date on all that) before ANrroid 11 based GOS ? 2020 ?
15:48:56 <strcat[m]> don't have a timeline
15:49:18 <strcat[m]> but there likely won't be another release based on Android 10
15:49:19 <jfbourdeau> if I check STABLE in the settings, what will it do ? Just not update ?
15:49:37 <strcat[m]> it won't upgrade to beta releases anymore
15:49:46 <strcat[m]> the current release is going to be released to stable since it's fine
15:49:52 <strcat[m]> the problematic release was cancelled
15:50:02 <strcat[m]> just have some final testing to do before it goes to stable
15:50:47 <jfbourdeau> ok tks  so at the next stable update, even if I cancelled a BEta release, will it update to the next stable release ? ( guess I should go read about it on the web site to refresh my memory)
15:50:48 <strcat[m]> beta channel is where most testing happens
15:51:18 <strcat[m]> well if you leave the Updater enabled it's going to try updating to the current release againj
15:51:21 <strcat[m]>  * well if you leave the Updater enabled it's going to try updating to the current release again
15:51:26 <jfbourdeau> tks for your patience.... Noobie question.... Noobie in a sense I am not a GOS or Android pro, but been using GOS for months and like it
15:52:14 <strcat[m]> you should probably use the stable channel from now on, but you'll need to decide how to handle your current predicament
15:52:37 <kickstart> i like graphene so much
15:52:39 <strcat[m]> either upgrade again and wipe data as it requests or disable Updater app (usage guide explains how) and wait until we release Android 11 GrapheneOS
15:52:50 <jfbourdeau> ok
15:53:03 <kickstart> i can't wait to ask them to start Convergence project  so i can leave my pc  and use the phone for everything
15:53:08 <kickstart> with a monitor
15:53:12 <strcat[m]> it's unfortunate that there was actually a serious problem caught in beta testing but at the same time it shows why we need it
15:53:20 <ruddo[m]> It's clean and mean and solves all my problems.  I just wish there was a supported tablet.  I wonder if CalyxOS will cover that gap.
15:54:06 <strcat[m]> if we had substantially more resources perhaps we could have Alpha -> Beta -> Stable but it's too overkill right now
15:54:27 <strcat[m]> so it goes basic internal testing -> Beta -> Stable and the developers mostly do testing once it's in Beta
15:55:02 <strcat[m]> the issue that prevents upgrading to the fixed release isn't really a bug, it's just that rolling back the kernel changes can't really be done
15:55:12 <strcat[m]> since f2fs has a backwards incompatible change
15:55:18 <strcat[m]> and it updated the fs format
15:55:49 <strcat[m]> shrug not much that we could have done to be friendlier to people doing beta testing afaict
15:56:27 <strcat[m]> those changes had to be rolled back and the alternative of not doing a September release (until migrating to Android 11 in at least 2+ weeks) wasn't a good one
15:56:44 <strcat[m]> Beta users are taking a risk, just how it is
15:58:08 <jfbourdeau> agree... all that make sense.  Have a good week end tks... Happy at least my Phone is functionnal
15:59:25 <Seplx[m]> Idk how much devs are here, but.
15:59:26 <Seplx[m]> How will Generic Kernel Images affect performance?
16:01:59 <engulf[m]> But since the f2fs was only enabled on 3a and 3a XL (which did not seem to have any sound, call or any other issues) wouldn't it been better solution to rollback only Pixel 3/3XL and Pixel 4/4XL?
16:02:29 <engulf[m]>  * But since the f2fs was only enabled on 3a and 3a XL (which did not seem to have any sound, call or any other issues) wouldn't it been better solution to rollback only Pixel 3/3XL and Pixel 4/4XL? If I understood correctly*
16:07:00 <s538gdek[m]> Should I go ahead and update the new version my phone downloaded last night? Or will it screw something up?
16:07:55 <engulf[m]> s538gdek: Really good question, which model do you have?
16:08:06 <s538gdek[m]> 3A
16:08:09 <engulf[m]>  * s538gdek: Really good question, which model do you have and on which channel are you on?
16:10:17 <engulf[m]> Quessing you are on the beta channel, as its the only one that has received an update. It really depends on which update it downloaded last night
16:12:36 <engulf[m]> I would personally kill the disable the update app, clear its storage, enable it and download the latest update as it doesn't have the backwards incompatible change in f2fs (which was rolled back)
16:14:25 <s538gdek[m]> OK thank you.
16:14:35 <s538gdek[m]> Graphene OS is awesome.
16:16:37 <engulf[m]>  * I would personally disable the update app, clear its storage, enable it and download the latest update as it doesn't have the backwards incompatible change in f2fs (which was rolled back)
16:17:11 <strcat[m]> and btw the f2fs change was fine and will be in the android 11 release with the rest
16:17:23 <strcat[m]> the issues forcing rolling back the kernel update were other things
16:17:52 <strcat[m]> just not backwards compatible to roll back that f2fs change
16:18:20 <strcat[m]> and we can't dedicate a whole bunch of dev time to figuring out some migration path from a cancelled beta release
16:18:35 <strcat[m]> there will be a migration path without a factory reset to Android 11-based GrapheneOS as it explains there on the releases page

16:49:25 <alex-a-soto[m]> Hey folks, so by default the pixel devices don't support HDMI out but rather rely on casting to a device. Is this a hardware or software limitation?
16:50:36 <strcat[m]> that might be a hardware limitation
16:50:45 <strcat[m]> not supporting miracast is a software limitation
16:50:52 <strcat[m]> you can use vlc to do chromecast from grapheneos
16:51:57 <alex-a-soto[m]> > that might be a hardware limitation
16:51:57 <alex-a-soto[m]> That's too bad. I was hoping it would be possible to use a NexDock and Pixel device together.
16:53:07 <strcat[m]> it works with GrapheneOS but Pixels don't support it
16:53:10 <strcat[m]> I don't really think it is possible to support it
16:53:14 <strcat[m]> I don't think the hardware is there
16:54:18 <alex-a-soto[m]> > I don't think the hardware is there
16:54:18 <alex-a-soto[m]> Thank you.
16:54:18 <strcat[m]> I think what's needed is essentially there but not hooked up, maybe it's possible to do it in software but I just doubt it
16:54:22 <strcat[m]> the SoC supports it
16:54:29 <strcat[m]> but doesn't mean the hardware is set up to be able to do it
16:54:52 <alex-a-soto[m]> * > I don't think the hardware is there

17:12:30 <louipc> good morning good night
17:12:35 <kickstart> thanks strcat[m]
17:12:38 <triniboytilladie> if this is not the place let me know
17:12:44 <aeonsolution[m]> triniboytilladie: what step on https://grapheneos.org/install are you having issues with
17:13:32 <louipc> this is the place
17:13:57 <triniboytilladie> aeonsolution[m] flashing the phone kept telling me the boot loader is old
17:14:18 <triniboytilladie> or the flash boo is to old sorry aeonsolution[m]
17:14:35 <aeonsolution[m]> this is a commn issue that users come across when they use videos from youtube that dont follow the official instructions
17:14:58 <triniboytilladie> AH
17:15:09 <aeonsolution[m]> are you using windows or mac or linux?
17:15:19 <triniboytilladie> WINDOWS
17:15:29 <aeonsolution[m]> ok nice
17:15:32 <aeonsolution[m]> lets do this
17:15:46 <aeonsolution[m]> close all command line windows and powershell windows you have open
17:16:26 <aeonsolution[m]> open up file explorer and go to Downloads
17:16:32 <triniboytilladie> wait im currently not at my personal laptop can i try reaching out to you or someone else when i am
17:17:09 <aeonsolution[m]> i probably wont be here later
17:17:18 <aeonsolution[m]> just follow the instructions on the website
17:17:28 <aeonsolution[m]> delete everything in your Downloads folder
17:17:43 <aeonsolution[m]> well first delete everything in your Downloads folder
17:17:55 <triniboytilladie> everything pertaining to the installation?
17:17:56 <aeonsolution[m]> then open up powershell and run the command
17:18:35 <aeonsolution[m]> `cd ~/Downloads`
17:19:12 <aeonsolution[m]> there is no need to open up additional windows, just follow the steps on the website using the open powershell window
17:19:21 <aeonsolution[m]> and you will be good
17:19:50 <triniboytilladie> okay cool
17:20:50 <triniboytilladie> again im deleting everything in the downloads folder except for graphene os and sdk or litterrally everything
17:21:00 <triniboytilladie> aeonsolution[m]
17:21:21 <aeonsolution[m]> i would do everything
17:21:42 <aeonsolution[m]> just so we remove that doubt that issue comes from a misdownloaded file
17:21:56 <triniboytilladie> and from there i start following graphene os directions correct?
17:22:15 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
17:22:18 <aeonsolution[m]> from here
17:40:53 <Autopsy[m]> Did you get it sorted, triniboytilladie ?
19:21:36 <gizmodroid[m]> Pixel 3 that received breaking Sept 10th beta, just received Sept 11th beta... audio works, didn't ask for a factory reset
19:22:06 <gizmodroid[m]> Was expecting to spend the next 2 hours reinstalling and reconfiguring
19:22:24 <gizmodroid[m]> Wife now expects me to do work on other things
19:22:38 <gizmodroid[m]> How do I put this on the issue tracker?
19:24:03 <gizmodroid[m]> J/k. good job all
19:24:08 <kickstart> man just book her any thing spa , saloon  or something
19:24:31 <gizmodroid[m]> haha, maybe I should book myself spa, and claim I went to get my phone fixed
19:24:43 <kickstart> this guaranteed way of having this 2 hours of peace
19:28:35 <kickstart> gizmodroid[m]your way buy you peace for 2 hours my way buy you peace for 2 hours and bounce time may be 1 day or 2
19:28:59 <gizmodroid[m]> haha, nice.
20:00:05 <dazinism> <louipc "nice. is zop/zap adoption increa"> zot/zap - not sure, possibly a bit? It is rather unknown, but an interesting family of projects.
21:03:14 <CEZM[m]> To confirm, this "seedvault" solution does not backup keystore?
21:04:12 <buildtobreak> Hey everyone. Sorry if this is the wrong venue for this kind of question - sorta new. Any chance that anyone else is having issue with DL from the website? Trying to download the .zip for a Pixel 2 XL and i'm getting 60kbps speeds, but only on that website. I tried checking the issue tracker for the website, but didnt find anything. Thoughts I'd ak
21:04:12 <buildtobreak> here

21:19:43 <lev[m]> update was stuck for a long time, then utlimately I got this
21:19:55 <lev[m]> I was hesitant to restart since it was ostensibly midway through the patch
21:20:25 <lev[m]> updating my backup, then I'm going to reboot, unless there is some log I should check/something I should do first
21:27:35 <Guest36731> hello all ! My phone just rebooted (actually because of no more battery, not a proper reboot). I guess an update applied during the reboot because i had a notification today (the classic notification "reboot the apply de update"). However my phone do not reboot... I tried to change active slot, but it failed ("FAILED (remote: 'set_active command is
21:27:36 <Guest36731> not allowed on locked devices')"). Is there a way without wiping my data? Thank you very much
21:29:38 <Guest36731> My phone is a Pixel 3a
21:31:42 <arouzing[m]> Hello!
21:37:42 <Guest36731> Sorry for disturbing, I tried one more time, and my phone finally successfully rebooted ! Big relief !
21:40:25 <aeonsolution[m]> <buildtobreak "Hey everyone. Sorry if this is t"> the servers may be getting DOS attacks so the download speeds will be slower
21:40:59 <aeonsolution[m]> lev: were you on the beta channel?
21:41:08 <lev[m]> no, stable
21:41:14 <aeonsolution[m]> i would just restart it
21:41:30 <lev[m]> I backed up my stuff an djust restarted it, it's been on the grapheneos graphic for like 30 seconds
21:41:31 <aeonsolution[m]> itll check whats wrong with the download
21:41:41 <lev[m]> ah kk
21:42:16 <aeonsolution[m]> if all else fails, you can factory reset
21:42:36 <lev[m]> I'm trying to avoid that if possible, but yeah
21:43:06 <arouzing[m]> I hope you get it working Lev!
21:44:18 <lev[m]> oh cool, it booted, and looks like it's finishing the update
21:44:22 <lev[m]> crisis averted rofl
21:44:26 <lev[m]> just making me sweat a little
21:44:36 <arouzing[m]> Congratulations!
21:44:40 <arouzing[m]> :D
21:45:13 <lev[m]> build number is the latest one, sweeet
21:45:37 <lev[m]> though I was able to grab all the stuff I needed, so I only would have lost lost time, not data
21:46:38 <aeonsolution[m]> lev: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
21:46:46 <aeonsolution[m]> further reading if youre interested
21:47:12 <arouzing[m]> I just got my phone / installed graphene os today!
21:51:26 <arouzing[m]> The only downside is notifications not working on all apps but I knew and was ok with that from the start.
22:10:16 <arouzing[m]> Welcome!
22:11:35 <lev[m]> yeah I use this as my daily driver, and the the notifications situation was the largest adjustment for sure (though I understand why this is the current state of things from a technical perspective)
22:11:56 <lev[m]> though only being reachable immediately via email/sms/phone/signal/telegram is fine imo
22:12:24 <lev[m]> the only thing that slack/discord; mostly I don't need those to be immediate (since if I am doing work, or hanging out, I'm at my computer anyway)
22:12:38 <arouzing[m]> They might find a workaround someday ü§û
22:12:39 <lev[m]> but I would like to able to be notified if my boss messages me on slack
22:13:23 <lev[m]> there is some ongoing work to implement a replacement for firebase, but I forget what it's called
22:14:28 <lev[m]>  * the only things that I miss are slack/discord; mostly I don't need those to be immediate (since if I am doing work, or hanging out, I'm at my computer anyway)
22:15:01 <arouzing[m]> :D
23:04:13 <dazinism> lev: Theres a slack bridge to element, which would get you notifications.  Has to be enabled in element integrations (matrix apps) in a room you set up to bridge. Then I think via integration settings on the slack end. Its been a few years since I've done this.
23:07:27 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Is there a way to force change imei on graphene?
23:08:23 <dazinism> No
23:09:32 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Darn
23:16:52 <engulf[m]> <lickidyspl1t[m] "Is there a way to force change i"> Changing IMEI is illegal in many countries
23:21:22 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Least of my worries bro
23:21:28 <lickidyspl1t[m]> üôÑ
