00:02:36 <seashield[m]> I can’t seem to accept it. There’s an exclamation mark next to your name and it freezes (just goes around in circles).
00:05:33 <strcat[m]> which Matrix client are you using?
00:05:36 <strcat[m]> use the Element web client
00:06:48 <seashield[m]> It’s working now. I’m using the iOS Element app.
00:08:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) so I'll probably be having a look at his issue now
00:24:20 <alex-resist> dazinism: the link you shared about "Reducing the Forensic Footprint [...]" is there a PDF download somewhere? Am I too stupid to find it?
00:25:08 <alex-resist> ooh I think I found it, it's below the abstract, nevermind
00:28:32 <alex-resist> If someone wants a laptop with working USB ports for flashing phones, I can recommend X230 Thinkpads. I never run into any problems, it seems to be very stable and very portable at the same time. Also you can do quite a bit of hardware modifications and it runs Heads+Qubes, but that is OT I guess
00:47:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Laptops suck tbh
00:57:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Issue resolved
01:00:54 <alex-resist> anupritaisno1[m] aren't most people flashing Graphene from laptops?
01:01:03 <alex-resist> I would think so
01:02:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> <alex-resist "anupritaisno1 aren't most people"> That's their problem
01:02:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway it wasn't his USB port that was the issue
01:02:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> I obviously won't tell publicly what the issue was
01:02:40 <alex-resist> That's fine
01:02:59 <alex-resist> I just wanted to mention that some laptops work fine, and an X230 is generally an okay machine to have
01:03:51 <alex-resist> If someone wants to do flashing parties at some point, they likely won't carry a desktop computer :)
01:11:44 <seashield[m]> huge thanks to this community, especially anupritaisno1. Very knowledgeable and professional. Outstanding.
01:34:53 <madaidan[m]> [anupritaisno1](https://matrix.to/#/@anupritaisno1:m.apex.to) being professional. That's a first.

01:54:47 <aeonsolution[m]> <neo[m] "After more than 7 hours of build"> you need to check the shell if there was an error that helps you fix the error. if there isn't one, try running `m -j1` to see where the error is occurring. you need to figure out how to resolve this after running that command.

05:32:08 <bobfett> <gerrard[m] "Does anyone know if you can shar"> Yes

08:08:51 <neo[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "you need to check the shell if t"> Thanks for the answer. I ran m -j1 and received the same message.
08:09:09 <neo[m]> I run build od Ubuntu 20.04
11:31:14 <aeonsolution[m]> neo: check that you didn't run out of space. if you didn't run out of space you need to look at the output from ninja and see if it gives you message/command to help you resolve the build. it "shouldn't" error out without a reason. there is very little anyone can do to help you resolve a failed ninja build because it is user specific and it cant tell us that you didnt miss a step. so it is highly likely that you
11:31:14 <aeonsolution[m]> made a mistake at some point.
11:31:57 <aeonsolution[m]> my advice is that you nuke the project and start from the beginning
11:32:24 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch
11:34:32 <aeonsolution[m]> it may seem tedious but it is a better use of your time to start over than trying to resolve a error that is being caused by a wrong user input

18:07:26 <cron732741[m]>  how to force phone to use media playing instade of phone sound output where quality is lower ?
21:00:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> <xander-salamande "stock Pixel 4 does this by defau"> You must update the WiFi driver to a certain version
21:00:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then it just works
21:00:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google updates the driver so this feature works fine
21:01:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's possible on other devices but they use a really outdated WiFi driver
21:01:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> So the feature doesn't get advertised
21:04:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> * It's possible on other non google devices but they use a really outdated WiFi driver
21:04:57 <xander-salamande> Do you need to do anything special on GrapheneOS to make this work? (Assuming phone had up-to-date stock Android beforehand)
21:05:06 <xander-salamande> (and assuming phone is a Pixel 4)
21:05:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> [xander-salamander](https://matrix.to/#/@xander-salamander:matrix.org) no, just have sd855 or newer and a pixel device
21:06:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or get a newer driver from CAF for non google devices and build it in to the kernel
21:08:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember that even if the WiFi driver is open source
21:08:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> It relies on closed source firmware
21:09:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Taking things into your hands and updating it might break WiFi completely

21:31:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> [D~C](https://matrix.to/#/@colljrdam:matrix.org) use the android flash tool to upgrade to R
21:31:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or sideload the full OTA from Google's page
21:31:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> The latter is safer
21:32:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Once you're upgraded to 11
21:32:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can flash graphene

22:32:28 <xander-salamande> Relevant text from official guide:
22:32:29 <xander-salamande> > It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions.
22:32:29 <xander-salamande> I have a vague memory that this used to say "latest Android 10" or somesuch, but now it just says "update the stock OS", which implies no special issues with [Android 11 --> GrapheneOS] as opposed to [Android 10 --> GrapheneOS]. (someone correct me if I'm reading the guide wrong here)
22:43:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> [xander-salamander](https://matrix.to/#/@xander-salamander:matrix.org) to tell you the truth
22:43:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> I pretty much unlocked and flashed right away
23:00:30 <XV73J> pixel 4 verizon, script fails at writing the image to slot a (but not bootloader, which is the part locked by verizon?). did I do something wrong on my end? flashed a pixel 3 sucessfully earlier on same port and same cable
23:00:47 <XV73J> error is (remote: 'Changing slot with snapshot applied may cancel the update.')

23:23:33 <aeonsolution[m]> XV73J: if you have a Pixel 4 Verizon variant you won't be be able to unlock the bootloader
23:26:01 <aeonsolution[m]> XV73J: there is nothing you can do about that, Verizon disables bootloader unlocking. the best way to avoid these issues is to get a noncarrier variant Pixel that has the device unlocked in the box
23:26:21 <XV73J> I'm able to unlock oem unlocking from dev options. i figured i wouldn't be able to write anything at all to the phone otherwise? just double checking
23:27:45 <aeonsolution[m]> they allow oem unlocking so you can go to other carriers but they dont let you modify their phones
23:28:10 <aeonsolution[m]> im butchering the technical part
23:28:54 <XV73J> ah like visible etc
23:28:57 <aeonsolution[m]> so because they dont let you unlock the bootloader you cant install alternative OSes
23:29:37 <aeonsolution[m]>  * so because they dont let you unlock the bootloader, you cant install alternative OSes
23:29:54 <aeonsolution[m]> if you are able too return the phone
23:30:13 <aeonsolution[m]> if you want 0 chance of having this problem, buy the phone straight from google
23:33:18 <XV73J> yeah it's tricky trying to find a used one that's actually unlocked
23:33:42 <XV73J> i'll stick with the pixel 3 i have anyways. thanks aeonsolution[m]
23:39:44 <aeonsolution[m]> you're welcome, sorry that you are having the problem. big bummer.
