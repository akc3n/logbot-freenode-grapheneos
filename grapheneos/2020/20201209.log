00:23:37 <Lallero> anyone knows a good android emulator for android?
00:24:04 <Lallero> I need gps to use maps in it
00:24:08 <Thatcher[m]> How do I apply the new update for Graphene that was released today?
00:25:06 <Thatcher[m]> I went to system update in the settings but it did not download anything
00:25:48 <Lallero> Thatcher, it's a beta release, you'll not get it if you're on stable
00:25:57 <Lallero> that's what probably where you're
00:26:35 <Thatcher[m]> Ah, thank you for clearing that up Lallero
00:27:50 <Lallero> np
00:41:54 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> What is the difference between an secondary security chip like T2, Secure Enclave, Titan M etc, than the one that is in Snapdragon processors which is also separated from the main processor?
00:58:40 <strcat[m]> those all provide different things
01:00:08 <strcat[m]> also secure enclave is not a separate chip in iOS devices
01:00:25 <TheJollyRoger> Woah, wait, it's... it's not? Huh. I didn't know that.
01:00:29 <strcat[m]> yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: something being on the same die or not doesn't change much, that's not what matters
01:03:05 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "Woah, wait, it's... it's not? Hu"> Seen my PM yet?
01:03:21 <TheJollyRoger> Hey yzrhjocizuwkjlqo, I haven't. Could you resend it?
01:04:25 <TheJollyRoger> I get this funny feeling that since Matrix.org doesn't show when someone's offline or not offline, I can't help but think that if someone on the Matrix side of things sends someone on IRC a direct message when that person on IRC is offline, it might not end up being delivered.
01:04:28 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <strcat[m] "yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: something be"> But why are most vendors that cares about security moving it out? Like on Macs, Pixel etc. Is it so they get control over it themselves instead of the CPU manufacturer?
01:05:12 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "Hey yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf, I haven'"> Done
01:06:45 <strcat[m]> yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: yes
01:07:04 <strcat[m]> yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: Apple only has it separate on x86 Macs
01:13:06 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Makes sense. Is snapdragons secure enclave as good as Titan M?
01:15:33 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Just thought, that besides properly modem isolation and secure boot, what is most Android OEMs mising to be as secure as Pixel devices?
01:17:03 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> If fairphone for example got faster updates and properly secure boot, what makes it different from a Pixel device?
01:22:04 <strcat> no the SPU is not competitive with the Titan M
01:22:15 <strcat> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: what about all the other issues with it?
01:23:14 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <strcat "yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: what about a"> Would you mind mentioning some of them?
01:23:27 <strcat> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: device support section in FAQ already covers a fair bit
01:24:39 <strcat> firmware / hardware security does not come down to those 2 things, sorry
01:24:42 <strcat> it's a broad topic
01:31:29 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <strcat "firmware / hardware security doe"> Yeah, I read the FAQ. I see there is a lot, which fairphone might not succeed at, as they're to small a company to make a properly secure phone. They can't even keep up with the software updates.
01:32:58 <strcat> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: when basic security features are missing and it's apparent on a surface level
01:33:05 <strcat> that's a strong indication of much deeper issues
01:33:10 <strcat> it's a lot of work to do this all properly
01:33:30 <strcat> and doing it properly is different from making something competing with a phone going above and beyond what the baseline is
01:37:06 <strcat[m]> it's actually hard to understand how companies can struggle so much to ship the security updates
01:37:39 <strcat[m]> keep in mind monthly security updates are substantially fewer changes than the AOSP monthly updates which have other bug fixes and improvements, and fairly substantial changes in the quarterly releases like this one
01:38:37 <TheJollyRoger> Wow, yikes.
01:39:07 <Thatcher[m]> On the subject of updates, when a Graphene updateis available, will a message pop up on my phone telling me about a new update?
01:39:26 <hypokeimenon[m]> Not to get too political but wherever corners can be cut, resources siphoned and belts tightened to ship a product that nets the best margins- that's what will happen.
01:39:36 <TheJollyRoger> Thatcher[m]: yes. You'll see a little icon with a down arrow in the bar, when your phone begins downloading updates.
01:39:38 <strcat[m]> Thatcher: it checks around every 4 hours
01:39:56 <strcat[m]> Thatcher: https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
01:40:02 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
01:40:03 <hypokeimenon[m]> It won't change until every tom, dick and harry complains about it via the most appropriately visible channels.
01:40:37 <TheJollyRoger> Thatcher[m]: if you want, you can set your update client to only download on "unmetered" connections, if you're in the same boat I am and you don't get a very good data allotment at the start of every month, but you do have access to wifi at home.
01:42:26 <Thatcher[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Thatcher: if you want, you can s"> So unmetered generally implies wifi?
01:42:32 <Thatcher[m]> That ia good
01:42:44 <Thatcher[m]> My data plan with Tmobile really sucks
01:43:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> Billions of Android phones live in the wild and only a few lines that barely make up the fingers on a typical human hand meet the minimum reference for security. I'm pretty sure anyone who cared would think that was laughable.
01:43:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:44:25 <strcat> Thatcher[m]: if you actually stay up to date the updates are pretty small
01:44:34 <strcat> if you don't miss an update you always get incrementals
01:45:17 <strcat> sometimes when a release shortly follows another there are 2 incrementals (past 2 releases to current) but usually just 1
01:45:20 <strcat> -rw-r--r-- 1 strcat strcat  49M Nov 28 07:50 coral-incremental-2020.11.05.18-2020.11.27.15.zip

01:46:23 <Thatcher[m]> Wow
01:46:29 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like even I and my 500 megabytes a month might not even need to set to unmetered then!
01:46:49 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: depends
01:46:56 <strcat> the major Chromium updates are pretty big deltas
01:47:02 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
01:47:03 <strcat> 100MB or so
01:47:07 <strcat> every 6 weeks
01:47:08 <TheJollyRoger> o.O Oh.
01:47:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ack!
01:47:16 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like I'll keep it on unmetered then...
01:47:20 <Thatcher[m]> Then I should not have to worry about setting permitted networks to 'any' in update preferences
01:47:27 <strcat> this is a quarterly release so the deltas for this one are probably larger than usual
01:50:12 <brenneke[m]> What is the recommended way to update Auditor on Pixel 2XL after this update? (assuming this phone will not get an update?
01:50:48 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: the easiest way would be to go to github directly and download the .apk from there. It's already signed and verified, so you can just download it.
01:50:58 <Thatcher[m]> When an update downloads and initiates, will it ask me to restart my phone, or is it just automatic?
01:51:12 <TheJollyRoger> Thatcher[m]: you can choose either one, as according to your preference!
01:51:59 <TheJollyRoger> Thatcher[m] head to System Update Settings, and the last line should have an "Automatic reboot" (OFF/ON) toggle.
01:52:23 <Thatcher[m]> Awesome!
01:52:32 <TheJollyRoger> By default, it's in the off position and it will prompt you to restart after the update has been downloaded. You can toggle it on if you want it to be more transparent.
01:55:42 <strcat> brenneke[m]: you can just install it from github
01:55:49 <strcat> brenneke[m]: supposedly there is another upstream Pixel 2 update
01:56:14 <strcat> haven't dropped all the code for it yet since we might be able to do a December release and then a partial January one
02:01:45 <TheJollyRoger> The "Fond farewell!" to the Pixel 2!
02:03:06 <TheJollyRoger> I wonder if there's a way to include some kind of warning in the final release that the phone will no longer get updates and that the users should migrate to a newer device as quickly as possible.
02:03:38 <DougFire> Hi, maybe someone has suggestions for how to fix this issue. Running graphene on pixel3, recently stopped receiving notifications for messenger and phone (missed call and voicemail). I have tried accessing control of notifications in both apps and in both access to work with notifications is denied. Thank you
02:03:39 <TheJollyRoger> I think the Original Pixel 1 had this, dunno how difficult it would be to do that for the 2 since it looks like they were warning about that the update before when the last update shipped.
02:03:46 <louipc> release notes
02:03:55 <TheJollyRoger> louipc: oh. I see.
02:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> DougFire: huh, very strange. Let me make a call to my own Pixel 3 and see if I can reproduce the issue.
02:04:59 * TheJollyRoger hangs up after hearing the ringback.
02:05:13 <TheJollyRoger> I'm getting missed call notifications, let me try voicemail.
02:06:34 <TheJollyRoger> DougFire: er, allow notifications?
02:07:19 <TheJollyRoger> Set it to all allow?
02:10:56 <brenneke[m]> OK nice thanks.
02:10:56 <brenneke[m]> How long should it take before a device shows up in Device integrity monitoring at https://attestation.app?
02:10:56 <brenneke[m]> Two phones showing but third is not.....have disabled and re-enabled remote verification, still not there on day 2.
02:11:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hey brenneke[m], I've noticed this too. I found that the second device doesn't seem to appear. Want me to check the issue tracker/bug reports?
02:13:03 <DougFire> sorry to be such a pain but I'm not seeing that option in apps&notifications. When I go into each of the apps, via app info>notifications the buttons are grey and unable to be clicked on
02:13:21 <brenneke[m]> Sure, please!
02:25:10 <TheJollyRoger> DougFire: the one at the top, is that set to on or off?
02:26:13 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, looks like it's set to "permanently on" for me too. Strange. I don't know how you were able to toggle any of it off...?
02:27:10 <DougFire> yes, it's set to permanently on but I'm no longer receiving the notifications
02:28:52 <TheJollyRoger> o.O. That is so bizarre!
02:29:42 <DougFire> I know! it's quite frustrating tbh.
02:29:51 <DougFire> thanks for trying to assist!
02:30:34 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome! Hope it'll work out!
02:30:52 <DougFire> if it doesn't, I'll try reloading the OS. thanks again!
02:38:03 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: I don't see it here, so I'm going to file an issue with "enhancement" and see what we get.
02:38:15 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wait wait wait a minute.
02:38:20 * TheJollyRoger decides to look at closed issues.
02:50:01 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. Looks like I'll have to ask about this. I got some lurking impressions that attestation server supported only one device at a time, but maybe it's a bug. I'll ask before I open.
02:54:40 <cyborgninjaneer[> I've got a couple of Verizon pixel 1s, carrier unlocked but the bootloader are still shackled. I'm going to try to hack them with the new exploit from xda and install GrapheneOS. They won't be terribly secure since they're so far out of date, but at least I can remove the Google infection. A family member needs a temporary phone and doesn't really do web browsing with it.
02:55:13 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Huh. Looks like I'll have to ask"> I have two reporting but not the third.
02:55:22 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Oh huh, weird.
02:55:28 <TheJollyRoger> gonna file the issue then.
02:56:49 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wait.
02:56:53 <TheJollyRoger> Er, let me check back...
02:57:01 <TheJollyRoger> Before I hit file...
02:57:12 <TheJollyRoger> Going to go and check back and see if my P4 appears now.
02:58:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I see it. Huh. It looks like its verified time is much later than I thought I first checked it in.
02:58:12 <TheJollyRoger> Weird.
03:06:53 <brenneke[m]> Maybe I'll just do remote on my 4a and manually check the 2XLs every now and again.
03:11:04 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
03:16:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> Purely out of curiosity, what sort of work could be done to further harden GrapheneOS against local exploits like lock screen bypass?
03:30:26 <TheJollyRoger> cyborgninjaneer[: I have no idea, I don't know how to program at this moment although I've been trying to learn.
03:49:10 <louipc> programming is just a tool
03:50:26 <louipc> hardening stuff is a different skill
03:52:14 <louipc> cyborgninjaneer[: how about 2fa unlock :p
04:04:49 <rny> maybe a funky gesture for single-factor and normal use prompts 2FA
04:04:52 <rny> kek
04:05:14 <rny> like holding the phone upside down when unlocking 1FA is enough, but if you do it normally, it asks for 2FA
05:55:34 <Vappy[m]> Hello
06:06:34 <M86ul[m]> Good morning to you'll from Europe. I am doubting between GrapheneOS, LineageOS, and /e/ for my FairPhone. What is the reason that you choose GrapheneOS?
06:10:55 <lolrepeatlol[m]> afaik grapheneos is for those who care most about security
06:11:25 <lolrepeatlol[m]> if you’re looking for the most security possible, with super good app sandboxing, graphene is the one
06:12:14 <somenerd[m]> both /e/ and Lineage decrease the security of the device
06:12:23 <lolrepeatlol[m]> the issue is that it lacks compatibility with certain apps because there is no google play services or any google play services replacement, /e/ does have a google play services replacement which is FOSS and works decently well from what I’ve heard
06:12:53 <somenerd[m]> MicroG
06:12:59 <somenerd[m]> lineage has it as well
06:13:06 <somenerd[m]> but both aren't secure
06:13:06 <lolrepeatlol[m]> <somenerd[m] "both /e/ and Lineage decrease th"> wait really? doesn’t graphene have verified boot though? so what does it lack security wise?
06:13:24 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS increases the security
06:13:30 <somenerd[m]> I meant the other 2
06:13:42 <lolrepeatlol[m]> yeah lineage and /e/ don’t really care about security at all
06:14:00 <lolrepeatlol[m]> oh hahaha yeah then i understand
06:14:10 <somenerd[m]> yeah
06:14:51 <lolrepeatlol[m]> personally i’m aiming to go for a pixel with calyxos since it is supposed to offer a good middle ground from what i’ve heard (in case you’re still looking for a phone and haven’t bought the fairphone yet)
06:17:04 <lolrepeatlol[m]> if you’d like to see which apps work without play services or which apps work with the play services replacement called microG, you can check https://plexus.techlore.tech/ (seems like it’s down right now though?)
06:19:25 <lolrepeatlol[m]> 86ul: ^
06:20:32 <lolrepeatlol[m]> wait does graphene even exist for fairphones? lol
06:20:49 <somenerd[m]> it doesn't
06:21:19 <lolrepeatlol[m]> yeah so then I’d go for /e/
06:21:38 <lolrepeatlol[m]> i know /e/ exists on those
06:21:58 <somenerd[m]> / /e/'s not that good
06:21:58 <somenerd[m]>  * /e/'s not that good
06:22:02 <lolrepeatlol[m]> oh really
06:22:15 <somenerd[m]> there was a link or something
06:22:19 <somenerd[m]> bit offtopic though
06:22:53 <lolrepeatlol[m]> haha yeah sorry
06:23:12 <M86ul[m]> <somenerd[m] "both /e/ and Lineage decrease th"> Like?
06:23:23 <somenerd[m]> no verified boot
06:23:38 <somenerd[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/android.html#custom-roms
06:23:42 <somenerd[m]> this may help as well
06:23:44 <M86ul[m]> <somenerd[m] "but both aren't secure"> Like?
06:24:00 <somenerd[m]> check the link I gave
06:24:30 <M86ul[m]> Thanks
06:26:30 <M86ul[m]> <lolrepeatlol[m] "wait does graphene even exist fo"> I really do not know it, still doubting and gathering info...
06:27:19 <somenerd[m]> it doesn't
06:27:32 <somenerd[m]> you might be able to build it though
06:29:16 <M86ul[m]> Oke, but as a non-ITer, I would have to learn by practice, which I like to do that way, but I have other priorities. So, if GrapheneOS is there not yet for a FairPhone, than it is very simple for me...
06:32:45 <somenerd[m]> still wouldn't be as secure as the official version
06:32:51 <somenerd[m]>  * still, it wouldn't be as secure as the official version
06:34:24 <M86ul[m]> Privacy is not my main issue, but it do follows out of my main concern: Federated and selfowning my own stuff...
06:36:03 <M86ul[m]> So, it is for me a less problem when the OS is not highly secure, but unfederated and not owning it is a big problem for me.
06:37:31 <M86ul[m]> To put it all in a bigger picture: The Ancient Regime is just replaced with Courant Regime (present government) In turns is in a fight with the Digital Regime (Google, Microsoft a d suchs).
06:37:54 <M86ul[m]> But that is off topic, I know...
06:45:40 <TheJollyRoger> M86ul[m]: with respect to security, the brief answer is that LineageOS and /e/ both lag far behind even factory Android, in some cases more than 5+ years of continual advancements. I'll give you a simple and basic example:
06:46:11 <TheJollyRoger> Around Android 7.0, enforcement of Android Verified Boot became *mandatory* by the Android specification, meaning that handsets that shipped with Android 7 needed to support verified boot;
06:47:05 <TheJollyRoger> Let's take an example: let's say, for one reason or another, Mallory (this is a stand-in name I use for an adversary) has discovered an exploit for your phone or has found a vulnerability that allows him to modify the persistent system partition.
06:47:53 <TheJollyRoger> At this point, Mallory can choose to modify your kernel at will, and this means doing some stuff like being able to change your operating system's mandatory access or security policies however he pleases.
06:48:10 <M86ul[m]> So, it would be better to learn to port GrapheneOS to FairPhone, than using Q and suchs?
06:48:25 <TheJollyRoger> On any handset that shipped with and enforces Verified Boot, you've got a defense against that.
06:48:50 <M86ul[m]> Or to learn how to verify my /e/ boot?
06:49:48 <TheJollyRoger> On those phones, Verified Boot is run at the late-stage qualcomm bootloader (which, while it's signed and verified, I believe is open source). The late stage bootloader then checks the signatures for the system partition. It must be bitwise identical to the image that the developer released. If tampering is detected and it doesn't match the developer's signature, the bootloader will attempt to
06:49:49 <TheJollyRoger> repair it to a state where it passes validation, or it will stop your phone from booting.
06:50:22 <TheJollyRoger> This may be inconvenient, but what would you rather have - a phone that happily lets you use a phone that is now compromised and is now actively malicious, or a phone that says STOP! Don't use me, I've been compromised?
06:50:41 <TheJollyRoger> M86ul[m]: It's a bit more complex than "port it to my phone" --
06:51:05 <TheJollyRoger> It's not your job to do bootloader security. It's your OEM's and your vendor's.
06:51:42 <TheJollyRoger> Fairphone if I recall correctly doesn't support this, nor do they support user provisioning of the verified  boot keys.
06:51:55 <TheJollyRoger> So this means the handset itself doesn't support verified boot.
06:52:22 <M86ul[m]> Ke, thanks. Still diving in the IT world as some who's focusing on Art
06:52:33 <TheJollyRoger> OEMs like Google actually have to pay qualcomm *extra* to have Qualcomm allow them to do user-provisionable verified boot keying.
06:53:24 <TheJollyRoger> This is why at this moment, GrapheneOS mainly prefers the Pixels, because no other vendor has been as forthcoming with support. For instance, Samsung will not allow you to rekey the bootloader, and unlocking the bootloader will burn out a fuse that will permanently disable a number of the bootloader security features on that handset.
06:54:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hey, welcome to the field. I'm actually not a computer guy either, it's just something I picked up a bit as a hobby, I'd like to learn to program someday and figure this out for myself.
06:56:03 <TheJollyRoger> M86ul[m]: There are several reasons that LineageOS and /e/ do not allow for locking of the bootloader, but one of them is that for LineageOS and /e/, they want to cater to the crowds of "power users" that want to play system administrator with their phone.
06:57:04 <TheJollyRoger> So as a result they reduce the restrictiveness of their security policies, as well use debug builds, allow app-accessible root, and often don't bother with verified boot so that way you can make changes to your system partition at will, run root, and more or less do the thing that power users tend to enjoy doing.
06:57:48 <TheJollyRoger> Again, very different goal from what GrapheneOS strives to accomplish: GrapheneOS prefers to have *more* restrictive security policies to confine, sandbox, and contain the apps as well as mitigate and prevent exploits, before they turn into vulnerabilities.
06:59:39 <M86ul[m]> Is there a virtual machine for Linux Mint and/or NixOS, where I can try these three mobile OS's?
07:00:14 <M86ul[m]> Thanks for the extra info, TheJollyRoger
07:00:27 <TheJollyRoger> The second thing is that LineageOS and /e/ also don't do full production builds. Essentially, it's a bit of a free-for-all. There's no production quality releases, and device support is largely going to vary by whoever chooses to maintain the device. There aren't any OTA updates, because they use userdebug builds, which aren't meant for production use, only debugging and testing.
07:01:29 <TheJollyRoger> M86ul[m]: if you're interested, I know that GrapheneOS will compile for and build and run in the Android Studio emulator, however you're going to be on your own for building the OS yourself. I unfortunately can provide very little help there, and unfortunately the emulator is only intended for testing and debugging, it's not actually for production use.
07:03:02 <TheJollyRoger> So you won't be getting any of the hardware security features that makes GrapheneOS so secure, and you're also going to be running it within a desktop environment -- with all the risks and vulnerabilities thereof of a perimeter-based security model (the desktop assumes that anything the user does, should have access to everything the user has. Yes, this includes the JavaScript from any
07:03:03 <TheJollyRoger> random-ass sites you've visited in your browser if your browser ever gets exploited.)
07:04:19 <TheJollyRoger> M86ul[m]: anytime! I have to head off soon, but do you have any other questions you'd like to ask me? I can try to answer some general questions, or try to point you in the right direction, or if I can't answer, defer you to hopefully someone else in this channel who can.
07:06:43 <M86ul[m]> <M86ul[m] "To put it all in a bigger pictur"> Nope, not for now, thanksTheJollyRoger . At this moment I am still writing an essay about this for a course that I follow at my university...
07:07:02 <M86ul[m]> *thanks TheJollyRoger
07:07:37 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, best of luck!
07:07:49 <cyborgninjaneer[> Build-your-own GrapheneOS is also good as a very clean Google-free Android distro, IMO.
07:07:50 <TheJollyRoger> Ye be welcome!
07:09:18 <TheJollyRoger> cyborgninjaneer[: I don't like saying this, but why on earth would you do that? Unless you really know what you are doing, can manage your own keys and your own infrastructure, and have enough time and diligence and expertise to be able to do that all sanely and actually understand the choices you're going to make and the rationale behind them, you're probably better off just going with

08:17:41 <gon[m]> How can i put searx as search engine in vanadium?
08:20:30 <mistazaki[m]> Hi, want ask. What happen or what effect if i deny network permission Vanadium Webview? Or deny Sensors permission?
08:27:47 <Lia[m]> <mistazaki[m] "Hi, want ask. What happen or wha"> Sensor permission has no effect, Network permission may cause apps using webview to not render its content
08:27:48 <Lia[m]> <gon[m] "How can i put searx as search en"> You can't
08:27:57 <Lia[m]> Unless you build your own Vanadium with different package name
08:28:10 <Lia[m]> (And different search engine sets))
08:30:58 <mistazaki[m]> <Lia[m] "Sensor permission has no effect,"> To this day I still not understand what a sensor is. Sorry.
08:33:53 <eenno[m]> <mistazaki[m] "Hi, want ask. What happen or wha"> Like Lia said. When I disabled it. After a reboot a lot of apps depending on webview started crashing. So I wouldn't recommend it.
09:49:53 <Dylanger[m]> Anyone tried 2020.12.08.08 yet?
10:01:40 <Wonderfall[m]> <Lia[m] "You can't"> Actually you can, and I have it set by default using a nightly build of Searx. Should be something related to OpenSearch and it has been fixed 2-3 months ago I think. Once you make a search it should appear as a suggestion in search engine settings.
10:08:43 <arpysco[m]> I tried that earlier with the one of the public searx instances, didn't work for me
10:17:05 <vsinghsanwal[m]> <eenno[m] "Like Lia said. When I disabled i"> Did your apps start crashing upon denying the sensors permission or the network permission?
10:25:51 <somenerd[m]> network
10:26:09 <somenerd[m]> since the webview is what apps use to render content
10:26:17 <somenerd[m]>  * since the webview is what apps use to render web content
10:26:28 <somenerd[m]> they need the network permission to access it
10:26:42 <strcat[m]> think you're misunderstanding how that works with the WebView
10:26:53 <strcat[m]> it's the app that's using the WebView that needs the INTERNET permission
10:27:16 <strcat[m]> to use it to access the network
10:27:32 <somenerd[m]> ohhhhh I see
10:28:24 <somenerd[m]> So the Vanadium WebView doesn't need the INTERNET permission?
10:30:37 <strcat[m]> look, if apps in the base OS didn't need permissions
10:30:38 <strcat[m]> they would be removed there
10:30:41 <strcat[m]> you're just misunderstanding how things work
10:31:29 <strcat[m]> the WebView is a library, only the isolated renderers actually run as WebView isolated app processes
10:31:31 <strcat[m]> they don't have network access
10:31:43 <strcat[m]> you're misunderstanding how this works and why the permissions are there
10:32:22 <strcat[m]> if an app doesn't have network access then the broker it runs for the WebView can't access the network, so the WebView inherently can't either
10:35:05 <strcat[m]> somenerd: I can't understand why you're claiming anything started crashing when you did that
10:35:08 <strcat[m]> probably not what you did that caused it
10:35:19 <somenerd[m]> I actually didn't
10:35:27 <somenerd[m]> I was paraphrasing the above messages
10:35:46 <somenerd[m]> > Sensor permission has no effect, Network permission may cause apps using webview to not render its content
10:35:47 <somenerd[m]> this one
10:38:20 <strcat> we don't use the WebView crash reporter
10:38:22 <strcat> or variations
10:38:35 <strcat> so I don't think with how we have it set up right now it needs network access
10:39:51 <strcat> it doesn't make connections on behalf of other apps - it's a library
10:40:45 <strcat> we don't use crash reports / variations though
10:42:13 <strcat> there's a WebView developer UI for testing it, etc.
10:45:12 <Wonderfall[m]> <arpysco[m] "I tried that earlier with the on"> It isn't fixed yet in the latest stable release so that's probably why. Newer versions should fix it.
10:50:53 <madd_hatter[m]> How is the vanadium app to know phone orientation to switch between portait to landscape with sensors disabled?  Most every app usually has sensor permission from what I can tell.
10:53:40 <strcat[m]> madd_hatter: no, that's not how it works
10:53:55 <strcat[m]> apps don't need sensors permission for that, they don't measure screen rotation themselves
10:54:26 <strcat[m]> madd_hatter: you're misunderstanding the Sensors permission and why we have to assume apps need it
10:54:31 <strcat[m]> covered in our documentation
10:56:53 <strcat[m]> madd_hatter: the whole point of the permission we added is that it covers all sensors not already covered by other permissions (camera, microphone, body sensors, activity recognition) - since it doesn't exist in Android, apps don't declare they need it when they need those,. and they don't have code to request it
10:58:02 <strcat[m]> so we have to assume that every app might need it
10:58:03 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean they do
10:58:39 <strcat[m]> it's not the app asking for it, there is nothing they need to ask for on the platform they target
11:04:08 <strcat[m]> no sane app will be rolling their own screen rotation handling with sensors
11:04:10 <madd_hatter[m]> Ok that makes sense. Thank you for taking the time to explain.
11:04:10 <madd_hatter[m]>  I am a bit ignorant on how everything interacts.  But slowly learning..
11:04:15 <strcat[m]> we could stop automatically adding the sensors permission for system apps if we went through every single one and marked whether it needs sensors
11:04:16 <strcat[m]> but have to assume that third party apps need it
11:04:23 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 final possible security patch level is 2020-11-01 after all, like we already have
11:04:26 <strcat[m]> December update for them is just an extended support release like ours fixing some of what can still be fixed, it's not a December security update release
11:04:27 <strcat[m]> so Pixel 2 is officially dead now
11:04:36 <strcat[m]> I don't see a use for their extended support branch / tag
11:04:37 <Lia[m]> Apologies, got that mixed up with disabled webview, yeah
11:04:37 <Lia[m]> *looks at my phone's permission manager*
11:04:37 <Lia[m]> It should be fine to deny all permissions in webview
11:05:17 <strcat[m]> Lia: the reason WebView has INTERNET is for crash reporting, variations and maybe the developer UI
11:05:28 <strcat[m]> we don't use crash reporting / variations
11:05:56 <strcat[m]> but don't really want to remove INTERNET for it because it's harmless and it seems useful to be able to use whatever developer tools / UI it has
11:06:00 <strcat[m]> haven't looked at what that offers
13:03:04 <Golli[m]2> <strcat[m] "we could stop automatically addi"> You could have a default permissions system, where the user can set what they want newly installed apps to have by default? Or have a deny all by default option in the menu for newly installed apps.
13:04:30 <Lia[m]> Deny all is great, but is unsure how to implement it, so does granting by default on user apps
13:12:16 <mistazaki[m]> Hi, want tu know.. Im try disable all sensor apps.. After that, notification system client update appears and need reboot. so i rebooot. After reboot, im see there are some system apps installed, its normal?
13:20:25 <doobry[m]> When I still have settings open my last apps and I try to add a new word to my word list in the keyboard while typing, my phone always switches to the latest settings. Do others as well experience this bug?
13:26:13 <eenno[m]> <strcat[m] "somenerd: I can't understand why"> Sorry for this misunderstanding. I want to clarify that I remembered incorrectly and it happened when I disabled the browser completely (as I wasn't using it as my browser). So nothing to do with permissions. My bad.
13:40:03 <mrxx_0[m]> <mistazaki[m] "Hi, want tu know.. Im try disabl"> Can you give more explanation? Your message is not clear at all
14:04:31 <Lia[m]> <mistazaki[m] "Hi, want tu know.. Im try disabl"> Yeah, had the same here. Think those are theme overlay apks
14:04:49 <Lia[m]> Bunch of Kai, Amethyst, etc appeared, and proceeded to disabled its sensor permissions
14:05:58 <Lia[m]> It should be no-op due to GrapheneOS not having a theme option due to RRO incompability with exec-spawning.
14:05:58 <Lia[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/133

19:42:02 <xztrop2[m]> Hi hi, I have a quick question. I recently did the install of grapheneos but haven't had a whole lot of time to set it up since then. I've heard several people say to get signal from the website instead of F-droid. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but when I try to do this it takes me to the google play store page. Noped outta there real quick. Can someone tell me 1. why it is better to get signal from their page, 2.
19:42:02 <xztrop2[m]> how to do this on grapheneos, and 3. if this is also the case for other apps like it, say telegram, for instance? Any help is much appreciated! Very new to all this

19:48:13 <xztrop2[m]> I take it you mean telegram
19:49:01 <xztrop2[m]> Could you expand on why not? I had thought the two were ranked similarly in terms of privacy and security
19:49:32 <AdamA7> Im getting stingrayed right now
19:49:39 <AdamA7> I normally have full bars LTE here
19:49:43 <AdamA7> But now I have no LTE
19:49:54 <AdamA7> ITs the FBi trying to jam LTE, ot force my phone onto isecure 2G
19:50:29 <AdamA7> Its called a IMSI Catcher DownGrade Attack
19:50:40 <AdamA7> Jam the more secure LTE/4G/3G, only allow 2G which can be intercepted easily
19:51:03 <AdamA7> I just got my new phone and its already getting hacked thanks to my connections to Edward Snowden
19:51:05 <AdamA7> Great =)
19:51:20 <Kurai> did you notice any black van outside your house recently?
19:51:25 <AdamA7> Yes
19:51:27 <AdamA7> A white van
19:51:36 <AdamA7> Plain white van on my country road
19:51:47 <AdamA7> At the same time the Van arrived, my LTE jammed and stopped working

23:07:16 <Adam1226A> How do I download Firefox on GOS? Or is Degoogled Chromium Good enough?
23:08:11 <TheJollyRoger> Adam1226A: just use Vanadium. You should avoid Firefox on mobile, it's not nearly as secure.
23:08:16 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
23:17:09 <TheJollyRoger> As for the other apps, as I said before, you'll need to source them from upstream, or use the Aurora Droid store, or obtain FDroid from F-Droid.org, should you want it.
23:18:15 <Adam1226A> Does Vanadium use Sandboxing
23:18:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, of course.
23:18:46 <TheJollyRoger> Firefox doesn't.
23:19:04 <Adam1226A> "Chromium-based browsers like Vanadium and Bromite provide the strongest sandbox implementation"
23:19:12 <Adam1226A> Does Tor Browser, Linux Desktop have any sandboxing?

23:19:57 <Adam1226A> Also I only asked 1 question
23:20:00 <Adam1226A> What are you answering
23:20:07 <Adam1226A> Does Tor Browser, Linux Desktop have any sandboxing?
23:20:15 <Adam1226A> Tor Browser should have some FireFox powered sandboxing, ideally
23:20:39 <TheJollyRoger> "No and no" as in "Tor Browser does not have sandboxing" and "the Linux desktop does not have sandboxing; everything you run as that user account is fully trusted with everything in that user account."
23:20:58 <Adam1226A> Wow
23:21:09 <Adam1226A> Tor Browser should have Chromium-Level Sandboxing
23:21:18 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, no, that wasn't me. The name "Jolly Roger" is a very common name: there are about five different people with some variant of the nickname "Jolly Roger" on Freenode - I often get mistaken for the one that livestreams Rocket League.
23:21:24 <strcat[m]> Adam1226A: read https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
23:21:36 <Adam1226A> So Tor Browser, one of the most targed for exploitation Browsers, doest have 'any' sandboxing at all?
23:21:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, Adam1226A please read the website thoroughly, many of your questions will be answered there.
23:21:52 <strcat[m]> Adam1226A: correct, for mobile
23:22:03 <Adam1226A> What about Linux Desktop Tor Browser?
23:22:05 <TheJollyRoger> Nope, it really doesn't. On Android, Firefox just simply takes an "all your eggs in one basket" approach.
23:22:08 <strcat[m]> it has a weak sandbox on desktop which doesn't protect renderers from each other
23:22:20 <Adam1226A> Does Linux Firefox have any sandboxing
23:22:23 <strcat[m]> only content as a whole from the rest of the system (to a lesser extent than Chromium though)
23:22:39 <TheJollyRoger> Technically yes, but it's extremely weak and mostly there for show.
23:22:45 <strcat[m]> Adam1226A: weak sandbox not protecting sites from each other (one site compromising a renderer can get all browser data and mess with other sites)
23:22:49 <Adam1226A> Wow...
23:22:56 <strcat[m]> and also on Linux, major issues with it in general
23:23:00 <Adam1226A> Tor Browser should be using the most hardened sandboxing aviable
23:23:12 <Adam1226A> Which Linux Distros/Configuration settings do you reccomend for maximum security
23:23:19 <strcat[m]> Firefox has a basic sandbox for protecting the system from the browser (but not sites from each other) on Windows
23:23:26 <Adam1226A> Nice
23:23:31 <strcat[m]> the implementation on Linux is much weaker and has serious holes
23:23:33 <Adam1226A> I use Trisquel Linux, based upon Ubuntu
23:23:37 <Adam1226A> Great..
23:23:47 <Adam1226A> And use Mozilla Firefox Linux, with Ublock origin
23:23:50 <Adam1226A> UFW Firewall on OS
23:23:57 <strcat[m]> protecting sites from each other (and your browser data) is very important and not covered by it
23:24:21 <TheJollyRoger> Adam1226A: consider installing Arch. It's at the very least up to date with upstream.
23:24:26 <Adam1226A> Nice
23:24:39 <Adam1226A> Any other security settings I should use, on any/all Linux Distros?
23:24:43 <Adam1226A> Such as UFW Firewall enabled
23:24:48 <TheJollyRoger> Either that, or Fedora.
23:24:56 <Adam1226A> Fedora, why ?
23:24:59 <TheJollyRoger> So you're not getting a fork, of a fork, of a fork, of old frankensoftware that's been kludged together.
23:25:05 <Adam1226A> Nice!
23:25:12 <Adam1226A> What do you think of Ubuntu, Mint, or Debian?
23:25:41 <TheJollyRoger> I think you should get off those as quickly as possible.
23:25:46 <Adam1226A> Hmm why?
23:25:50 <TheJollyRoger> The reasons why I suggest Fedora are simple:
23:26:19 <TheJollyRoger> Actually, let's take this to offtopic.
23:26:29 <TheJollyRoger> I'll wait for you there.
23:26:33 <TheJollyRoger> Ping me when you get there.
23:27:47 <Adam1226A> Im there
23:35:15 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: see PM about something btw
23:44:20 <Adan18285> "Donate to Graphene OS"!
23:57:02 <digiscales[m]> When is next update due to show up on phone? I'm new user am I right a new release has been completed? but not yet showing on software update in settings?
