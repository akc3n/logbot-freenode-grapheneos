00:03:07 <bypassbobby[m]> Hello people. Does anyone know how to screen mirror on graphene? Any recommended apps?
00:03:13 <bypassbobby[m]> Is it possible?
00:05:32 <EncryptedSnowsto> So does anyone know of an alternative Home Launcher that is, you know, privacy respecting?
00:06:00 <EncryptedSnowsto> The default one has basically no customization
00:07:41 <timeo[m]> Hey. I just want say a huge thanks to the devs and commmunity for making this rom :-}
00:07:46 <hasnoname[m]> <EncryptedSnowsto "So does anyone know of an altern"> Lawnchair2
00:08:12 <timeo[m]> And last happy new year to you all o/
00:26:07 <EncryptedSnowsto> > <EncryptedSnowstor
00:27:13 <EncryptedSnowsto> hasnoname on Fdroid it says "NOTE:'' This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived"
00:29:06 <hasnoname[m]> <EncryptedSnowsto "hasnoname on Fdroid it says "NOT"> Go for the one on Aurora. It says lawnchair2
00:31:21 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone screen mirror on graphene with success?
00:34:00 <EncryptedSnowsto> I said privacy respecting, this has google integration. And it hasn't been updated in a year
00:34:31 <EncryptedSnowsto> >Lawnchair has all the features of the Pixel Launcher (including the Google Feed)
00:40:21 <LinusSexTips[m]> whats wrong with the default launcher?
00:42:53 <usui> any news about pixel5?
00:44:17 <louipc> no
01:07:17 <EncryptedSnowsto> Linus it has practically zero customization
01:07:36 <EncryptedSnowsto> Unless I'm missing something
01:11:16 <LinusSexTips[m]> yeah that's true
01:11:24 <LinusSexTips[m]> I guess I prefer the simplicity
01:12:51 <grapheneos_user_> I love your username ;)
01:13:07 <goose1> I'm bootlooping :(!  I am trying to flash on a 3A and everything was going smoothly. flash-all exexecuted fine. afterwards I'm met with 'the bootloader is unlocked and software integrity may be available to attackers. Do not store any sensitive data on this device.' then it procedes bootlooping
01:14:06 <goose1> I should note that it seems to autoboot after flashing which is when I am prompted with that message. I haven't locked the bootloader at that point.
01:14:47 <goose1> I lock it after and try booting in but it just loops at that point. I start and the screen goes black for half a second before bringing me right back to the bootloader
01:18:15 <goose1> I am unable to poweroff from the bootloader interface either it brings me right back.
01:40:25 <strcat[m]> are you following https://grapheneos.org/install or an unofficial guide?
01:53:49 <goose1> im following the official guide
02:05:46 <ryley-coyote[m]> Two people named strcat in this room. One is the main developer; one is not. Is that funny or dumb? I'm not sure.
02:06:16 <goose1> it can be both :D
02:07:14 <sel[m]1> <ryley-coyote[m] "Two people named strcat in this "> Both of them are the same person
02:07:22 <sel[m]1> One is just connecting from IRC
02:10:25 <ryley-coyote[m]> Ooooohhh. Whoops. I'm the dumb one. Is that funny?
02:35:41 <retserwwer> hello
02:35:42 <retserwwer> lol
02:35:46 <goose1> hello
02:41:43 <dwkr[m]> hello
02:46:25 <louipc> hi
02:50:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <ryley-coyote[m] "Ooooohhh. Whoops. I'm the dumb o"> Yes.
02:55:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> fivndim3: This is going to sound stupid, but I've had this issue twice with Graphene on MVNOs (smaller carriers). After dicking with APN settings for weeks, I resolved by:
02:56:49 <DannyWorkOrderPr> 0) Figuring out some MVNOs require a new SIM for each unique phone, but don't advertise that...and many of their CSR aren't even aware. Got and registered a new SIM & 1) changed my Preferred Network Type, all good after that.
03:32:34 <dwkr[m]> fivndim3 I've been using Mint. No issues other than visual voice mail.
03:53:49 <strcat[m]> Our FAQ section on encryption now covers the standard delays for encryption key derivation enforced by the secure element:
03:53:49 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
03:55:02 <strcat[m]> should help address the common confusion caused by it only started to ramp up after the initial leeway it provides to make mistakes

04:04:06 <ayaen_t[m]> nice.
04:53:25 <hasnoname[m]> <EncryptedSnowsto ">Lawnchair has all the features "> Its a gsf independent app with no trackers and is oss. Those Google related stuff can be disabled and you can also cut the network to the app.
05:17:28 <sealteam420[m]> yo
05:18:11 <sealteam420[m]> I'm having some trouble with my pixel 3a. I flashed following the official guide and flash-all finished fine with no errors.
05:18:17 <sealteam420[m]> it seems I am now stuck in a bootloop
05:20:27 <sealteam420[m]> I should note that following the install it automatically started and I was prompted with a message that was a bootloader unlocked warning
05:20:40 <sealteam420[m]> I had not locked it yet because it automatically booted before I could
05:20:57 <sealteam420[m]> now I am stuck in a bootloop D:
05:21:56 <louipc> are you sure you flashed the right zip
05:34:13 <ayaen_t[m]> sealteam420 did you follow the guide here https://grapheneos.org/install
05:35:02 <sealteam420[m]> I did follow the official guide, yes.
05:36:04 <ayaen_t[m]> and you confirmed the name of the factory image ? sargo ?
05:43:10 <sealteam420[m]> Yeah its the right image
05:43:16 <sealteam420[m]> I confirmed and also redownloaded
05:43:19 <sealteam420[m]> try flashing again?
05:43:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> What was the command you used to flash?
05:43:59 <ayaen_t[m]> yes .
05:45:30 <ayaen_t[m]> sealteam420 it would be better if you followed the guide sealteam420 did you follow the guide here https://grapheneos.org/install as closely as possible .
05:45:30 <ayaen_t[m]> that guide is regularly used succesfully and tested
05:45:46 <sealteam420[m]> I followed the guide step by step
05:46:13 <sealteam420[m]> Everything worked fine. Brand new device. Just serviced. Unlocked. Good quality cable
05:46:38 <sealteam420[m]> i ran flash_all.sh
05:46:58 <ayaen_t[m]> show how you typed it.
05:47:09 <ayaen_t[m]> if you could , please.
05:47:20 <strcat[m]> sealteam420: can you try again and show the output from it
05:47:29 <ayaen_t[m]> yes
05:47:30 <strcat[m]> should have a bunch of output throughout the flashing process
05:48:34 <sealteam420[m]> while in the directory I ran ./flash_all.sh
05:49:01 <sealteam420[m]> Sure
05:51:28 <sealteam420[m]> im flashing again after redownloading the newest stable release and verifying it
05:51:49 <ayaen_t[m]> ok .
05:52:29 <sealteam420[m]> wtf im getting a new error i never had before
05:53:21 <ayaen_t[m]> could you get a screenshot and paste here or just copy paste some terminal output here ?

10:38:06 <pakoloko> Hi
10:38:46 <pakoloko> Is possible install grapheneos in pixel 5?
10:39:56 <pakoloko> I recently discovered grapheneos and I would like to try it ... if it is in pixel 5 I would buy a pixel 5.
10:41:42 <flabbergasted> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
10:41:48 <ayaen_t[m]> pakoloko: take a look here : https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
10:42:25 <pakoloko> I have a question that I have not found the answer anywhere. if the police or a person had physical access to the phone. Could you extract the data such as images, files etc ... or is it encrypted in some way that it would be impossible to extract anything?
10:46:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> pakoloko: as long as you have a lockscreen password set it should not be possible to extract anything

11:28:43 <ayaen_t[m]> nice.
12:49:38 <casaouuii[m]> I have a question, when u use grapheneos, how does it with carriet
12:49:52 <casaouuii[m]> Carrier
12:52:45 <ayaen_t[m]> casaouuii  i am not sure what you want to know  , which pixel do you use?
12:53:08 <casaouuii[m]> 4a
12:53:23 <casaouuii[m]> In terms of tracking and protection from ur carrier service
12:53:33 <casaouuii[m]> Like location and history of ur internet etc
12:53:37 <casaouuii[m]> Global question
12:54:43 <ayaen_t[m]> casaouuii:  https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode might be useful
12:56:41 <ayaen_t[m]> <casaouuii[m] "Like location and history of ur "> what i do is only open incognito tabs in vanadium and disable history and other settings that tends to store the state of the browser
12:57:51 <ayaen_t[m]> ofcourse its a pain to use the browser this way
12:58:42 <ayaen_t[m]> * what i do is only open incognito tabs in vanadium and disable history cookies  and other settings
12:59:46 <casaouuii[m]> But with vanadium is it really so secure as tor browser ?
12:59:51 <casaouuii[m]> And private
13:06:38 <dakotah[m]> It won't be more private if you use tor with tor browser. No clue about security. I think vanadium would be better there.
13:09:06 <ayaen_t[m]> casaouuii:  its recommended to use vanadium . but vanadium does not offer anonymity .
13:09:41 <ayaen_t[m]> tor browser offers anonymity . but is based on a less secure browser which is firefox
13:10:51 <ayaen_t[m]> but if you want privacy , disable third party cookies and all cookies whenever possible use ini incognito mode
13:12:30 <ayaen_t[m]> and other such settings which you find in vanadium
13:14:09 <ayaen_t[m]> you could use orbot in vpn mode too
13:14:22 <ayaen_t[m]> and use vanadium for browsing
13:15:23 <ayaen_t[m]> so you get good security and also anonymity thoigh it might effect the network  performance
13:15:45 <ayaen_t[m]> and orbot is not a perfect app
13:17:02 <ayaen_t[m]> but if  you use orbot then mind you even though you wont be recognized , your network activity kihht stand out as you are the only one likely to be using orbot with grapheneOS
13:18:26 <dakotah[m]> There are other vpns with tor services too. I have no clue how well those work.
13:19:11 <ayaen_t[m]> orbot is the most accesible thougb
13:19:38 <dakotah[m]> True
13:20:13 <ayaen_t[m]> and orbot is actually not a vpn provider afaik it uses the android vpn feature to route all traffic through the tor network
13:29:47 <justanotherlurke> I might join in and be the second person to use orbit with graphene. Doubling our anonymity. 😉
13:30:26 <justanotherlurke> And how about using the bromite browser?
13:31:16 <ayaen_t[m]> justanotherlurker https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
13:37:26 <justanotherlurke> <ayaen_t[m] "justanotherlurker https://graphe"> Thanks. Am actually just reading through the whole usage-page, before getting started with my recently set-up 4XL.

13:49:38 <joehandcockandja> * It explodes if you get the password wrong
13:51:27 <Liakdeuser[m]> <pakoloko "and how omerta phone differs fro"> It's specially (over)prized that you'd be better off getting 2 or more Pixels and flashing the images yourself for free

15:09:55 <causa-sui> hi, thoughts on using yalp/aurora store? it seems like the best way I've found to get updates to signal without using microG or such
15:14:05 <fomijafi[m]> <causa-sui "hi, thoughts on using yalp/auror"> You can download the signal apk right from their site which will prompt for updates
15:16:09 <causa-sui> ok thank you. I imagine with aurora/yalp, there are the inherent privacy concerns with connecting to google hosts, and also security risks associated with downloading closed-source apps. But do aurora/yalp themselves break the grapheneOS security model in any way (beyond that)?
15:23:26 <ayaen_t[m]> causa-sui:  aurora store is just an app. and is used by quiet some people here.and so im sure they do not have any 'grapheneos exploit' to break the security model and you sbould be able to use it quiet normally
15:24:33 <ayaen_t[m]> wether an app is closed source or open source matters only to a limited extent
15:25:21 <ayaen_t[m]> but do watch out for what all permissions an app asks for and try and cirreleate it with the functionalities it provides
15:26:16 <somenerd[m]> this link is quite helpful:https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
15:26:37 <somenerd[m]> also watch out for dangerous permissions like accessibility services
15:26:50 <ayaen_t[m]> always forget this link!
15:27:00 <somenerd[m]> and things like android version targeted
15:27:15 <somenerd[m]> (target SDK)
15:27:57 <causa-sui> this looks like a good resource, thank you. I will read it when I'm off work :)
15:28:01 <somenerd[m]> even though the app may be trusted with the permission (whichever one it is), it adds attack surface
15:28:38 <causa-sui> yes I had to do some research on why accessibility services is dangerous but I understand now, I don't need accessibility help so I will never grant that to anything
15:29:49 <causa-sui> ok thanks everyone, bye for now :)

17:31:28 <ayaen_t[m]> ok.
17:32:32 <ayaen_t[m]> i would do it myself but righnau the device  is not available
17:33:29 <justanotherlurke> That's kind of you, but I can do some further testing myself. Just thought somebody might have the official answer I could not find.
17:52:02 <justanotherlurke> In case this helps anybody at a later time:
17:52:02 <justanotherlurke> The adapter works if I remove the phone's cover, so that it can go in deep. A vfat-formatted stick was recognized without problems, exfat was not. Still need to find and test an ext4-stick.
17:53:14 <justanotherlurke> Follow-up-question: Would using an USB-stick then be the easiest way to exchange files between separate users on the same phone, if necessary?
18:06:35 <gorrin[m]> As I am following the GrapheneOS instructions, in Powershell I write the commands: fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
18:06:35 <gorrin[m]> Installed as /home/username/platform-tools/fastboot
18:06:35 <gorrin[m]> And Powershell states that the term "Installed" is not recognized as the name of a cmlet, function, script file, or operable program. Etc.
18:11:00 <fll[m]> gorrin: you should type only "fastboot --version" without " as command. What you wrote should be output of that command
18:14:28 <fll[m]> The text in between the commands is really important. You need to read it more carefully.
18:31:10 <gorrin[m]> I don't understand your explanation, does "without" have something to do here? I tried something else and now it gave me "'fastboot' is not recognized" etc. In general how should I write the code? The instructions all seem to be clear but it's still a bit confusing for someone who doesn't do that kind of stuff.
18:45:55 <ayaen_t[m]> gorrin:  in the powershell window just type
18:45:56 <ayaen_t[m]> fastboot --version
18:45:56 <ayaen_t[m]> without any changes
18:54:05 <ayaen_t[m]> you should get the out put as
18:54:05 <ayaen_t[m]> fastboot version xxxxyyyyy
18:54:05 <ayaen_t[m]> here xxxxxyyyyy will be the version number
19:03:43 <tuxabyte> Hi, I recently realized how important online privacy is for me and deciced to go all-in privacy. Unfortunately, I require Windows as my operating system for work. Luckily I was able to harden Windows 10 and make it work. There are a bunch of add-ons in Firefox for optimal privacy. Are browser extensions on Graphene OS not mandatory?  Would
19:03:43 <tuxabyte> installing FireFox over the default browser kill the purpose of GrapheneOS?
19:09:25 <jpds> tuxabyte: -> #grapheneos-offtopic
19:14:29 <tuxabyte> even on Windows?

19:57:22 <simpletech[m]> <tuxabyte "installing FireFox over the defa"> No. Why should it? Read: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
20:03:29 <ermalism> I'm getting errors compiling grapheneos for emulator based on the build documentation in the page
20:03:33 <ermalism> error: external/vixl/Android.bp:95:1: unrecognized module type "art_cc_defaults"
20:03:38 <ermalism> Any idea?
20:29:08 <ryley-coyote[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "https://grapheneos.org/usage#web"> I just read this and I'm switching from Firefox KLAR back to Vanadium. Thank you.
20:44:42 <cyber1863828> Hi
20:44:52 <cyber1863828> My battery is draining really fast
20:45:17 <cyber1863828> Im just using LTR, VPN and browsing with chromium
20:45:20 <cyber1863828> LTE
22:10:52 <EncryptedSnowsto> What phone, and how old is it
22:11:22 <EncryptedSnowsto> Are you sure the draining only started after you installed Graphene?
22:11:53 <EncryptedSnowsto> Oh wait the msg is old he's probably long gone

22:34:52 <strcat[m]> if you're building for a 32-bit target you'll need to build Vanadium first
22:34:57 <strcat[m]> not sure why you would be building for a 32-bit target
22:35:06 <strcat[m]> if you want to build for the emulator use x86_64 (or arm64 at least)
22:41:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: I wonder if 32-bit vanadium was even tested btw
22:41:25 <strcat[m]> we don't officially support 32-bit - doesn't really matter
22:41:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also it would make a lot of our security absolutely meaningless like the 64-bjt address space we use for our malloc
22:41:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Also it would make a lot of our security absolutely meaningless like the 64-bit address space we use for our malloc
22:42:00 <strcat[m]> a lot of security features are missing on the legacy architectures
22:42:01 <strcat[m]> not just ours
22:42:47 <strcat[m]> the only form of 32-bit support is for legacy apps via multiarch support
22:43:00 <strcat[m]> Vanadium WebView works fine for those - although the renderer is still 64-bit in the sandbox
22:43:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will we ever go 64-bit only, no legacy at all(
22:43:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Will we ever go 64-bit only, no legacy at all?
22:43:32 <strcat[m]> of course
22:43:40 <strcat[m]> already happening gradually anyway
22:43:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Exciting indeed
22:43:46 <strcat[m]> it's happening upstream
22:52:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: so is there any point beyond 64-bit?
22:52:21 <adjism> Nope, I just wanted to compile it for the emulator
22:52:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like maybe 128-bit
22:52:29 <adjism> I guess I put the wrong target
22:52:34 <adjism> aosp_arm
22:53:01 <adjism> which one can I put for the emulator, sdk_phone_x86_64 ?
22:53:13 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: for address space? no, not really, especially since it's far from a 64-bit address space right now
22:53:29 <strcat[m]> it's 48-bit max and as I've said before we can't enable that yet due to driver bugs which need to be resolved
22:53:33 <strcat[m]> don't have anyone working on that though
22:53:41 <strcat[m]> it's not exactly a high priority due to more serious issues
22:53:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: I guess we could store extra data in the upper bits
22:53:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> But kind of useless
22:53:59 <strcat[m]> that's what pointer authentication and MTE do
22:54:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmmm
22:54:16 <strcat[m]> and we need to implement MTE for hardened_malloc soon
22:54:21 <strcat[m]> since hardware will have it soon
22:54:31 <strcat[m]> it's an increasingly pressing thing
22:54:40 <strcat[m]> should already have someone working on that
22:54:56 <strcat[m]> can be developed with QEMU which supports MTE now
22:56:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah ok
22:56:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> I think it can be done yeah
