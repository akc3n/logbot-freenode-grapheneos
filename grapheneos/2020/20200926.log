00:40:02 <gabe[m]1> I have a question. I'm thinking about buying a pixel phone so I can use grapheneOS. I always here people say LineageOS isn't secure because you can't lock the bootloader or something like that. Can you lock the bootloader on GrapheneOS and if so, why can it be done on GrapheneOS, but not Lineage
00:40:32 <strcat[m]> LineageOS is off-topic for this channel
00:40:50 <strcat[m]> your questions about GrapheneOS are answered by the site
00:40:55 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/
00:41:50 <strcat[m]> read the main page and https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
00:42:20 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS starts from the baseline of providing the standard privacy and security features including all the hardware-based privacy and security features
00:43:04 <strcat[m]> it uses signed, production builds with a secure update client written for GrapheneOS and targets hardware where that is all possible
00:43:07 <strcat[m]> it's really all covered by the site
00:43:47 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS makes substantial changes to improve privacy and security, and as a rule it does not roll back privacy and security
00:44:17 <strcat[m]> and it will not target devices where we cannot provide the standard privacy and security features, we won't target devices where those are unavailable to an alternative OS
00:44:48 <strcat[m]> and of course we do things in a way that makes full use of them - the answer to your question is mostly that we AVOID making changes breaking the security model and we do proper production builds
00:45:31 <strcat[m]> if you want to ask about other OSes you'll need to do that somewhere else
01:03:30 <vata0[m]> Anyone have a pixel 3 xl that is compatible with Verizon they wanna sell
01:03:49 <strcat[m]> all Pixel 3 XLs are compatible with Verizon
01:03:59 <strcat[m]> you need to avoid Verizon model Pixels
01:04:10 <strcat[m]>  * all Pixels are compatible with Verizon
01:04:34 <bbqcore[m]> vata0: where are you located
01:04:38 <strcat[m]> the Verizon models are the only ones that don't support installing another OS
01:05:13 <bbqcore[m]> strcat: will be system accent color change hold after Android 11 upgrade?
01:05:25 <bbqcore[m]>  * strcat: will my system accent color change hold after Android 11 upgrade?
01:05:49 <bbqcore[m]> I managed to get it in while it was in Dev Options
01:05:54 <strcat[m]> don't know not a supported feature
01:22:53 <vata0[m]> strcat: so it‚Äôs literally just the Verizon specific models that are a problem.
01:23:18 <vata0[m]> strcat: all for them are gsm and cdma correct
01:23:41 <RippedJack[m]> Which is more privacy android or desktop?
01:24:06 <vata0[m]> Desktop-linux
01:24:16 <vata0[m]> Cubes or tali‚Äôs
01:24:44 <RippedJack[m]> Is it not a phone a AIO botnet?
01:24:50 <cn3m[m]1> off topic please go to the other chat
01:25:00 <cn3m[m]1> the off topic room
01:25:33 <vata0[m]> Has anything been said about a maintainer for the pixel 4a
01:26:17 <cn3m[m]1> no, but it is supported by AOSP Alliance and the kernel work is mostly done from Pixel 4
01:26:34 <cn3m[m]1> if someone wants to step up it would be the easiest phone to support
01:27:23 <vata0[m]> So would it be safe to say thet buying an unlocked version from Verizon and sitting on it for a bit is a safe bet because it will get support
01:27:43 <vata0[m]> * So would it be safe to say thet buying an unlocked version from google* and sitting on it for a bit is a safe bet because it will get support
01:28:11 <cn3m[m]1> don't buy from the verizon store, but from the google store
01:28:27 <cn3m[m]1> it is uncertain if the device will be supported
01:28:41 <cn3m[m]1> many developers rather focus on making GrapheneOS better
01:28:43 <vata0[m]> And if I knew even the slightest about doing any of this I would üíØ% be contributing to support
01:29:03 <cn3m[m]1> if you want to buy the phone just go for it
01:29:07 <cn3m[m]1> learn as you go
01:29:13 <cn3m[m]1> that is what 90% of people here idd
01:30:28 <vata0[m]> I wanted a 3xl but I came to late to the part to be able to get one from google and I‚Äôm having an extremely hard time finding one thet will work now since it‚Äôs hard to tell if they actually came
01:30:28 <vata0[m]> From google and are unlocked on eBay
01:30:43 <vata0[m]> Most sellers just know there ‚Äúfactory unlocked‚Äù and tents about it
01:30:44 <cn3m[m]1> swappa.com is what most people use
01:30:56 <cn3m[m]1> you can contact sellers too
01:31:01 <vata0[m]> * Most sellers just know there ‚Äúfactory unlocked‚Äù and that‚Äôs about it
01:31:20 <cn3m[m]1> 3 XL is on it's last year of support likely
01:31:32 <vata0[m]> What do you feel is a fair price for a 3xl in good condition
01:31:38 <vata0[m]> I know that‚Äôs subjective
01:33:00 <cn3m[m]1> idk
01:33:44 <vata0[m]> cn3m: what phone do you currently use
01:33:56 <cn3m[m]1> 3a XL
01:34:33 <cn3m[m]1> If I bought a phone today it would be 4 XL or XS
01:35:00 <vata0[m]> How‚Äôs performance
01:35:09 <cn3m[m]1> a ok
01:35:21 <cn3m[m]1> no real complaints
01:35:28 <vata0[m]> There a pixel 4 Xs?
01:35:32 <cn3m[m]1> eMMC isn't super fast, but it is fine
01:35:45 <cn3m[m]1> <vata0[m] "There a pixel 4 Xs?"> no separate phones
01:36:25 <vata0[m]> I‚Äôve been with Apple for years currently on a xr
01:37:19 <cn3m[m]1> I'd go 4 XL then if you want to upgrade. The XR is a solid phone
01:38:53 <vata0[m]> Yea. I don‚Äôt ah e any problems with It. It‚Äôs honestly been awesome. But it‚Äôs Apple. Which out the 2 major apple is the lesser of the evil. But I want to go more privacy oriented
01:39:06 <vata0[m]> That‚Äôs what starts my whole journey into all this
01:40:00 <vata0[m]> Also the 4xl is expensive
01:40:31 <vata0[m]> I can get a 4a 128 gig unlocked from google for 370 something. After tax
01:45:44 <nickcalyx[m]> yeah the 4a is a great value IMO
01:46:02 <nickcalyx[m]> and google's fabric case is really nice too
01:48:30 <vata0[m]> nickcalyx: yea I‚Äôve seriously just been considering getting one and sitting on it till it has support
05:00:40 <biotinker> So I'm trying to build the OS myself
05:00:50 <biotinker> For my pixel 4a, since there's no official version yet
05:01:02 <biotinker> i'm getting the following error:
05:01:08 <biotinker> FAILED: ninja: 'external/vanadium/prebuilt/arm/TrichromeLibrary.apk', needed by 'out/target/product/generic/obj/APPS/TrichromeLibrary_intermediates/package.apk', missing and no known rule to make it
05:01:34 <biotinker> There's an arm64 version of TrichromeLibrary.apk, but copying it to the needed location didn't do anything
05:01:41 <biotinker> has anyone seen this before/have ideas?
05:02:52 <biotinker> I was able to build calyxOS with no issues, but that's also on android 10, so it could be a graphene-specific thing, or a 10 -> 11 thing
05:06:52 <biotinker> Oh, never mind- the copy did work, there were just two very similar named packages, TrichromeLibrary and TrichromeChrome
05:07:04 <biotinker> I think the target arch just needs to be arm_64
05:41:05 <louipc> biotinker: if you plan to build regular updates yourself you could be the official maintainer
05:41:22 <biotinker> Hmmm...maybe
05:41:26 <louipc> new devices going forward will need maintainers
05:41:55 <biotinker> I wouldn't be neccessaily opposed.
05:42:34 <biotinker> I don't even know if the build will work yet- it's still compiling, and probably will be all night
05:43:04 <biotinker> Most of what I've done so far has really not been terribly hard
05:43:21 <biotinker> Which makes me concerned that maybe I'm missing something obvious, and I don't want to go make insecure builds for people
05:43:30 <louipc> yea. but thats part of the need too. for maintainers to work out device specific issues as they pop up
05:43:48 <biotinker> Good point
05:44:17 <louipc> and the other dev can focus on general and core features, issues
05:46:31 <biotinker> Again, I'm not opposed to that. The "me" part will be replaced with a small shell script as soon as I'm confident I've worked out the kinks
05:46:40 <biotinker> on my end anyway
05:46:49 <biotinker> and I can always troubleshoot
05:59:03 <louipc> sure
06:08:01 <strcat[m]> biotinker: sounds like you didn't do choosecombo in the shell you are using to build
06:08:07 <strcat[m]> you need the environment set up in the current shell
06:08:16 <strcat[m]> looks like you started trying to build the generic armv7 target
06:08:24 <strcat[m]> clear `out/` and start again
06:24:00 <biotinker> Oops
06:24:06 <biotinker> Yeah, I definitely missed that
06:24:24 <biotinker> Thanks! I will clear that and try again
06:25:42 <biotinker> Do I also need to redo vendor/android-prepare-vendor/execute-all.sh?
06:26:04 <biotinker> I would think no, but I'm not sure if anything from choosecombo gets used for that
06:35:59 <mastercakex[m]> Any security disadvantage for GrapheneOS running an outdated Android10 version?
06:36:00 <mastercakex[m]> Just wanted to make it clear whether GrapheneOS users are exposed to security issued untill Android 11 version is fully operating?
06:36:12 <mastercakex[m]> Not speaking features. Security only
06:37:01 <cn3m[m]1> mastercakex: the latest version of GrapheneOS is fine ^
06:37:04 <ruben_brusselma4> My guess is it's the opposite
06:37:23 <ruben_brusselma4> > mastercakex: the latest version of GrapheneOS is fine ^
06:37:23 <ruben_brusselma4> Yeah what he said
06:37:52 <ruben_brusselma4> There will definitely be bugs that have yet to be discovered on the new android 11
06:38:03 <mastercakex[m]> * Any security disadvantage for GrapheneOS running an outdated Android10 version?
06:38:03 <mastercakex[m]> Just wanted to make it clear whether GrapheneOS users are exposed to security issues untill Android 11 version is fully operating?
06:39:57 <mastercakex[m]> Bugs is a war never to be won.
06:47:42 <louipc> hmm I'd think they would backport security patches at least??
06:48:23 <louipc> mastercakex[m]: i dunno. figure out what is new about android 11 and extrapolate
07:45:41 <strcat[m]> mastercakex: the current GrapheneOS releases are based on Android 11
07:46:55 <strcat[m]> Android 10 is only 1 year old and the releases receive security updates for 3 years so that in itself would not be a problem simply for security updates
07:47:17 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS based on Android 10 is no longer developed and isn't what we make releases from though
07:47:33 <strcat[m]>  * Android 10 is only 1 year old and the major releases receive security updates for 3 years so that in itself would not be a problem simply for security updates
07:58:18 <strcat[m]> mastercakex: suggest reading the release notes for the 4 releases this month
08:08:04 <tamqcrg[m]> <dazinism "If you push that notification si"> Sorry, this sorted it, thank you!
08:32:35 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2020.09.25.00 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.25.00
08:33:19 <strcat[m]> testing some changes to the new update server deployment process so that's why it's taking longer than usual to be pushed out to beta
08:34:00 <JTL> Good work
08:34:36 <JTL> With regards to the update server changes, you mean improving the server deployment in a more automated way, or something else? (just curious)
08:35:37 <strcat[m]> changing the way it's automated and tested
08:35:51 <JTL> ah
08:36:26 <strcat[m]> it's not directly related to the move to a new update server but since I had to spin up a server and deploy to it I started working on it a bit
08:36:35 <JTL> Understandable
08:36:36 <JTL> > We're no longer going to be listing out restored past features in a separate section for the release notes.
08:36:38 <JTL> And what's the exact rationale behind this?
08:37:06 <strcat[m]> it's sometimes problematic to split it like that since features often change when they get restored
08:37:28 <JTL> fair
08:37:46 <strcat[m]> just going to try to note when something is a past feature in the normal changes list
08:38:06 <strcat[m]> for 10 -> 11, the only thing we haven't restored yet are the SELinux policy changes which we'll do next
08:38:53 <strcat[m]> didn't lose as much as usual partly due to not having as many invasive changes as in the past (since we were still reviving the project and there has been more focus on other things) + having a lot more help migrating
08:51:42 <strcat[m]> I haven't generated the deltas from the last stable release yet and will probably do that after I sleep after pushing it out to beta
08:52:39 <strcat[m]> so won't be pushed to stable until that's done
08:53:09 <strcat[m]> or could just skip deltas since it's a major release but I expect they're still 30% of the size

13:15:10 <yoda__1> around 50% it showed that.....  I didn't see 70, 80 90     may be it just went fast for that part
13:15:18 <yoda__1> now I reboot ¬ª? and it should be done ?
13:15:29 <nothankyou[m]> Yeah?
13:15:47 <yoda__1> booting up
13:16:14 <yoda__1> It says please insert Disk 1/13 of Windows 3.11 for Workgroup !!!
13:16:23 <yoda__1> joke
13:16:30 <nothankyou[m]> Lmao
13:16:32 <nothankyou[m]> Ok
13:16:44 <nothankyou[m]> Booting at Windows Phone
13:16:56 <yoda__1> once booted up I go in the about phone in setting and still see .13  sorry....
13:17:08 <nothankyou[m]> Quite odd
13:17:30 <nothankyou[m]> Guess it was not really pushed out, but maybe try testing the biometrics?
13:17:53 <nothankyou[m]> Does aegis or s.notes offer biometric protection?
13:18:20 <yoda__1> I come from the IOS world LOL  where do I goo for your biometric test ? LOL so sorry I can google
13:19:26 <yoda__1> googling LOL
13:20:11 <nothankyou[m]> Welp, install s.notes
13:20:15 <nothankyou[m]> Then put settibgs
13:20:26 <nothankyou[m]>  * Then go to settings
13:20:42 <nothankyou[m]> Then check for enable biometric lock if it's not greyed out
13:22:40 <yoda__1> I installed SNotes   your setting is within the app or I go in  Android Settings and try to find anything into the App setting about biometric (JUST DID AND do not see anything with that word)
13:23:08 * nothankyou[m] posted a file: com.standardnotes.apk (27128KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/the-apothecary.club/3462f7fea494545535a716d9c6d4989328b17cd0/com.standardnotes.apk >
13:23:25 <yoda__1> went in settings, App and notification and went into the SNote settings
13:24:51 <nothankyou[m]> Off topic, but it's more of open the app

13:27:11 <nothankyou[m]> At the settings when you swipe from the left
13:27:12 <yoda__1> I am in the app settings and do not see something with word biometric   Enable FingerPrint lock ?
13:27:28 <nothankyou[m]> Press settings!
13:27:33 <nothankyou[m]>  * Press settings?
13:27:34 <yoda__1> I did
13:27:36 <yoda__1>  I am there

13:28:11 <yoda__1> BTW If you tired to help a noobie, I won't be offended LOL
13:28:13 <nothankyou[m]> Is it greyed out like this?
13:28:45 <nothankyou[m]> Well, if it's greyed out. You are definitely in the same version
13:28:59 <nothankyou[m]> Otherwise, it maybe named in the same version but has changes?
13:29:20 <nothankyou[m]> If not, then it wasn't pushed yet, and was a placeholder
13:29:41 <yoda__1> weird I don,t see it at all... but I too the apk from Fdroid.
13:29:49 <yoda__1> I am version 3.0.17
13:30:25 <nothankyou[m]> I use the one from Aurora Droid?
13:30:28 <yoda__1> starting over with your apk
13:30:35 <nothankyou[m]>  * I use the one from Aurora Store?
13:31:33 <nothankyou[m]> Good luck ^^
13:33:24 <yoda__1> greyed out
13:33:38 <yoda__1> with the apk your provided me sorry...We didn't have the same version
13:34:03 <nothankyou[m]> Ok
13:34:06 <yoda__1> will wait a few days to see how it goes for other and for now will stay at .13
13:34:15 <yoda__1> Have a nice week end nothankyou[m]  and tks for your help
13:34:21 <nothankyou[m]> Not pushed out yet
13:34:27 <nothankyou[m]> Thanks for your input as well
13:34:48 <nothankyou[m]> A good learning experience for your side
13:35:24 <yoda__1> yes ( good learning exp...) LOL  I now understand... Ad for your not pushed yet, I will have to do another sideload ? Or now that I did it, I will just wait for some update ?
13:35:42 <yoda__1> was my last question LOL
13:35:51 <nothankyou[m]> I rather wait for the seamless update client to do its thing
13:36:08 <yoda__1> but I won't need to " reinstall" ?
13:36:17 <yoda__1> Wait, that I can do
13:36:20 <yoda__1> ;-)
13:36:34 <nothankyou[m]> But if you decide to sideload, you'd have to do it again
13:36:59 <yoda__1> ok
13:49:23 <christian-h> I just installed graphenos. Do you use the fdroid privilege extension? How would I install it? https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged/
13:53:41 <nothankyou[m]> No
13:53:48 <nothankyou[m]> For security reasons, and also licensing
13:54:15 <nothankyou[m]> Fdroid still uses v1
13:54:26 <nothankyou[m]> Which caused some fdroid-installed apps to be gone at A11
13:55:57 <christian-h> <nothankyou[m] "Which caused some fdroid-install"> Wait, if I install apps via fdroid they might be gone after graphenos updates to A11? What do you use to get apps?
13:57:21 <nothankyou[m]> Well, some of them that still uses v1 signature
13:57:59 <nothankyou[m]> Aurora Store, as the apps there are signed by v2/v3
13:58:11 <nothankyou[m]> (Or aurora droid with izzyondroid repo)
13:58:49 <Pinembour[m]> <nothankyou[m] "If not, then it wasn't pushed ye"> I sideloaded the update for taimen, I'm now on .09.25 and the biometry issue is fixed as far as I can see

14:03:03 <yoda__1> Pinembour[m], WHich file did you use for SideLoasd to .25 ? I tried on my pixel 3a and still stuck to .13
14:05:30 <nothankyou[m]> <nothankyou[m] "https://releases.grapheneos.org/"> Check the logs,but here is a sample
14:05:43 <nothankyou[m]> Change the model to one you own

14:07:46 <Pinembour[m]> <yoda__1 "Pinembour, WHich file did you us"> I used the link posted by Lia but changed bonito for taimen as I have a 2XL
14:09:28 <yoda__1> I have noobie difficulti with that url LOL  I see 3a XL  and also 3a  but none have OTA .25 link
14:09:40 <yoda__1> under Beta channel
14:09:59 <yoda__1> So I am looking for the right file to sideload .25 onto my yesterday .13 installation. :-)
14:10:08 <yoda__1> I have a pixel 3a
14:10:59 <yoda__1> nothankyou[m], when you say "  Check the logs " you mean Changeog ? A little bit lower in the url ??
14:12:10 <yoda__1> for 3a there is only sargo-ota_update-2020.09.18.13.zip
14:12:42 <yoda__1> and for 3a XL bonito-ota_update-2020.09.18.13.zip   as I am not sure why 3A is listed 2 times... once alone and once with XL (3A xl)

14:13:29 <yoda__1> confusing for noobie which 3a to take.... as for the .25 OTA update file for sideloading, I don't see it at all
14:13:56 <jpds> yoda__1: The Pixel 3a XL is a different phone
14:14:16 <yoda__1> oooooooooooppppppppsssssssssss so sorry
14:14:35 <yoda__1> I havea  3a " only"
14:14:58 <yoda__1> so it's a sargo file for .25 I need to find ? for my sideload update ? I don't see it
14:15:25 <jpds> You can copy the URL for sargo and change the numbers for the .zip location
14:15:27 <yoda__1> and nothankyou[m] the bonito one you gaved me I think was wrong... But thanks though
14:17:20 <yoda__1> you mean something like http://sargo-ota_update-2020.09.25.00.zip ?   jpds
14:18:15 <yoda__1> and if that url do not work it mean there is not one yet for my 3a ?
14:18:30 <jpds> yoda__1: Yes, but with the full URL
14:19:03 <yoda__1> oops
14:19:09 <yoda__1> ok tks .... on it's way !!
14:19:14 <yoda__1> tks jpds
14:24:42 <jpds> yoda__1: I think it's initially made available for sideload testing (hence not publicly listed), then pushed out to beta and then stable
14:25:06 <yoda__1> tks nothankyou[m]  and jpds   I now know how to find the right ota update file and sideload it without having to reinstall my phone fresh loosing all my apps and config...   I am now at 94% update, sure it will be ok / work
14:26:55 <yoda__1> I am now in .25  And nothankyou[m]   now BIOmetric (even if I don't know what it is LOL will google) are not greyed out in  standardnotes
14:27:12 <yoda__1> done for today LOL
14:28:07 <yoda__1> ok Biometric = stuff like unlocking app with fingerprint etc... Just did it
14:50:45 <duggalsu[m]> <nothankyou[m] "Not that I know of. Test it in r"> Its working fine in remote attestation. I was wondering if the auditor app needs to somehow recognize a paired device instead of asking the auditee to scan the barcode again? What's the app workflow?
15:00:19 <yoda__1>  Iwas using Shelter with previous version of GOS.  Now with the new Android 11 based version, does it still make sense for me to ISOLATE FaceBook, Whatsapp etc etc using Shelter ?
15:22:31 <alzxjm[m]1> yoda__1: it's not recommended. Work profiles weren't really designed for this use
15:33:40 <yoda__1> alzxjm[m]1,  tks !  So you would simply run apps like Whatsapp, FaceBook etc in your main profile ?  Risking they can access our main contacts list etc etc ? (I am not being sarkastic but just asking....)  If most of your run all your Half trustable apps in GOS, then I'll do it LOL it will make my life easier ( no double COntact list etc)
15:34:07 <yoda__1> I don't want to have to log out or switch profile.... Shelter was making it easy but I am open to learn
15:39:05 <mastercakex[m]> Run Facebook as a webapp. Forget isolation
15:40:43 <mastercakex[m]> better delete FB. It'll make your life easier
15:41:39 <strcat[m]> yoda__1: don't give out access to permissions for accessing shared data or use profiles, either way works fine
15:42:07 <strcat[m]> Storage permission is on the way out and apps have to stop using it once they target Android 11 (which they have to do by next year)
15:42:25 <strcat[m]> (on the Play Store... F-Droid has no such requirements, but we'll increase the warning when Play bans it)
15:45:46 <strcat[m]> is anyone having trouble loading the https://grapheneos.org/ site on any of their devices?
15:45:57 <strcat[m]> test on normal connection and VPN ideally
15:46:17 <strcat[m]> a couple people reported issues connecting to it on macOS and iOS but not sure if it's a local problem for them or not
15:46:32 <strcat[m]> the site did move to a new server recently but it's configured exactly the same way, at least it should be
15:47:52 <louipc> loads ok on my wifi
15:47:57 <louipc> laptop
15:48:51 <fll[m]> Maybe those folks' DNS-cache is slow to update?
15:49:07 <nothankyou[m]> No problems here
15:49:24 <bobfett> No problems for me on my phone
15:50:14 <nothankyou[m]> Wow I got pinged so much, but it's nice that sideloading works
15:52:33 <strcat[m]> okay nevermind figured out the error
15:52:44 <strcat[m]> seems specific to Safari with brillo support which much be new in the latest release
15:52:47 <strcat[m]> should be fine now
15:52:55 <strcat[m]> please report problems like this in the future instead of staying quiet
15:54:18 <nothankyou[m]> <duggalsu[m] "Its working fine in remote attes"> Scan the code twice right? Auditee scan auditor, auditor scan auditee?
15:54:41 <nothankyou[m]> Anyways attestation.app has tutorial there
15:56:56 <strcat[m]> https://attestation.app/tutorial#local-verification
15:57:36 <strcat[m]> if you start the initial pairing but don't complete it, it will start showing an error explaining the problem you caused on the device acting as the Auditor
15:58:08 <strcat[m]> explains how to deal with it (clear Auditee pairings on the Auditee or Auditor pairings on the Auditor)
15:58:19 <strcat[m]> the solution is in the error message
15:58:34 <strcat[m]> it can't fix it automatically since it works via QR code scanning instead of something like NFC so it can't communicate back and forth
15:59:15 <strcat[m]> it also explains for the initial pairing that it's the initial pairing and it's important for you to complete it
16:04:26 <yoda__1> tks mastercakex[m] and strambotic[m] for your comments on isolations
16:09:56 <faxing[m]> No problems loading the website from Tor or Ungoogled Chromium by the way

16:19:58 <duggalsu[m]> Is the vanadium browser degoogled? Also, any specific reason the search engine options don't include startpage?
16:23:13 <Sheru[m]> By degoogled you mean no google-related telemetry, safe browing? Yeah, along with default search engine being duckduckgo, removing Google
16:23:30 <Sheru[m]> Or not really, it is still there
16:24:05 <louipc> telemetry?
16:24:23 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, it has none
16:24:35 <louipc> oh whats still there
16:25:54 <Sheru[m]> Just check its settings, or if you want to read the patches it uses: github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium
16:52:05 <adeus[m]> Theoretical question: an attacker in privileged local network position to GrapheneOS user pushes a GrapheneOS update that has been modified. How practical is this potential vector ?
16:52:49 <jpds> adeus[m]: Unless they've somehow stolen the graphene signing keys, not at all
17:02:56 <nickcalyx[m]> Verified boot won't let an unisgned update run
17:22:29 <strcat[m]> regardless the updater won't accept an update that isn't correctly signed
17:22:41 <strcat[m]> so it would not get to the point that verified boot is relevant
17:22:54 <strcat[m]> adeus: read https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-security
17:23:32 <strcat[m]> adeus: also read https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
17:23:40 <strcat[m]> > The update packages have a internal signature verified by the update client (or recovery when sideloading). Downgrade attacks are also prevented, and downgrades cannot be done unless a special downgrade update package has been signed with the release key. The internal payload for update_engine is also signed, providing another layer of signature verification and downgrade protection. Verified boot and the
17:23:40 <strcat[m]> hardware-backed keystore also act as a final layer of protection.
17:24:00 <strcat[m]> 1) update client checks signature of the update package and prevents downgrades
17:24:06 <strcat[m]> 2) update_engine checks signature of the update payload and prevents downgrades
17:24:38 <strcat[m]> 3) verified boot verifies the authenticity/integrity of all OS images and prevents downgrades
17:24:48 <biotinker> I have successfully booted GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a
17:26:08 <Sheru[m]> With all the features?
17:26:31 <Sheru[m]> Wow, cool
17:26:34 <strcat[m]> would require making a custom kernel and porting over all the changes
17:26:46 <strcat[m]> and making sure to port over device repo changes
17:26:56 <strcat[m]> atm there is not much specific to devices other than the kernel work
17:30:01 <biotinker> @Sheru I don't know about all the features- I'm still new enough to not know what I may have missed. But, it ~runs~
17:30:37 <nickcalyx[m]> That's a great start biotinker ! Kudos
17:31:08 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, still kudos
17:31:08 <biotinker> @strcat there weren't any kernel-specific changes that I needed to make. I just built with defaults, and it seemed to work. Would it have pulled in the kernel Google distributes? Or the GrapheneOS kernel for e.g. the pixel4? I'm not sure
17:31:11 <nickcalyx[m]> ü§ò
17:31:22 <strcat[m]> biotinker: you're using the stock kernel
17:31:23 <biotinker> I suppose I'll just start using it now and see if things work/break :)
17:31:27 <strcat[m]> not a GrapheneOS kernel
17:31:36 <Sheru[m]> Probably a good start to check is the settings
17:31:57 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a kernel is not the same as 4 / 4 XL
17:32:06 <strcat[m]> so you're using stock kernel + their dynamic kernel modules from vendor
17:32:21 <Sheru[m]> About the kernel, is it acceptable to do incremental builds on kernel changes?
17:32:24 <strcat[m]> part of making a port is building the kernel from source and porting over our changes
17:32:44 <strcat[m]> well the 1st step requires the minimum of building it to the point that it can boot
17:33:05 <strcat[m]> and unless you want to figure out how to build the dynamic kernel modules including the out-of-tree ones
17:33:07 <strcat[m]> and bundle them into vendor
17:33:17 <strcat[m]> which is all pointless work since that's not how we ship them
17:33:42 <strcat[m]> you'd need to port over the changes to do monolithic kernel builds for the initial build
17:33:47 <strcat[m]> unless you want to set things up their way
17:34:06 <biotinker> So I'm currently basically running AOSP plus the graphene-specific custom apps like Vanadium
17:34:34 <strcat[m]> biotinker: you have GrapheneOS userspace and stock OS kernel
17:34:49 <strcat[m]> so it's like half GrapheneOS
17:35:22 <biotinker> Got it
17:35:26 <strcat[m]> biotinker: you need to make a repo comparable to kernel_google_coral from the upstream tag and port over the changes
17:35:28 <strcat[m]> then build that
17:35:37 <biotinker> Got it
17:36:07 <biotinker> I'll reference the calyxOS kernel changes as a guide
17:36:11 <biotinker> Thanks for the help!
17:36:45 <strcat[m]> biotinker: use our Pixel 4 kernel repo
17:36:50 <strcat[m]> not CalyxOS
17:37:11 <strcat[m]> you need to start from the proper msm.git and out-of-tree driver repos
17:37:17 <strcat[m]> the Pixel 4a tags for those
17:37:27 <strcat[m]> then do the same changes we have for the Pixel 4 repos
17:37:32 <strcat[m]> I doubt anything will be substantially different
17:37:50 <strcat[m]> it may just all apply cleanly (other than stuff you have to adjust to be for 4a configurations)
17:37:58 <biotinker> I meant, calyxOS already has a beta 4a kernel branch so I can look at the commits made to that and use that as a guide
17:38:04 <biotinker> not that I would literally use their kernel
17:38:46 <biotinker> But, sounds good. I'll start plugging away on that
17:41:23 <strcat[m]> you should reference our 4 kernel
17:41:26 <strcat[m]> they probably don'
17:41:32 <strcat[m]>  * they probably don't do things the way we do
17:41:39 <strcat[m]> they might use the stock OS modules
17:41:55 <strcat[m]> we build them all from source and build them into the kernel since we disable dynamic kernel module support to improve security

19:26:03 <nickcalyx[m]> you just seem to have chosen a lot of apps that don't allow backups
19:26:03 <adeus[m]> Any solutions
19:26:25 <dazinism> Are you on android11?
19:27:27 <adeus[m]> dazinism: I‚Äôm on whatever the latest GrapheneOS is
19:27:57 <adeus[m]> So folks for real world people not tech smart is a solution in scenario I described ?
19:28:12 <dazinism> Probs 10 then. 11 is in testing, maybe even beta now
19:28:45 <dazinism> Signal has its own backup mechanism
19:28:57 <nickcalyx[m]> we are working on making seedvault seamless like that but as long as app makers refuse to allow their apps to be backed up then it's not so simple
19:29:10 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <dazinism "Probs 10 then. 11 is in testing,"> Actually, Android 11 R is available in the latest stable release of GrapheneOS. And I do have it already
19:30:59 <adeus[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "we are working on making seedvau"> Needs to be simple this kind of security grapheenos can‚Äôt just be practical for geeks and needs

19:31:09 <RippedJack[m]> Is pinephone smokes pixel with graphene?
19:31:23 <RippedJack[m]> * does the pinephone smokes pixel with graphene?
19:31:32 <dazinism> lol
19:31:49 <adeus[m]> It‚Äôs not possible like a computer you can clone the HDD you just clone the phone ?
19:32:40 <nickcalyx[m]> <adeus[m] "It‚Äôs not possible like a compute"> nope
19:33:10 <dazinism> adeus: if you setup Signal to make backups, it gives you a long passphrase to write down, then saves a backup file to storage on your device
19:33:19 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <RippedJack[m] "Is pinephone smokes pixel with g"> Are you asking if PinePhone is better than GrapheneOS? Well, not really: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24596248
19:33:37 <dazinism> It undates that backup file regularly
19:33:52 <dazinism> I think recent changes to Seedvault  may back that file up
19:35:27 <RippedJack[m]> I'm assuming Librem 5 is the chad this round?
19:35:27 <dazinism> If not you could setup Nextcloud or something to back it up for you
19:36:16 <dazinism> Black Winner Yoshi (privacytools.io): are you sure its been released on stable. I'd expect it to be beta channel still...
19:37:52 <blacklight447[m]> Is the latest stable release based on android 11 yet?
19:38:40 <dazinism> adeus: for other apps you could tell the developers about seedvault and ask them to enable backups or add an option in their apps settings to enable backups.  I think for many apps it wouldn't be too difficult
19:39:04 * RippedJack[m] assuming no combat is the winner?
19:40:09 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <dazinism "Black Winner Yoshi (privacytools"> Check the changelog
19:45:10 <adeus[m]> It shows latest update is on 25th but my device won‚Äôt update still running 2020.09.11.14

19:45:24 <unsafeoppa[m]> Hi guys, I found toggling WiFi MAC randomization on and off permanently disconnects my WiFi. It deleted my installed wifi certificates. So far it only exist on RADIUS authentications;I've tested it with Ms-chapv2 and EAP-TLS. Basic WPA2 credentials doesn't seem to be affected by it. I'm currently on 11 Beta.
19:48:44 <dazinism> Black Winner Yoshi (privacytools.io): thats changlog is posted first. Later OTAs are released on beta channel. Later still (maybe 6-16 or something hours?) on OTAs are available on stable channel
19:49:09 <dazinism> Timing depends on how much time Daniel has to set things up, when he sleeps etc.
19:51:28 <dazinism> Quick feedback on any issues is very valuable. Especially during the first day after the change log is posted.
19:51:43 <adeus[m]> <dazinism "Timing depends on how much time "> Ok thanks. Sorry another stupid question but I need know I see a lot of people talking about android 11 update.. is it known when that update for pixel 3 devices is expected to be made available ? >1wk > 2wk or >4wk ?
19:55:08 <dazinism> Unless there are issues with the 2020.09.25.00 release discovered during the beta phase I expect it should be available within 24hours. Possibly much sooner
19:59:17 <dazinism> Black Winner Yoshi (privacytools.io): you can see that build isnt yet listed in stable https://grapheneos.org/releases#stable-channel
19:59:20 <unsafeoppa[m]> I came from 10 stable to 11 beta. I was using EAP-TLS prior to upgrade. And after the Beta upgrade I noticed right away my WiFi  was disconnected and won't connect. I did some poking around the WiFi settings and eventually narrowed it down to MAC randomization which seems to trigger the issue;
19:59:31 <dazinism> Or even as beta below that
20:02:03 <dazinism> Not sure its even been released as an OTA on beta channel or just people have side loaded
20:02:33 <adeus[m]> <dazinism "Unless there are issues with the"> Your saying android 11 update will be possibly available to stable channel pixel 3 devices in next couple of days ?
20:03:56 <dazinism> unsafeoppa: if you could open an issue on github that would be great https://grapheneos.org/contact#reporting-issues
20:05:00 <dazinism> adeus: yes, unless its delayed because of issues discovered during beta testing, that are deemed to be serious enough to delay the release to stable
20:12:40 <dazinism> strcat anupritaisno1 ^
20:39:57 <SentientTed[m]>   Just figured I would put this here since it took me a while to figure it out, but when I updated today in the beta channel, my mobile network would not connect at all. The way that I fixed it was to set the preferred network type to global and that fixed the problem.
20:40:16 <strcat[m]> dazinism: you can see it's in the beta channel from https://grapheneos.org/releases#beta-channel
20:40:34 <strcat[m]> SentientTed: what was it on before
20:41:11 <SentientTed[m]> it defaults to the LTE(recommended)
20:42:12 <strcat[m]> that makes it sound like your network doesn't have working 4G but presents it as being available
20:42:40 <SentientTed[m]> now that I changed it I get LTE
20:42:47 <SentientTed[m]> i though it was pretty wierd
20:44:00 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: the latest release will be pushed out via the stable channel soon
20:44:25 <strcat[m]> no major issues found
20:52:27 <adeus[m]> From what I seen discussed here before, setting up a secondary profile essentially created an additional layer of encryption for that profile (double encrypt). If that is true, for some threat models, it might have benefit to set your main profile as a secondary to benefit from additional encryption layer?

21:27:48 <devd> Hi, I was wondering whether anyone can suggest an online bank whose mobile app works well on grapheneos.  I'd like to be able to deposit checks using my phone but (perhaps unsurprisingly) the app for my small credit union doesn't work without google services.
21:30:01 <dazinism> strcat: I'm seeing 9-18 there via torbrowser. Just checked with clearnet and see its on 9-25
21:31:04 <strcat[m]> dazinism: it retrieves the current list with JavaScript, you must have it disabled so you're seeing the fallback static list
21:31:17 <strcat[m]> we don't update the static releases listing for beta releases
21:31:28 <dazinism> Yeah, that'll do it
21:31:41 <strcat[m]> there's a noscript element on the page explaining that the listing will often be stale if JS is disabled
21:32:24 <strcat[m]> <noscript><strong>JavaScript is required to fetch the current list of releases from the update server. The list you're seeing below is a pre-generated template and may not be updated for the latest set of releases yet.</strong></noscript>
21:32:27 <strcat[m]> shows up for me if I disable JS
21:32:53 <strcat[m]> you can manually look at https://releases.grapheneos.org/coral-beta

21:33:53 <shraier[m]> hello everyone
21:35:24 <strcat[m]> dazinism: it uses same metadata as the Updater app which keeps it in sync
21:35:51 <strcat[m]> changing the static html for each release just isn't something we want to bother with
21:36:01 <dazinism> Fair
21:36:24 <strcat[m]> we try to change it before we delete the old releases it's listing
21:36:31 <strcat[m]> that's all
21:36:41 <strcat[m]> so they don't 404
21:37:08 <strcat[m]> if people install the past release they just get updated to the current one within ~4 hrs anyway
21:37:20 <strcat[m]> maybe even quicker? it might run the scheduled job immediately for the first time
21:37:55 <strcat[m]> I think it probably does unless they changed the default JobScheduler settings
21:38:10 <strcat[m]> basically there's a setting for the time period and also a setting for how coarse it is
21:38:26 <strcat[m]> by default it was (and probably still is) set so that the precision is the same as the time period
21:38:34 <strcat[m]> so if you set a job for 4 hour periods
21:38:49 <strcat[m]> it's allowed to run up to 4 hours late or 4 hours early by default
21:38:50 <strcat[m]> unless you change that
21:38:56 <strcat[m]> which is how it groups together as many jobs as it can to reduce wakeups
21:38:58 <dazinism> Yeah somehow managed to miss the bold JavaScript warning....
21:39:02 <strcat[m]> similar to other timers
21:39:34 <strcat[m]> so since we have it set to 4 hours it could sometimes be a fair bit longer, or shorter, since we don't set the precision high
21:39:38 <strcat[m]> but on average it's every 4 hrs
21:40:10 <strcat[m]> if you are plugged into charger and have network access it will get it out of the way as soon as possible
21:44:02 <strcat[m]> going to do the stable release around 8pm EDT
21:44:24 <strcat[m]> have til then to report horrible problems that should be blockers via the tracker
21:44:36 <madaidan[m]> Does PdfViewer execute javascript inside PDFs?

21:51:00 <absynt> trying to build latest tag (beta-channel) for 3a. repo init is not happy, because https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest/blob/RP1A.200720.009.2020.09.25.00/default.xml is empty. am i doing something wrong?
21:54:13 <absynt> strcat[m]: is this on purpose?
21:57:22 <absynt> thanks
21:57:47 <strcat[m]> absynt: pushed it again
21:58:19 <strcat[m]> I think there was an error and I've been working on the script so it didn't abort
22:00:33 <absynt> strcat[m]: thanks, everything working now
22:16:07 <shraier[m]> I'm looking to get a Pixel phone but I'm not sure which model to get. Is there any end-of-life date for the 3a model and or is there any roadmap when will the 4a model be supported?
22:16:52 <shraier[m]>  * I'm looking to get a Pixel phone but I'm not sure which model to get. Is there any end-of-life date for the 3a model and or is there any roadmap when will the 4a model be supported by GrapheneOS ofc?
22:17:11 <jpds> shraier[m]: Yes, 3a is EOL in May 2022: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en
22:18:35 <shraier[m]> By your answer I suppose the EOL of GrapheneOS is same as the manufacturer's?
22:18:45 <shraier[m]>  * By your answer I suppose the EOL of GrapheneOS for a certain device is same as the manufacturer's?
22:18:53 <jpds> I believe that is the case
22:20:14 <shraier[m]> Alright. So basically the best thing to do is to wait for 4a support, since the 3a will soon be deprecated?
22:20:59 <jpds> That's still a year and a half off and it's a very nice phone
22:22:35 <shraier[m]> I know, but why not get the last one... do you know when to expect a 4a support by graphene?
22:44:19 <neopetsarecool[m> Hey just wondering what phone service do you guys use?
23:00:55 <neopetsarecool[m> <shraier[m] "I know, but why not get the last"> Graphene support for it isn't planned anytime soon
23:03:33 <strcat[m]> jpds: note that's the minimum guaranteed update date not EOL date
23:03:40 <strcat[m]> we don't know how much longer they'll be supported
23:03:55 <strcat[m]> for example the Pixel 1 received a final security update 2 months after the last guaranteed date
23:05:21 <strcat[m]> the Pixel C received an extra 6 month of support
23:05:29 <strcat[m]>  * the Pixel C received an extra 6 months of support
23:06:24 <strcat[m]> neopetsarecool: it could be supported 2 weeks from now if people step up as device maintainers
23:06:35 <strcat[m]> neopetsarecool: but yeah, it's not planned by the people currently working on the project
23:06:57 <strcat[m]> look how fast the Pixel 4 and 4 XL got supported when 2 maintainers stepped up
23:07:15 <strcat[m]> the work to support the Pixel 4a will be the same 3 months from now as it is today
23:07:25 <strcat[m]> what will make it happen is if someone works on it
23:07:51 <strcat[m]> since Pixel 4 support is done it's not really that big of an initial project but requires long-term commitment to keeping it going
23:08:15 <strcat[m]> you can fairly easily build GrapheneOS for the 4a and then porting over the kernel and device repository changes should be enough, adding it to some scripts, etc.
23:08:22 <strcat[m]> and then long-term work on it resolving issues that come up, porting, etc.
