01:54:23 <ruddo[m]> If Pixel models had an SD card, or at least they sold SD card-carrying cases (they exist for some phones) I would be 100% content with it.

10:03:42 <defconanon12[m]> sheruleeya: F-droid is always on it when it comes to security. See this blog written in 2017. If you want to share where you are seeing this Janus vulnerability claim I would really like to know thanks.

10:52:39 <privacy_based_li> <sheruleeya[m] "I read before that f-droid has s"> building your own is always the best
10:54:23 <defconanon12[m]> sheruleeya: Okay as far as I know yes. It goes through scans multiple times to ensure the app ecosystem hasn't been compromised. If you are really concerned verify the apps yourself. Use an alternative like APKmirror. Also, yes building your own is also an option.
10:56:06 <privacy_based_li> F-droid's advantage is that you are sure that the apps are build from the source code published
10:56:06 <defconanon12[m]> Compare fingerprints as well.
10:57:42 <privacy_based_li> When you download from github, or any other site there is a chance that app is built after modifying/adding something to the source code

12:19:00 <dazinism> They are moving to support v2 & v3
12:19:36 <dazinism> Think I heard someone say that was necessary to support Android 11? Not sure if thats true?
12:19:50 <sheruleeya[m]> <dazinism "sheruleeya: think that the Janus"> Well, will use f-droid for now
12:19:55 <dazinism> Think unlikely, but I could be wrong
12:20:50 <dazinism> sheruleeya: you might find this helpful
12:20:59 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
12:56:08 <defconanon12[m]> I would like to state this isn't primarily an F-droid problem. It is more of a developer problem. If the devs of an app refuse to see the importance of using v2 and v3 then that sucks on a security standpoint. My main problem with F-droid is how they don't refresh the catalogue if an app does not update properly or it is a different app entirely from the original one.
12:56:58 <defconanon12[m]> I think they should have a cut lose security model but keep in mind they are a small team. They can't track of apps that have passed beforehand.
12:57:27 <defconanon12[m]> * I think they should have a cut lose security policy but keep in mind they are a small team. They can't track of apps that have passed beforehand.
13:11:23 <defconanon12[m]> To add on this they even have apps that are no longer supported by the devs.
14:16:05 <sheruleeya[m]> Alright. Yeah, it's more of them perhaps
14:21:32 <packetup[m]> Happy to see the Graphene OS project working to build more from source 😀
14:57:53 <strcat[m]> defconanon12: no, it is an F-Droid problem
14:57:58 <strcat[m]> nearly every app uses v2/v3 signatures
14:58:07 <strcat[m]> F-Droid has taken YEARS to adopt a substantial, important security improving
14:58:17 <strcat[m]> not using v2 signatures should be considered a security vulnerability like not support TLS 1.2+
14:58:44 <strcat[m]> defconanon12: the builds of apps outside F-Droid use v2/v3 signatures, F-Droid downgrades that to v1, among other problems with it
14:59:24 <strcat[m]> and it is a security problem because the whole point of v2 signatures was to redesign the signature system to avoid FUTURE vulnerabilities like that janus vulnerability
14:59:40 <strcat[m]> by making the signatures verify the WHOLE zip not just portions of it that are deemed relevant
14:59:58 <strcat[m]> it's an important security improvement and the old way is really quite broken / terrible
15:00:26 <strcat[m]> that specific vulnerability was fixed, and the flawed signature system was fixed with v2 signatures
15:00:34 <strcat[m]> a LONG time ago and v2/v3 signatures are used AUTOMATICALLY for every app, app developers don't need to take any action to use v2+ signatures
15:00:42 <strcat[m]> it is automatic as long as they use any SDK from the past few years
15:00:57 <defconanon12[m]> So they lied as a PR stunt to the userbase basically. No wonder I can't find any documentation on it.
15:00:57 <strcat[m]> even if they haven't updated the SDK for 2 years (which is pretty fucking terrible) they use v2 sigs
15:01:49 <strcat[m]> and this vulnerability is still relevant for apps from F-Droid despite the fact that their repo metadata includes hashes for apps to verify them\
15:01:57 <strcat[m]>  * and this vulnerability is still relevant for apps from F-Droid despite the fact that their repo metadata includes hashes for apps to verify them
15:02:23 <strcat[m]> the apps are installed on the OS and a user might try to install an out-of-band update including downloading it from F-Droid themselves
15:02:48 <strcat[m]> and also there's not supposed to just be F-Droid as a line of security especially with the other flaws it has
15:03:02 <strcat[m]> imo this reflects their overall attitude and prioritization of security
15:03:24 <strcat[m]> not adopting security fixes from 2017
15:03:47 <strcat[m]> the old signature scheme is flawed, that's why it was replaced, it doesn't verify the whole zip
15:03:53 <strcat[m]> that's problematic
15:04:16 <strcat[m]> sure they fixed the known vulnerability caused by that but it doesn't change the fact that v1 doesn't verify the whole zip so an attacker can modify an apk signed with v1 and it will be verified as correctly signed even though it's modified
15:04:21 <strcat[m]> as long as they don't touch what v1 verifies
15:04:23 <strcat[m]> that is a problem
15:04:30 <strcat[m]> v2 signatures are important
15:04:39 <strcat[m]> there are probably apps that trust zip content, etc.
15:04:51 <strcat[m]> instead of only using it via the OS
15:05:20 <strcat[m]> v2 signatures exist for a reason
15:05:36 <strcat[m]> everyone should have updated within a month of it being available really
15:06:55 <defconanon12[m]> What would you recommend as an alternative to F-droid? I see APKmirror or build my own.
15:08:10 <strcat[m]> I recommend contributing to the project including the work of making a better app distribution / update system

15:26:01 <dallemon> jiibus[m]: you can configure it for each network in your Wi-Fi settings
15:27:08 <jiibus[m]> Yea, saw that. now realizing it uses a different static MAC for each network. Good enough
15:29:28 <cyborgninjaneer[> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): can external F-droid repositories use v2 or v3 sigs or does the F-droid software straight up not support them at all?

16:43:03 <strcat[m]> cereal_eater: by default, GrapheneOS disables adding new USB peripherals while locked
16:43:06 <strcat[m]> cereal_eater: that's a GrapheneOS feature you can configure
16:43:37 <strcat[m]> peripherals can only be added at boot (i.e. before decrypting any user data) or while unlocked by default
16:43:47 <strcat[m]> it may make sense to disable adding them at boot too
16:43:51 <strcat[m]> people are welcome to work on that
16:44:15 <strcat[m]> the threat model ATM is a device is obtained by an attacker after the user has unlocked post-boot, but while it's locked
16:44:39 <strcat[m]> and they aren't trying to give a device back to the user that's compromised to trick them - just compromising what they obtained
16:44:56 <strcat[m]> for that feature
16:45:46 <cereal_eater> ok, makes sense and souds fine. I'll just remember to unlock the screen before plugging the headset in.
16:47:02 <cereal_eater> thank you for the information and for the 2020.06.22.21 release .-)
16:55:23 <defconanon12[m]> madaidan.: Never mind on that I was wrong using Aurora Store for now.
17:26:01 <dazinism> cyborgninjaneer: Think other repos on Fdroid will have apps with v2 or v3 sigs. Its the build server Fdroid use for their own repository that currently forces v1 there.
17:27:22 <strcat[m]> my experience is that serious obvious problems on the surface like this is indicative of deep, pervasive problems
17:27:30 <strcat[m]> and I've run into a lot of issues like this with F-Droid
17:27:38 <strcat[m]> also major bugs in how it installs apps, etc.
17:27:59 <strcat[m]> and it's not simply a matter of fixing this cases by case
17:28:12 <strcat[m]> there are systemic issues in how it's developed especially the app repo
17:28:32 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't fit how we want this to work
17:28:48 <JTL> I used to think that forking F-Droid and only using "our" repository by default would be acceptable, now given these issues I can understand wanting to start anew.
17:29:13 <ruddo[m]> Anything F-Droid must be improved.
17:29:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just use auroradroid
17:29:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> It works
17:31:33 <defconanon12[m]> Auroradroid is nice.
17:35:27 <strcat[m]> JTL: I want proper automatic updates
17:35:50 <strcat[m]> F-Droid has no path to that - it's far too complex and crufty to trust it with that
17:35:59 <strcat[m]> there are bad usability bugs just trying to use it
17:36:07 <JTL> agreed
17:37:44 <strcat[m]> so the plan is to add metadata signing to Updater for the channel metadata (although that doesn't provide it with more than verifying channel name - since it already has proper signature verification and downgrade protection just like the apk package manager)
17:37:55 <strcat[m]> and then fork it into an app update system
17:37:59 <strcat[m]> and then that can have the ability to install new apps added to it
17:45:17 <cyborgninjaneer[> It would be helpful for GrapheneOS' solution to be able to pull from established F-droid repos like Bitwarden and Bromite, if the issues with it can be solved or sufficiently mitigated client-side.
17:46:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> The alternative is trying to convince developers to adopt the GrapheneOS software manager and host their stuff for it, which might be difficult, or to have community members build a ton of stuff from source regularly, which won't scale well.
17:48:21 <cyborgninjaneer[> Although... If the GrapheneOS way works on other OS's too, it might just end up replacing F-Droid.
17:48:32 <madaidan[m]> I think the plan is to upload a few good apps to the GrapheneOS store. Not something massive.
17:49:48 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's great for the default repo, but I'd hope to see the ability to add more repos. It's a FOSS "store" after all, not another walled-garden Apple app store.
17:49:54 <proof_jr> put a survey asking which apps can't live without and work from there
17:53:55 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: people are still free to use F-Droid, Aurora Store, and others
17:54:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yes, but they suck.
17:54:18 <strcat[m]> this is for distributing our own out-of-band updates to GrapheneOS and making our own builds of other apps available
17:54:23 <strcat[m]> yeah but that's not our problem to solve
17:54:47 <strcat[m]> they can't even handle dependency management
17:54:58 <strcat[m]> like TrichromeChrome depends on TrichromeLibrary
17:55:17 <strcat[m]> the built-in package manager knows that but can't do much about it
17:56:15 <cyborgninjaneer[> Would it be within the scope of GrapheneOS' store to include something like Simple Mobile Tools so users can get them via a more trustworthy channel?
17:56:22 <cyborgninjaneer[> https://www.simplemobiletools.com
17:56:52 <cyborgninjaneer[> (Assuming the software meets your standards. I don't know whether or not it does)
17:57:22 <cyborgninjaneer[> These might be better than the default AOSP apps.
17:57:51 <joshman[m]> Simple Mobile Tools suck. It's my  personal preference
17:59:29 <proof_jr> josh.man: calendar and photos app pretty good
17:59:40 <cyborgninjaneer[> ^
18:00:02 <joshman[m]> Photos lacks functions big time. Calendar is somewhat ok-ish
18:00:21 <proof_jr> it's supposed to be "simple"
18:00:23 <cyborgninjaneer[> Notes are okay too, although I prefer Standard Notes for most things
18:00:41 <joshman[m]> It's so simple I'm better off with AOSP apps
18:05:30 <strcat[m]> proof_jr: not a fan of the approach taken by a lot of those apps
18:05:42 <strcat[m]> so no, probably not
18:05:54 <strcat[m]> and btw we're not looking for suggestions on apps we should package
18:06:00 <strcat[m]> you're welcome to use F-Droid, Aurora Store, etc.
18:06:54 <strcat[m]> apps that we choose to package and ship via our own repository / update system will need to meet our high standards
18:07:41 <strcat[m]> and apps doing stuff like putting a UI-level app PIN to prevent access to files accessible other ways...
18:07:48 <strcat[m]> and also depending on legacy / insecure ways of doing things...
18:07:59 <madaidan[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Would it be within the scope of "> IME they're pretty buggy which is never a good sign.
18:08:00 <strcat[m]> and pushing users to keep seeing that as normal
18:08:03 <strcat[m]> yeah, we're not promoting those
18:08:24 <proof_jr> ok
18:08:40 <strcat[m]> still using the Storage permission in 2020 is a bad look for any app trying to claim it cares about privacy or security
18:08:59 <strcat[m]> it's deprecated and requires explicitly opting into the legacy storage model when targeting the current platform
18:09:15 <strcat[m]> and that option goes away with the next version of the platform (when targeting it)
18:09:30 <cyborgninjaneer[> How would you write a gallery app in the new way of doing things?
18:12:28 <strcat[m]> don't mandate access to any specific source of photos
18:12:33 <strcat[m]> support requesting access to Photos
18:12:43 <strcat[m]> support requesting access to arbitrary directories or files
18:12:55 <strcat[m]> support opening stuff passed to it
18:13:11 <strcat[m]> Android 4.4.4 had SAF
18:13:27 <strcat[m]> app devs have no excuse for doing stuff in such a privacy invasive and terrible way
18:13:29 <strcat[m]> almost across the board
18:14:11 <strcat[m]> and it's funny for apps to pretend they are privacy or security focused when treating privacy/security and user consent with such disdain and placing such a low priority on doing these things right
18:14:34 <dallemon[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org) gz on the newest release. already flashed it to my 4 xl. will give the cts another go tonight. however i seem to be having a slight issue with the device disconnecting after a few hours. also i'm sorry i haven't got around to writing a clean report from the runs i have done earlier.
18:14:58 <strcat[m]> one of the major strengths of iOS is a much better app ecosystem by better developers who even if they don't care more about privacy/security are generally just a lot less clueless and neglectful which improves those things
18:16:00 <strcat[m]> and open source seems more like an excuse to do a bad job than a way of improving things
18:16:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: apparently iOS got pwned by a browser exploit

18:48:00 <xabi[m]> We aren't getting iOS on our pixels, and the main topic here is grapheneOS
18:48:52 <concat[m]> <xabi[m] "We aren't getting iOS on our pix"> That wasn't what they were talking about. And we can talk about OS security here.
18:49:01 <LynnStephenson[4> <madaidan[m] "CVE counting is not a real indic"> CVE counts are only slightly significant, but not nearly as much as you'd (anupritaisno1) like to be.
18:49:45 <cn3m[m]> CVE counting is always garbage. Projects report them differently. There's never a time it's useful
18:50:21 <strcat[m]> a higher number of CVEs is not something that should be interpreted as a bad thing
18:50:32 <strcat[m]> most projects don't obtain CVEs for their security vulnerabilities
18:50:38 <LynnStephenson[4> The internals of the CVEs can give you a slight insider to what is actually going on inside the OS, and to give you an idea of how security is approached (from a blackbox perspective).
18:50:42 <strcat[m]> and sometimes go out of the way to try avoiding assignment
18:51:04 <strcat[m]> since people misuse it as a count of vulnerabilities
18:51:17 <strcat[m]> so projects mostly try to avoid it other than certain ones with more responsible dev teams
18:51:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay got it
18:51:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Shouldn't have brought the CVE argument
18:51:27 <strcat[m]> and also it just tells you how much was discovered
18:51:32 <strcat[m]> not how many vulnerabilities exist
18:51:47 <strcat[m]> it tells you how many were discovered, fixed and had a CVE assigned to keep track of it
18:52:01 <strcat[m]> a project with 0 CVEs assigned can have far more vulnerabilities and much worse security
18:52:06 <strcat[m]> than one with 100
18:52:24 <strcat[m]> also the way they are assigned varies
18:52:36 <strcat[m]> sometimes they'll assign 1 CVE to cover fixes across a bunch of different things
18:52:41 <strcat[m]> because they are similar fixes
18:52:48 <strcat[m]> sometimes 1 issue will get multiple CVEs

18:54:45 <strcat[m]> but mediatek is definitely less secure

19:03:20 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "strcat: I'm not trying to compar"> Still does zero good with how the reporting works. You also have the issue of reliability and containment not being a major factor. iOS and modem Android will have almost no problem curbing persistence for example.

20:42:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> JTL: no
20:44:24 <JTL> just thought I'd ask :P
21:40:18 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> Ist there a risk for daily users with no tech knowledge to switch to the beta channel?
21:42:55 <TheJollyRoger> yxcvbnmlp[m]: not much of a risk, but unless you're running the CTS and sending in CTS reports, there's also no reward.
21:45:25 <dazinism> Think testing functionality when the beta drops and reporting any bugs you find is valued
21:45:54 <dazinism> Specially testing stuff related to any changes
21:48:07 <dazinism> Need to be fairly proactive (ideally try forcing the update soon after its announced ) as the stable generally isnt very far behind
21:50:54 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> <TheJollyRoger "yxcvbnmlp: not much of a risk, b"> How do i do that? I want to contribute to the project more (: I am not sophisticated enough for developing or somwthing like that, but i want to do what i can

21:53:31 <TheJollyRoger> I can try to help you with it later.
21:54:43 <blacklight447[m]> This reads like a dude just randomly applying a bunch of stuff with security in the name and calling it secure
21:54:45 <cn3m[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Wtf is yama security"> Yama and debugging levels is attack surface in many cases
21:54:47 <cn3m[m]>  Didn't read the link

21:56:43 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Wtf is yama security"> Yama is basically just a bunch of extensions to regular DAC permissions.
21:56:53 <blacklight447[m]> "I installed the most security related tools therefore i am the modt secure!!!!"
21:58:10 <cn3m[m]> No SELinux is the Android sandbox

22:03:43 <TheJollyRoger> Debugging logs for Pixel 4 GrapheneOS coming now.
22:05:55 <defconanon12[m]> Here is another insight on IOS failing at security and privacy. 0days happen on every device and they are very hard to avoid. Look at Google Project Zero. Goes in depth of what happened on IOS devices. IOS 10-13
22:05:55 <defconanon12[m]> https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/?m=1
22:06:40 <defconanon12[m]> Mitigations also add attack surface.
22:09:20 <cn3m[m]> That's not an accurate assessment of that post at all
22:10:30 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: How so?
22:12:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Wtf is yama security"> Yama tried to enforce certain system wide restrictions
22:12:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> It mostly failed at its original goal
22:13:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it restricts a debug call that can sometimes be dangerous
22:13:26 <cn3m[m]> Everything gets zero days. iPhones and Pixels are really the only ones taking strong action to handle things like this defconanon12
22:13:46 <cn3m[m]> iOS doesn't even allow dynamic native code execution
22:13:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's at least one known browser sandbox escape due to that call
22:14:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> However it's not a replacement for selinux
22:15:07 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Yama can still be beneficial if stacked with other LSMs like SELinux, no?
22:15:08 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: Yes, I forgot to mention Apple took a strong approach when those 0days happened and stopped them pretty fast.
22:15:14 <renlord> cn3m[m]: we crackdown on dynamic native code execution using selinux
22:15:54 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "cn3m: we crackdown on dynamic na"> Right and the plan is to remove it from userland with an opt in
22:16:14 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is super on top of that
22:16:29 <renlord> we kinda already have an app domain for that
22:16:48 <renlord> strcat[m]: is the next step writing the frontend to classify which apps should go into which app domain?
22:16:53 <renlord> so users can control?
22:16:58 <cn3m[m]> defconanon12: I'd recommend reading Daniel's comparison https://reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/ekxifpa?context=3
22:17:26 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: Been meaning to thanks. ^^
22:17:28 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "we kinda already have an app dom"> It was in the project originally you could completely block out
22:17:35 <cn3m[m]> * It was in the project originally you could completely block it
22:17:48 <renlord> cn3m[m]: in the legacy code?
22:17:51 <strcat[m]> renlord: we'd need to split the non-base app domains
22:17:53 <renlord> i dont know what it looks like
22:17:55 <strcat[m]> and add a toggle to choose which to use
22:18:00 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes this used to be implemented
22:18:03 <strcat[m]> we had an exception database
22:18:53 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon12[m] "cn3m: Been meaning to thanks. ^^"> It's old, but it's still based on the Pixel 3 which is still the latest architecture that GrapheneOS supports. Pixel 4 and the iPhone 11 both improved things. As did iOS 13
22:18:57 <cn3m[m]> The comparison is still relevant in my opinion
22:19:28 <renlord> competition is healthy
22:19:35 <renlord> hehe
22:19:52 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "cn3m: in the legacy code?"> The problem is it breaks a lot of important apps for people. Which is unfortunate on iOS
22:20:05 <cn3m[m]> Emulators and Tor Browser/Firefox for instance would be essentially
22:20:10 <cn3m[m]> Toast
22:21:38 <madaidan[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Wtf is yama security"> It's an LSM that contains a few small security features. Definitely not comparable to SELinux.
22:21:56 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "Yama and debugging levels is att"> That doesn't make sense.
22:22:46 <madaidan[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "Yama can still be beneficial if "> Yes.

22:24:03 <cn3m[m]> <madaidan[m] "That doesn't make sense."> You can restrict debugging paths
22:24:16 <cn3m[m]> Like Chromium
22:24:31 <madaidan[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "image.png"> It basically just restricts the ptrace syscall
22:24:44 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Ah I see. That makes sense.
22:25:04 <madaidan[m]> It was intended to be a generic LSM with a bunch of little security features but it never really took off
22:25:05 <renlord> strcat[m]: so iirc, last time we've split base and non-base
22:26:12 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <madaidan[m] "It basically just restricts the "> Are there any normal circumstances (not debugging) when `ptrace` would be necessary for normal operation? I'm wondering if it would be feasible to set `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` to `3 - no attach`
22:26:24 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Without breakage of course.
22:27:18 <madaidan[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "Are there any normal circumstanc"> No, ptrace is only really used for debugging and exploits.
22:27:19 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Er sorry not the capability. The sysctl provided by Yama
22:27:57 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Easy enough. Thanks for the info
22:28:18 <cn3m[m]> renlord: that would be a pretty cool feature to bring back. It's not that common, but it's a big enough issue when it is
22:28:27 <madaidan[m]> It basically lets you modify any program's memory that's running as the same user.
22:28:49 <renlord> cn3m[m]: i think its a pretty important feature that narrows the gap between ios and android
22:28:52 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Ah okay. I wasn't actually sure what that syscall did.
22:29:18 <renlord> dont like ios people to be swinging their dicks at me
22:29:38 <cn3m[m]> The other thing is iOS has very good scoped apps
22:29:55 <JTL> hold on, what feature are we talking about again?
22:29:58 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 is kinda half assing that with the silent allows by category
22:30:32 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "dont like ios people to be swing"> Haha yeah whatever simple things right
22:30:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> JTL: sucking iOS' e-peen

22:47:14 <TheJollyRoger> cts reports coming.
23:18:07 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon12[m] "cn3m: I am guessing today Graphe"> iOS has made more gains than GrapheneOS has since that read. It's complicated. The simple answer is iOS and GrapheneOS are the most private and secure options and you can't go wrong with either
23:20:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> iOS and secure. We can all dream, sure
23:22:41 <cn3m[m]> They are both pushing security and meaningful privacy farther than any other projects available right now. Daniel has already done a great write-up on both. Both could use a little work and could use each other's advances.
23:22:41 <cn3m[m]> The distinction is not that important as they both have an incredible leg up on everything else
23:27:36 <cn3m[m]> The best way to settle this debate is to head to GitHub and add some important old features back in or add an app store or app scoping. There's a lot of low hanging fruit. If everything on GitHub issues were done there would be no debate
23:29:30 <radixed9[m]> <cn3m[m] "The best way to settle this deba"> ^
23:29:31 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "iOS and secure. We can all dream"> iOS is secure.
23:40:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Doubt
23:45:34 <cyborgninjaneer[> I have concerns about their approach to fixing things. The same kinds of bugs seem to crop up repeatedly
23:45:34 <radixed9[m]> anupritaisno1: Do you have something to specific to criticize about the security?
23:46:36 <radixed9[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "I have concerns about their appr"> This happens with all software and all platforms. iOS is immune to many classes of issues that virtually everything else is weak too. I am very curious if someone has a criticism of the security architecture
23:46:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> Take malicious text strings for example. The first time that happened, they should have rewritten the way the OS handled text so that could not happen anymore.
23:47:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm not saying it's bad, just that I have doubts.
23:49:00 <radixed9[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Take malicious text strings for "> Parser errors happen all the time for various things. Yes there was that DOS attack on iOS lately with it. It's a minor issue
23:49:59 <radixed9[m]> We have had SQL injections was public 20 years ago
23:50:27 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's entirely possible that it's less serious than I thought. It just bugs me that it seems to crop up over and over when I would expect design changes to prevent that class of bugs.
23:50:37 <radixed9[m]> The first SQL injection went public 20 years ago*
23:51:45 <jacob[m]2> Hello everyone, I had changed my matrix domain so this isn’t me “joining” for the first time :)
23:52:12 <cyborgninjaneer[> Now I will say, there are some privacy advantages to using iOS, especially you don't use iCloud. Fewer phone models make it harder to fingerprint devices.
23:52:34 <radixed9[m]> The iOS 14 features are incredibly impressive on the privacy front
23:52:56 <jacob[m]2> Never thought about that before, yeah fewer one models makes it hard to know who someone is besides the many many Android phones
23:53:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> I've seen some of it. It's a really great start.
23:53:20 <radixed9[m]> <jacob[m]2 "Never thought about that before,"> This is why Vanadium tries to imitate a Google Pixel running Chrome
23:53:36 <jacob[m]2> The TL;DR privacy policy is pretty cool as well
23:53:36 <jacob[m]2> And the camera/microphone indicator
23:53:41 <radixed9[m]> It is far less effective at that goal, but it does a good job right now

23:54:18 <radixed9[m]> I can't type today
23:54:29 <jacob[m]2> Hm I haven’t seen the ad id stuff yet. What is that specifically?
23:54:32 <renlord> i think most criticism towards ios security is that apple also wallgardens their public security research efforts
23:54:57 <renlord> so not necessarily everyone has access to verify ios security and you need to trust third parties that do it
23:55:16 <cn3m[m]> Mobile ad tech developer the ad ID stuff is awesome
23:55:22 <cyborgninjaneer[> I think if apple were more open with stuff and receptive to input it could be a lot better. But, what do I know.
23:55:35 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "so not necessarily everyone has "> Most important changes are either in the open source components or well documented or both
23:56:17 <cn3m[m]> <jacob[m]2 "Hm I haven’t seen the ad id stuf"> It lets you choose if apps can track you

23:56:48 <jacob[m]2> So you can flat out deny it?
23:56:54 <cn3m[m]> iOS you can opt out of all of that much like GrapheneOS does
23:57:08 <cn3m[m]> <jacob[m]2 "So you can flat out deny it?"> You can already
23:57:09 <cyborgninjaneer[> What I want is for Apple to offer a bit more software freedom, and let users obtain software outside of the app store.
23:57:13 <radixed9[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't have the ad ID code in the first place
23:57:33 <jacob[m]2> That’s what I thought you could do with limit tracking right? What is the new iOS 14 feature then?
23:57:41 <radixed9[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "What I want is for Apple to offe"> That is a terrible idea for the privacy and security reasons. People can sideload if they want too. It shouldn't be too easy. The current system is good
23:57:44 <icy-sprite[m]> Apparently you can make the AD ID to zeros when you deny it
23:57:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> I didn't know you even could sideload.
23:58:00 <cn3m[m]> <jacob[m]2 "That’s what I thought you could "> It asks by default for every app
23:58:11 <radixed9[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "I didn't know you even could sid"> You can. There are even open source app stores
23:58:15 <radixed9[m]> it is not recommended however
23:58:23 <cyborgninjaneer[> It doesn't have to be easy. I was just misinformed.
23:58:29 <radixed9[m]> You can easily download source code or even a binary and install it
23:58:31 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's all good then
23:58:32 <icy-sprite[m]> I like the privacy report feature too.
23:58:44 <radixed9[m]> iOS 14 is very impressive
23:58:54 <jacob[m]2> <cn3m[m] "It asks by default for every app"> Oh ok nice
23:59:06 <cn3m[m]> The best feature is full app scoping and the limits on background use, but that's been there forever
