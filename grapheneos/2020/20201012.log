01:24:49 <adeus[m]> Hey any GrapheneOS compatible phones that have at least 2 years of support left in them ?
01:25:11 <adeus[m]> I heard Pixel 3 is just 1Y EOL and 4 is not supported
01:25:15 <adeus[m]> Officially yet
01:28:42 <adeus[m]> Nevermind
01:28:56 <adeus[m]> I see the 4 and 4XL is officially supported now
01:29:23 <alzxjm[m]> <adeus[m] "I heard Pixel 3 is just 1Y EOL a"> 4 is officially supported.
01:31:32 <adeus[m]> P4 $372 on amazon vs $200 for P3 maybe can snag a deal on prime day
08:42:43 <zyxt128[m]> Hi guys
08:42:43 <zyxt128[m]> Maybe this question is partially off-topic, but do you know if GOS has an auditd mechanism? I know that there was an attempt to port the auditd from linux to AOSP but I'm not sure if it was successful.
08:48:24 <propertype[m]> We have attestation for that - https:/attestation.app
08:48:44 <propertype[m]> * We have attestation for that - https://attestation.app
08:48:54 <propertype[m]> Its bundled with gos
08:49:41 <zyxt128[m]> Yes, I know that, but I don't mean Auditor, but the auditd
08:50:32 <zyxt128[m]> https://linux.die.net/man/8/auditd
08:50:54 <zyxt128[m]>  * Yes, I know that, but I don't mean Auditor app, but the auditd linux daemon
08:54:27 <prtr> Hello,
08:55:19 <prtr> I have a question. When comes the release for the Pixel 4a device?
08:56:26 <cn3m> When people step up as maintainers
08:56:30 <cn3m> from the community
09:28:14 <mrxx_0[m]> <prtr "I have a question. When comes th"> I am waiting for mine to arrive to specially work on that :)
12:10:19 <renlord> zyxt128[m]: yes
12:10:54 <renlord> when specifying sepolicy, we specify some actions need to be auditted (logged)
12:10:59 <renlord> and it'll print to the logs
12:11:32 <renlord> zyxt128[m]: prints like that
12:11:35 <renlord> ```

12:19:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> AFAIK you cannot easily
12:20:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have dmesg_restrict set on our kernels
12:20:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> I just use UART when I want to see selinux logs
12:20:43 <shdudbdjdj[m]> Would it be technically possible to allow switching user profile wile calling without compromising security? It would be a lot for usability (:
12:21:55 <zyxt128[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I just use UART when I want to s"> Thank you
12:22:07 <dazinism> zyxt128: maybe this is useful https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/SecurityLog
14:38:39 <Sheru[m]> Ah yes, massive wave of joined and left dialogues
14:54:49 <bosje[m]> Sorry to spam this question a lot, but I am an iPhone user looking to switch
14:55:15 <bosje[m]> I’m thinking either a pixel 4a or 5, are these devices on the roadmap?
15:00:15 <Sheru[m]> Depends if there'll be a maintainer
15:00:32 <Sheru[m]> But what is more likely to be supported if there'll be one is 4a, as the source code is already there
15:14:13 <bosje[m]> I see
15:14:28 <bosje[m]> Is the new 5g version expected to be very different?
15:15:08 <bosje[m]> I don’t think 5g is worth it atm but who knows
15:20:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> <bosje[m] "Is the new 5g version expected t"> Yes
15:21:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Different kernel
15:22:40 <Sheru[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Different kernel "> More security mitigations yay (hopefully that actually works)

15:31:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixel 4a and also I need to really get my new workstation built
15:32:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> The stuff I'm working on to fix rn takes so long I just sit looking at it compile
16:00:58 <redu321[m]> has anyone ever got into the pixel 4 with graphene os without pin? Like how secure is the phone with graphene? Can you compare it with the same phone security as the iphone? Bc it is also very hard to get into the latets iphone. Just try to imagine how secure the os and the pixel phone are compared to other
16:24:20 <faxing[m]> <redu321[m] "has anyone ever got into the pix"> I'm not sure I understand parts of your question but Graphene is notably better than iPhone for security in some places and on the same level or a little worse in others.
16:24:56 <faxing[m]> Graphene is the best OS if you're looking for maximum security and privacy, period.
16:25:25 <faxing[m]>  * That said, if you take everything into account then Graphene is the best OS if you're looking for maximum security and privacy, period.
16:28:35 <louipc> I wouldnt make such a wild statement because I dont have full knowledge of all the OS out there, but GrapheneOS is pretty good especially if you're looking for something on a pixel device. The best I can think of at least.
16:30:59 <zyxt128[m]> redu321: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/
16:31:17 <zyxt128[m]> Read Daniel's answer
16:32:10 <faxing[m]> <louipc "I wouldnt make such a wild state"> Well I mean if you consider the alternatives:
16:32:55 <faxing[m]> Calyx is good too but just retains the Android security model without improving on it or hardening it further, still good, just not as good as graphene.
17:03:55 <p00l00p[m]> honestly since A11, graphene is much faster
17:04:14 <p00l00p[m]> i can barely notice performance impact with hardering
17:04:19 <p00l00p[m]>  * i can barely notice performance impact with hardening
17:08:41 <systemctl[m]> yeah i've seen noticeable speed improvements with eyes only with the new a11 update
17:16:31 <faxing[m]> Same
17:16:59 <faxing[m]> I feel like even stupid things like opening the keyboard feel smoother and less jittery than they did before
18:25:07 <crixtnn[m]> would turning on location for offline navigation, while on airplane mode would keep cellular modem off, or are the two linked?

18:49:57 <crixtnn[m]> jpds: thanks. browsed the FAQ a while ago, seems to have grown quite a lot since then.
18:57:39 <mo6rule[m]> Is 'Wi-Fi-enhanced MAC Randomisation' the default or did I accidentally turn it off?
19:04:46 <mo6rule[m]> Should it be enabled?
19:05:25 <mo6rule[m]> The MAC is still randomized anyway right?
19:05:52 <mo6rule[m]> Or should I have this enabled?
19:07:00 <mo6rule[m]> ('Should' meaning 'Yes please, gimme MAC randomization)
19:18:30 <neo[m]> Guys, I tried to generate signed factory images with command: m otatools-package, but I received:
19:18:30 <neo[m]> m: coomand not found
19:18:30 <neo[m]> What should I do to continue with this?
20:01:25 <louipc> can you use `make`
20:13:13 <louipc> neo[m]: sound like you didnt run envsetup
20:32:08 <neo[m]> <louipc "neo: sound like you didnt run en"> I did:
20:32:51 <louipc> what shell
20:34:19 <neo[m]> bash
20:40:46 <louipc> i dunno try again. you should have the 'm' function
20:42:54 <neo[m]> Sorry, maybe this is the reason: I did m target-files-package in previous session.
20:43:21 <louipc> when you opened the new session did you run envsetup again
20:43:28 <neo[m]> No
20:43:40 <louipc> run it again.
20:43:43 <neo[m]> Yes, that's it, I guess
20:43:49 <louipc> yes

21:00:40 <neo[m]> I don't know why it gives me this message, because I also ran 'choosecombo release aosp_bonito user'
21:00:40 <neo[m]>  after envsetup.

21:05:34 <neo[m]> how do you use it_
21:05:37 <neo[m]>  * how do you use it?

21:06:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> It will show you all the lunch targets
21:06:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it only shows userdebug so copy and paste the target exactly as it says without the number obviously
21:07:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> And change the userdebug to user
21:10:22 <neo[m]> Thanks!
