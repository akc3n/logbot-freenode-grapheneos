02:16:42 <aeonsolution[m]> There isn't a how-to guide for contributing to GrapheneOS, people that want to contribute can look up how to get started with open source by searching for resources on the internet.
02:17:41 <aeonsolution[m]> Everything you want to know about the project is on the website: https://grapheneos.org/
02:27:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> [aeonsolution](https://matrix.to/#/@aeonsolution:matrix.org) 4a when lol
02:37:15 <RiotElement[m]> Never mind, figured it out :)
04:25:55 <besconix[m]> Does Graphene track your location?

09:26:21 <redu321[m]> I have a question. Is there a difference in security between the pixel 4 and the pixel 4a?
09:26:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
09:29:20 <redu321[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "No "> So the pixel 4a has the same security as the pixel 4? No difference?
09:39:58 <redu321[m]> Why is pixel 4a  for graphene os still experimental? That is why i am wondering if there is maybe a difference in security?
09:50:18 <alcastronic[m]> The port of GrapheneOS to the Pixel 4a is no considered as stable  yet. It might still have some issues and not all features might work as expected. I did not test it myself as I do not have an Pixel 4a.
09:53:18 <jpds> redu321[m]: There's no difference in security
09:56:25 <redu321[m]> <alcastronic[m] "The port of GrapheneOS to the Pi"> Allright. So if i want to install graphene os on a pixel 4a right now. Are there security issues or only user experience issues?
10:06:44 <dazinism> redu321: if I'm not confused its all pretty much there now. The main thing left was auditor support, and although its not included in the build you can get the latest auditor release and safely update.
10:08:33 <dazinism> Anus 'no' is a pretty good confirmation of that as they are one of the developers
10:09:36 <redu321[m]> dazinism: Thanks for your response!
10:10:21 <alcastronic[m]> Did someone already look into the Pixel 4a 5G version?
10:11:04 <alcastronic[m]> Ok stupid question, it starts selling end of the month (in my area) , sry for confusion
12:22:19 <aeonsolution[m]> redu321: if you are curious and want a more in-depth understanding on why its the same security please check out this video from an Android team engineer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5N_YcHX8zc and then whenever you want to compare device kernels you can explore https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/
12:23:43 <aeonsolution[m]> this link goes over kernel security for android https://source.android.com/security/overview/kernel-security
12:52:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> [aeonsolution](https://matrix.to/#/@aeonsolution:matrix.org) that's completely unrelated
12:52:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> And users are not going to be reading kernel sources either
12:53:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is the same security because we are using the same exploit mitigation
12:57:57 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: if you really need to talk to me send me a private message otherwise stop tagging me, I've already asked you to leave me out of your monologues
12:59:07 <hypokeimenon[m]> They were referring to the answer you gave to redu321
12:59:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> [aeonsolution](https://matrix.to/#/@aeonsolution:matrix.org) you are pretty dense aren't you. You're spreading some really weird misinformation here
13:00:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google's kernel for the 4a doesn't have most of the exploit mitigation I had to look into and add
13:00:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google in fact went ahead and disabled a bunch of exploit mitigation on the 4a
13:01:00 <hypokeimenon[m]> redu321 asked whether it was safe to assume that the security level of the Pixel 4a was on the same level as a Pixel 3 series given that the Pixel 4a line is not regarded as 'fully stable'. Or if the issues were mainly usability ones that hadn't appeared yet- specifically in relation to GrapheneOS.
13:01:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> That is pretty normal if you ask
13:02:28 <aeonsolution[m]> If you want to infantilize users and misrepresent my statement that if users are curious to learn more refer to said links. I again don't know what to tell you.
13:03:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Explain how that link even mentions the exploit mitigation we do
13:03:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is no "infantilizing" users here
13:03:28 <hypokeimenon[m]> Google's kernel gives an indication as to the difference between Pixel 3(a) and Pixel 4(a) maybe but not a production GrapheneOS build for both- is what anupritaisno is saying
13:04:06 <aeonsolution[m]> I am not disputing any of that. I don't know where you see that I am.
13:04:51 <aeonsolution[m]> anu inserted himself into my message sharing resources for those that are curious.
13:05:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "anu inserted himself into my mes"> No I did not
13:05:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> They didn't 'insert themselves'. They believed your suggestion was not directly relevant
13:05:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> You are showing a video from 2018 as a "resource" for a device released in 2020
13:06:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> And you are linking to upstream AOSP documentation
13:06:24 <aeonsolution[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "They didn't 'insert themselves'."> relevant to what?
13:06:37 <aeonsolution[m]> you all have a nice day
13:07:41 <hypokeimenon[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "relevant to what?"> In this instance: "Is the security on the latest build of GrapheneOS for a Pixel 4a the same quality as one for a Pixel 3/Pixel 3a?"
13:08:26 <aeonsolution[m]> you should really read the messages before jumping to conclusions
13:08:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> I am not trying to gand up on you I am trying to explain why it feels like anu jumped on you because I am sure they didn't do it out of malice
13:09:20 <aeonsolution[m]> Who said that you were?
13:09:48 <aeonsolution[m]> Didn't know anu needed people to defend him either but noted.
13:09:57 <hypokeimenon[m]> To be honest, I have made a mistake
13:10:12 <hypokeimenon[m]> There was no reference to Pixel 3s only Pixel 4 vs Pixel 4a
13:10:57 <aeonsolution[m]> Its fine. No harm, no foul.
13:12:18 <aeonsolution[m]> I should of been more clear too and said its the same kernel version.
13:12:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> * I am not trying to gang up on you I am trying to explain why it feels like anu jumped on you because I am sure they didn't do it out of malice
13:13:06 <aeonsolution[m]> Which is what I was referring to when I shared the resources.
13:41:02 <redu321[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "redu321: if you are curious and "> tnx!
13:57:29 <strcat[m]> alcastronic: the Pixel 4a 5G is a totally different device from the 4a, more similar to the 5, and no work on support for it has been done
14:13:21 <alcastronic[m]> strcat: thanks for clarificaton, I was not sure how different 4a and 4a 5G are
15:34:57 <r0tt0r[m]> <alcastronic[m] "The port of GrapheneOS to the Pi"> from what i see and use since a week, pretty stable and dint encounter any issue so far
15:35:27 <r0tt0r[m]> * from what i see and use since a week, pretty stable and didnt encounter any issue so far
16:00:05 <NorbertTretkowsk> Works fine on my 4a as well since a week, no issues.
16:04:18 <projectmoon> No glitches here either
16:24:53 <dar_gomml[m]> Can i find Information about the backup feature somewhere?
16:25:11 <dar_gomml[m]> > No glitches here either
16:25:11 <dar_gomml[m]> Same here.
16:28:54 <Remutheythem[m]> Strangely old messages reappearing?
17:04:01 <pixel24> Hi@all, I would like to try GRaphenOS I have my own Grouware server (Kopano). From my Android I accessed it via Active-Sync (Exchange account on Android). Does this also work in GraphenOS?
17:04:01 <pixel24> with best
17:09:03 <Vappy[m]> Did you guys prune the channel recently?
17:14:52 <Linus[m]> people are kicked after being idle for 30days
17:18:34 <louipc> dang lurkers
17:32:06 <strcat[m]> Vappy: Matrix kicks users that have been idle for 30 days
17:32:10 <strcat[m]> Vappy: it's not our choice
17:32:39 <dazinism> dar_gomml: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
17:32:42 <strcat[m]> if you don't interact with the Matrix IRC bridge at all for 30 days, it kicks you from all bridged IRC channels
17:32:58 <strcat[m]> so if you don't post here for 30 days and don't otherwise interact with it, it will kick you
17:33:05 <strcat[m]> unfortunately they don't consider read receipts interaction
17:33:08 <Vappy[m]> Yeah thats totally understandable. You guys want to keep costs down
17:33:17 <strcat[m]> Vappy: again, it's not our decision
17:33:22 <strcat[m]> Vappy: this is what Matrix does
17:33:24 <Vappy[m]> Thanks for letting me know though
17:33:37 <strcat[m]> Vappy: it's matrix.org that does this for their IRC bridge
17:33:46 <strcat[m]>  * Vappy: it's matrix.org that does this for their IRC bridges
17:33:50 <Remutheythem[m]> <dazinism "dar_gomml: https://hub.libranet."> Is it advisable to enable backup manager on secondary users?
17:33:57 <somenerd[m]> rather annoying for IRC lurkers
17:34:05 <strcat[m]> Vappy: we don't want this, but we don't have a way to configure or disable it, it's just how Matrix implements the IRC bridges
17:34:06 <dazinism> dar_gomml GrapheneOS has updated seedvault a bit since all that was written, but think most of it is pretty much still true.
17:34:24 <Vappy[m]> Ohhh
17:34:37 <strcat[m]> this is an IRC channel with a Matrix bridge to it
17:34:40 <Vappy[m]> Alright
17:34:46 <strcat[m]> Matrix's IRC bridge bot kicks users that are idle for 30 days
17:34:47 <Vappy[m]> Understandable
17:35:03 <strcat[m]> if it was up to us, read receipts would count as interaction
17:35:23 <Vappy[m]> Matrix is just way too slow sometimes so I dropped it for a while
17:35:40 <dazinism> Apparently freenode insisted on that to allow matrix to bridge.
17:35:42 <strcat[m]> I suggest trying to talk the Matrix developers into treating read receipts as not being idle
17:35:54 <strcat[m]> dazinism: the way it's implemented is unfortunate though
17:36:00 <strcat[m]> Vappy: recommend using IRC then
17:36:06 <strcat[m]> Vappy: won't have lag, won't get kicked for being idle
17:36:24 <strcat[m]> although if you don't have a client connected you won't get the messages
17:36:33 <strcat[m]> but you could just look at the archived logs if you wanted to see those
17:37:08 <Vappy[m]> Makes sense
17:37:25 <dazinism> I kinda thought it kicked if you hadn't used a matrix client for x days, but I could well of misunderstood
17:37:40 <Vappy[m]> Did the grapheneOS a11 come out yet? Or is that still in the works
17:37:59 <dazinism> Its been out for a while now
17:38:06 <dazinism> Check the releases
17:38:09 <Linus[m]> out for awhile
17:39:00 <Remutheythem[m]> <Vappy[m] "Did the grapheneOS a11 come out "> Been there for a month
17:39:13 <Remutheythem[m]> Unlike some other "secure" OS out there
17:39:59 <Remutheythem[m]> OSs* (plural)
17:40:32 <Vappy[m]> Goddamn you guys work fast
17:41:17 <Vappy[m]> Im still waiting on lineage to release their a11 so I can update my phone
17:41:35 <louipc> pixel24: a user said that microsoft exchange app works
17:42:12 <Remutheythem[m]> <Vappy[m] "Im still waiting on lineage to r"> Quite influenced by the security-privacy priority of this OS development.
17:43:21 <strcat[m]> dazinism: no you get kicked based on lack of interaction (and read receipts don't count) with the IRC bridge
17:43:47 <strcat[m]> it's a problematic policy and has substantially reduced the size of this channel
17:43:55 <strcat[m]> Matrix has been quite problematic for us
17:47:38 <pixel24> Do I need an extra app under GraphenOS for Exchange access or is it in the system under Account like the "normal" Android?
17:53:49 <strcat[m]> you need an app
17:54:13 <strcat[m]> pixel24: Android itself hasn't provided Exchange support for several years - it is only provided via Play services
17:55:13 <strcat[m]> there are various email apps that work on GrapheneOS (or Android without Play services) and have exchange support
17:57:23 <mmcblk0[m]> Please how can i add google mail account?
17:58:04 <pixel24> In addition to e-mail, the previous "Exchange" account also includes contacts, calendar, tasks and notes. This seems to be a bit more difficult on GraphenOS. Are there any users here who use it?
18:35:29 <SB13X> WINDOWS INSTALL: Hi guys can someone help me with install, I'm using the latest fastboot downloaded twice one through the command line link in the install guide and again direct from Android Dev site. It is: 30.0.4-6686687. Yet I keep getting the outdated error when running the flash-all.bat
18:38:53 <Remutheythem[m]> Tried which fastboot?
18:41:01 <SB13X> fastboot --version
18:42:28 <SB13X> Downloaded from https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip using the command line install guide method and direct download. The is for a Pixel 3 updated to Android 11 latest security patch btw.
18:44:39 <SB13X> Throws this error when typing flash-all.bat
18:44:42 <SB13X> fastboot : The term 'fastboot' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.

18:45:19 <SB13X> fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html
18:50:13 <SB13X> Can I just enter each of the individual flash command inside the .bat file one after the other instead without issue?
18:51:28 <SB13X> Remutheythem[m]?
18:51:38 <SB13X> Remutheythem[m] ?
18:54:15 <strcat[m]> looks like the end of the road for the Pixel 2 and 2 XL
18:54:34 <strcat[m]> pixel24: it's not more difficult, you just need to install an app (or apps) supporting it
18:54:49 <strcat[m]> pixel24: the apps don't come with the OS like the stock OS but they exist
18:55:52 <strcat[m]> pixel24: I don't really want to recommend apps that I haven't used, so I'm not going to list the names of apps, but they exist
18:56:28 <strcat[m]> mmcblk0: like any other email account, they support standard IMAP, etc.
18:56:38 <strcat[m]> add it in your preferred mail client
18:56:57 <pixel24> ok, thanks. I try it :-)
18:58:40 <SB13X> nvm managed to get it installed using the individual commands in the flash-all.bat file which appears to be broken :S
19:00:00 <strcat[m]> SB13X: it's not broken, you're not correctly following the instructions
19:00:10 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't be running them one by one by hand
19:00:35 <strcat[m]> it looks like you didn't set up your path
19:01:00 <strcat[m]> and you're doing things your own way instead of following the guide - strongly not recommended, and if you're doing that you'll be own your own and can't get support here
19:03:07 <strcat[m]> make sure you're using PowerShell as the guide says and make sure you run the command to set up the path for fastboot: https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
19:03:19 <strcat[m]> you aren't supposed to change your directory into the platform-tools directory, it never says to do that
19:03:53 <strcat[m]> pay attention to whether you get an error message from any of the commands and if you do, stop there to figure it out
19:03:58 <strcat[m]> don't skip anything
19:05:01 <strcat[m]> you should be able to run `fastboot --version` in the shell from *any* directory if you've set it up properly, if you changed into the platform-tools directory, that was something not part of the guide and is just masking the problem (not setting up the path)
19:05:32 <strcat[m]> and don't use any unofficial guides even as a reference - the most common ones are incorrect
19:08:02 <SB13X> I get you just unaware of what negative effects doing it manually as opposed to automatically could introduce however just to avoid any possible future issues I'll do it again for peace of mind after having a quick reccy around the OS.
19:09:48 <makingaliasesisa> he is daniel micay just saying
19:09:55 <strcat[m]> SB13X: if you've successfully locked the bootloader you don't need to do it again
19:10:02 <strcat[m]> but the flash-all script is not broken
19:10:59 <SB13X> I agree and recall my previous statement was supposed to be a question but either way I concede.
19:11:43 <strcat[m]> we eventually want to make a WebUSB flashing tool but we don't have the resources to implement it from scratch ATM
19:12:57 <st23gr> Can anybody recommend a maps app for grapheneOS
19:16:49 <fragaria[m]> st23gr: i use osmand+
19:18:51 <fragaria[m]>  * st23gr: i use osmand+ , you can find it for free on the f-droid repo
19:23:29 <strcat[m]> https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/packages/apps/Gallery2/+/1471522 didn't have the right reviewer on it but I added them and it should get fixed upstream now, already fixed for our next release (today)

20:36:37 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 and 2 XL support is officially obsolete
20:37:16 <strcat[m]> we may decide to do post-EOL releases for them but it won't be at the regular schedule and depends on people interested in working on harm reduction for something that should no longer be used
20:37:30 <strcat[m]> there were no Pixel 2 or 2 XL maintainers
21:11:25 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a support is no longer experimental, and that will probably be the recommended device for most people (along with Pixel 4 and 4 XL)

22:18:23 <dazinism> All sounds good. I'd read somewhere (android police?) that the Pixel 2/XL would get December from Google same as it was with the Pixel 1

22:25:54 <louipc> time to gear up for pixel 5 :D
22:46:50 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "https://source.android.com/secur"> > Source code patches for these issues will be released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository in the next 48 hours.
22:46:57 <Dylanger[m]> I assume you'll create a tagged release
22:47:39 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: it's already all rebased onto the new upstream releases
22:47:44 <strcat[m]> the kernel tags are what gets uploaded last
22:48:19 <strcat[m]> dazinism: maybe but doesn't seem they'll get November patch actually in November
22:48:30 <strcat[m]> we'll just consider them obsolete now
22:48:36 <strcat[m]> if they get another update we'll ship it
22:48:41 <strcat[m]> keeping them around in the sources
22:48:57 <strcat[m]> shipping a partial security update for them is possible too
22:49:10 <strcat[m]> we'll need to add a check for Pixel 2 and 2 XL in the file setting the security patch
22:49:33 <Dylanger[m]> Do I need to re `repo init`? Or just do a `repo sync`?
22:49:35 <strcat[m]> might just do that once to ship 2020-11-01 for them (since they don't have 2020-11-05 available)
22:49:44 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: redo repo init in the same source tree
22:49:52 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: otherwise it'll try to merge the new manifest changes
22:49:59 <Dylanger[m]> Thank you
22:50:00 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: we rebase our changes onto each new stable release
22:50:06 <strcat[m]> instead of merging them
22:50:17 <strcat[m]> because we treat it as a downstream patch set
22:50:36 <strcat[m]> and also the stable releases aren't always just the continuation of the same branch
22:50:43 <strcat[m]> in this case, yeah, it's just android11-release branch
