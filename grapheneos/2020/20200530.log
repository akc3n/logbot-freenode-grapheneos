00:00:55 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] "you guys are missing the point"> I think both approaches are very useful, the blogs or knowledge bases or FAQ is very well suited for ppl who are new and wanna know more and well instead of constantly asking, they can spend some time and read those
00:00:55 <chani1> cn3m[m]: so maybe it's another opportunity for someone else to contribute
00:02:00 <chani1> mxnorvak[m]: I agree! That's how I got into learning more about the project
00:02:26 <chani1> cn3m[m]: reddit is absolutely a hive of scum and villany, which is why I gave up on the idea of trying to find useful info there
00:02:27 <mxnorvak[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "I think both approaches are very"> Myself included, i always have tons of questions
00:05:40 <chani1> cn3m[m]: and maybe I'm being too optimistic and biased, but I'd think a large population on the subreddits are average people who are interested in privacy and security but aren't actually developers themselves.
00:07:32 <chani1> but a lot of people struggle to read websites where you have to look up every third word, and unless you can evaluate the arguments on a website, it just looks like slapfights, like every other comment section on every other website
00:07:48 <chani1> which a lot of people, myself included, basically just tune out
00:10:33 <chani1> err, sorry, by "arguments on a website" I meant to write "arguments on reddit"
00:29:51 <cn3m[m]> Blog posts are why this problem started
00:29:55 <cn3m[m]> you will just be labeled a shill if you can't counter their groupthink which is what will happen with posting a blog
00:30:22 <cn3m[m]> look what I'm talking about
00:30:28 <cn3m[m]> here's a conversation right now

00:31:06 <cn3m[m]> one guy is downvoting me since he doesn't agree with the facts I share
00:31:10 <cn3m[m]> there are two of these guys and their alts that do this
00:31:34 <cn3m[m]> I'm four times as active as them
00:32:15 <cn3m[m]> If people contributed it wouldn't just me getting singled out as the only person on every random post
00:32:24 <cn3m[m]> would make the work easier for all of us
00:32:26 <cn3m[m]> look at how well written the grpaheneos site is
00:32:31 <cn3m[m]> people still don't understand it and post bullshit about it
00:34:49 <cn3m[m]> madaidans-insecurities.github.io is from a security researcher from a well respected project. They still dismiss it and the only way it get's shared on Reddit
00:35:45 <cn3m[m]> writings from Daniel and Aidan get shot down. A random blog will probably be hit much worse
00:39:33 <cn3m[m]> welcome
00:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
00:43:36 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] "Blog posts are why this problem "> Tbh i think this is incorrect, there are tons of blogs about many subjects, the problem in this case is the trolls that choose a blog or a developer's work and start attacking it, and well they might be misinformed or even have bad intentions, that doesn't mean the blog shouldn't have been written in the first place
00:47:08 <cn3m[m]> I'm not saying that
00:47:13 <cn3m[m]> I'm saying there's better ways to spend your time
00:47:17 <cn3m[m]> that makes a difference
00:47:51 <chani1> cn3m[m]: by arguing with people on the internet?
00:48:09 <cn3m[m]> yes
00:48:22 <cn3m[m]> there's much more that I do than that
00:48:30 <dazinism> chani1:  yes, looks like you can. Under the list of pages theres 'add new page'
00:49:17 <chani1> dazinism: after I click that, the build button doesn't appear to do anything after type in the new page name.
00:49:37 <dazinism> If you are on mobile have to tap on the right arrow up top near the ëÅî menu
00:49:48 <chani1> I'm not on mobile
00:50:24 <dazinism> Thats just so you can see the list of pages (left hand pane)
00:52:29 <dazinism> chani1: I'm looking at it now, see whats going on...
00:52:35 <chani1> dazinism: thanks
00:54:25 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] "I'm saying there's better ways t"> Yeah stopping the spread of misinformation and correcting ppl is important, having that source to be able to read is also important in my opinion and i was under the impression that you are against it cause it may led to ppl misusing it and spread more misinformation
00:55:15 <mxnorvak[m]> And for those kinda folks
00:55:27 <mxnorvak[m]> I think they'll always find a way
00:55:48 <cn3m[m]> Reddit whatever has the most upvotes people believe
00:56:00 <cn3m[m]> If I can make a strong case and just get a few upvotes that works
00:56:37 <cn3m[m]> they won't even take the time to read a blog
00:56:51 <cn3m[m]> you can see in comments that they don't know half of what the article said
00:57:42 <cn3m[m]> What makes you think you could do better than a well known security researcher like Daniel or Aidan is my question
00:58:17 <TheJollyRoger> The Dunning Kruger Effect...?
01:00:51 <cn3m[m]> I mean that's a little harsh, but I guess that's what I mean yeah
01:00:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
01:02:38 <dazinism> chani1: looks like you need an account on any Hubzilla server
01:02:55 <dazinism> I can create a page / some pages for you now if you like
01:02:58 <TheJollyRoger> I get the impression that with sports it's the same story, the people that are usually the ones being the loudest Monday Morning Armchair Quarterbacks have never put on a pair of cleats and stepped onto the field, and don't have any of the appreciation of the amount of work it takes to "get good." But with sports usually the great realization comes within hours of lacing up your cleats... seems
01:02:59 <TheJollyRoger> with computers that moment might never come because it's not like there's a great big wall of linebackers to crash into the moment someone shouts "Hike!"
01:03:20 <dazinism> chani1: then you can edit them
01:03:24 <chani1> cn3m[m]: if you're talking about me, I'm not suggesting I can

01:04:17 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org there's some serious grandstanding
01:04:36 <TheJollyRoger> Aaargh.
01:05:04 <chani1> cn3m[m]: I am saying that a lot of what's out there, including (to a lesser extent) the GrapheneOS website, is not accessable to the average user
01:05:35 <cn3m[m]> privacy blogs are all funded by sketchy VPNs or something
01:05:42 <cn3m[m]> it's impossible to make headway
01:06:20 <TheJollyRoger> Really does remind me of "Operation Orchestra".
01:06:56 <yolotrolo[m]> is netguard filtering mode working on graphene? because on their fake it's said that it was not working with copperhead
01:07:07 <yolotrolo[m]> ok their FAQ*
01:07:14 <chani1> TheJollyRoger: what's operation orchestra?
01:07:37 <cn3m[m]> Reddit is where these ideas spread since it's group think. People can just upvote what fits their worldview and don't have to contribute
01:07:48 <cn3m[m]> we need people commenting to change the perceptions
01:07:50 <cn3m[m]> that's why I post on everything related
01:08:19 <cn3m[m]>  @mxnorvak:matrix.org yeah he looked for a guide I'm not saying he didn't
01:08:23 <chani1> cn3m[m]: and I'm willing to help, which is why I'm trying to educate myself enough that I'm not spouting nonsense
01:08:28 <cn3m[m]> anyway he's not the problem
01:09:04 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_chani1:matrix.org then have a mock debate with me where I'm playing a part of someone who's selling privacy or security theater
01:09:25 <cn3m[m]> that's the best way I can help
01:09:37 <cn3m[m]> you can also see what I comment on Reddit and weigh in
01:09:43 <chani1> cn3m[m]: ok
01:09:47 <cn3m[m]> can't hurt
01:10:17 <chani1> I just honestly can't help but think there's got to be something better we can do than argue with people like that anonymouse guy
01:10:37 <cn3m[m]> anyone can dm me and I'll help them
01:10:45 <cn3m[m]> it's not rocket science and I'm already pouring many hours a day into this I can handle it
01:10:52 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_chani1:matrix.org that's a tiny fraction of what I do
01:11:04 <cn3m[m]> that's just what ends up here
01:11:11 <cn3m[m]> I win those debates which is something
01:11:32 <cn3m[m]> this works this is how this stuff started in the first place this is how it will end

01:17:02 <hugosmith> Hi there! Can someone confirm if GrapheneOS has native call recording? If not, are there any third party apps to do this?
01:20:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hey chani1, Operation Orchestra is a funny skit done by one of the FreeBSD lead developers where he plays the role of a junior NSA agent that accidentally leaks top secret documents on how to make mass surveillance easier by undermining, sowing discord, and uncertainty, and disagreement within Open Source without breaking any rules, and all being above board.
01:20:39 <TheJollyRoger> Although it's quite obviously satire, a lot of it turned out to be very prophetic.
01:20:49 <TheJollyRoger> Give me a minute and I'll go and pull it up for you.
01:21:40 <TheJollyRoger> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwcl17Q0bpk chani1 try this one.
01:22:15 <chani1> TheJollyRoger: that's hilarious (and a perfect depiction of reddit)
01:22:27 <TheJollyRoger> hugosmith: Ahoy! GrapheneOS doesn't natively implement recording. I think there actually may require be specific permissions required in order to access or control the phone.
01:22:51 <TheJollyRoger> *I think there actually maybe specific permissions or security policies around controlling the phone on Android, since that's a fairly sensitive permission.
01:23:14 <TheJollyRoger> chani1: hehe, I actually really like this talk. It's incredibly relevant today, and it's amazing how long ago the talk was first made!
01:24:10 <TheJollyRoger> I think PHK wanted to put on black shades, slick his hair back, wear a headphone and a suit but the FreeBSD people didn't have enough time for it so in some versions of the talk he just says "you'll have to just use your imagination."
01:29:32 <hugosmith> Thank you TheJollyRoger. I've seen some phone brands that offer this feature wide open, others that retrict it to some regions only, and even some of them that restrict it completely. I'd hope GrapheneOS would offer this feature to their users (at least as an optional setting on a call by call basis), so they can activate it when needed.
01:30:28 <hugosmith> Do you know of any third party app that allows someone to record a call on GrapheneOS?
01:30:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I've noticed that for some reason apps that can record calls are curiously sparse, I've wondered if Android doesn't allow that but haven't investigated.
01:31:31 <TheJollyRoger> I don't, not at this moment. There was an ancient app in F-Droid that claimed it would, but when I tested it, recorded nothing but silence.
01:32:09 <TheJollyRoger> So that's why I think it /might/ not be allowed, but again, I'm not sure and I'd have to look into that.
01:32:56 <TheJollyRoger> (As in, there might be an assumption that for security purposes, only certain privileged system apps have access to control the phone)
01:32:57 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org if you try to add it upstream. GrapheneOS will get it
01:33:35 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. Uh... hehehe I uh... I'm not quite in a position to try to send anything upstream.
01:34:07 <TheJollyRoger> Except maybe cookies. (As in, the kind that you eat, not the kind you clear out of your browser cache on a regular basis, but those I want to send in to this project first :P.)
01:34:10 <cn3m[m]> wrong ping sorry
01:34:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ah ahaha oops :P.
01:36:10 <hugosmith> I see. If you find something about it, or hear any plans about future implementation of call recording, would you please post it here TheJollyRoger?
01:37:29 <hugosmith> Right now I'd really like to get rid of Google on my phone, but I *need* call recording, so bad news for me I guess. 8(
01:38:07 <TheJollyRoger> hugosmith: if I find out I'll give you a shout!
01:38:18 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_hugosmith:matrix.org Doesn't iPhone have?
01:38:19 <cn3m[m]> this*
01:40:17 <hugosmith> I think it doesn't cn3m[m]. You have to rent some third party call service, add them to the conversation, and they are not cheap.
01:40:54 <dazinism> hugosmith: think its possible but disabled on must androids. If I'm not getting confused blocking recording was brought in on Nougat?
01:41:02 <cn3m[m]> wouldn't Google voice do this for free?
01:41:32 <cn3m[m]> then you don't need Google play services?
01:41:33 <hugosmith> Google voice is not available in my country.
01:41:35 <DannyWorkOrderPr> hugosmith: Is using a normal voice recorder on speakerphone an option? Works great for my usecase.
01:43:00 <hugosmith> DannyWorkOrderPr: you need a really quite environment to properly record a phone call like that, otherwise it would collect a lot of background noise, and it wouldn't be private at all.
01:43:04 <TheJollyRoger> I've got a splitter box and use the USB-C converter that came in the box with my phone... but that requires some actual hardware.
01:43:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <TheJollyRoger "I've got a splitter box and use "> Yeah, running it into the Line In/mic port of a laptop desktop could work, no?
01:43:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Or you can buy USB ones for around $10 or so.
01:45:29 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: check PM
01:45:37 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, sorry.
01:46:16 <hugosmith> Yes, that's another option TheJollyRoger, but I prefer it to be a mobile self-contanied solution. When I answer a call, usually I cannot start plugins cables, or even don't have the required additional hardware arround (I'd have to carry it with me all the time).
01:46:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I gotcha.
01:47:38 <hugosmith> I hope someday GrapheneOS could add this feature. Thank you for your time. Best regards.
01:47:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. The capability is probably there in Android. If you're a developer, I think the best way to get it added would be to write the code and make the PR.
01:48:25 <hugosmith> I'm just a regular user. I wouldn't know where to start.
01:48:39 <TheJollyRoger> Well, so am I, so I'm learning :P.
01:49:47 <hugosmith> Good for you! Maybe one day I will try, who knows.
01:49:52 <TheJollyRoger> That's the spirit :D

03:18:39 <analog[m]> Yeah lmao touche.
03:18:59 <analog[m]> You're either trusting shit or complete randoms.
03:20:50 <BobVila> I just got an unlocked pixel 3a, and should I install graphene before or after switching phones?
03:21:14 <BobVila> cell carrier*
03:23:40 <yolotrolo[m]> guys no one replied to my question:( i asked if the filtering mode of netguard was working or not on graphene os because it was not working with copperhead, thanks
03:25:02 <yolotrolo[m]> maybe no one use it
03:25:04 <strcat[m]> should work fine
03:25:16 <strcat[m]> don't think it's particularly useful but should work fine...
03:25:31 <strcat[m]> cause we have the upstream implementation of that feature which has an exception for VPN apps
03:25:36 <strcat[m]> rather than our old one
03:26:39 <yolotrolo[m]> ho ok, thanks, i like it because it give you a detailed log of which apps are connecting to which domain
03:31:50 <renlord> BobVila: does not matter.
03:33:56 <BobVila> Ok, thanks.
03:35:17 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_BobVila:matrix.org welcome btw
03:51:28 <BobVila> thanks :)

04:48:25 <furofuro_01[m]> I am not sure if this is allowed, but
04:48:26 <furofuro_01[m]> Any comments about CalyxOS
04:48:44 <furofuro_01[m]> No one talks about it on privacy subreddits
04:49:17 <aeonsolution[m]> hey furofuro, to get the best response you should have specific questions
04:49:45 <aeonsolution[m]> or you can look at the logs on https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
04:51:32 <furofuro_01[m]> My apologies. It just struck into my curiosity, and I am not that knowledgeable about that OS too (hence cannot conclude about it in comparision to GrapheneOS, although the latter is most likely better at security and privacy)
04:52:28 <aeonsolution[m]> it depends on your use case and security model, you should look at both projects and try to figure out whats best for you
04:52:42 <aeonsolution[m]> both are really good options
04:53:08 <baldgeek123[m]> Calyx has microg, so for some that might be a bonus?
04:54:16 <chani> furofuro_01[m]: good timing! cn3m[m] just answered that question on reddit recently:
04:54:25 <chani> https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/gt6fvg/calyx_os_vs_graphene_os/
04:54:28 <furofuro_01[m]> Thanks. Threat model is major data collecting companies and ISP, and security model is generally for it to be not to be easily hacked or attacked by malware.
04:54:54 <furofuro_01[m]> chani: Thanks.
04:55:15 <chani> furofuro_01[m]: hope it helps :)
04:56:21 <furofuro_01[m]> Yeah. It helps to have an overview.
04:56:28 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a second.
04:57:13 <TheJollyRoger> furofuro_01[m]: https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge I've got a small overview. You can check "GrapheneOS versus Others" and you can see a bit of a side by side comparison I've quickly written up, if you like.
04:57:52 <cn3m[m]>  @furofuro_01:matrix.org CalyxOS sounds right if you want a touch of Google crud and a healthy dose of AOSP goodness
04:57:52 <TheJollyRoger> That's just a quick, "TLDR" version, there's quite a lot more that can be said, you could quite easily write books on the subject, so I tried to condense it down into about a 30-second read for each entry.
04:58:04 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is still an option with the devices
04:58:17 <cn3m[m]> so you aren't locked in
04:58:39 <cn3m[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/gt0t2d/im_so_confused/
04:58:45 <cn3m[m]> that hardening guide again... ugh
04:58:56 <cn3m[m]> why do people still find that?
04:58:57 <furofuro_01[m]> Alright. Thought it has support for earlier Pixels
04:59:07 <cn3m[m]>  @furofuro_01:matrix.org Pixel 2-4
04:59:14 <furofuro_01[m]> (Cant afford a pixel 3a atm, guess I better wait for now.)
04:59:17 <cn3m[m]> you need Rattlesnake to support Pixel 1
04:59:29 <cn3m[m]> and it is not dropping support for 3 months
04:59:57 <furofuro_01[m]> Pixel 2 doesnt seem to be that worth with its support time, despite almost half the price of 3a
05:00:02 <cn3m[m]> Rattlesnake is stock AOSP with no hardening or gapps added. You build it yourself but it's super easy
05:00:22 <cn3m[m]> what do you have right now? Pixel 1?
05:00:35 <furofuro_01[m]> None of them yet
05:01:13 <furofuro_01[m]> Planning to buy soon, and Pixel 3a is the best option for support time, albeit quite expensive on my country (around $400)
05:01:13 <cn3m[m]> what phone do you have right now?
05:01:30 <furofuro_01[m]> ASUS M1 pro
05:01:33 <TheJollyRoger> furofuro_01[m]: yes, pixel3a is currently your best bet for value for the money.
05:01:36 <cn3m[m]> can't go wrong with a 3a or soon 4a
05:01:55 <furofuro_01[m]> 4a is too expensive (maybe)
05:02:03 <cn3m[m]> 4a won't be supported for a bit though
05:02:09 <cn3m[m]> pixel 3a is great I have one
05:02:25 <furofuro_01[m]> I have limited options as of now though, and thinking twice due to <2 years support
05:03:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <furofuro_01[m] "4a is too expensive (maybe)"> AliExpress and Swappa can cut that price you mentioned in half, depending on when you check
05:03:19 <furofuro_01[m]> (I really cant change phones that often, but this is the best compromise I have for better privacy and security tandem investment for the future.)
05:03:24 <cn3m[m]> if money is that tight I'd get a used iPhone
05:03:40 <cn3m[m]> you can keep them longer and they have great security relatively even with the older ones
05:03:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, seconded!
05:04:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <DannyWorkOrderPr "AliExpress and Swappa can cut th"> Sorry, meant for 3a
05:04:42 <cn3m[m]> iPhone are still in the comparable zone to the GrapheneOS ones for both privacy and security
05:04:48 <cn3m[m]> there's a lot of pros and cons
05:04:53 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "if money is that tight I'd get a"> Thanks for the suggestion, will think about it soon.
05:04:54 <cn3m[m]> no clear winner
05:05:23 <cn3m[m]> definitely get a Pixel if you're interested in development though ;-P
05:05:29 <furofuro_01[m]> As far as I had read before, I agree.
05:05:44 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "definitely get a Pixel if you're"> Completely zero knowledge though, although I am interested to partake soon
05:05:58 <cn3m[m]>  @furofuro_01:matrix.org yeah iPhone 8 is $150 for 2.5-4.5 years of support here
05:06:01 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
05:06:01 <cn3m[m]> which is pretty insane value
05:06:18 <cn3m[m]> hard to say no to that for a security privacy budget argument
05:06:46 <furofuro_01[m]> Wish they do offer that phone on that cheap price here
05:07:28 <cn3m[m]> worth checking iPhone used get around the world
05:07:51 <cn3m[m]> it does checkm8, but don't leave your phone unattended without rebooting when you get it back
05:08:04 <cn3m[m]> that's pretty reasonable opsec on any phone
05:08:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yay for verified boot :D
05:08:27 <cn3m[m]> I love verified boot
05:09:32 <furofuro_01[m]> Alright. Will update you soon
05:09:41 <furofuro_01[m]> Maybe in three months
05:10:28 <furofuro_01[m]> About the phone, but most probably I'm getting a Pixel due to preference to android (and also having at least a little more control (correct me if I'm wrong) on my device)
05:10:44 <cn3m[m]> The mind boggling thing is iPhone 5s from 7 years ago still has some critical security advantages over the majority of Androids
05:10:59 <cn3m[m]> I wonder if they are ever going to stop updating that thing
05:11:03 <TheJollyRoger> And device support!
05:11:17 <cn3m[m]> Pixel is amazing
05:12:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <furofuro_01[m] "About the phone, but most probab"> More networking etc control, and also more freedom to dick yourself in the ass, too
05:12:58 <furofuro_01[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Sorry, meant for 3a"> On a side note, Swappa does not deliver outside US sadly
05:13:30 <DannyWorkOrderPr> furofuro_01: Depends on the seller, I'd comment on a listing and ask if they'd adjust the price to ship international if you're interested
05:13:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> (Unless some policy has changed)
05:18:24 <cn3m[m]>  @dannyknoll:matrix.org networking control does screw you if you want to block domains though haha
05:18:53 <cn3m[m]> iOS doesn't let you bypass DNS blocks
05:54:34 <zxwayland> hi
05:58:30 <cn3m[m]> hello
06:09:31 <marlow11[m]> I'm just hoping my pixel 2 hangs in there until I can get a newer model supported by grapheneOS. Past experience has given me about a 3-6 month timeline after contract ends until device craps itself :-/
06:12:13 <overheadscallop[> cn3m: please check dm
06:24:36 <cg_droid> TheJollyRoger, great work with all the FAQs in that link üôÇ
06:24:48 <cg_droid> Thank you for the update strcat[m]
06:25:46 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], do you ever sleep? lol üòâ
06:36:22 <cg_droid> yolotrolo[m], yes, Netguard works great with GrapheneOS (GOS) but you don't really need it. I used it before.
06:37:37 <cg_droid> But I understand that it's a great tool to analyze the connections your smartphone makes
06:38:08 <cg_droid> But also notice that you're giving Network permission to that app
07:03:40 <cg_droid> Question: after the update, is it safe to disable A2DP BT again? will it work receiving calls through the speakers?, Pixel 3a here.
07:04:29 <cg_droid> I need to test it but if you've already done it please tell me. Thanks
07:09:03 <joshman[m]> <cg_droid "Question: after the update, is i"> It's not only safe. It's recommend to turn developer settings off

07:10:13 <cg_droid> joshman[m], why?, for example I see the open processese and what they are wasting there, disable animations...
07:10:22 <cg_droid> joshman[m], why?, for example I see the open processes and what they are wasting there, disable animations...
07:11:06 <cg_droid> isn't it safe if you don't touch something sensible?
07:11:22 <strcat[m]> big if
07:11:32 <strcat[m]> do you know what the setting you changed does
07:11:42 <cg_droid> Good point strcat[m]
07:11:54 <cg_droid> Not really...
07:12:10 <cg_droid> Please tell me
07:14:37 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], one of these days I will dm you to learn and help
07:16:53 <aeonsolution[m]> cg_droid if you have a Pixel 3a, I can help you out. What are you trying to accomplish right now?
07:23:09 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]:  only asking if I can disable developer options now with the update. I enabled A2DP BT to receive calls through the speakers, it wasn't working before when it was  disabled. But reading strcat[m] and joshman[m] words I think it's better to disable the developers options now
07:25:37 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]: and also answering about what cn3m said to teach us to help,  I don't know about code
07:27:27 <aeonsolution[m]> Are you on a regular release? You should disable developers options after disabled OEM unlocking if you are. https://grapheneos.org/install#disabling-oem-unlocking
07:28:40 <aeonsolution[m]> You don't need to know how to code to help maintain a device starting off. Learning how to build the development branch is a good start.
07:29:08 <cg_droid> Yes, OEM is disabled after I installed Gos
07:29:34 <aeonsolution[m]> This is where most of the testing gets done. The OS is always changing.
07:29:59 <cg_droid> What is the development branch exactly?
07:30:21 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch
07:30:45 <cg_droid> I just disabled developer options. Hating animations but...
07:30:56 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]: thanks, I'll read
07:32:23 <aeonsolution[m]> Software development is important but what is lacking in my opinion is help with the GrapheneOS and supporting the core apps. I don't see a path of expanding into other apps until that gets more support.
07:33:24 <aeonsolution[m]> Ontop of that, hear is strcat guidelines for software development. https://grapheneos.org/build#development-guidelines
07:33:34 <aeonsolution[m]>  * Ontop of that, here is strcat guidelines for software development. https://grapheneos.org/build#development-guidelines
07:35:53 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]: I know nothing about these things. Maybe you thought I knew about languages or code?, confused, sorry.
07:36:03 <cn3m[m]> Anyone tried Android 11 yet?
07:37:07 <aeonsolution[m]> cg_droid: That's a starting point to get started with software development if you aren't going to help with the GrapheneOS or core apps.
07:38:43 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]: knowing nothing, how can I help?, I thought about helping to refute the attacks against strcat in forums, as cn3m said, but need some learning
07:39:35 <cg_droid> That's why I said to cn3m that I'll dm him when I have some time to learn
07:40:36 <cg_droid> I have many debts and this smartphone is like gold to me and the only phone I have...
07:42:02 * radixed9[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/csWdkqcpSLubXlxrdLHivjgX >
07:42:21 <cg_droid> I don't know if it's risky to the smartphone to get involved with the development branch
07:42:40 <radixed9[m]> "I learned programming and computer science on my own as I was doing it." Best advice you'll get
07:44:11 <aeonsolution[m]> cg_droid if you can't help that ok, I was offering you actionable options to get started
07:44:37 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]: thanks
07:45:00 <aeonsolution[m]>  * cg_droid if you can't help that's ok, I was offering you actionable options to get started
07:47:25 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]: I'd like to help but now it's like Chinese to me
07:47:38 <cg_droid> Sorry
07:47:48 <cg_droid> I must learn
07:48:25 <cg_droid> radixed9[m]: great words...
07:48:26 <aeonsolution[m]> its just out of your element, saying its Chinese isn't really the expression you want to use
07:48:44 <radixed9[m]> Android developer blogs and documentation go a long way cg_droid:
07:48:52 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]: ah ok, it's an Spanish expression
07:49:07 <cg_droid> Sorry
07:50:07 <aeonsolution[m]> saying a specific language is hard is derogatory is what i was getting at
07:50:11 <cg_droid> > Android developer blogs and documentation go a long way cg_droid:
07:50:11 <cg_droid> I see, mayne it's easier to learn with cn3m and answer in forums
07:50:13 <aeonsolution[m]> its just out of your skills
07:50:18 <cg_droid> > Android developer blogs and documentation go a long way cg_droid:
07:50:18 <cg_droid> I see, maybe it's easier to learn with cn3m and answer in forums
07:50:23 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]: yes
07:50:42 <cg_droid> And English is not my language
07:50:49 <cg_droid> Sorry then
07:51:47 <cg_droid> Is my nick confusing in chats maybe?
07:52:47 <aeonsolution[m]> i don't know what you mean by that
07:54:03 <cg_droid> The nick cgdroid, if it means something about coding or programming to others...
07:54:47 <aeonsolution[m]> no thats not it, i saw you were reaching out for suggestions so i wanted to give you options that you can research to learn the things you dont know
07:55:34 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m]: i' ll read it and I'll find for answers. Thanks
07:55:44 <cg_droid> Bookmarked

08:17:06 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. Here we go... syncing Vanadium again. Fingers crossed aeonsolution[m]! Thank you!
08:17:56 <aeonsolution[m]> It's happening!
08:18:07 <TheJollyRoger> cg_droid: hey you're welcome. Let me know if you've got one you think you'd like me to answer or something of the sort... I'm off for the night but I will be back tomorrow!
08:34:05 <jalb> TheJollyRoger, what's the link?
09:25:12 <jalb> Here's what the canceled Google Pixel 4a XL would have looked like: https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-what-canceled-google-pixel-4a-xl-would-have-looked
09:28:12 <cn3m[m]> that's a terrible title
09:31:21 <jalb> Clickbait maybe
09:59:38 <jalb> cn3m[m], I read your job was about privacy and ads, what do you think about Adguard through DNS?
10:01:58 <jalb> And reading about what you teach in private to partipate, why don't you write a text file with all the knowledge and so someone could give you the email address and you send it
10:02:35 <cn3m[m]> <jalb "cn3m, I read your job was about "> PrivateDNS on Android?
10:02:37 <cn3m[m]> <jalb "And reading about what you teach"> no one would read it
10:03:10 <cn3m[m]> if people read what I wrote people would read what Daniel writes on Reddit with is a treasure chest compared to what I would write
10:03:36 <jalb> Yes, Private DNS
10:03:57 <jalb> cn3m[m], I mean those interested could send you a DM with the email address and you send it
10:04:04 <jalb> With some instructions and knowledge
10:04:21 <jalb> I mean to learn about what you want to teach
10:04:48 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_jalb:matrix.org reddit.com/u/DanielMicay/comments/top has way more info and better info than I can give
10:05:23 <jalb> ok thanks
10:05:49 <cn3m[m]> I'm not a security researcher I'm a privacy expert who has been off the job for way too long
10:06:38 <cn3m[m]> <jalb "Yes, Private DNS"> that's a long topic
10:06:39 <jalb> Answer to the link: "Sorry, there aren‚Äôt any communities on Reddit with that name."
10:06:41 <cn3m[m]> it's probably good
10:06:54 <cn3m[m]> <jalb "Answer to the link: "Sorry, ther"> I'll fix the link once sec
10:07:02 <jalb> Thanks
10:07:57 <jalb> https://www.reddit.com/user/DanielMicay/comments/?sort=top
10:08:08 <cn3m[m]> yeah that
10:08:08 <jalb> Got it
10:09:01 <jalb> New in reddit
10:09:09 <dazinism> chani1: glad you managed to get started
10:09:12 <cn3m[m]> I source better since I'm not an authority that's really the only advantage I have
10:11:01 <jalb> :)
10:11:06 <jalb> jalb66 there
10:11:55 <cn3m[m]> I'd write a guide to all my knowledge if people really wanted it I guess, but I'm just not there time or knowledge wise
10:12:25 <cn3m[m]> I can't answer everything I pass up a lot of questions even when I know I can give a better answer than most
10:12:50 <jalb> No problem, I think we can manage with that guide you send
10:13:04 <jalb> But it can be good
10:13:17 <jalb> And so we can also fight against all that people against Daniel
10:13:25 <jalb> Thank you cn3m[m]
10:13:52 <jalb> Think about it
10:15:40 <cn3m[m]> I will, but it's a reverse dunning kruger effect
10:15:57 <jalb> But it's something important, I think
10:17:24 <cn3m[m]> I'm the wrong person for it
10:17:35 <cn3m[m]> someone should have a stronger security background
10:17:45 <jalb> I don't think so. I read your posts and I like it
10:18:07 <jalb> And you're already helping us
10:18:10 <cn3m[m]> I'll think about it
10:18:14 <jalb> But it's your choice
10:18:32 <jalb> Thanks
10:19:23 <jalb> I'll try now in the car if I receive the calls with the new update
10:19:27 <jalb> Bye
10:20:33 <cn3m[m]> the main thing is Daniel knows more than me and has written so much on Reddit
10:20:57 <cn3m[m]> there's almost no reason to write anything
10:30:55 <dazinism> cn3m: maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I'm thinking folks are asking for a written guide to countering misinformation / being effective on Reddit, rather than general knowledge.
10:31:40 <dazinism> I get you need the knowledge also (could include links to good sources)
10:33:10 <dazinism> Also maybe suggestion to follow you, links to good  examples of the technique you use when discussing and how it can turn people around?
10:33:57 <dazinism> I like your style
10:47:14 <cn3m[m]> Yeah that's true. I guess I would have to think about if that's an active thing I'm thinking about or a side effect of practice
10:48:25 <jalb> Only to say that calls are working in Pixel 3a with that option in Developer options disabled, tested right now.
10:49:28 <jalb> dazinism, yes, that's what I mean
10:50:01 <jalb> I don't know how to answer those people in Reddit fighting against Daniel
10:50:14 <jalb> I need something more or I can't help
10:50:29 <jalb> I have some knowledge but not enough
10:50:50 <jalb> Or you could create a guide with links
10:51:14 <jalb> dazinism, that's a good poiint
10:54:32 <jalb> Anyway I'll read what I can what Daniel posted there
10:54:34 <jalb> Thanks
11:19:27 <jalb> Never buy a Nokia phone now, really!
11:23:57 <jalb> Time to read Daniel posts in Reddit, bye

11:39:38 <spaceinfinite[m]> Im in europe 13:39 here
11:39:59 <cn3m[m]> California
11:40:13 <spaceinfinite[m]> cn3m: at least you have the weather
11:40:35 <cn3m[m]> that's true
11:40:48 <cn3m[m]> and surprisingly excellent privacy laws right now
11:41:45 <cn3m[m]> CCPA and now that the core law in the NSA surveillance died cause Coronavirus. it's a great place to be
11:53:19 <hitchhooker[m]> wut? didnt the extension go through?
11:55:30 <jalb> cn3m[m], about Nokia Phones: no, it's not referencing something you said, it's only my experience. ACtually I bought a Pixel 3a to scape from them, they have made y Nokia 7,1 useless with wrong updates, you can read in the forum with many users complaining: https://community.phones.nokia.com/discussion/59149/6-months-of-bugs-on-nokia-7-1
11:56:24 <jalb> When they updated the phone in March, you reboot the phone and it's in a loop and impossible to start. the only option is to make a factory reset and avoid new updates!!. That's how my Nokia 7.1 is now, waiting all these months for a fix. Nothing yet.
11:56:50 <hitchhooker[m]> nokia phones dont really have anything to do with nokia company
11:57:26 <jalb> HMD Global now
11:57:37 <jalb> New Nokias are made by them
11:58:07 <cn3m[m]> better to update and break then not update thonks
11:58:17 <jalb> And it's Android one...
11:58:58 <jalb> Happy with Pixel 3a and GOS now :)
11:59:11 <jalb> This freedom...
12:02:51 <mxnorvak[m]> <jalb "When they updated the phone in M"> If it's android one, isn't it on Google to release updates and fixes?
12:04:00 <mxnorvak[m]> I thought its Google's job to update the phone just as they do their own Pixel lineup and Nokia (HMD.) Only makes the hardware
12:07:20 <jalb> No, HMD do it and send them through the ISP,s
12:07:40 <jalb> And it seems they don't test the updated
12:07:44 <jalb> *updates
12:09:46 <jalb> There also some HMD apps in the phone. Camera connects to Facebook, I disabled all the Google apps I don't need or sending connections to Google, but when you disable Google services many apps will send a warning in Notifications telling you that this app won't work without Google services: not true. They work. I disables all these notifications but the Telephone notification wasn't possible.
12:10:03 <jalb> Anyway, using it that way and with Netguard was working ok
12:10:10 <jalb> Until the updates came
12:11:10 <jalb> Google do it, but HMD is the company sending the updates when they consider them ready
12:11:59 <jalb> That's why I said avoid buying a Nokia Phone with Android one. Other models work ok, it seems, but who knows when they'll fail like others...
12:12:13 <jalb> Sorry, it's not something to talk herre
12:12:30 <jalb> But I feel free with GOS, thank you!!
12:13:55 <mxnorvak[m]> Thanks for the info
12:14:06 <jalb> You're welcome
12:15:23 <jalb> Time for siesta :) Bye

17:31:17 <aeonsolution[m]> I'm finishing up building the development branch again. 97%!
17:33:26 <skwisgaar[m]> > CCPA and now that the core law in the NSA surveillance died cause Coronavirus. it's a great place to be
17:33:26 <skwisgaar[m]> cn3m Curious what you're referring to about the NSA, I can't find anything about this
17:36:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> skwisgaar: Search FISA PATRIOT ACT reauthorization
17:36:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If that doesn't get you where you need to be, tack "surveillance" in there, too
17:37:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Use Qwant, Startpage, etc
17:40:06 <cn3m[m]>  @skwisgaar:matrix.org Section 215 bit the dust
17:40:10 <cn3m[m]> for now anyway
17:41:25 <inquiree> My god, the guy is completely misrepresenting his exchange with Daniel

17:43:04 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_inquiree:matrix.org yeah I commented there, but it's not going well
17:43:45 <inquiree> cn3m, check out his latest comment
17:44:32 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_inquiree:matrix.org yeah I commented there, but it's not going well
17:44:40 <inquiree> That might be the coup de gr√¢ce. I don't gave access to my reddit credentials ATM to report him :(
17:46:07 <TheJollyRoger> aeonsolution[m]: aw man awesome! I'm just going over my checklist again to make sure I haven't missed a step.
17:46:47 <inquiree> I'll do it latet
17:46:51 <inquiree> Later*
17:47:42 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_inquiree:matrix.org haha I hope he doesn't get banned tho
17:47:46 <cn3m[m]> he's a joker
17:49:19 <inquiree> He probably has an unholy amount of sockpuppets anyway
17:51:15 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Still needing all those Chrome build dependencies!
17:51:50 <aeonsolution[m]> What do you mean TheJollyRoger?
17:51:56 <cn3m[m]> Man /r/Android was the wrong place to say I like Pixels and iPhones
17:53:26 <TheJollyRoger> Hi aeonsolution[m] I remembered about building Vanadium first, so I went to take a look here... https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/build/install-build-deps.sh I think there might be some of these that are named differently.
17:54:16 <cn3m[m]> Just so you guys know Google's AD ID is all specific and Samsung had CFI(CFP is the same thing) before Google. /s
17:54:28 <aeonsolution[m]> can you send me the error or warning message you got?
17:54:38 <aeonsolution[m]> oh and the command too
17:54:44 <cn3m[m]> my S8 was more revolutionary for security than my Pixel 3a! /s
17:55:37 <TheJollyRoger> aeonsolution[m]: oh I haven't encountered an error just yet, I'm just making sure I got them all, since I don't remember installing any of these, except a few we discussed...?
17:56:52 <aeonsolution[m]> got it; arch lets you download group packages and i want to say that the list i gave you should be enough to get you to build vanadium
17:57:08 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Whew!
17:57:17 <aeonsolution[m]> https://www.archlinux.org/groups/
17:57:56 <aeonsolution[m]> base-devel is a group package for example
17:58:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ohhhh, oh I see.
17:58:25 <TheJollyRoger> Not a specific package, but a big group of packages all bundled together, huh, makes sense, didn't think of it that way!
17:58:43 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah!
17:58:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cn3m[m] "Man /r/Android was the wrong pla"> Really? I figured they had always sort of liked Pixels over there. At least selectively, for camera performance, UI fluidity and close-ness to AOSP. They only really meme battery capacity iirc
17:58:53 <TheJollyRoger> Damn that's smart! Okay, configured gn args and added my cert digest, now, here we go!
17:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> Here we g!
17:59:26 <TheJollyRoger> *here we go!
17:59:36 <TheJollyRoger> Let's see if this one works!
17:59:37 <aeonsolution[m]> it wouldn't hurt to install the packages you found and add the --needed option when you install them; but i think you got them all
17:59:49 <aeonsolution[m]> it should ü§û
17:59:55 <TheJollyRoger> Whew! ^_^
17:59:58 <cn3m[m]>  @hypokeimenon:tchncs.de apparently not
17:59:58 <hypokeimenon[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Really? I figured they had alway"> Also fast patches and OS updates
18:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> Afterward I'll export and copy my sh history and then I can comb through it!
18:00:37 <TheJollyRoger> I just gotta step away from the PC for the moment, I will be right back.
18:00:56 <aeonsolution[m]> kk
18:01:06 <aeonsolution[m]> its going to be a while for the vanadium stuff
18:01:20 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/HcrrjTQVXLrgIBYtFgQjzrWx >
18:01:34 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. It's roughly ~2PM here so I'll check back around suppertime.
18:02:41 <hypokeimenon[m]> tbh Samsung have sort of led the feature-set hardware game with a decent software UI for a while so I've been sympathetic to it too
18:03:06 <cn3m[m]> the sensor permission is really nice
18:03:08 <cn3m[m]> Samsung isn't bad
18:03:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> There was no where else to get a flagship with all the specs you sort of want without crappy software
18:03:20 <cn3m[m]> but it's Google Pixel
18:04:28 <cn3m[m]> There's an iPhone
18:04:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> Decent battery, latest high res Oled screens, headphone Jack (rip 3.5mm you will be missed), competitive camera, decent update speed, at least 2 OS updates etc
18:06:06 <cn3m[m]> 3 years software updates, 3 years monthly security patches, 4 years quarterly. Samsung isn't the worst
18:06:18 <cn3m[m]> by far
18:06:49 <cn3m[m]> the sensor toggle is excellent and bizzare no one else picked that up. It's just One UI and GrapheneOS. that's beyond me
18:07:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yeah it's a real shame their security, openness and Knox stuff isn't up to snuff
18:07:38 <hypokeimenon[m]> Then again Samsung is a pretty bad company sustainability wise so I'm apathetic
18:07:50 <cn3m[m]> their budget phones also suck balls on security
18:08:05 <cn3m[m]> quarterly updates?
18:08:19 <hypokeimenon[m]> Fairphone/Shiftphone with official GrapheneOS would have been nice.
18:08:47 <cn3m[m]> hardware is not okay though
18:08:49 <cn3m[m]> Samsung or Motorola could be considered
18:09:33 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "Samsung or Motorola could be con"> I am not sure either of those allow custom keys
18:09:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> My first non-Nokia phone was a Hello Moto
18:09:36 <EssentialChaos[m> I've never had a Nokia phone
18:09:43 <cn3m[m]>  @essentialchaos:tchncs.de Moto X4
18:09:59 <cn3m[m]> and Samsung has been supported by GrapheneOS before, could happen again
18:10:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "I've never had a Nokia phone"> That's pretty surprising.
18:10:47 <nickcalyx[m]> > Then again Samsung is a pretty bad company sustainability wise so I'm apathetic
18:10:47 <nickcalyx[m]> You mean you're not confident they will stay in business?
18:11:10 <cn3m[m]> I had a Razr get on my power level  @hypokeimenon:tchncs.de
18:11:42 <EssentialChaos[m> <hypokeimenon[m] "That's pretty surprising."> Yeah, it went like Siemens -> Samsung -> Samsung -> Phillips -> Phillips -> Samsung -> Xiaomi, iic
18:11:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> I've bounced around Motorola, (Sony) Eriksson, LG, Nokia and Samsung after the years
18:11:43 <EssentialChaos[m> > <@hypokeimenon:tchncs.de> That's pretty surprising.
18:11:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cn3m[m] "and Samsung has been supported b"> what?!
18:11:43 <EssentialChaos[m>  * Yeah, it went like Siemens -> Samsung -> Samsung -> Phillips -> Phillips -> Samsung -> Xiaomi, iirc
18:12:10 <cn3m[m]> the S4
18:12:26 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "Yeah, it went like Siemens -> Sa"> (The first two were Dumbphones, btw)
18:12:28 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cn3m[m] "I had a Razr get on my power lev"> Too high for me man
18:12:28 <cn3m[m]> before it moved to AOSP as a base
18:12:44 <cn3m[m]> AOSP killed the radio star
18:12:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> My next phones will all be Pixels
18:13:14 <cn3m[m]> I will get a Pixel as long as Daniel supports them
18:13:19 <cn3m[m]> if he ever drops them I'm getting an iPhone
18:13:38 <cn3m[m]> unless we get custom hardware
18:13:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> If he stops I'm ditching phones lol
18:15:31 <cn3m[m]> S4 is the only non Google device ever supported by GrapheneOS
18:15:48 <cn3m[m]> unless you count HiKey
18:15:50 <cx2[m]> If by ditching phones you mean they are EOL thus not supportable.... then sure
18:16:11 <hypokeimenon[m]> Was the Nexus a Google or LG device
18:16:16 <cn3m[m]> Google
18:16:37 <EssentialChaos[m> <hypokeimenon[m] "Was the Nexus a Google or LG dev"> Google partnered with different companies
18:16:38 <cn3m[m]> LG and Huawei have made them for Google
18:17:02 <EssentialChaos[m> There was one from Samsung, iirc
18:17:15 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS never supported that one
18:17:24 <hypokeimenon[m]> How is the Huawei's security if anyone knows?
18:17:56 <cn3m[m]> Not good
18:18:02 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "There was one from Samsung, iirc"> It's called "Galaxy Nexus", who would have thought...
18:18:09 <cn3m[m]> Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the first Nexus iirc
18:18:20 <cn3m[m]> that was a sexy phone
18:18:27 <cn3m[m]> Google and Samsung working hand in hand
18:18:47 <EssentialChaos[m> The first was Nexus One by HTC
18:19:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cn3m[m] "Google and Samsung working hand "> Never again...
18:19:32 <cn3m[m]> Huawei security wise might get better they have a huge advantage over Google in that they make their own hardware
18:19:59 <cn3m[m]> They could do a good job if they really tried
18:20:48 <cyredanthem[m]> Does anyone still have Nexus 5X images?
18:21:11 <cyredanthem[m]> I'd love to try to pentest the old features
18:21:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> Is there anyone that makes their own hardware apart from Huawei kirin and Samsung exynos
18:21:13 <cyredanthem[m]> I can't find them anywhere
18:21:14 <cyredanthem[m]> > Is there anyone that makes their own hardware apart from Huawei kirin and Samsung exynos
18:21:14 <cyredanthem[m]> Apple
18:21:26 <cyredanthem[m]> That's why they are so good since they care and make everything

18:32:53 <EssentialChaos[m> Facepalm

18:37:27 <cn3m[m]> I gotta hand it to Apple https://bhavukjain.com/blog/2020/05/30/zeroday-signin-with-apple/
18:37:35 <cn3m[m]> they might have some flaws that are bad
18:37:55 <cn3m[m]> however they do take good care of bug reporters
18:38:51 <cn3m[m]> why can't I find a $100,000 security bug?
19:04:54 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat your instructions for installing the Android SDK and Android Studio are beyond great. Thank you!
19:06:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "strcat your instructions for ins"> You just execute studio.sh?
19:07:39 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: is resource:// in the CSP actually required? it shouldn't be with how I have it set up
19:09:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seems to work
19:09:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> See the screenshot
19:09:41 <aeonsolution[m]> I used to use the instructions on https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android#Android_Studio and that has it's issues that you have to sort out on your own. strcat's instructions make so that no extra configurations not included in the guide are needed to keep it up to date.
19:11:26 <aeonsolution[m]> updating was a big problem for me
19:12:12 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: hmm
19:12:21 <strcat[m]> it's weird though because I'm sending it through localhost: via intercepting request
19:12:36 <strcat[m]> so it really shouldn't need resource://
19:12:38 <strcat[m]> something is wrong if it does I think
19:13:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've sent you the build in private
19:13:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's signed with my key so you might need to re-sign with yours first
19:13:57 <strcat[m]> I'm just confused about why a CSP change is needed
19:13:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> My tree was completely clean and I ran git clean -fdx to make sure no previous build remnants were reused
19:13:58 <strcat[m]> need to figure it out
19:15:49 <TheJollyRoger> One hour, fifteen minutes in and the Vanadium build hasn't failed yet...!
19:16:29 <aeonsolution[m]> its gonna be 4+ hours
19:16:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well JavaScript not my thing I'm afraid
19:17:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can try adding a gesture swipe left/right to change page next
19:17:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> I think I've figured out how to do that
19:18:00 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: okay maybe resource does make sense because I use WebResourceResponse
19:18:01 <strcat[m]> unsure
19:18:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Well, 25% with no hiccups feels like a good sign...
19:18:19 <strcat[m]> dunno how it works now
19:18:19 <strcat[m]> without that
19:18:24 <strcat[m]> but somehow now needs it
19:18:53 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/grapheneos/pdfviewer/PdfViewer.java#L176
19:18:55 <strcat[m]> you can see here
19:18:59 <strcat[m]> I feed in everything as web resources
19:19:14 <strcat[m]> so
19:19:15 <strcat[m]> why would it be required for pdf.js but not the other files
19:19:21 <strcat[m]> why does self work fine for the others
19:21:20 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: I successfully built Vanadium and the development branch! No more errors with my install. I had used the --no-history option which was the cause of the original breakage.
19:22:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well strcat
19:23:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> If it doesn't introduce any security issues
19:23:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it works
19:23:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's fine I guess
19:24:29 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: what can I do to help with Vanadium now?
19:26:16 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: there's a lot to work on
19:26:26 <strcat[m]> look through the tracker
19:26:31 <strcat[m]> one thing would be figuring out how to disable gaia in a clean way
19:26:37 <strcat[m]> you can look at what Bromite, etc. do for that
19:26:52 <strcat[m]> there's a LOT that needs to be done
19:27:07 <strcat[m]> the only MAJOR feature we need to do downstream is implementing content filtering using the built-in content filtering engine
19:27:23 <strcat[m]> bromite has an implementation but I think for various reasons it isn't suitable for us atm
19:27:34 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: but yeah look through issue tracker and bromite changes
19:27:41 <strcat[m]> in general we need to make things cleaner / more robust / less invasive for Vanadium
19:27:46 <strcat[m]> and not all is wanted ofc
19:27:50 <strcat[m]> some is useless / redundant, some isn't relevant to mobile
19:27:53 <strcat[m]> some we don't want
19:28:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> I mean adblock in vanadium would be a great idea
19:29:30 <aeonsolution[m]> got it, thanks for the advice; i'll post my findings here and try to share what i learn with Jolly. is there anyone else that i should coordinate with that maybe already working on vanadium stuff strcat?
19:30:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "got it, thanks for the advice; i"> You could help with the audio issue
19:30:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> I still don't have a log
19:30:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I can't reproduce it myself even with the latest hardened malloc
19:30:56 <aeonsolution[m]> can you message me to walk me through the process, dont want to clog the chat
19:30:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> If we have a log we'd at least know half the problem
19:31:32 <aeonsolution[m]> i'd be happy to help with that anupritaisno1!
19:32:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "can you message me to walk me th"> It's very simple

19:40:38 <strcat[m]> just worked around
19:40:45 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/commit/ce6a21226426ca2be026eb0dc7cc6a085bf12cdf
19:40:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes but I'd like to see the
19:41:09 <strcat[m]> valldrac figured out that the DeviceDescriptor SortedVector nonsense seems to be gone in master
19:41:11 <strcat[m]> so hopefully it's gone in Android 11
19:41:16 <strcat[m]> and we can drop this workaround with Android 121
19:41:20 <strcat[m]>  * and we can drop this workaround with Android 1
19:41:24 <strcat[m]>  * and we can drop this workaround with Android 11
19:41:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "just worked around"> BTW can you add a flag to turn on/off bug handling and workarounds easily?
19:42:22 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: the notes you gave are still good, if we need to catch a bug, i'll be able to contribute logs to that now üòÅ
19:43:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "anupritaisno1: the notes you gav"> You can even take logs on your phone itself if you have an adb over network toggle
19:43:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just download an adb compiled for android and start sending commands
19:44:37 <aeonsolution[m]> is that in the developer options or do i need a command to enable that
19:45:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm not sure but I think there's an adb command to do it
19:45:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW also see shizuku
19:46:33 <aeonsolution[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "BTW can you add a flag to turn o"> this is a good idea
19:47:25 <aeonsolution[m]> if the bug isn't gone in Android 11 we can revisit this anupritaisno1
19:52:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well one thing of interest is
19:52:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> The android 11 clang supports a polyhedral loop optimizer
19:53:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> I wonder if it can be enabled on android now
19:53:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW a limited polyhedral loop optimizer can be enabled for the kernel already
19:59:31 <renor> How can I access files from the computer of a work profile?
19:59:31 <TheJollyRoger> Two hours, I think I'm about halfway there.
19:59:42 <renor> Can't find a way
19:59:44 <TheJollyRoger> no hiccups yet, fingers crossed.
20:00:21 <aeonsolution[m]> TheJollyRoger: you're on the right path, it just takes a long time
20:01:21 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
20:02:39 <strcat[m]> it takes longer to build Vanadium than GrapheneOS generally
20:06:03 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_renor:matrix.org that's hard to do I think a terminal app could share it iirc?
20:06:04 <cn3m[m]> user profiles are recommended
20:07:14 <TheJollyRoger> Come to think of it, that doesn't sound so surprising in retrospect, I mean, a modern browser is essentially an entire operating system.
20:32:32 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org how is the source code so small for Chromium and so big for AOSP
20:33:46 <cyredanthem[m]> If the code was smaller I'd try building Android. Data caps somehow are still a thing here
20:34:52 <TheJollyRoger> I'm... I'm not sure.
20:35:40 <cyredanthem[m]> Someone used to compress it and I'd use that for my Lineage builds
20:35:49 <cyredanthem[m]> They stopped doing it though
20:35:57 <cyredanthem[m]> 2GB of source was so manageable
20:36:14 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm very sad that's gone
20:37:19 <cn3m[m]> CopperheadOS has Seedvault for backups. https://reddit.com/comments/gab6x2/comment/foz17yo Such innovation. /s
20:38:43 <cyredanthem[m]> They also didn't really do anything updates wise until GrapheneOS released Android 10
20:38:53 <cyredanthem[m]> They track GrapheneOS so closely and never beat it to the punch
20:38:56 <cyredanthem[m]> I wonder why /s
20:41:54 <BalooRJ> I'm very glad Daniel added the backup feature
20:42:07 <cyredanthem[m]> If anyone finds a highly compressed AOSP archive I'd be your biggest fan
20:42:12 <BalooRJ> Anyone have thoughts on what the reasonable backup space on a flash drive would be to back up phone?
20:42:21 <cx2[m]> I hope they are in this channel.....soooo   much.
20:42:38 <BalooRJ> I've only got an 8GB flash drive, but have about 30GB used on my Pixel 3a
20:42:56 <cyredanthem[m]> > I'm very glad Daniel added the backup feature
20:42:56 <cyredanthem[m]> It's from CalyxOS and it was added to GrapheneOS and then copied to CuckerheadOS
20:42:56 <BalooRJ> Someone on here previously told me that backup only backs up app data
20:43:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, it only backs up app data, and /only/ for apps that have the "Allow backups of this app" flag set.
20:44:23 <strcat[m]> it's allowed by default
20:44:36 <BalooRJ> TheJollyRoger - Thank you!
20:44:44 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: it backs up the OS / app data just not profile home directories yet
20:44:49 <strcat[m]> you have to back that up yourself for now
20:44:55 <TheJollyRoger> Er, wait, I thought some apps don't allow-- OH wait a minute, it's a negative, not a positive,
20:44:58 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, my mistake.
20:45:36 <BalooRJ> I'm fine with the appdata right now...I've moved my music over to a Plex server and started to stream things instead.
20:45:47 <BalooRJ> which I think is what is taking up a good portion of the non-appdata room
20:48:09 <BalooRJ> Is there a flash drive type that works best when using as backup, say fat32 vs ntfs?
20:48:27 <BalooRJ> or mkfs or what have you.
20:48:28 <TheJollyRoger> Your phone should format it once you plug it in.
20:48:33 <BalooRJ> Got it, thanks
20:48:34 <TheJollyRoger> If it doesn't recognize it.
21:14:17 <nickcalyx[m]> USB drives are so cheap, getting one the size of your,phone's storage is probably,like 20 dollars
21:14:33 <nickcalyx[m]> You can.even use a USB hard drive
21:15:09 <TheJollyRoger> I like to stockpile Corsair Survivor USB drives since they come with a nice little screw-on cover.
21:15:33 <TheJollyRoger> Keeps the dirt out.
21:16:21 <nickcalyx[m]> I wonder if there's a way to support USB dvd burners
21:16:43 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe if they got their power from another source...?
21:16:45 <TheJollyRoger> Dunno.
21:17:53 <nickcalyx[m]> I've powered a spinning usb drive off of a pixel 2
21:18:42 <TheJollyRoger> Oh damn
21:18:43 <TheJollyRoger> Wow :p.
21:18:44 <nickcalyx[m]> to back up to it
21:19:30 <nickcalyx[m]> I have some big disk arrays by this company drobo ... that have usb ports
21:19:43 <nickcalyx[m]> 16tb or whatever
21:19:53 <nickcalyx[m]> you can use things like that too
21:19:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hahahaha damn
21:24:51 <nickcalyx[m]> it doesn't have to just be a usb stick
21:24:53 <nickcalyx[m]> is my point
21:34:31 <nickcalyx[m]> when we were figuring out seedvault I was inspired by Apple's time machine backup which is,truly comprehensive and lets you,have local or cloud backup options
22:04:08 <nickcalyx[m]> we're not quite at that level of polish yet.  I wanted it so that if you lost your phoen and got a new one, and restored, it would be exactly the same as the old phone.. every text message in place, every phone call record in place, every photo, every app, setting, everything
22:12:41 <cn3m[m]>  @nickcalyx:matrix.org hey quick question
22:12:52 <cn3m[m]> does microG still have proprietary Google binaries?
22:17:01 <spaceinfinite[m]> strcat: p.eertu.be/videos/watch/d‚Ä¶cn3m p.eertu.be/videos/watch/d‚Ä¶
22:17:08 <spaceinfinite[m]> cn3m: p.eertu.be/videos/watch/d‚Ä¶
22:21:59 <cn3m[m]> what?  @spaceinfinite:matrix.org
22:23:29 <spaceinfinite[m]> Jolla/sailfishos just done a video on grapheneos
22:25:23 <cn3m[m]> is there a direct YouTube link?
22:25:34 <nickcalyx[m]> > does microG still have proprietary Google binaries?
22:25:34 <nickcalyx[m]> Not sure, maybe cdesai knows
22:25:59 <cn3m[m]> thanks
22:26:10 <spaceinfinite[m]> I couldnt find a you tube link
22:26:22 <cdesai> No, microG is fully open source
22:26:37 <strcat[m]> well whatever you linked doesn't resolve
22:26:43 <strcat[m]> not clear what you are talking about either
22:26:46 <cdesai> It has limited functionality solely because of that, they have to reimplement all the APIs google has
22:26:56 <cn3m[m]> thanks
22:27:46 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_cdesai:matrix.org thanks
22:27:48 <strcat[m]> it does download google binaries for some things like droidguard
22:27:58 <strcat[m]> but probably not mandatory features
22:28:02 <strcat[m]> opt-in stuff afaik
22:28:12 <overheadscallop[> <spaceinfinite[m] "strcat: p.eertu.be/videos/watch/"> I believe the link was supposed to be https://p.eertu.be/videos/watch/d936a95d-23b6-4865-96cd-e0cbd614352f
22:28:34 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_cdesai:matrix.org thanks
22:29:01 <spaceinfinite[m]> https://p.eertu.be/videos/watch/d936a95d-23b6-4865-96cd-e0cbd614352f
22:30:33 <cn3m[m]> I'll watch the video
22:31:54 <spaceinfinite[m]> Not talking about anything. Juzt said sailfishOS made a video about grapheneOS
23:07:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai "No, microG is fully open source"> Honestly wouldn't recommend microg
23:08:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nobody other than fdroid is even able to build it properly
23:08:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> It has never been audited
23:08:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> It doesn't even get regular updates
23:09:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> That app is like a potential exploit kit
23:09:14 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: we build it ourselves, and I build it myself just fine
23:09:30 <cdesai> We also lock it down more and avoid using the default patch
23:09:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai "anupritaisno1: we build it ourse"> That's just one of the minor issues
23:09:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai "We also lock it down more and av"> Signature spoofing is irrelevant
23:09:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm talking about the app itself being the issue
23:10:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> The app being in system as a priv app is a worse risk than some permission the user has to go through great lengths to grant
23:11:47 <cdesai> Priv apps still need a permission whitelist, and even updates can't add new permissions
23:12:16 <cdesai> The only permission it has there is installing a location provider
23:13:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> It seems there's a bunch of permissions actually
23:13:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sure they're not priv-app permissions
23:14:01 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200531-044345_Permission_controller.png (184KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/eQRjHOiiohwWHLZgYepqlLtU >
23:14:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unaudited apps like these in system are a serious risk
23:14:31 <cdesai> Well, yes, it needs those to do what it does
23:15:46 <cdesai> Sure, it'd be nice to have it audited, but as such it doesn't have any extra or unnecessary permissions
23:15:59 <cdesai> And well, there's no alternative
23:16:38 <cdesai> Why do we target A2 in addition to the pixels? To have a cheaper alternative with proper verified boot, even if it isn't perfect.
23:17:07 <cdesai> But it's still a big improvement over stock
23:17:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well it is quite a huge problem
23:17:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> For one google definitely has better security than microg
23:18:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> An app that passes data to other apps and has those many input sources coming from untrusted places is quite an issue
23:18:22 <cdesai[m]> Yes but we can't exactly ship play services, nor would we want to. There has to be a balance.
23:19:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you're making hardened ROMs then you can't ship a potential exploit kit anyway
23:19:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW what ROM?
23:19:27 <cdesai[m]> CalyxOS
23:24:37 <travankor_> how would you engineer a (secure) alternative to microg
23:25:14 <strcat[m]> see my past posts about it
23:25:16 <strcat[m]> and the issue tracker
23:25:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <travankor_ "how would you engineer a (secure"> Separation of processes would be a start
23:25:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Separate the geocoder
23:25:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Into a different app
23:25:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Separate the other stuff too as much as possible
23:25:47 <strcat[m]> well there is no reason that something like geocoder should even be part of it
23:25:57 <strcat[m]> because it is not a play services API
23:26:02 <strcat[m]> those are providers for AOSP APIs
23:26:08 <strcat[m]> they should be separate things not grouped with it
23:27:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> It should also implement https certificate pinning exactly like official gms client
23:27:14 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <spaceinfinite[m] "https://p.eertu.be/videos/watch/"> So besides the fact that this dude speaks English like a dog with peanut butter in his mouth, a positive review, on security/privacy aspects. Good deal. Negatives include: It still looks like Android, with no custom fonts or UI, lol
23:27:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "So besides the fact that this du"> >a dog with peanut butter in his mouth
23:28:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> So, a dead dog?
23:28:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> I thought peanuts were poisonous for them
23:28:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> You're 1) definitely mistaken 2) mildly OffTopic =P
23:28:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nvm
23:28:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm wrong
23:28:53 <TheJollyRoger> I think it's eating large amounts of chocolate or coffee...?
23:29:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Don't give them peanut butter with artificial sweetener in it, or anything with artificial sweetener, that's all
23:30:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai "Why do we target A2 in addition "> BTW when is CAF being merged on pixels
23:30:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> One guy actually managed to do it on a pixel 4
23:32:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai
23:32:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW how do you tag on matrix?
23:32:58 <cx2[m]> anupritaisno1: I think it depends on the client?
23:33:19 <cdesai[m]> anupritaisno1 what about the pixel 4?
23:33:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Somebody merged CAF on it
23:33:45 <TheJollyRoger> ~80% through Vanadium. No hiccups so far. I'm going to start cleaning up my notes. Oh yeah. Uh... gonna get that CTS repor.
23:33:46 <TheJollyRoger> *report.
23:33:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> The r4 kernel branch
23:33:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> With camera and all that
23:34:06 <cdesai[m]> That usually causes more harm than good
23:34:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well seems to work fine for the guy
23:34:35 <cdesai[m]> It's just ricing
23:35:04 <cdesai[m]> Google maintains AOSP for the pixels, does monthly updates. Anything else is just pointless
23:35:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Actually not so much
23:35:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google is quite behind on stuff like qcacld
23:36:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pulling it directly from CAF sounds like an idea
23:36:08 <cdesai[m]> But it still gets security updates. You don't know if that random caf tag does
23:36:15 <cdesai[m]> It might not even be meant for production, who knows
23:36:23 <cdesai[m]> Easy way to bring in additional exploits
23:36:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai[m] "It might not even be meant for p"> They are
23:36:31 <cdesai[m]> Should just stick with Google code on the pixels
23:36:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Qualcomm has their own security bulletins
23:36:39 <JTL> What's this discussion about CAF tags about?
23:36:42 <JTL> lol
23:36:57 <cn3m[m]> CAF is alpha code from Qualcomm
23:37:07 <cn3m[m]> it's not good for ROM building for security or stability
23:37:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Besides Google's own Qualcomm ASB comes from patches these Qualcomm branches sometimes address a year or more ago
23:37:14 <cn3m[m]> it's a major issue with Lineage for example
23:37:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "it's a major issue with Lineage "> No it's not
23:37:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> CAF for instance did not miss vulnerabilities google forgot to pick twice
23:38:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> For instance that binder vulnerability never was an issue on CAF because they merged it in faster than google did
23:38:44 <travankor_> is caf open source?
23:38:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> The kernels yes
23:39:05 <cn3m[m]>  @travankor:matrix.org a lot of Qualcomm related code is. Not all
23:39:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> The HALs partially
23:39:15 <travankor_> (i dont know anything about android-dev, sadly)
23:39:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> <travankor_ "(i dont know anything about andr"> Well there's a bunch of camera fixes in that branch which are of interest
23:39:48 <cn3m[m]>  @anupritaisno1:m.apex.to that could be true in some cases, but we don't know what issues that could add
23:39:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> And personally been merging CAF for years
23:40:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only had one issue and that too once
23:41:00 <cn3m[m]> I wouldn't use it for a security and privacy focused ROM myself
23:41:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> A null pointer dereference in qcacld which was a single revert
23:41:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise I merge and ship CAF tags almost as they're out
23:42:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Most of the times if you even open the ASB you'll see your CAF merge 3 months ago fixes everything in the current Qualcomm components section
23:43:02 <TheJollyRoger> Hey strcat, it looks like the CTS is passing everything on `run cts`, except for that one test that the CTS seems to hiccup on with installing the CTS app. For some reason, it's ended up being installed to my phone and I can't seem to uninstall it anymore since it keeps insisting "not installed for this user." But otherwise it seems to pass.
23:44:23 <cdesai[m]> anupritaisno1 you can't just cherry pick things as you like like that though, what about any potential security issues by code merged this way? There would be more in caf tags than just security fixes. Also that's just the open source half, a lot of it is proprietary and thus wouldn't match then
23:44:44 <cdesai[m]> It really isn't a good idea for Google devices at the very least
23:45:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cdesai[m] "anupritaisno1 you can't just che"> Not a very pressing concern honestly
23:47:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Would you rather leave huge parts of your kernel outdated because you're worried about pulling in security vulnerabilities from upstream when you are already missing fixes for what's discovered or just fix the ones that are already known
23:47:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you've ever opened qcacld-3.0 for yourself you'd come to very similar conclusions as me
23:48:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Qcacld is a terrible driver and running a year old qcacld with Google's patches is quite a huge issue
23:48:14 <cdesai[m]> > If you've ever opened qcacld-3.0 for yourself you'd come to very similar conclusions as me
23:48:14 <cdesai[m]> I definitely wouldn't
