00:49:38 <saucy-salamander> I have a couple of questions
00:49:39 <saucy-salamander> Is Bromite's  security close to that of Vanadium or should I use Vanadium with next DNS or something
00:49:39 <saucy-salamander> Can I change the proxy settings for Vanadium so I can route it through orbot (TOR)

01:09:33 <JS[m]> This might seen off-topic, but what's a good phone to get?
01:10:02 <louipc> pixel 4a for grapheneos
01:10:51 <crog[m]> But not on Verizon, right?
01:13:17 <JS[m]> I want to get a phone that allows for privacy for the user.
01:14:04 <JS[m]> I know it sounds like I'm asking for a lot, but I want to know where to hunt to get one.
01:14:38 <qubits> Google pixel 4a with grapheneOS is the best solution
01:14:57 <JS[m]> Got it.
01:15:12 <JS[m]> How expensive are they, usually?
01:15:21 <qubits> Thats what i was told, i will buy google pixel 4a and install grahpeneos
01:15:45 <qubits> You can find on google i think about 450e
01:16:54 <qubits> But you can better ask here for that kind a questions #grapheneos-offtopic
01:17:05 <louipc> crog[m]: hmm unsure. i heard of potential issues, but where did you read that?
01:20:10 <JS[m]> Sorry about that.
01:21:56 <Baloo> What is the main difference between the 4a and the 3a?
01:22:04 <Baloo> for someone running GrapheneOS.
01:22:09 <qubits> i think ssd
01:24:55 <qubits> Unlike the Pixel 3a, the Pixel 4a has a proper SSD which provides a much better experience with the GrapheneOS exec-based spawning security feature.
01:25:18 <strcat> Baloo: it's a newer generation device with substantially longer support
01:25:22 <louipc> pixel 4a has longer support period
01:25:34 <louipc> jinx
01:26:02 <Baloo> good to know. what's the support timeframe for the 4a?
01:26:18 <strcat> the same as always
01:26:21 <strcat> it's newer
01:26:26 <crog[m]> Someone mentioned that VZ and Sprint were troublesome duty or authentication issues with the networks.  I'll try to find it in the chat.
01:26:27 <strcat> information is available on our site
01:26:45 <strcat> crog[m]: Sprint is going away
01:26:55 <JS[m]> What about AT&T?
01:27:13 <strcat> all carriers other than Sprint should work fine and Sprint is a legacy carrier that's going away
01:27:13 <crog[m]> Yeah being merged with Tmo
01:27:34 <strcat> don't get a Verizon Pixel, that doesn't mean you can't use Verizon as a carrier
01:28:08 <crog[m]> strcat: too late
01:28:22 <louipc> Baloo: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#pixel_phones
01:29:11 <strcat> future generation devices will now have 4 years of security updates instead of 3 years
01:30:29 <Baloo> yeah, I learned my lesson with the original Pixel on verizon and a workaround to unlock the bootloader was not found until long after. Bought the 3a at Best Buy new with no carrier.
01:30:35 <Baloo> louipc: Thanks.
01:30:42 <Baloo> 4 years is good to know.
01:31:08 <strcat> the current ones are 3 years guaranteed after launch
01:31:53 <JS[m]> I'm currently on an S8+, don't know what I'll upgrade to or get.
01:32:47 <JS[m]> Maybe a Pixel 4A and run a different OS on it.
01:50:15 <gostemp[m]> Are any of the default apps safe to uninstall (e.g. Auditor, Messaging)?
01:51:19 <strcat> gostemp[m]: you should probably just leave it be
01:51:31 <strcat> why not use Auditor?
01:52:08 <gostemp[m]> I do, but it seems like a one-time use app
01:52:20 <strcat> you seem to misunderstand the purpose of it
01:52:28 <strcat> https://attestation.app/about
01:52:45 <strcat> it's primarily based on Trust-On-First-Use, the first verification is the pairing
01:52:56 <strcat> it provides much more security after that point
01:53:06 <strcat> and it can be used to set up automated remote verification instead of doing it manually
01:53:10 <strcat> I think you're missing the point
01:53:25 <strcat> gostemp[m]: you can disable apps within profiles, they are still part of the OS
01:53:37 <strcat> gostemp[m]: so you aren't going to save any space
01:54:34 <gostemp[m]> You're completely right, I did not know it was capable of any of that
01:54:59 <gostemp[m]> I just installed GrapheneOS and I'm still trying to figure a lot of things out
01:55:04 <strcat> the install guide recommends doing a check with Auditor after installing to verify that you installed the genuine GrapheneOS
01:55:07 <gostemp[m]> Appreciate your help
01:55:16 <strcat> but after that point verifying with it provides stronger security properties
01:55:23 <strcat> since it has paired with the device you used to do the verification
01:55:34 <strcat> and you can enable remote attestation via https://attestation.app/ with it
01:56:06 <strcat> gostemp[m]: uninstalling apps can't save you any space, you can disable them from being able to run and showing up as available apps
01:56:15 <strcat> either way, they're part of the OS images
01:56:37 <strcat> you'll continue to receive updates for them as part of the OS updates since they're part of the OS images
01:56:37 <gostemp[m]> <strcat "gostemp: uninstalling apps can't"> Yeah, I got that
01:57:21 <strcat> I'd only consider disabling one of those apps in a profile if you install a full replacement and set it as the default
01:57:23 <gostemp[m]> Does the second device used for verification need to be trusted, or can it be a random one?
01:57:36 <strcat> gostemp[m]: can be a random one, of course it provides more assurance if it's secure
01:57:48 <strcat> gostemp[m]: you can use more than one other device to verify with Auditor
01:57:50 <strcat> doesn't have to be just 1
01:58:11 <strcat> and/or use the automated attestation.app verification which can be set to send alert emails if it stops receiving valid attestations
01:58:27 <strcat> (which could just mean your device was turned off / without internet for 2 days)
02:07:16 <hypokeimenon[m]> <strcat "future generation devices will n"> very nice
03:09:00 <drdisrespect> Hello, i wonder if there is a way denying bluetooth permission 2 android on my pixel 4 with grapheneos. I have turned it off but it still show in report that bluetooth permission is on
03:11:29 <drdisrespect> Android.permission.BLUETOOTH: YES
03:11:35 <drdisrespect> Thats what the log says
03:11:47 <drdisrespect> Even when bluetooth is clearly off
04:26:35 <strcat[m]> too bad they left before someone could answer
04:26:37 <strcat[m]> that's not what that means
04:27:04 <strcat[m]> looking at low-level technical information is not helpful if you aren't capable of interpreting it
04:27:44 <strcat[m]> a common issue is that power users look at low-level, non-user-facing permissions which do not mean what they think, and get concerned about it
04:27:46 <strcat[m]> see this a lot
04:27:58 <strcat[m]> the dangerous permissions have toggles by definition
04:28:29 <strcat[m]> the low-level permissions generally grant the ability to request something, like requesting Bluetooth pairing
04:28:37 <strcat[m]> doing Bluetooth scanning requires the location permission on top of that
04:29:02 <strcat[m]> it's covered by case-by-case consent + existing location permission, would not make sense to have yet another toggle
04:29:34 <strcat[m]> that's the case for all of those low-level permissions: for one reason or another, it does not make sense for them to be another permission toggle, and permission toggles are a bad way to do access control
04:29:43 <strcat[m]> case-by-case consent is better and is usually what's done nowadays
04:30:00 <strcat[m]> and there is a painful process of migrating things like shared file access to the more modern case-by-case consent systems
06:29:21 <rtevans[m]> nscnt: Golli I finally got GrapheneOS installed on my phone. After watching a tutorial on YouTube, I found that copying fastboot to usr/local/bin finally allowed me to flash the image. Plugging my phone directly into a USB port instead of using a hub also helped.
06:29:21 <rtevans[m]> Thanks for the assistance.
06:39:47 <strcat[m]> please follow https://grapheneos.org/install instead of inaccurate videos
06:39:54 <strcat[m]> you needed to run the command to set up PATH
06:39:55 <Liakde[m]> Welcome
06:41:45 <rtevans[m]> strcat: I tried the following the installation documentation but it didn't work for me. The video tutorial made all the difference. All I did was copy fastboot to a different location.
06:43:46 <strcat[m]> you weren't setting PATH
06:43:53 <strcat[m]> if you run exactly the commands in the guide it works
06:44:16 <strcat[m]> copying fastboot to /usr is a pretty bad hack and totally unnecessary
06:44:22 <keepitcool[m]> <rtevans[m] "strcat: I tried the following th"> a google pixel phone?
06:45:14 <rtevans[m]> keep.it.cool: Yes, Pixel 4a. I believe GrapheneOS is only supported on pixel phones.
06:45:17 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend against following unofficial guides especially those with incorrect instructions like that
06:45:33 <rtevans[m]> strcat:  You mean "cd sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03"? I did that.
06:45:36 <strcat[m]> no
06:45:43 <strcat[m]> you weren't setting PATH
06:45:48 <strcat[m]> look at the whole section on obtaining fastboot
06:46:03 <strcat[m]> it has you download it, extract it, set up PATH and then test that it works with `fastboot --version`
06:46:09 <strcat[m]> you're supposed to run exactly the commands that are there
06:46:17 <strcat[m]> if you skip or change things, then yeah, it won't work
06:46:19 <louipc> probably just need an installer, web or otherwise...
06:46:37 <strcat[m]> help welcome making a WebUSB installer
06:46:42 <rtevans[m]> Yes I believe I followed those steps.
06:46:48 <strcat[m]> rtevans: no, you didn't
06:46:51 <refraction[m]> export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH
06:46:57 <refraction[m]> rtevans:
06:47:12 <strcat[m]> you can't skip steps or change them
06:47:19 <strcat[m]> and you have to run them in the same shell
06:47:23 <strcat[m]> you weren't doing that so it didn't work
06:47:42 <strcat[m]> the process can be done with copy-paste
06:47:49 <rtevans[m]> curl, echo, unsip, then export. Yes I remember inputing those commands in my terminal.
06:47:51 <strcat[m]> no changes other than device name and release version
06:48:02 <strcat[m]> rtevans: does not mean you followed the instructions correctly
06:48:05 <louipc> too often people can't follow the instructions properly
06:48:05 <strcat[m]> in fact it's clear you didn't
06:48:10 <rtevans[m]>  * curl, echo, unzip, then export. Yes I remember inputting those commands in my terminal.
06:48:11 <strcat[m]> no point in arguing otherwise
06:48:16 <strcat[m]> it didn't work because you didn't follow it
06:48:21 <strcat[m]> there was no need to do that ugly hack
06:48:39 <strcat[m]> in fact, you're demonstrating why those unofficial guides are so problematic
06:48:45 <strcat[m]> they have people do broken and unsafe things
06:48:46 <rtevans[m]> So does that mean I need to start over again? The OS works fine on my phone.
06:48:47 <strcat[m]> and they listen...
06:49:16 <strcat[m]> rtevans: it's not clear what you did, for all I know you installed third party software that compromised your machine and they gave you another OS
06:49:20 <louipc> no point now that its installed rtevans[m] , but you might want to clean what you did from your desktop OS
06:49:23 <strcat[m]> rtevans: only the official guide is supported
06:49:55 <refraction[m]> To be fair, I tried the Windows PATH command and it didn't work so I had to go to Windows Settings to set the PATH.
06:49:58 <strcat[m]> any decent video guide would at least follow the official instructions
06:50:00 <rtevans[m]> I'm pretty sure I didn't install 3rd party software. All I did was move the fastboot file to that certain directory.
06:50:06 <strcat[m]> refraction: it works fine, you didn't do it per the guide
06:50:09 <strcat[m]> refraction: copy-paste works
06:50:30 <strcat[m]> the install process is regularly tested via copy-paste and is known to work properly on each of the supported OSes with 0 changes
06:50:40 <strcat[m]> if it didn't work for you it's because you didn't follow it
06:51:35 <strcat[m]> if you try to write stuff out by hand and make mistakes, yeah, it won't work
06:51:40 <strcat[m]> if you skip stuff, it won't work
06:51:51 <strcat[m]> if you close the shell and don't start at the top again, it won't work
06:51:59 <strcat[m]> expected
06:52:21 <louipc> couldnt a lot of that just be scripted
06:52:37 <strcat[m]> it is scripted
06:52:42 <refraction[m]> It might be the fact that I ran the PowerShell terminal as Administrator, so the PATH command failed
06:52:49 <strcat[m]> refraction: no, it's not
06:52:59 <strcat[m]> refraction: it's that you didn't follow the instructions
06:53:11 <strcat[m]> you skipped commands or closed it and started in the middle in a new shell
06:53:23 <refraction[m]> Huh. I did copy-paste the commands directly into the PowerShell terminal all in the same session.
06:53:31 <strcat[m]> in which case it would work
06:53:33 <rtevans[m]> I was using Linux and not Windows. So should I delete the images, fastboot files, etc I downloaded or not? Seems harmless to me.
06:53:49 <rtevans[m]> Oh and I ran the flash command as root and I think that helped as well.
06:53:52 <strcat[m]> the guide covers both and is verified to work on both with each release
06:54:04 <strcat[m]> rtevans: another case of not following it
06:54:20 <louipc> i mean it could be more automated to avoid this confusion which seems to be happening way too much
06:54:21 <strcat[m]> if you followed the section on fastboot on a supported OS you wouldn't have those issues
06:54:35 <rtevans[m]> I followed that step at first without the sudo and it didn't work...
06:54:40 <louipc> elminate the human error as much as possible
06:54:42 <strcat[m]> rtevans: you didn't follow the guide
06:54:48 <strcat[m]> you already said you used an unofficial guide
06:55:10 <louipc> rtevans[m]: no point in arguing. you missed some detail otherwise it would have worked
06:55:15 <strcat[m]> there's a section on fastboot in the guide covering packages you need to install
06:55:24 <strcat[m]> and then how to download and add it to the path for the current shell
06:55:37 <strcat[m]> it's something trivial that is not going to just not work
06:55:49 <louipc> rtevans[m]: the videos and unofficial guides only offer hacks for people who miss certain details
06:55:50 <rtevans[m]> I'm talking about the flash command. I didn't say I got the idea to use sudo from the video tutorial. Someone in this chat recommended it to me.
06:56:07 <strcat[m]> rtevans:  because you didn't follow the official guide
06:56:12 <strcat[m]> you didn't follow the fastboot section of the guide
06:56:23 <strcat[m]> so yes, it didn't work, and you used multiple supported / unwise hacks to work around it
06:56:45 <strcat[m]> I know which parts you didn't do
06:56:47 <strcat[m]> and what you did wrong
06:56:47 <louipc> anyway.. what is this discussion
06:57:07 <rtevans[m]> I think you're being needlessly pedantic. Thanks to everyone here who helped me anyways. Have a good night.
06:57:33 <strcat[m]> no, I'm recommending against people following bad advice
06:57:37 <strcat[m]> and you're making false claims
06:57:56 <strcat[m]> following unofficial guides recommending unsafe workarounds / hacks is not a good idea
06:58:05 <strcat[m]> the official guide works properly via copy-paste
06:58:52 <strcat[m]> louipc: the install process is described the way it is to make it safer
06:59:03 <strcat[m]> louipc: by using distro packages when they work properly, using signify to verify the OS
06:59:26 <strcat[m]> if we're just going to have a script there's no point of including signify in it
06:59:45 <louipc> there's obviously something not quite right the way these issues keep repeating
06:59:52 <strcat[m]> and then it might as well just be a WebUSB installer
06:59:58 <strcat[m]> what's wrong is people don't follow the instructions
07:00:08 <louipc> people are people
07:00:38 <strcat[m]> they might as well just be using a WebUSB installer rather than anything local rather than blindly trusting a script
07:01:10 <louipc> either way is fine
07:07:34 <strcat[m]> rtevans: you make it clear above that you weren't following the official guide, so please don't give people bad advice based on what you pieced together following unofficial / misguided third party instructions
07:07:54 <strcat[m]> I don't see anyone linking you a video, it's you that linked it
07:08:45 <strcat[m]> and you said this:
07:08:48 <strcat[m]> > I made sure I updated to the latest version of fastboot by following these instructions: https://idroot.us/install-adb-and-fastboot-ubuntu-20-04/
07:08:59 <strcat[m]> so you made it clear you weren't following the guide, and as expected it didn't work
07:09:16 <strcat[m]> > FYI, Signify doesn't work on Debian based distros and I'm using one.
07:09:19 <strcat[m]> also wrong and covered in the guide
07:09:22 <Liakde[m]> <refraction[m] "To be fair, I tried the Windows "> Nah, the windows $env:path works perfectly
07:09:54 <refraction[m]> Yeah. I might have done something wrong then.
07:10:11 <Liakde[m]> I tried installing this on windows like three times already. Copy pasting the command in the single shell command and changing the device name and version works alright
07:10:53 <strcat[m]> making a WebUSB installer is planned and needs developers
07:12:17 <refraction[m]> <Liakde[m] "I tried installing this on windo"> Wait a second. Changing the device name and version?
07:12:17 <Liakde[m]> * I tried installing this on windows like three times already. Copy pasting the command in the single shell windows and changing the device name and version works alright
07:12:33 <Liakde[m]> Nah, I mean on the installation process itself
07:12:41 <refraction[m]> Oh OK
07:12:46 <Liakde[m]> As is on grapheneos.org/install
07:13:06 <strcat[m]> the fastboot section has you verify it worked with `fastboot --version` and then as long as you continue using the same shell it's going to keep working
07:13:19 <strcat[m]> so it's pretty clear already if it's going to work from that section already
07:13:47 <strcat[m]> if you continue on without finishing it, it won't work - you have to download, extract and add to PATH then verify it (that's what it tells you)
07:13:54 <strcat[m]> or, on an OS that has proper packages, you just install it
07:13:59 <strcat[m]> but Debian doesn't
07:16:36 <refraction[m]> <strcat[m] "the fastboot section has you ver"> Thing is, fastboot --version outputted the correct information at first, but once I tried cding into the unpacked GrapheneOS image that's when fastboot was no longer detected.
07:17:13 <refraction[m]> I ran the PATH command according to the guide already but it still didn't seem to work
07:17:17 <Liakde[m]> You probably closed a window, or opened a new tab somewhere in your terminal
07:17:17 <strcat[m]> refraction: because you weren't following the guide
07:17:22 <strcat[m]> you made it clear what you did now
07:17:26 <strcat[m]> you ran commands not in the guide
07:17:39 <strcat[m]> you ran a `cd` command from an unofficial guide perhaps
07:17:53 <strcat[m]> you run the commands that are there, without skipping any, and without adding any
07:17:59 <strcat[m]> if you do that it's your own process, not ours
07:18:23 <strcat[m]> which is fine if you actually know what you're doing but if you don't, you either follow our instructions exactly as they are, or you should expect that it won't work
07:19:03 <strcat[m]> refraction: I can tell what people did wrong from described symptoms like that, you're implying you did `cd` into the directory (not in our guide) so that's why it "worked"
07:19:17 <refraction[m]> I literally copied and pasted the cd command from the official guide verbatim
07:19:21 <strcat[m]> no
07:19:25 <strcat[m]> there's no cd into platform-tools
07:19:50 <strcat[m]> you could go look in your command history and see where you went wrong
07:19:51 <refraction[m]> <strcat[m] "there's no cd into platform-tool"> I meant this
07:19:54 <refraction[m]> cd sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03
07:20:03 <strcat[m]> I know, and I'm talking about earlier
07:20:10 <strcat[m]> what you did wrong is you did cd into platform-tools
07:20:24 <strcat[m]> which isn't there
07:20:41 <strcat[m]> look, it's a computer, it follows rules
07:20:45 <strcat[m]> it isn't magic
07:21:02 <strcat[m]> it doesn't work differently on your computer
07:21:14 <hypokeimenon[m]> <refraction[m] "I literally copied and pasted th"> iirc copying and pasting is bad practice for various reasons
07:21:47 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: if someone is just blindly following it it doesn't really matter
07:21:53 <refraction[m]> I didn't cd into platform-tools. I opened the PowerShell prompt directly at the platform-tools directory.
07:21:53 <refraction[m]> I realise my mistake now, but the guide didn't specify where I should open the PowerShell prompt so I thought I would need to open it inside the platform-tools folder.
07:21:58 <Liakde[m]> The video on copy pasting the commands: https://asciinema.org/a/qVCcAFPUMheCIPejb6EwjXow4
07:22:20 <strcat[m]> refraction: that doesn't make sense though - the guide has you open PowerShell and run this stuff
07:22:27 <strcat[m]> refraction: you didn't have a platform-tools directory when you started
07:22:38 <louipc> oh nice Liakde[m]
07:22:42 <strcat[m]> so that means you must have closed it and opened a new one
07:23:03 <strcat[m]> a common mistake is doing that: closing it and opening another
07:23:12 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really matter where you open it as long as you can write files there
07:23:20 <strcat[m]> and as long as you continue using the same one
07:23:25 <strcat[m]> if you close it, you have to just start over
07:23:42 <strcat[m]> it deliberately doesn't make permanent changes
07:23:53 <refraction[m]> Uhh... I installed fastboot prior to GrapheneOS already since I had dabbled with Android ROMs before, and since I checked it's up to date I thought I can use that.
07:23:55 <strcat[m]> doesn't install anything, doesn't have you make any permanent configuration changes
07:24:24 <hypokeimenon[m]> <strcat[m] "hypokeimenon: if someone is just"> surely it is still okay/better if they typed it in though? https://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste
07:24:53 <refraction[m]> Didn't realise that using an existing copy of fastboot would cause it to fail.
07:25:05 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: they're trusting the website anyway - the instructions are indeed written so that someone who knows what they're doing can easily understand exactly what they're doing and verify with signify the code that is going to be run / used
07:25:33 <strcat[m]> refraction: it failed because you didn't have fastboot in your PATH
07:25:48 <strcat[m]> refraction: you didn't have fastboot in your PATH because you improvised your own way of doing that which wasn't right
07:26:15 <strcat[m]> the guide has you open PowerShell, use curl to download platform-tools, extract it, add it to PATH, test it and continue on
07:26:46 <strcat[m]> so, yes, if you come up with your own way of doing it, that has to be correct
07:26:48 <strcat[m]> and it wasn't
07:27:14 <refraction[m]> strcat: Yeah. I just didn't realise that I would need to redownload fastboot if I had it install.
07:27:14 <refraction[m]> The fault is indeed mine. I apologise.
07:27:17 <strcat[m]> you could have used the existing fastboot if you set up PATH to point at it
07:27:29 <strcat[m]> but we aren't going to try to explain what PATH is, how it works
07:27:31 <refraction[m]> * strcat: Yeah. I just didn't realise that I would need to redownload fastboot if I had it installed.
07:27:31 <refraction[m]> The fault is indeed mine. I apologise.
07:27:37 <strcat[m]> we just give a list of commands to run that works
07:28:29 <strcat[m]> refraction: the PATH command we have there is adding a directory called platform-tools in the current working directory (PWD) to PATH
07:28:54 <strcat[m]> on Windows: `$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"`
07:29:02 <strcat[m]> $pwd expands to the current directory that you're in
07:29:26 <strcat[m]> refraction: so, with the way you improvised it, you could have done `cd ..` and then done it, or removed `$pwd\` but yeah that's the problem with improvising
07:29:34 <strcat[m]> you have to then understand what the commands do to fit in your improvisation
07:30:20 <refraction[m]> I see.
07:31:19 <strcat[m]> louipcm: so for example, we could put unlock and lock into the script
07:31:31 <strcat[m]> but it requires interaction with the device
07:31:40 <strcat[m]> so it has to be explained what to do
07:31:50 <strcat[m]> and it's best if they have an opportunity to read first
07:31:57 <louipcm> yea it would have to have some interactivity
07:32:09 <strcat[m]> yeah and I don't think if we're going to have a fully automated process
07:32:12 <strcat[m]> where you trust a script
07:32:18 <strcat[m]> that it makes sense to have anything run locally
07:32:21 <louipcm> which would apply to web installer too
07:32:34 <strcat[m]> if you're going to trust it, might as well just have the web page do it
07:32:53 <louipcm> with pictures and diagrams
07:32:55 <strcat[m]> we do want to make a WebUSB installer
07:33:00 <strcat[m]> and it wouldn't actually be that hard
07:33:08 <louipcm> maybe animated gifs
07:33:10 <strcat[m]> someone did some initial work on figuring out how to do the fastboot protocol via WebUSB
07:33:41 <strcat[m]> so some of the basics are known and it has to be figured out how to issue the more complex commands
07:33:50 <strcat[m]> lock and unlock are probably already doable with the existing available code
07:34:06 <strcat[m]> what needs to be figured out is how to run the flashing commands with images and the zip
07:34:13 <strcat[m]> probably not that complicated
07:34:16 <strcat[m]> and then putting it all together
07:34:23 <strcat[m]> as an interactive GUI web installer
07:34:31 <strcat[m]> I'd be happy to pay someone to make it
07:35:05 <strcat[m]> a good start would be just setting it up to unlock and then lock as a basic proof of concept
07:35:08 <strcat[m]> wouldn't be that hard
07:35:32 <strcat[m]> I could do it in 10 minutes but I'm looking for someone to start working on it and doing that easy part first seems counterproductive to that
09:42:19 <r0tt0r[m]> https://github.com/webusb/awesome
09:42:26 <r0tt0r[m]> like this?
09:44:30 <JTL> I think https://github.com/devanlai/webdfu is the closest analogy
09:44:40 <JTL> There's https://flash.android.com/welcome but not open source iirc
09:45:27 <JTL> Idea is to implement fastboot protocol with WebUSB
09:46:34 <r0tt0r[m]> <JTL "There's https://flash.android.co"> that is build on awesome webusb afais
10:07:08 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: that's just a list of WebUSB applications
10:08:00 <strcat[m]> JTL: https://github.com/webadb/webadb.js has the start of a fastboot implementation (not most of it)
10:27:56 <abdulocracy> I had to reflash a Pixel and return it, and flash.android.com blew my mind
10:59:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> abdulocracy: yeah and you obviously forgot fastboot erase avb_custom_key

11:30:43 <fgjh> Hi! The faq says graphene os runs on Pixel 4a. Does this mean, the Pixel 4a 5G-Variant is also supported?
11:32:23 <somenerd[m]> The 4a 5G isn't supported
11:32:34 <somenerd[m]> it's not related to the Pixel 4 line
11:33:23 <somenerd[m]> afaict it's like in the middle of the Pixel 4 line and the Pixel 5
11:34:20 <fgjh> okay thank you! :)
11:35:13 <mrxx_0[m]> fgjh: Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G are complete different devices don't get fooled by the name
12:06:12 <fgjh> yeah i thing i got fooled by the name. Are there any plans the 4a 5G will be supported in the near future?
12:08:30 <sb13x[m]> Only if somebody reveals themselves out of the ether to maintain it.
16:53:32 <GOSUser> I just purchased a SIM card from PublicMobile, and although I can Receive calls, and send texts, I can't seem to receive texts back. Is there something I'm doing wrong?
17:03:28 <Birdie[m]> Permissions perhaps for storage after denied in system settings for messaging app?
17:06:11 <GOSUser> Both the Messaging and Signal app have all permissions allowed
17:06:34 <Liakde[m]> <Birdie[m] "Permissions perhaps for storage "> Nah, doubt it
17:07:05 <Liakde[m]> <GOSUser "I just purchased a SIM card from"> Hard to tell if it's carrier problem or signal problem
17:08:59 <GOSUser> "Permissions perhaps for storage", are you referring to the "read the contents of your shared storage" permission?
17:09:23 <Liakde[m]> Yeah, but do not grant that
17:09:36 <GOSUser> How come?
17:09:38 <Liakde[m]> It's not needed as app have internal storage to handle received messags
17:09:43 <GOSUser> ah
17:10:32 <Liakde[m]> It's probably carrier signal problem,  unsure. Are you on your primary user, as in the user you are after reboot and unlocking?
17:11:10 <GOSUser> Yes, I have the multiple users feature disabled as well
17:12:22 <Liakde[m]> Hmm, try rebooting?
17:12:37 <Liakde[m]> and test on texting on that number
17:15:40 <GOSUser> Texting 611 or my own number from the phone seems to yield a reply
17:19:10 <Liakde[m]> Nice
17:19:26 <Liakde[m]> How about other numbers?
17:22:28 <GOSUser> Doesn't seem to work
17:23:40 <Liakde[m]> I'd wait for help to those who uses similar SIM to you

17:25:42 <GOSUser> I'll try that. Would making a post on the subreddit about this be allowed?
17:26:31 <Liakde[m]> Unsure, users there aren't that active as matrix though, nor is sure of moderation rules there

17:46:33 <strcat[m]> brenneke: you're not supposed to do that
17:46:38 <strcat[m]> you're supposed to follow the guide
17:46:58 <strcat[m]> why would platform-tools be extracted anywhere but current directory in PowerShell? that's what the guide has you do
17:47:09 <strcat[m]> if you decide to do things your own way, you cannot get support here and are on your own
17:47:25 <strcat[m]> only the official guide is supported here - and that's not what it says to do
17:47:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> brenneke: pm me
17:47:43 <strcat[m]> brenneke: follow what the guide says
17:47:48 <strcat[m]> it tells you how to download and extract it
17:47:56 <strcat[m]> you can copy the commands as they are and it will work
17:48:31 <strcat[m]> if you downloading something in your browser, you decided to come up with your own way of doing it, and need to adjust other steps to your own way of doing it

17:49:39 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I need you working on the priority issues not providing support
17:49:49 <strcat[m]> the guide has a working installation process if people choose to follow it
17:49:54 <GOSUser> Birdie[m] This is a new number
17:50:04 <strcat[m]> choosing not to follow it is a choice to have problems - don't need to be providing support via PMs

17:51:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it usually takes no more than a minute
17:53:11 <strcat[m]> brenneke: follow what's written there instead of coming up with your own approach
17:53:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway please reply in the dev chats it is important rn
17:53:28 <strcat[m]> brenneke: if you think you understand it enough to come up with your own approach - fine, do that, but it is not what's written there
17:53:39 <strcat[m]> brenneke: run exactly the commands it tells you to run
17:53:43 <strcat[m]> don't improvise and change it
17:54:03 <strcat[m]> only people who understand what's being done should be changing it to suit them
17:54:17 <strcat[m]> nowhere there does it say to use a browser to download anything
17:54:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> brenneke: pm me and I get it fixed fast or spend another 15 minutes arguing with developers
17:54:54 <Liakde[m]> > <@brenneke:matrix.org> I like this.
17:54:54 <Liakde[m]> > Problem is however, that a programmer/developer would have difficulty understanding the perspective of a dummy!
17:54:54 <Liakde[m]> While that holds some merit at vacuum, in the context of "for dummies", copying and pasting the command and **not closing** that window will flash it with no issues, assuming the usb is connected well
17:55:00 <strcat[m]> please just follow the guide
17:55:12 <strcat[m]> I don't want unofficial instructions to be having developer support here
17:55:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> I need to talk about important bug reports with strcat and this is not going anywhere quick
17:55:28 <strcat[m]> the official instructions are what we support
17:55:42 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: so work on that, I don't want you providing support for unofficial instructions
17:55:46 <strcat[m]> it's making things worse here
17:56:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: so work on that, "> How can I if you keep repeating yourself in chat for the next hour?
17:56:20 <strcat[m]> people have the perception that they can come up with their own approach and ignore the official instructions because someone like you will help them
17:56:47 <strcat[m]> look, these are the channel rules
17:57:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway I need testers from USA rn

17:58:05 <strcat[m]> brenneke: you don't need to understand that
17:58:15 <strcat[m]> brenneke: the whole point is you're deviating from the guide and doing things your own way
17:58:21 <strcat[m]> brenneke: in which case, yes, you would need to understand those things
17:58:44 <strcat[m]> brenneke: it gives you a list of commands to run, you're not doing that

17:59:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't want people getting support for installing via unofficial methods
17:59:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> brenneke: anyway I have sent you a DM. If you don't reply in the next 30s I'm ignoring you
17:59:58 <strcat[m]> we support the official methods which right now is the official guide, later WebUSB installer of our own
18:00:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because I've told you 3x to pm me
18:00:22 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you're going to encourage people to not follow the official guide
18:00:24 <strcat[m]> and I don't want that
18:00:27 <strcat[m]> there's a reason we have that
18:00:38 <strcat[m]> if you think something in it could be done better contribute to that
18:00:55 <strcat[m]> help with the official guide should be provided in the channel
18:01:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well 30s are up, from my PoV brenneke just wants to start drama here at this stage
18:01:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "if you think something in it cou"> I literally follow it 1:1

18:02:53 <strcat[m]> we aren't going to support downloading things with a browser because that makes it more complicated to explain

18:03:53 <Liakde[m]> > Apparently you are reading as accurately as those having trouble with the guide.
18:03:54 <Liakde[m]> I'm unsure how is that relevant, to be honest?
18:04:40 <Liakde[m]> Imagine writing a functional guide just for users to ignore and modify it and asks for help
18:04:44 <strcat[m]> brenneke: it gives instructions on downloading and using platform-tools, it doesn't give instructions on using some existing copy somewhere else
18:05:06 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201220-233440_Element_(Riot.im).png (46KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/yGjYMXWNrWVelhwCrxyuQMAE/Screenshot_20201220-233440_Element_(Riot.im).png >
18:05:09 <strcat[m]> if people have it already (a proper version) and have that set up the guide has them use that
18:05:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: it's clear he doesn't need help. Time to ignore and move on
18:05:38 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: that's not helping
18:08:52 <Liakde[m]> The installation works, but unsure about the necessity of pictures, or have an inserted text of telling users not to close the Terminal/PowerShell
18:09:29 <Liakde[m]> The latter would probably help
18:09:37 <strcat[m]> the problems are primarily when people start coming up with their own approach
18:09:42 <strcat[m]> can't do much about that
18:09:50 <Liakde[m]> Fair
18:09:51 <strcat[m]> could make it clearer that if you close the terminal you need to start over
18:10:18 <strcat[m]> I can't do much about someone deciding to get fastboot another way than what's described there
18:10:23 <strcat[m]> and not doing it right
18:10:44 <strcat[m]> it would help if Debian / Ubuntu fixed their packages
18:11:01 <strcat[m]> I get the impression that they are deliberately bad at this point
18:12:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "I get the impression that they a"> They are
18:12:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> They've caused so much downtime to me
18:13:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's ironic how archlinux has more uptime for me than those "stable" distros
18:13:14 <strcat[m]> you're free to stop providing help via PMs and focus on development
18:13:33 <strcat[m]> the channel exists to provide support, and largely to help people follow the official documentation on installation, building, etc.
18:13:42 <strcat[m]> lots of other people here to help
18:14:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: you cannot help a person rejecting the help he's being offered
18:14:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: just don't do that in the first place
18:14:46 <entropy[m]> fedora package is old and broken too, i don't get what's so difficult about packaging a relatively simple piece of software like fastboot but apparently it's beyond the reach of most distro maintainers
18:15:08 <strcat[m]> for some reason most are not building it from the platform-tools revisions/tags
18:15:22 <strcat[m]> they make up their own version numbering system for it
18:15:33 <strcat[m]> they patch it to override the standard versioning
18:15:46 <strcat[m]> and they're making their own build systems (even Arch is doing that) instead of using AOSP build system
18:15:49 <strcat[m]> unnecessarily complicated
18:16:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: just don't do tha"> I mean it does help us in the end
18:16:41 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no it uses your time and encourages not following the instructions
18:16:45 <chris42> would some of these problems be mitigated, by offering a docker for building?
18:16:56 <strcat[m]> chris42: it's not about building
18:17:07 <strcat[m]> very few people are having issues building afaict
18:17:20 <chris42> more the install people?
18:17:23 <strcat[m]> the questions about building tend to be things not covered in the guide
18:17:48 <strcat[m]> since it primarily focuses on walking through doing a production build
18:17:54 <strcat[m]> not development workflows
18:18:05 <strcat[m]> it tries to do that as an aside
18:19:15 <strcat[m]> people are welcome to help with making a WebUSB-based installer
18:20:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "people are welcome to help with "> Btw I'll be doing that
18:20:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> I spent some of my time learning js
18:21:00 <chris42> yeah read that before... I'm more looking to get myself involved in the Pixel 5
18:21:39 <strcat[m]> adding new devices is blocked by resolving priority issues
18:21:48 <strcat[m]> and won't be able to have official builds without a new workstation
18:22:12 <strcat[m]> so you can work on that but you'll need to help with the baseline work too for it to proceed
18:25:58 <chris42> That is good to know.
18:28:02 <strcat[m]> perhaps we should drop Linux support from the official guide to simplify it
18:28:18 <strcat[m]> distributions without working fastboot
18:28:29 <strcat[m]>  * perhaps we should drop most Linux support from the official guide to simplify it
18:39:11 <Birdie[m]> <strcat[m] "perhaps we should drop Linux sup"> May I ask then that obviously the current guide was the winner over other options to help simplify the install for people?
18:39:48 <strcat[m]> Birdie: don't know what you mean
18:40:00 <strcat[m]> as I said help making a WebUSB installer is welcome
18:40:12 <strcat[m]> if you want to help with that, go ahead, but don't have the expectation that others will do the work
18:40:51 <strcat[m]> the normal guide is not going to tell people to trust some thing without verifying a signature
18:41:27 <strcat[m]> and the intent is to use distribution packages, but unfortunately most have broken packages
18:44:58 <strcat[m]> obviously we want a simple WebUSB installer for people since I've been saying that repeatedly
18:45:36 <strcat[m]> we do not want to have a CLI install process where you blindly trust some script - it defeats the whole purpose
18:47:36 <Birdie[m]> <strcat[m] "the normal guide is not going to"> Ya of course I understand that, I just thought this github account was on your team guys team at some point. https://github.com/Peter-Easton/grapheneos-easy-installer with his write ups to on gos In repo.
18:49:01 <strcat[m]> that's not official
18:49:16 <strcat[m]> and it just tells you to follow the guide from what I can see
18:50:38 <Birdie[m]> <strcat[m] "we do not want to have a CLI ins"> Ya it does, inregards though to the situation earlier with platform tools etc.. Is why I even mentioned it.
18:51:03 <strcat[m]> the standalone platform tools section is for OSes without a proper fastboot package
18:51:20 <strcat[m]> it has you run 3 commands to set it up
18:51:25 <strcat[m]> and sure, we could put those 3 commands in a script
18:51:33 <strcat[m]> I don't think that's actually going to help people
18:51:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> But why
18:52:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why does putting that in a script help people
18:52:18 <strcat[m]> you have to copy the curl command, optional verification, unzip, export path
18:52:42 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it won't
18:52:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: focus on the TTS thing
18:53:05 <strcat[m]> I want you to stop helping with installation issues
18:57:29 <camilica> Hi, anyone knows a safe photo vault app who secures and encrypted photo s on grapheneos?
18:58:04 <strcat[m]> storage is already encrypted
18:58:39 <strcat[m]> an app that stores data normally, internally, is perfectly fine
18:59:36 <camilica> Okey thanx
19:00:34 <strcat[m]> if you're specifically asking for something that has an extra layer of encrypted directories that sounds more like a storage provider app, not a photo app
19:00:46 <strcat[m]> as in you want something that lets you have assorted internal directories with their own passphrases?
19:00:53 <strcat[m]> separate from unlocking the profile
19:00:58 <strcat[m]> sounds like a storage provider app
19:01:01 <strcat[m]> do not know of one that exists
19:01:53 <camilica> Well i would like an app where i can store pictures and i can secure it with an passphrase
19:02:15 <camilica> Just dont know if there is a good one
19:02:29 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound specific to pictures
19:02:39 <strcat[m]> storage is already encrypted with the passphrase of the profile
19:02:49 <strcat[m]> consider putting things in a separate user profile if you want them to be separate
19:03:08 <camilica> Hmmm, didnt think about that. That might be a solution
19:03:15 <strcat[m]> as I said above there could be a storage provider app supporting encrypting internal directories with an extra layer of encryption via a passphrase per directory
19:03:20 <strcat[m]> but I do not think an app like that is available
19:04:17 <camilica> Well if it s not availible than a second profile could do the job
19:04:31 <camilica> Going to try that
19:04:35 <camilica> Thanks
19:06:05 <camilica> And a storage provider app is availible?
19:06:27 <camilica> So i can passphrase directories?

19:16:34 <strcat[m]> I don't think that's relevant
19:17:09 <Birdie[m]> Ok
19:17:12 <strcat[m]> the base OS functionality is that each user profile has separate credential-based encryption and GrapheneOS adds a logout option to the lockscreen and power action menu
19:17:42 <strcat[m]> an app offering storage providers encrypted internally with passphrases could be made, as I wrote above, no reason it has to be built into the OS
19:17:58 <strcat[m]> but you can already use profiles, everything is already encrypted and not with just 1 key
19:18:17 <strcat[m]> I'm not suggesting an app, I'm stating that it can be easily made
19:19:18 <Birdie[m]> <strcat[m] "the base OS functionality is tha"> That's why I mentioned it had no use for me on gos pixel because of what you already had setup.
19:19:36 <strcat[m]> okay but I don't see the relevance of that app
19:19:49 <strcat[m]> it's an outdated app that does not seem to do anything relevant to this
19:19:59 <strcat[m]> I think you're misunderstanding what it does
19:20:16 <strcat[m]> read the description
19:21:20 <Birdie[m]> <strcat[m] "I think you're misunderstanding "> Ya maybe youre right. I may have misunderstood
19:42:35 <organicpumpkin[m> strcat anupritaisno1 I don't know how long it will take for you folks to get the webusb installer up and running. But until you do, if you want help reducing these issues, I can help make changes to your official installation guide from a behavioural economics perspective that helps reduce human error from non-developers.
19:42:35 <organicpumpkin[m> No changes to your actual commands etc. Just in the way I present it.
19:42:35 <organicpumpkin[m> Please let me know if you are interested.
19:44:24 <Birdie[m]> "Well i would like an app where i can store pictures and i can secure it with an passphrase"
19:44:24 <Birdie[m]> And on Fdroids description. It
19:45:00 <strcat[m]> OrganicPumpkin: leave out anupritaisno1  from it
19:45:42 <nscnt> I would strip out, that you may use the platform-tools of your distribution. Why bother if you can get the newest platform-tools with 3 commands max?
19:46:17 <strcat[m]> that's a workaround for distributions with broken packages
19:46:21 <louipc> organicpumpkin[m: sounds interesting
19:46:29 <strcat[m]> I'm more inclined to stop supporting distributions with broken packages
19:46:35 <strcat[m]> and we just won't provide support on the channel for it
19:46:58 <strcat[m]> we'll ask people to file a bug with the distribution about it and request support from them with their packages
19:47:50 <nscnt> Wouldn't be: "Do not use any packages provided by your distribution. Use the following commands to obtain the platform-tools:" or something simpler?
19:47:55 <strcat[m]> no
19:48:01 <strcat[m]> the goal is not making it as simple as possible
19:48:05 <strcat[m]> it's doing it in the best way
19:48:15 <strcat[m]> the intention is to use distribution packages that are properly done
19:48:23 <strcat[m]> not trusting an additional source of software
19:48:28 <strcat[m]> putting that there is a workaround
19:48:42 <strcat[m]> the workaround is not going to replace the recommended and best way to do it
19:48:48 <nscnt> I undertand the not trusting part, true
19:49:00 <nscnt> *understand
19:49:09 <Birdie[m]> * "Well i would like an app where i can store pictures and i can secure it with an passphrase"
19:49:09 <Birdie[m]> And on Fdroids description. It stores media and encrypts it with a passphrase, so maybe I jumped the gun on it not storing it locally but could have nextcloud on homedesktop or laptop. Just my two cents IMHO.
19:49:13 <strcat[m]> why even bother with signing the factory images if we just have people install stuff like that
19:49:19 <strcat[m]>  * why even bother with signing the factory images if we just have people get stuff like that
19:49:37 <strcat[m]> might as well remove signify from the instructions if we do what you're suggesting
19:49:39 <nscnt> Yup, I was on the wrong path with that
19:49:41 <strcat[m]> because there's no point of it
19:50:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> OrganicPumpkin: I'll do webusb much later if I do get to it
20:00:56 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat[m] "why even bother with signing the"> Well, I am curious what the motivation behind including the alternate sources in your install guide was originally. Because I understand your point from a trust/security perspective and I am sure you would have thought of that earlier as well.
20:01:52 <strcat[m]> don't really understand what the purpose of your comments is meant to be
20:02:17 <strcat[m]> if you want to help with improving the guide or implementing the planned WebUSB installer, you're welcome to
20:02:32 <strcat[m]> I don't want an unproductive discussion without a purpose on this
20:02:58 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat[m] "if you want to help with improvi"> That is the purpose behind my comments.
20:04:28 <organicpumpkin[m> May I ask how to proceed? Would you like me to draw up a first draft and send it in?
20:08:48 <strcat[m]> make incremental changes
20:08:56 <strcat[m]> don't do a full rewrite, change it incrementally
20:09:08 <strcat[m]> if you make 10 changes and I agree with 6 it won't be merged
20:09:26 <strcat[m]> the more changes you make together, the less likely it is to be merged
20:09:49 <strcat[m]> make a pull request with a clear purpose / explanation
20:09:58 <strcat[m]> improving it in some way
20:10:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> OrganicPumpkin: already explained before
20:10:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> The initial draft should be a PoC demonstrating bootloader lock and unlock
20:13:39 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: that was about WebUSB
20:13:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: please just leave this to me
20:13:46 <strcat[m]> work on what you're already working on
20:14:11 <strcat[m]> you're not following the discussion, not helping to jump in
