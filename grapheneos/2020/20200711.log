01:16:10 <kukini[m]> If anyone is out there, I'm new to GrapheneOS and even newer to Matrix.
01:16:49 <kukini[m]> I'm really enjoying Graphene and not missing much about googled Android.
01:16:59 <alzxjm[m]> kukini: Welcome!
01:18:04 <kukini[m]> Fleksy though. I have been using openboard but it is not even close to Fleksy.
01:19:14 <kukini[m]> And since the keyboard is the most used function on a phone, I was hoping for a more efficient one. Anyone have any suggestions?
01:25:03 <kukini[m]> Also wondering if anyone has used an alternative launcher?
01:36:36 <CaptainPicard[m]> kukini: I just use the one built into the phone. I think some people have used Anysoftkeyboard from Fdroid
01:37:10 <CaptainPicard[m]> In general it's best practice for security to install software from as few sources/developers as possible, because you have to trust less people. With that in mind I haven't looked at launchers either
01:37:37 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS keyboard and GrapheneOS keyboard team represent
01:37:41 <cn3m[m]> launcher*
01:41:03 <crueltekk[m]> kukini Tried different launchers and have to say that none of them was quite interessting. And on graphene I wouldn't even recommend due to different permissions you have to give and sometimes even setup accessibility stuff.
01:41:03 <crueltekk[m]> For keyboard try anysoftkeyboard from fdroid :) kinda love that keyboard for android and it's FOSS :)
01:42:07 <kukini[m]> These have been my thoughts, that's why i came here with questions. "In general it's best practice for security to install software from as few sources/developers as possible, because you have to trust less people. With that in mind I haven't looked at launchers either"
01:44:27 <kukini[m]> Thanks for the input guys. I assumed this would be the feedback I would receive. Neither the keyboard or launcher is a deal breaker for me. Not worth looking to outside sources for the reasons y'all stated.
01:44:49 <kukini[m]> Just had to appease my curiosity.
01:49:33 <crueltekk[m]> <kukini[m] "Thanks for the input guys. I ass"> If it's no deal breaker for you then get F-Droid and try different launchers by yourself :) Some of them are worth to look at.
01:50:04 <CaptainPicard[m]> It's totally fine to try different launchers, just be mindful what permissions you grant them
01:50:27 <CaptainPicard[m]> Be especially wary of anything that asks for accessibility services. If granted they give the app in question more power than you have as the user
01:50:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> paintedman you here?
01:52:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Check your PM
01:53:41 <kukini[m]> Thanks for the advice. I'm sure I'll be back!
01:54:06 <crueltekk[m]> kukini you're welcome :)
01:54:55 <kukini[m]> Just thought of one more. A little petty but what about notification sounds. Talk about a throwback.
01:55:31 <kukini[m]> I haven't spent much time on it but it looks like one can use there own files.
01:57:43 <crueltekk[m]> <kukini[m] "I haven't spent much time on it "> I'm on Pixel 4 XL
01:58:07 <crueltekk[m]> Don't know other devices but there should be no difference :)
02:03:04 <crueltekk[m]> Just press a volume button and select the options menu, when you select to change a ringtone scroll down to the end there's the option to ad own sounds.
02:10:36 <crueltekk[m]> * Just press a volume button and select the options menu, when you select to change a ringtone scroll down to the end there's the option to add own sounds.
02:12:15 <kukini[m]> Thanks, I saw that too. Just too lazy to get the files, save them, and load them. :-l

06:23:49 <alicebobandeve[m> anupritaisno1: ok
06:23:56 <renlord> and does not implement the quicksearchbox widget either
06:24:24 <WhenIw> switch to andriod
06:24:28 <WhenIw> andriod is better
06:24:35 <WhenIw> best*
06:24:37 <renlord> i have it setup already on my branch, i dont think it addresses the issue

07:11:43 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy, mind if I take this one (first tier)?
07:11:55 <TheJollyRoger> WhenIw, what could I help you with?
07:12:00 <WhenIw> https://github.com/Yo-kai-Sei-shin-kage/makemon
07:13:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, heh, I was expecting you were looking more to install GrapheneOS and having an issue with that or something :\.
07:14:17 <WhenIw> nah man. do i like that broke to you? lol
07:14:21 <WhenIw> andirod is the way
07:14:42 <TheJollyRoger> <mandalorian voice>THIS IS THE WAY</voice>
07:14:45 * TheJollyRoger cracks up
07:14:47 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, couldn't resist :)
07:15:12 <WhenIw> ?
07:15:28 <TheJollyRoger> (reference to the TV show, nothing important.)
07:16:32 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like you should be able to run this just with the commandline...?
07:16:51 <TheJollyRoger> I usually put scripts like these into a directory in my home directory called ~/Applications/Scripts and then add it to my $PATH
07:17:17 <renlord> you need help and you sound like an ass.
07:17:34 <TheJollyRoger> (And chmod u+x it, obvs)
07:17:56 <renlord> an ass probably has better manners than you.
07:18:20 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy renlord.

07:19:09 <WhenIw> yehhhhh
07:19:21 <TheJollyRoger> WhenIw, if you're here for GrapheneOS, then you can be here for GrapheneOS, if not, you can leave this community.
07:19:37 <renlord> obviously a troll
07:19:49 <WhenIw> i would leave but i really dont have anyone else to ask for help
07:20:11 <renlord> WhenIw: https://betterfm.org/smart-questions.html
07:20:14 <renlord> then ask again
07:20:15 <TheJollyRoger> Other people's apps and scripts aren't our problem -- however I already said something there you could take a look at.

07:21:10 <TheJollyRoger> What he said.
07:21:56 <TheJollyRoger> WhenIw, other people's apps and scripts aren't our problem. You may have better luck asking in a channel that discusses bash, or your distribution.
07:22:07 <g65434-2[m]> i wasnt sure it was a troll albeit having suspicion, now i'm sure

07:22:40 <TheJollyRoger> So I suggest you go find a channel that deals with either of those.
07:23:08 <WhenIw> what other cahannels?
07:23:14 <renlord> file an issue
07:23:20 <renlord> at their repo
07:23:31 <WhenIw> the dude has clrealy not been fucking active since 2018
07:23:38 <WhenIw> fuck off you piece of shit renlord
07:23:44 <renlord> can we ban ^
07:23:44 <WhenIw> you clearly dont know anything
07:23:52 <renlord> bye
07:24:21 <TheJollyRoger> Well, as always I try to act in good faith... might've been a bit too lenient this time.
07:24:26 <TheJollyRoger> Ah well.
07:25:18 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry you guys had to put up with him for so long. If he returns ping me.
07:25:56 <renlord> the asker sounded like a markov spam bot
07:26:38 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. Every year those things are getting more sophisticated.
07:29:53 <strcat> lol he sent me some pasted logs

07:45:40 <renor> The privacy youtuber 'TheHatedOne' just made a video about GrapheneOS: https://invidio.us/watch?v=xIXAzA555xk
07:53:21 <renlord> wtf in the vidoe, the maker disabled network perm for auditor
07:53:24 <renlord> LOL
07:53:32 <renlord> should use a different app as smaple
07:59:12 <JTL> bonerdose[m]: Someone with many years of experience with this and related matters :)
08:15:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: yeah since that's actually useful
08:15:45 <strcat[m]> I recommend using the attestation.app service - there isn't really a reason not to use it
08:16:35 <strcat[m]> I probably need to make it clearer that the fingerprint / identity for attestation is just the sha256 hash of the public key for the hardware-backed key generated for the pairing
08:16:46 <strcat[m]> if you wipe data for the app or clear pairings, that key is gone
08:17:16 <strcat[m]> and it's a different key for each pairing (remote attestation is just a pairing with attestation.app in a different namespace than the local verification pairings)
08:52:16 <cn3m[m]> renlord: yeah, but it is a very good video compared to the crud on YouTube
08:52:21 <cn3m[m]> this is a huge win for the quality of the representation of the project
09:07:19 <pikey[m]> <haran "Hi All, I am looking for a good "> I have tested quite a few, most are rubbish. I used TapeACall pro on iphone for quite a few years and it's excellent, but since moving to Graphene (and new phone contract/number) I found that cell providers in my country no longer off 3 way calling which TaC relies on. It's fantastic quality but you need to be able to "merge calls". However tghey updated their privacy policy a
09:07:19 <pikey[m]> few days ago and I have some concerns. I have emailed them and awaiting replies to my questions.
09:07:57 <pikey[m]> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fragileheart.callrecorder
09:08:21 <pikey[m]> i found apk for it (apkpure or apk mirror i think).
09:09:29 <pikey[m]> <strcat[m] "I recommend using the attestatio"> Fantastic app. I keep getting "failed to submit remote attestation" but i think it's a VPN issue so I am working on that. I wouldn't be without attestation.app :)
09:13:12 <strcat[m]> pikey: you could check adb logcat after it happens to figure it out
09:13:22 <strcat[m]> also you can use adb to force the job to run
09:13:59 <strcat[m]> having the exception might not really help you debug it though
09:14:21 <strcat[m]> since I assume it's a network issue
09:24:43 <renor> > this is a huge win for the quality of the representation of the project
09:24:43 <renor> Yeah, I too think this is good. I'm not a follower of this youtuber, but it has a considerable ammount of followers and the explanation he gives in the video is good
09:24:45 <pikey[m]> thanks. Yes pretty sure it's a network issue. The strange thing is my relative ran Graphene for a few months on the same device, and he ran PIA too, and never had any connection issues. The only difference was the cellular network provider. I have asked them if they block any IPs or VPNs, they claim not to but I am not so sure. Anyway..... adb stuff is not something I am much good with (struggled my way through flashing
09:24:45 <pikey[m]> Graphene thanks mainly to TheVeryJollyRoger :D)
09:26:00 <pikey[m]> One thing I am struggling with is working out how to customise notifications. That's not a GOS issue, more just Android in general and it being new to me. But I keep getting "Signal background connection enabled", and its a persistent notification so I can't get rid of it from the pull down. If anyone knows what it means and if I can stop it notifying, please shout.
09:27:06 <f8sai[m]> <pikey[m] "One thing I am struggling with i"> Not recommended to remove it, it helps to tell whenever you'll get notification for your messages
09:28:06 <f8sai[m]> You may put it into silent though, or disable the "others" on the notification, but then you will not be able to tell whenever you'll get notifications or not
09:28:19 <f8sai[m]> (On the Signal app, or Riot, that is)

09:46:20 <pacobell[m]> Why is Seedvault refusing to backup to my USB drive in GOS?
09:47:17 <pacobell[m]> And it honors the "App doesn't allow backup" flag?
09:47:25 <pacobell[m]> That's disappointing.
09:47:54 <dazinism> USB flash stick?
09:49:18 <pacobell[m]> Eh, micro SD in an adapter, but close enough.
09:49:46 <dazinism> The flag is set by app devs for a reason. Often because a backup would be useless as data is tied to the device
09:49:49 <pacobell[m]> Actually, two adapters. The OS sees it just fine, tho.
09:50:35 <dazinism> Or something else about how the app works
09:51:07 <dazinism> Not sure why seedvault doesnt see the drive
09:51:25 <dazinism> Would defo expect it to if the OS sees the storage
09:51:41 <pacobell[m]> It does see it. The problem is that it keeps erroring out when it tries to initiate the backup.
09:52:24 <pacobell[m]> I had done a backup previously when I first installer GOS. Perfectly fine.
09:52:38 <pacobell[m]> But it decided to shit the bed today.
09:52:58 <pacobell[m]> I have no confidence that my previous backups will even restore properly.
09:53:34 <dazinism> Try filing an issue on the seedvault github. Tend to get responded to quickly
09:53:42 <pacobell[m]> Do I just need to nuke the previous backups and start anew?
09:54:04 <dazinism> Or in the feenode channel
09:54:06 <pacobell[m]> I know it's tied to a different encryption key.
09:54:47 <pacobell[m]> I'll check the GitHub to see if anyone else is experiencing this.
09:55:02 <pacobell[m]> I really need backup to be reliable.
09:55:20 <dazinism> #freenode_#seedvault:matrix.org
09:55:29 <pacobell[m]> Especially since Google reiterated that they don't care about offline backup in their recent AMA.
09:56:33 <dazinism> pacobell: I keep an eye on seedvault github issues. Dont recall seeing anyone with similar issies
09:56:35 <pacobell[m]> <dazinism "#freenode_#seedvault:matrix.org"> Tnx
09:57:52 <dazinism> pacobell: no doubt catching an adb logcat just after it fails would be useful
09:58:31 <dazinism> Or using bug report in developer options
09:58:38 <pikey[m]> q22: @f8sai:privacytools.io Thanks, that picture helped a lot. I was also wondering similar about Riot. I don't want it updatig at all in background. I don'yt want any notifications. I use my desktop for Riot, just want it on phone in case I want to open it up when I am mobile which isn't very often. Trying to work out what each 'type' of notiofcation does is tricky! thanjks again
09:58:40 <pacobell[m]> I would, but my only laptop just went kaput due to faulty USB-C ports 😣
09:59:04 <pacobell[m]> Any way to view logcat from within GOS?
09:59:06 <pikey[m]> "other" off - got rid of that, perfect thanks!
10:00:09 <dazinism> <pacobell[m] "Any way to view logcat from with"> Dont think its possible without another device. Although the bug report feature above is.
10:00:33 <dazinism> *feature I mentioned is
10:01:10 <pacobell[m]> Btw, HP's EliteBook USB-C implementation is dumb. They claim Power Delivery 3.0 compatibility, but it's a lie.
10:01:38 <dazinism> I've not tried using bug report, think it saves a file you can email
10:01:57 <pacobell[m]> Ooh! Let's see.
10:02:34 <dazinism> Apparently loads of usb c implementations arent done well. Either in hardware and/or software
10:03:17 <dazinism> Why the GrapheneOS install guide recommends using USB A to C
10:03:30 <pacobell[m]> In HP's case, I think they're using some proprietary implementation that only allows their chargers.
10:03:44 <dazinism> Nice
10:03:55 <dazinism> :/
10:04:20 <pacobell[m]> After a couple tries using a known PD3.0 charger, I think it "locked" the ports.
10:04:32 <pacobell[m]> Now it won't even charge with the HP charger. So dumb.
10:04:51 <dazinism> Extra nice.
10:05:49 <pacobell[m]> Or maybe it's proprietary wonkiness fried those ports' controller boards. Who knows?
10:07:04 <pacobell[m]> You can tell they knew it was non-standard because they even have a scary graphical popup in Windows telling you as such.
10:07:46 <pacobell[m]> Anyway, way off-topic. I'll shut up about that now.
10:11:14 <hiya> Is it easy to move your data from Google's calendar, email, notes to Nextcloud?
10:11:19 <hiya> Self-hosted one
10:12:00 <pacobell[m]> Oh, does GOS support reading any other filesystem on USB storage other than FAT32? I really don't feel comfortable storing anything on that fs.
10:12:14 <pacobell[m]> I'm really hoping for at least exfat.
10:12:48 <pacobell[m]> <hiya "Is it easy to move your data fro"> I'm wondering the same thing.
10:16:50 <strcat[m]> pacobell: no not atm
10:17:10 <strcat[m]> Linux only recently got exFAT support upstream and it will be a while before that's in the LTS branches being used
10:18:17 <pacobell[m]> Huh, so I bit the bullet and reformatted my card in GOS. Seedvault still refuses to backup.
10:18:39 <pacobell[m]> I dunno what else to try.
10:19:02 <alzxjm[m]> <hiya "Is it easy to move your data fro"> That's kind of a big question. Nextcloud does not do email. It has a basic notes app, which I actually really like, but if you're talking about getting your notes out of Google Keep into Nextcloud, I'm not sure there's an easy way. Standard Notes has a Google Keep import tool which could be an intermediate step. It converts everything from Google Keep's Takeout export (html I
10:19:02 <alzxjm[m]> think) to text files.
10:19:47 <strcat[m]> pacobell: have you tested that it works
10:21:41 <alzxjm[m]> Calendar is the option out of those that works best with Nextcloud. I'm not sure if you can import a Google calendar directly, but Nextcloud has great calendar functionality. To get it to work on GrapheneOS you'll need to download DAVx5. This will sync your contacts, calendar, and tasks.
10:23:07 <strcat[m]> > exFAT was a proprietary file system until 2019 when Microsoft released the specification and allowed OIN members to use their patents
10:23:19 <strcat[m]> that's why it wasn't supported until recently - people didn't want to use it due to patents
10:25:59 <pacobell[m]> <strcat[m] "pacobell: have you tested that i"> It didn't seem to at first, but I guess I just had to wait a few seconds? I guess I'll see when I go to restore something.
10:26:29 <pacobell[m]> There's very little visual feedback that stuff is happening.
10:26:42 <strcat[m]> it shows progress in a notification
10:26:52 <pacobell[m]> I just noticed the notification indicator.
10:27:06 <strcat[m]> you can test by using some sample app, storing data in it, and using the functionality to restore data after uninstalling and installing the app again
10:27:16 <strcat[m]> need to enable that feature
10:27:35 <pacobell[m]> I'll try it on an innocuous app I'm not really invested in right now m
10:27:40 <strcat[m]> exFAT would be a nicer filesystem but it just wasn't supported upstream until recently
10:27:53 <strcat[m]> better performance and higher limits on file size, that's about it
10:28:00 <pacobell[m]> >4GB files would be nice.
10:28:30 <pacobell[m]> * greater than
10:28:52 <pacobell[m]> Ugh, this auto formatting needs a way to escape.
10:30:28 <pacobell[m]> Wow, it couldn't backup 84 apps. The app ecosystem really is kinda shitty.
10:31:23 <pacobell[m]> What the hell does "backup quota exceeded" mean?
10:33:46 <pacobell[m]> <pacobell[m] "Wow, it couldn't backup 84 apps."> That's like 59% of all my apps 😢
10:37:15 <strcat[m]> pacobell: a lot of apps disable backups
10:37:24 <strcat[m]> because they are too lazy to blacklist which files are device specific, etc.
10:38:25 <strcat[m]> backup is enabled by default
10:38:39 <pacobell[m]> Fuck me
10:38:40 <hiya> alzxjm[m]: So basically, Google is not migration or export friendly
10:39:00 <strcat[m]> pacobell: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup#EnablingAutoBackup
10:39:06 <strcat[m]> I don't know why so many apps disable it
10:39:44 <pacobell[m]> So I should just yell at every dev that does this nonsense.
10:39:55 <strcat[m]> so basically you're supposed to exclude caches and other stuff that can be regenerated via excluding files
10:40:13 <strcat[m]> and exclude stuff specific to a device (not common other than caches)
10:40:18 <strcat[m]> pacobell: sure
10:40:36 <strcat[m]> pacobell: as an example in our control though, Vanadium excludes most files from backup because it inherits that from Chromium
10:41:00 <pacobell[m]> I appreciate that
10:41:10 <strcat[m]> the reason is that Chromium has a sync implementation (but we don't implement all that stuff and point it at our own service - afaik there isn't an open source implementation of the service anyway)
10:41:23 <strcat[m]> so they can't have 2 overlapping backup mechanisms
10:41:40 <strcat[m]> and we haven't had time to get it enabled for everything sync usually covers
10:41:41 <pacobell[m]> K, just reinstalled a backed up app. Didn't see an indication that data was restored.
10:41:48 <strcat[m]> pacobell: you have to enable that feature
10:41:53 <strcat[m]> it's not on by default
10:41:54 <pacobell[m]> Yup
10:42:17 <strcat[m]> check if the data was restored
10:42:22 <strcat[m]> the install process triggers it
10:42:42 <strcat[m]> ofc it needs to be an app that doesn't disable backups or exclude the relevant files
10:43:00 <pacobell[m]> <strcat[m] "ofc it needs to be an app that d"> I made sure of that
10:43:04 <strcat[m]> as another example Signal disables backups because they do their own encrypted backups
10:43:15 <strcat[m]> I don't know why so many apps disable it though
10:43:26 <strcat[m]> just how things are, most devs set backups disabled for no particular reason
10:43:33 <pacobell[m]> I always forget to export my Signal backups 😣
10:43:36 <strcat[m]> I think because Android Studio tells you to explicitly mark it
10:43:43 <strcat[m]> and devs just disable it
10:43:51 <strcat[m]> because it's easier than thinking about if you should exclude anything
10:44:43 <pacobell[m]> So, just to be clear, there's no explicit notification telling you your app data's been restored, right?
10:45:14 <pacobell[m]> It all just happens silently in the background?
10:48:14 <pacobell[m]> Damn! That FairEmail dev pushes updates way too often 😂
10:49:05 <pacobell[m]> It's like every time I open the app, I get an update notification.
10:49:36 <pacobell[m]> Really nice Autocrypt implementation, tho.
11:00:17 <strcat[m]> pacobell: it doesn't happen in the background
11:00:24 <strcat[m]> it happens as part of installing the app
11:00:29 <strcat[m]> the app isn't installed until the data is restored
11:00:38 <strcat[m]> it's part of installing it, the backup implementation is integrated into the OS
11:00:51 <strcat[m]> it's not some hack that comes along after the install and drops the data in
11:00:53 <strcat[m]> where there could be a race
11:01:11 <strcat[m]> if restore failed the app would fail to be installed
11:01:15 <pacobell[m]> That's good to know. So the very fact that it installed at all means that the data was restored?
11:01:22 <strcat[m]> yes if there was data to restore
11:01:30 <strcat[m]> it's a hook triggered as part of installing the app
11:01:41 <pacobell[m]> Very cool
11:01:50 <strcat[m]> it's not done after the install, is the important part
11:01:56 <strcat[m]> but rather the OS calls into it during the install process
11:02:21 <pacobell[m]> I'm guessing that's how Google does it from their own cloud backups as well?
11:02:24 <strcat[m]> it's the same backup infrastructure used for Google's Google Drive based backups
11:02:32 <strcat[m]> pacobell: it's exactly the same infrastructure
11:02:32 <pacobell[m]> Right.
11:02:38 <strcat[m]> and I'd guess that Samsung, etc. probably have their own backup services too
11:03:52 <pacobell[m]> Bleh, neither Vanadium nor Bromite will reset my password on this website due to their buggy js 😭
11:04:11 <strcat[m]> adb backup / restore also reuses the same infrastructure, but at a lower level, it's not a backup service implementation
11:04:23 <strcat[m]> pacobell: just note seedvault doesn't yet back up your home directory, just app data
11:04:41 <strcat[m]> i.e. the part you can't do yourself without seedvault
11:04:44 <pacobell[m]> <strcat[m] "pacobell: just note seedvault do"> Noted.
11:06:15 <pacobell[m]> <pacobell[m] "Bleh, neither Vanadium nor Bromi"> Guess I have to use a "dangerous" browser
11:08:11 <pacobell[m]> Also, b/c I wrap most every app in Tor, I'm getting really tired of tapping on umbrellas and trucks 😛
11:13:47 <strcat> 04:03:36 WhenIw | do your parents know you're a fucking idiot?
11:13:53 <strcat> that guy still messaging me
11:13:55 <strcat> good stuff
11:14:28 <f8sai[m]> Isn't he/she already kicked though
11:15:40 <pacobell[m]> Is that person behind 7 proxies? 😏
11:17:21 <f8sai[m]> Surprised somebody uses 84 apps in one profile
11:19:39 <pacobell[m]> I'm evaluating a lot of apps. Some may come and go over the next few weeks.
11:20:30 <pacobell[m]> Huh, so you can remove posts here.
11:20:37 <f8sai[m]> I see then, some sadly had issues on non-main profiles. I rather do tests there
11:20:40 <f8sai[m]> Yes, on Riot.im
11:20:46 <f8sai[m]> RiotX not really
11:20:58 <f8sai[m]> <f8sai[m] "RiotX not really"> Check how this message gets deleted
11:21:20 <pacobell[m]> Tada!
11:22:24 <pacobell[m]> I don't think that PurpleAir map is working. I just wanna know if the air outside is safe to breathe due to the fires here in CA.
11:23:08 <f8sai[m]> <f8sai[m] "I see then, some sadly had issue"> More often, closed source apps had issues or not running at all on non-main profiles, GOS or not
11:23:22 <pacobell[m]> I would check my local sensor, but I forgot its local IP address and my Google WiFi app doesn't work on GOS.
11:24:32 <pacobell[m]> What's a good IP scanner app on Android?
11:24:33 <f8sai[m]> Have you tested it with Calyx? (If you can afford to reflash and backup stuffs9
11:25:43 <pacobell[m]> What, the VPN service?
11:26:24 <pacobell[m]> <f8sai[m] "Have you tested it with Calyx? ("> What, the VPN service?
11:26:38 <f8sai[m]> No, I meant the OS itself, and sadly couldn't help with IP scanner app
11:26:42 <f8sai[m]> Never used one myself
11:26:54 <f8sai[m]> My apologies
11:27:44 <pacobell[m]> The Calyx folks have their own flavor of Android?
11:28:16 <f8sai[m]> Yeah, I thought everyone knows here. They had microG, just for you to know
11:28:32 <pacobell[m]> News to me
11:28:45 <pacobell[m]> I'll check it out, I suppose.
11:29:24 <pacobell[m]> So Calyx allows for root?
11:29:38 <f8sai[m]> You can check their room here, or check their logs on freenode, or even some mentions here.
11:29:38 <f8sai[m]> Only if some (vital) apps used was still dependent to some play services replacement, I would have used that.
11:29:50 <f8sai[m]> <pacobell[m] "So Calyx allows for root?"> Nope afaik
11:29:56 <f8sai[m]> Or rather not too sure
11:30:02 <f8sai[m]> But they have verified boot like GOS
11:30:26 <pacobell[m]> Or microG is just baked into /system?
11:30:29 <f8sai[m]> (Well, maybe I'm getting off-topic, go duck it or searx it)
11:30:42 <f8sai[m]> Probably, you can opt in/out
11:30:48 <pacobell[m]> That's nice.
11:31:38 <pacobell[m]> I'm trying to de-Google, but it's gonna be a process.
11:31:44 <f8sai[m]> Never used it myself though, but I invited you there
11:31:51 <pacobell[m]> Gotta find decent alternatives.
11:32:15 <f8sai[m]> (I'm pretty much contented on GOS due to complete independence on gms/gsf)

21:56:52 <larncat[m]> Hello everyone. I'm a happily running GOS for about a day now. Having dabbled with custom android OSes going back a decade, color me satisfied. I could gush about this.. this was exactly what I was looking for!
21:57:51 <cn3m[m]> :)
21:59:57 <larncat[m]> On Verizon wireless VoLTE is working now. I struggled with this since leaving VZs OS. Wifi texting and calling were a huge loss as well as I'm often in a fringe reception area.
22:00:04 <larncat[m]> :)
22:00:37 <larncat[m]> Unreliable SMS/MMS is such a pain!
22:02:13 <larncat[m]> And now it works over WiFi using Signal and enabling its WiFi compatibility switch. QKSMS+ does not work on WiFi only.
22:03:51 <larncat[m]> WiFi calling is a no go. I've seen discussion on this, so hopefully this is a possibility.
22:06:08 <larncat[m]> I'm curious what mechanism of Signal enables seamless WiFi SMS/MMS. This was my experience with the nexus 5x as well on Verizon.
22:07:03 <larncat[m]> ..years ago.
22:10:57 <larncat[m]> another detail is that WiFi texting on VZ using the Signal method won't initially work while connected to a VPN. This was also my experience years ago.
22:17:30 <larncat[m]> Pressing the 'Trigger carrier provisioning' button on the bottom of the com.android.settings.RadioInfo page (*#*#4636#*#*) was necessary to receive calls in GOS. This was my experience on LOS as well. That seems to have a consistent result in getting calls and SMS registered. LOS was buggy and I had to trigger provisioning every reboot. I've had that activity bookmarked for some time.. very useful.
22:18:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> LOS?
22:18:43 <cn3m[m]> LineageOS
22:19:45 <larncat[m]> So far triggering carrier provisioning was only necessary once under GOS with the Pixel 3. This has survived multiple reboots and an OS update and I'm reliably receiving calls and texts
22:20:09 <larncat[m]> LOS 17.1 Official
22:20:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah that
22:21:40 <larncat[m]> 😃
22:22:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk why that might happen
22:22:56 <larncat[m]> So glad to be off that. Although It did inspire me to run Android 10 on my aging device, once it had official release status
22:22:59 <nickcalyx[m]> maybe some of the carrier provisioning stuff isn't in AOSP
22:24:02 <larncat[m]> Yeah me neither. 'Trigger carrier provisioning' has a real and immediate effect when in a fringe reception area with connectivity issues.
22:24:13 <larncat[m]> On Verizon
22:24:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> larncat: lineageos is just not serious with pixel
22:25:07 <larncat[m]> Was running on a V20
22:25:34 <larncat[m]> That was a great device, but old
22:27:38 <larncat[m]> LG just won't give u VoLTE et all on a custom ROM, which is why I'm so relieved now, cause I got a Pixel :)
22:28:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Disagree
22:28:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> AFAIK that device could only boot GSIs for a very long time
22:28:29 <cn3m[m]> A good device was a Nexus 5 or an iPhone 6

22:33:25 <larncat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "That's all you need to do to pro"> Awesome, thanks.
22:34:45 <larncat[m]> Is VoWifi on Pixel with VZ a work in progress?
22:35:45 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "cn3m: I tell you 95% of those co"> how do you like the Pixel 4?
22:35:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> larncat: basically google just threw all the app permissions into a single file
22:35:57 <g65434-2[m]> vim is a godsent
22:36:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have it fixed locally but you'd need to properly fix this
22:36:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> I first fixed it now slowly cleaning it up
22:37:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "how do you like the Pixel 4?"> Would reply with 👎
22:37:54 <cn3m[m]> really?
22:38:00 <larncat[m]> Wow
22:38:13 <larncat[m]> Deal breaker?
22:38:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
22:38:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are many places google needs to seriously think about improving
22:40:50 <larncat[m]> Eschewing the fingerprint reader was unfortunate.
22:41:14 <nickcalyx[m]> > Eschewing the fingerprint reader was unfortunate.
22:41:15 <nickcalyx[m]> Agreed
22:41:53 <nickcalyx[m]> I dont want face unlock
22:42:20 <larncat[m]> meneither
22:42:46 <JTL> Agreed
22:43:08 <larncat[m]> Strong password with usable biometrics is key

22:45:18 <larncat[m]> Gotcha.. Biggies
22:45:49 <larncat[m]> Frankly interesting points.
22:46:38 <g65434-2[m]> guess 3/3a are best picks for now then

22:47:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> The small size of the phone is also pretty nice
22:48:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> I never use camera so couldn't tell you about it, sorry
22:49:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> So why a 👎? Many of these issues are simply not acceptable for the price these go for
22:49:07 <larncat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I have it fixed locally but you'"> Is this in regards to WiFi calling?
22:49:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
22:49:29 <larncat[m]> Cool
22:49:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> So far my implementation works without needing to do anything manually

22:50:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Note that voice over WiFi turns off voice over LTE
22:50:52 <g65434-2[m]> ugh, volte when flashbacks on xda
22:51:01 <larncat[m]> Interesting. Are the switches still locked out in com.android.settings.RadioInfo?
22:51:20 <larncat[m]> <g65434-2[m] "ugh, volte when flashbacks on xd"> Yeah
22:52:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> larncat: yes
22:52:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can unlock them but it is useless
22:52:57 <larncat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I can unlock them but it is usel"> Sure
22:53:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk what UT interface is btw
22:53:26 <larncat[m]> Was that screenshot from the SIM status page?
22:53:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes

22:54:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's going to take a very long time to land WiFi calling in grapheneos btw
22:54:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Especially if I'm the only one wanting to fix this
22:55:14 <larncat[m]> Very interesting. It's encouraging that WiFi calling can work. Especially if you're off grid for wireless.
22:56:17 <larncat[m]> Hmm. EID unknown. What is EID?
22:56:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Indian carriers....
22:57:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> They don't send all the fields
22:57:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Many things will show up as unknown even on stock
22:57:39 <larncat[m]> Aha. Interestingly, on VZ ROM EID is registered.
22:57:56 <larncat[m]> With IMS
23:00:27 <larncat[m]> anupritaisno1  are you building GOS with a modified carrier provisioning file to accomplish this?
23:01:56 <rover1[m]> there a way kill processes in other profile when switch?
23:03:04 <rover1[m]>  * there a way kill processes in other profile when switch profiles?
23:58:30 <larncat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It's going to take a very long t"> Thanks for the info. Setting my expectations appropriately.
