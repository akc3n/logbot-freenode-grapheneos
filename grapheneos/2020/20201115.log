00:07:43 <very_sneaky> out of curiosity, is there anything that can be done from a graphene perspective to support push notifications? or is this an issue with the way the majority of apps have implemented the feature to work specifically with the gsf api?
00:08:21 <strcat[m]> push notifications work on GrapheneOS as long as the apps provide an implementation not depending on Google's FCM being provided by the OS
00:08:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> very_sneaky: whitelist apps in battery optimization
00:08:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> And bug developers to support websockets
00:08:44 <strcat[m]> apps can request battery optimization exceptions if they need them
00:08:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Signal does this correctly
00:08:55 <strcat[m]> they don't need to use websockets, that's just one way to do a push connection
00:09:00 <very_sneaky> yeah, I've noticed that some do, but a lot don't - signal being an example of one that worked correctly
00:09:18 <strcat[m]> so for example for email, IMAP provides a IMAP IDLE for doing push
00:09:29 <strcat[m]> email apps can keep open an IMAP connection and use IMAP IDLE to do push instead of polling
00:09:39 <very_sneaky> is there a path to supporting apps that don't by mocking the gsf api in a non hacky way?
00:09:45 <strcat[m]> and they can run a foreground service to keep doing it in the background
00:10:14 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: if an app uses FCM to send messages, there is no way to get those without using FCM, official implementation or not
00:10:28 <strcat[m]> and we're not hard-wiring support for Google services into the OS with special privileges unavailable to regular apps
00:10:39 <strcat[m]> that is counter to the goals and methods of GrapheneOS
00:10:43 <very_sneaky> what's fcm?
00:10:50 <strcat[m]> google it
00:10:57 <very_sneaky> yeah, i appreciate that, i'm just ignorant on the topic, wondering if there is a way around google
00:11:22 <strcat[m]> you're asking if there is a way to use Google's cloud messaging service on GrapheneOs
00:11:29 <strcat[m]>  * you're asking if there is a way to use Google's cloud messaging service on GrapheneOS
00:11:33 <strcat[m]> you're not asking for a way to avoid using it, you're asking how to use it
00:12:27 <strcat[m]> also an app using FCM when available does not at all stop them from providing a different implementation when it's not available, either because the device doesn't have Play services, or Play services is disabled by the user, or the FCM service is down / unavailable such as when it's blocked (in China, for example)
00:13:02 <strcat[m]> apps are perfectly capable of doing push for notifications or other features without FCM
00:13:05 <strcat[m]> and many do
00:13:29 <strcat[m]> I gave the example of how IMAP provides push via the IMAP IDLE feature
00:13:46 <strcat[m]> an email app implementing IMAP and important standard extensions will support that
00:14:04 <strcat[m]> most email servers do not support sending notifications via FCM... but do support IMAP IDLE
00:14:20 <very_sneaky> sure, so the issue at the moment is predominantly that because play services are so ubiquitous on android phones, there isn't _wide_ adoption of alternative methods for push notifications
00:14:33 <strcat[m]> so if an email app doesn't support it, that's a pretty glaring flaw whether or not Play services is available
00:14:34 <very_sneaky> with some notable exceptions
00:15:47 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: a lot of developers don't bother with support for not having Play services, whether because it's not integrated into the OS, is disabled, or the Google services are not available
00:15:48 <strcat[m]> as mentioned above
00:16:11 <strcat[m]> it's the responsibility of app developers to do this, there is no way of getting push notifications without FCM if they chose to ONLY do it via FCM
00:16:43 <strcat[m]> microG is not an alternative to FCM, rather it provides an incomplete implementation of a subset of Play services APIs including a partial implementation of FCM
00:16:47 <strcat[m]> it uses the Google services
00:17:08 <strcat[m]> it is not a way to avoid Google services, rather it's a very incomplete implementation of Play services
00:17:22 <strcat[m]> and like Play services is only designed to be built into the OS
00:17:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is quite insecure too
00:17:29 <strcat[m]> with a bunch of whitelisting and special privileges granted
00:17:56 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: ultimately, you'll have to get the developers to implement support for not depending on Google services
00:18:16 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: the main issue is that users do not push developers to do this
00:18:40 <very_sneaky> yeah gotcha. and I assume the issue with FCM is that it _is_ a google service, i.e. it uses google cloud infrastructure for support, rather than being a protocol who's implementation is infrastructure independent?
00:18:46 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: there are a lot of people without Play services on their phones, but they don't push developers to support it, or they take an approach like using a broken and incomplete reimplementation using the same Google services (microG)
00:19:05 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: FCM inherently uses Google's FCM servers
00:19:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Microg doesn't have TLS pinning and doesn't verify apps that interface with it. Accepting input from untrusted external plugin providers on an app holding almost a supercookie to your google account is also a very terrible idea
00:19:10 <rayromano[m]> <louipc "rayromano: aurora store version "> Thank you very much for the response! I will check that out!
00:19:16 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: it would be possible to implement a push protocol that was server agnostic
00:19:18 <strcat[m]> FCM is not that
00:19:23 <strcat[m]> FCM means using Google's FCM servers
00:19:34 <very_sneaky> okay, cool. the issues are a bit clearer for me now
00:19:34 <strcat[m]> it implies that the app's server sends messages to Google's servers
00:19:40 <strcat[m]> and Google delivers them to the device
00:19:53 <strcat[m]> using hard-wired support in the base OS with special integration / whitelisting
00:20:11 <strcat[m]> there is no alternative way to use FCM that avoids using their FCM servers, the app is sending the messages to Google
00:20:13 <strcat[m]> not to you
00:20:20 <strcat[m]>  * there is no alternative way to use FCM that avoids using their FCM servers, the app server is sending the messages to Google
00:20:25 <very_sneaky> yep cool, that confirms my read of it
00:20:47 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: it would have been entirely possible for this to be an open protocol that's server agnostic
00:20:51 <strcat[m]> very easy to design it that way
00:20:54 <strcat[m]> it's just not what FCM is
00:21:00 <very_sneaky> i wonder if something like that does exist
00:21:53 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: it was starting to exist but the emerging push ecosystem got wiped out by Apple and Google providing their own and giving them special privileges unavailable to others, particularly on iOS, where there is no way to do it another way
00:22:23 <strcat[m]> on Android you can do it another way, but you have to show a foreground service and ask for a battery optimization to match what FCM does - FCM just has an implicit ability to do that as part of being hard-wired into the OS
00:22:54 <strcat[m]> it has a battery optimization exception via the sysconfig configuration and has a similar whitelist to allow it to run in the background without a foreground service
00:23:00 <very_sneaky> interesting. so if such a protocol was developed, it might eb able to be hardwired in to, say, graphene in the same way?
00:23:18 <strcat[m]> sure, but it doesn't have to be hard-wired
00:23:21 <strcat[m]> it can work without that
00:23:39 <strcat[m]> just requires you to accept the dialog it shows asking for a battery optimization exception + live with the fact that it shows a foreground service is running
00:23:59 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: it would be entirely possible to implement this with a single app + server providing push for multiple apps via an open protocol
00:24:31 <strcat[m]> very_sneaky: best way to do it is probably with a library that provides push notifications with the app's server, and can *optionally* use a central service
00:24:35 <very_sneaky> i guess i'm just thinking that perhaps that's part of the issue with adoption of alternate methods by app developers
00:24:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "just requires you to accept the "> Actually no
00:24:47 <strcat[m]> this is what would be evolved if APNS and FCM had not been done the way they were
00:24:51 <very_sneaky> no standardised, service agnostic way of doing it
00:25:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> You have to either accept the battery optimization exemption or have a foreground notification
00:25:24 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no, that's not accurate
00:25:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Foreground notification is redundant with battery optimization
00:25:35 <strcat[m]> it's not
00:25:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: no, that's not ac"> Isn't that what allows gms to not show a notification?
00:26:02 <strcat[m]> no
00:26:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmmm
00:26:20 <strcat[m]> they are orthogonal things
00:26:22 <strcat[m]> they don't really overlap
00:26:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pretty sure I read that battery optimization exemption is basically a permission to allow starting in background
00:26:46 <strcat[m]> the main thing done by the battery optimization exception is simply allowing network access during doze, etc.
00:26:49 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you're wrong
00:26:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> K
00:27:09 <strcat[m]> battery optimization exception hardly does anything other than allowing network access during doze, etc.
00:27:16 <strcat[m]> it does do some minor other things
00:27:23 <strcat[m]> such as allowing more precise alarms
00:27:28 <strcat[m]> that's why DeskClock needed it
00:27:59 <strcat[m]> it does not override any restrictions on running code in the background
00:29:28 <strcat[m]> a foreground service is needed if you want to keep a process running, in general
00:30:08 <strcat[m]> Play services has multiple privileged permissions, a battery optimization exception, is whitelisted as a provider for various things and has other exceptions
00:34:21 <strcat[m]> it is not simply a regular app
00:34:32 <strcat[m]> and cannot function as one
01:13:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Testers are needed to test certain carrier related changes. If you are on any of the supported non legacy devices please pm me. You also need to have a carrier that has either volte or WiFi calling and the fact that it is not working on grapheneos. You'll be given an unofficial build to test if it works. Remember that this means your device will be wiped during testing
01:16:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are people who are spreading misinformation about grapheneos. Anybody who can volunteer to help us against those trying to spread libel about the project can pm me. Please actually mention why you have pm'd me, don't just leave it on blank
01:16:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Another thing I have noticed is that people pm me and then leave the chat before I have even joined. Remember that as a developer I have other things I must do such as fixing bugs. Please be patient after you start a pm with me. I will eventually get to you

11:34:48 <danielkl[m]> Hi. I would like to switch from Android 11(Pixel 3) to GraphenenOS. But my Banking APP(Fidor Bank) will not be available in my opinion. And without that APP I will no  longer have access to my banking account. Is there any possiblity to install that APP on GrapheneOS?THX for your help.
11:37:12 <Johnny21A> the biggest problem with banking apps, is that they probably depend on google play services(and safetynet) which are not available in grapheneOs AFAIK
11:38:45 <certainindividua> I switched banks since choosing graphene and let the bank know its because of GS
11:39:16 <Johnny21A> Is it me, or is https://grapheneos.org/ down?
11:39:17 <certainindividua> New bank has greener investments anyway
11:39:44 <certainindividua> <Johnny21A "Is it me, or is https://graphene"> Still up for me
11:40:29 <Johnny21A> yeah nevermind it is me, firefox update in the background and does not load a new page untill restart. I should learn to read
12:19:47 <nscnt> thedon1[m]: The warning message and the Google logo is expected and it can't be changed/removed at all. Please lock the bootloader to ensure security of your device.

12:48:46 <mastercakex[m]> How can I dig deeper into what caused it ?
12:52:29 <clox[m]> Hi guys,  what is the best for secure lock your screen? PIN, PASSWORD or PATTERN? Wich one is more difficult to crack your device?
12:52:54 <mastercakex[m]> Password of course
12:53:05 <mastercakex[m]> Alphanumeric
12:55:25 <nscnt> clox[m]: Strong password (>= 8 digits) with e.g. fingerprint for convenience. You can enable "Lockdown" if you want to disable fingerprint in a situation (or restart your device)
12:57:16 <nscnt> Haven't you ever watched over your buddies shoulder and "accidentally" saw his pin/pattern? That's one advantage why to use fingerprint in public
12:58:13 <clox[m]> <nscnt "clox: Strong password (>= 8 digi"> Thanks, nscnt.
12:58:46 <clox[m]> I normally use pin but you are right that password is the best
13:01:08 <mastercakex[m]> Each day I discover grapheneOS becoming more difficult as for a daily driver and pixels absence of wifi6 is such a bummer. It just feels ages behind apple since apple launched SE. So sad to admit apples victory
13:02:34 <renlord> mastercakex[m]: your isp supports wifi6 speeds already?
13:06:11 <mastercakex[m]> renlord it does 1Gbs but speed is not a single factor WiFi 6 is needed for
13:06:37 <renlord> besides wpa3 and better bandwidth, anything else?
13:07:48 <renlord> actually quite a bit
13:07:50 <mastercakex[m]> If you reside in a 50story building it becomes almost mandatory to have AX router
13:08:05 <renlord> i suppose next-gen pixels should have wifi6
13:08:25 <renlord> i reside in a 60+ storey building and im on ac
13:08:31 <renlord> no issue
13:09:11 <mastercakex[m]> Google is supposedly giving up on pixels. They are far even from midrange iphones let alone flagships
13:09:40 <mastercakex[m]> What's your isp bandwidth?
13:10:20 <mastercakex[m]> I'm on 500mbit contract and I really feel the need of a better router and wifi6 receiver
13:22:54 <renlord> 100mbps
13:23:18 <renlord> i cant even max out bandwidth on a cat5 cable
13:23:20 <renlord> lol
13:26:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> mastercakex: they aren't
13:27:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google isn't discontinuing pixels

18:49:17 <tom_co[m]> Guys, I flashed grapheneOS on my Pixel 3 XL and my location services doesn't work. When I open any maps it says looking for position and never finds it. I downloaded GPS status app and there are some tests for sensors and it looks like everything is okay. Is there anything I can do to know if it is hardware of software fault?
18:51:20 <louipc> how does it not work?
18:53:27 <louipc> tom_co[m]: you gave app permission?
18:54:08 <tom_co[m]> It just says looking for a location, getting position. Yes I did gave permissions to the apps and also tried a few different ones.
19:06:57 <TheJollyRoger> tom_co[m]: have you given it enough time (and enough reception) for it to calibrate?
19:10:11 <tom_co[m]> TheJollyRoger:  Yes, it was a few hours that I had my maps opened and also this GPS app and it didn't find my location.
19:10:31 <TheJollyRoger> Outdoors, with an unobstructed view to the sky?
19:10:51 <TheJollyRoger> (Preferably in an area without a lot of tall buildings)
19:11:13 <tom_co[m]> TheJollyRoger: Yes outside, I had my other phone with me and it had no problem to get a location in a few seconds. Not sure what might be an issue.
19:11:29 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, not sure either.
19:11:38 <tom_co[m]> <TheJollyRoger "(Preferably in an area without a"> I live near the bit city
19:12:12 <tom_co[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hmm, not sure either."> I'm just not sure if it is hardware issue or it might be just a software bug
19:12:20 <TheJollyRoger> Very strange. I know that I had some difficulty getting the GPS to work but after a while oddly enough the problem seemed to sort itself out.
19:13:32 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to it being a bug, not sure - each installation of GrapheneOS is identical down to the very last bit (thanks to Android Verified Boot), so if it can't be reproduced on this end that may rule out a software bug.
19:13:56 <TheJollyRoger> What solved it for me was visiting a park and walking around in the area for a bit.
19:14:20 <louipc> tom_co[m]: other phone is same with grapheneos or?
19:14:32 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. I dunno.
19:14:46 <TheJollyRoger> Stick around, someone else may pipe up though, don't lose hope!
19:15:40 <tom_co[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Stick around, someone else may p"> It's not a big deal, it's not my main phone. I just wanted to know what might be an issue or if somebody else encountered it as well.
19:15:56 <tom_co[m]> <louipc "tom_co: other phone is same with"> No, the other phone was iPhone
19:16:07 <TheJollyRoger> Hey right on, right on.
19:16:25 <louipc> ok lol cant compare them
19:16:50 <tom_co[m]> <louipc "ok lol cant compare them"> Yeah I know but still it's a GPS signal no?
19:17:02 <louipc> not necessarily
19:18:08 <tom_co[m]> <louipc "not necessarily"> Should I try to do a clean install again?
19:18:17 <louipc> but you said a gps app on graphene works right, so.. it would appear the map app has a problem
19:18:29 <louipc> what apps did you try
19:18:57 <TheJollyRoger> tom_co[m]: I don't think it's time to try the nuclear option just yet; rebooting your phone will revert any changes to your system image to factory-fresh condition without zapping your userdata, assuming your bootloader is locked.
19:20:07 <TheJollyRoger> oh, that's a good point louipc; some apps may be dependent on Google Software Framework, which GrapheneOS deliberately omits as part of its design goals. I should ask about this.
19:20:28 <TheJollyRoger> Well, anyone on the IRC side, here comes the tide.
19:20:58 <tom_co[m]> GPS sensor is okay but it doesn't work. I tried Sygic, OSM maps and this GPS app

19:21:31 <malicoye[m]> Try Waze
19:22:04 <louipc> tom_co[m]: oh but you can't get coordinates
19:23:28 <tom_co[m]> <louipc "tom_co: oh but you can't get coo"> Yes, it never finds my position
19:25:37 <tom_co[m]> I tried Waze and it says No Network & GPS, so there might be some issue with network but my internet connection works fine on the phone
19:26:20 <TheJollyRoger> Wonder if it's dependent on Google Location Services.
19:26:23 <louipc> oh that sounds really weird
19:28:22 <tom_co[m]> Yeah it is weird, i don't know what to do 😀
19:30:19 * TheJollyRoger is puzzled!
19:43:00 <dazinism> tom_co: try GPSTest (An app for testing GPS and GNSS capabilities of a device) - https://f-droid.org/app/com.android.gpstest.osmdroid
19:44:01 <dazinism> Think getting first lock can take some time. Also think your phone needs to download some stuff. Has it got an internet connection?
19:45:02 <dazinism> Also if I'm not confused it needs a while to download data files from satellites first time to get things set up
19:46:01 <dazinism> So need to be able to receive well from satellite, although it sounds like you had probably had that
19:54:48 <tom_co[m]> <dazinism "tom_co: try GPSTest (An app for "> I will try that
20:36:18 <pallaf> hello
20:36:50 <pallaf> im in the process of unlocking the bootloader
20:37:20 <pallaf> im able to run fastboot command via terminal but it gets stuck at "waiting for any device"
20:37:45 <pallaf> I've already enabled oem unlocking under developer options and rebooted into bootloader menu
20:38:04 <pallaf> Did I miss something here
20:41:52 <M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4> if you are running ubuntu
20:41:57 <M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4> try using fasboot with sudo
20:41:59 <M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4> worked for me
20:42:30 <mx[m]> <pallaf "hello"> also check adb devices

20:42:42 <mx[m]>  * also check adb devices
20:43:02 <M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4> does anyone know if the camera on the pixel 4a is as good as on stock?
20:43:32 <M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4> because with the 3a the camera was worse on graphene because some optimizations were done in the google camera app
20:44:17 <pallaf> thx sudo fixed it
20:44:46 <louipc> from what I heard its better because it's done in hardware now, but there's still a lack of great non-google camera apps
20:44:46 <M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4> <pallaf "thx sudo fixed it"> youre welcome, I also have to use sudo for adb btw
20:44:51 <mx[m]> <M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4 "because with the 3a the camera w"> I use 3a with opencamera
20:45:00 <M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4> is it any good
20:45:08 <M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4> <louipc "from what I heard its better bec"> ah ok thank you

21:07:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do you need help with something?
21:19:46 <zfnmxt> M2v3zfgd88zdhqf4: The GCam app on the 4a is definitely better.
21:20:22 <zfnmxt> But you can use Gcam (for now) on the 4a. 7.4.x and https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider works fine for me on graphene.
21:29:52 <pallaf> i can't copy my files over to my pixel? Is there a special filesystem installed?
21:56:58 <strcat[m]> pallaf: not clear what you mean
21:57:29 <strcat[m]> if you're talking about transferring files to a profile's home directory via USB, you need to enable file transfer from the notification
21:57:34 <strcat[m]> and then transfer files with MTP
21:57:58 <strcat[m]> there is nothing different about this with GrapheneOS
22:02:21 <r0tt0r[m]> <zfnmxt "But you can use Gcam (for now) o"> it has been brought up earlier and if you are security concerned installung debug app is not a good way to follow

22:05:56 <pallaf> did same as before when vanilla android was installed
22:06:04 <strcat[m]> use a GUI for it if you don't know how to use the CLI MTP tools
22:06:14 <strcat[m]> it works fine
22:06:14 <pallaf> well it did work before
22:06:18 <strcat[m]> as do apps like nextcloud
22:06:19 <pallaf> with cli
22:06:29 <strcat[m]> that error shows you're making a mistake

22:07:27 <strcat[m]> show the command you're running then
22:07:47 <strcat[m]> but this is not a libmtp help channel
22:08:28 <pallaf> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Media_Transfer_Protocol
22:08:31 <pallaf> simple-mtpfs
22:09:07 <strcat[m]> you need to say what command you're using and the error you get from it
22:09:13 <strcat[m]> and whether you've enabled file transfer on the device
22:09:31 <strcat[m]> the way you're trying to seek help here is not productive and is going to be treated as trolling soon
22:12:32 <pallaf> cp -r ~/Music/NewPipe ~/mnt/Music/
22:12:38 <pallaf> tried it with even sudo
22:12:45 <pallaf> sudo give me permission denied
22:12:54 <pallaf> i feel like im being trolled by terminal
22:13:04 <pallaf> tried even with su
22:13:14 <pallaf> pointed to /home directory
22:13:16 <pallaf> etc
22:15:18 <strcat[m]> so there's no issue with MTP
22:15:38 <strcat[m]> can you just use an MTP GUI?
22:15:47 * spiceghost[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/RrjyEntOYXiempElBvUIApyV/message.txt >
22:16:04 <strcat[m]> this isn't a good place to learn how to use the CLI or libmtp CLI tools
22:16:25 <strcat[m]> if there isn't a problem with MTP and GrapheneOS (and there doesn't appear to be), it's not in the scope of the channel
22:17:10 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: it does turn off Wi-Fi and the other radios, but they can be turned back on, while cellular can't be
22:24:31 <spiceghost[m]> I used TheHatedOnes tut for graphene on Linux. I couldn't verify my sig file is it ok kto verify with auditor app. I kept getting error: no file directory
22:31:36 <spiceghost[m]> <strcat[m] "spiceghost: it does turn off Wi-"> Thanks, had no idea it actually turned it off. I use it to make sure the cellular radio is off.
22:32:04 <TheJollyRoger> Hi spiceghost[m], the auditor app will verify your installation /post install/. You'll need to have completed the install (note that locking the bootloader afterward is what completes the installation).
22:33:13 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: our official installation guide is at https://grapheneos.org/install, unofficial installation guides aren't supported and usually have errors or omissions
22:33:20 <strcat[m]> we can't provide support for unofficial installation guides here
22:36:54 <spiceghost[m]> <strcat[m] "spiceghost: our official install"> Yes, I read that. I am a visual learner so I had to look up a video. However, I did use the install instruction from the site as well. Since I'm on ubuntu I used signify-openbsd but I didn't get a verified message. My message said the file was not in the directory, but it was there. I continued the installation anyway and had a successful verification with the Auditor
22:36:54 <spiceghost[m]> app but the signify part just didn't work and I don't know why.
22:37:49 <TheJollyRoger> The payload, the signature file, and the public key?
22:38:11 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: you have to adjust the file names to the correct ones
22:41:12 <spiceghost[m]> <strcat[m] "spiceghost: you have to adjust t"> The site actually had the file name for the 4a there in the example. It was a easy copy paste. I even tried it by copying the file name from the .sig file in my directory and it still didn't work. I did not burn my computer though lol
22:42:14 <strcat[m]> you have to make sure to download both files
22:42:19 <strcat[m]> and then run the signify command with the proper file names
22:42:32 <strcat[m]> it has you download factory.pub, the factory images zip and the signature
22:42:41 <strcat[m]> if you run the commands as they are written there, it works
22:42:42 <strcat[m]> so you omitted one
22:42:49 <strcat[m]> or you opened up a new terminal in a new directory, etc.
22:48:59 <spiceghost[m]> <strcat[m] "if you run the commands as they "> Maybe it's because I only opened the terminal to verify. I didn't download in the terminal. I wish I had recorded myself. I should be ok trusting the auditor app, correct?
22:49:18 <strcat[m]> if you follow the install instructions, it works
22:49:23 <strcat[m]> you did it your own way and didn't do it correctly per the instructions
22:49:35 <strcat[m]> you ran the signify command without the files being present, that's why it didn't work
22:50:04 <strcat[m]> we can't provide support for unofficial installation methods
22:50:43 <TheJollyRoger> spiceghost[m]: the Auditor app will verify the entire system image, bitwise, to the genuine verified boot keys.
22:51:01 <spiceghost[m]> <strcat[m] "you did it your own way and didn"> Hey man I know you don't believe me but the files were there. I looked at them as I did it.  I guess I will have to recreate this and make a video. I am telling the truth. Im not saying I did nothing wrong but I had the files!
22:51:02 <TheJollyRoger> You'll be fine.
22:51:41 <TheJollyRoger> spiceghost, can you paste me the output of `ls -lah .` in the terminal, please?
22:52:10 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: the files were not there, you're wrong
22:52:29 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: as you said yourself, you didn't follow the official installation instructions
22:52:52 <strcat[m]> you tried to run signify in a directory where those 3 files (public key, factory images zip, factory images zip signature) were not present
22:53:03 <strcat[m]> so it didn't work, because the files weren't present
22:53:14 <strcat[m]> it can't read your mind and get the files from a different place than where you instructed it to look
22:53:36 <spiceghost[m]> <strcat[m] "spiceghost: as you said yourself"> No I said I followed the instructions and used a visual guide as I am a visual learner. They aren't complicated and I'm sure you get irritated with that. Don't worry I'll recreate it.
22:53:54 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: you're wrong, I don't need to confirm that
22:54:37 <spiceghost[m]> <strcat[m] "spiceghost: you're wrong, I don'"> Just drop it and wait
22:54:42 <TheJollyRoger> spiceghost[m]: the use of signify is one part of multiple levels of verification. If you can't or don't use it, there are others, including auditor. If auditor passes, you'll be fine.
22:54:50 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: no
22:54:59 <TheJollyRoger> spiceghost[m]: he's the lead developer, mate, he knows what he's talking about.
22:55:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe we should make an official flash video
22:55:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Obviously one that's broken down into parts
22:55:58 <spiceghost[m]> <TheJollyRoger "spiceghost: he's the lead develo"> He could be Jesus reincarnated no reason to talk to someone like that. Respect aint hard I wasn't being disrespectful
22:56:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> spiceghost: that is OT
22:56:34 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: you're wrong and the error message you got was correct
22:57:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> spiceghost: read our install guide please
22:57:10 <briaruser[m]> There is no way to fix the notfication issue for apps who use google service for the notfications right? I alrdy tested microg but didnt work
22:57:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> You are already downloading the release from our website
22:57:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> And the chances that someone will break into our servers to replace a build is pretty slim
22:57:46 <strcat[m]> briaruser: GrapheneOS doesn't have Play services, and Play services has to be built into the OS
22:58:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> As long as you have downloaded it from our site with https
22:58:17 <strcat[m]> briaruser: some apps have settings to enable their own push service instead of doing it automatically, etc.
22:58:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> You really shouldn't have much of an issue
22:58:28 <strcat[m]> briaruser: varies per app, please get support from the app developers, contact them about it
22:59:08 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: https://gist.github.com/thestinger/3799b6b95e76e2a44ed505c375d9d527 the instructions expect you to download those 3 files to the same directory and then run signify in that directory with the correct paths
22:59:16 <strcat[m]> spiceghost: you didn't do that, so you got an error
22:59:26 <strcat[m]> I am not telling you that you didn't download the files
22:59:41 <strcat[m]> I'm telling you that you didn't have them in the same directory together where you ran the signify command
23:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> spiceghost[m]: please paste the output of `ls -lah .` - this will tell you.
23:01:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: perfect timing
23:13:46 <briaruser[m]> <strcat[m] "briaruser: varies per app, pleas"> Tnx for the reply. Yess i will do that.
