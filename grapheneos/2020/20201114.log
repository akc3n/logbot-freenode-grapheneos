03:33:41 <inpharmaticist[m> Anyone get Among Us to work from Aurora store?
04:01:50 <Linus[m]1> Doesnt work due to a Unity bug iirc
04:02:31 <Linus[m]1> anupritaisno1: I think you're the one who said that?
04:08:38 <louipcm> that sounds familiar
10:52:44 * SweetAmy19 19/f looking for older. This is me naked: https://imagetwist.com/c60gumtcigj7/nude5.jpg Do you like my pussy?
11:15:01 <madaidan[m]> Not really
12:41:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <SweetAmy19 "19/f looking for older. This is "> Sorry I'm attracted to madaidan.
12:42:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Linus: yes
12:42:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> I am looking into it
13:06:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys as said yesterday
13:07:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you can help grapheneos please pm me
13:07:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are many people, including from copperhead trying to spread misinformation about grapheneos
13:07:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have a group where we try to correct this misinformation
13:08:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pm me if you want to join
13:32:59 <r0tt0r[m]> anyone on p4a/beta channel has issues with fingerprint?
13:33:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> r0tt0r: pm mrxx_0
14:55:29 <dazinism> A: Theres an app called greentooth that turns off Bluetooth, I've not tried it.
15:07:27 <dazinism> Also can possibly do things with tasker or easer. Have to give these apps a certain control over your phone.
15:18:13 <hubortje[m]> <dazinism "A: Theres an app called greentoo"> I use it daylie, and I love it.
15:26:58 <crabman[m]> Is there a way to have Firefox as a choice for “Open With” on P4a.  I had that option on P3a.  Or, how can I browse and open files with Firefox?
15:35:29 <dazinism> crabman: I'd expect that Firefox will specify which file types it would support opening. Guess if theres a difference to what you had previously its due to the recent major change to Firefox & that they've dropped support for doing what you want yo do.
15:35:39 <dazinism> What file format?
15:37:33 <crabman[m]> dazinism: Actually, none of my browsers are listed, except Vandium.  This is a change from my last install.  I primary want to open html and xpi files.
15:38:56 <dazinism> crabman: maybe you set vanadium as the default browser. If you go into settings > apps >vanadium could clear defaults
15:39:37 <crabman[m]> dazinism: No, FFnightly is the current default.
15:42:33 <crabman[m]> dazinism: Clearing default makes no difference what is presented when hitting "Open With"
15:45:19 <A[m]7> <hubortje[m] "I use it daylie, and I love it."> I can't find it anywhere. Is that the right name?
15:45:56 <dazinism> Its in the fdroid repo
15:46:50 <dazinism> crabman: whats listed when you do that?
15:48:04 <crabman[m]> dazinism: MiXplorer, Vanadium, and HTML Viewer when using the Files app.
15:48:43 <dazinism> Then I expect the issue is the version of ff you are running doesnt support that
15:48:46 <crabman[m]> dazinism: I get a more extensive list when using MixPlorer, but none are my added browsers.
15:49:46 <dazinism> Vanadium is a safer way to view HTML files
15:50:04 <crabman[m]> dazinism: Like I said earlier, with my P3a all my browsers were listed.
15:50:51 <crabman[m]> <dazinism "Vanadium is a safer way to view "> Vanadium does not support Cookie AutoDelete
15:51:16 <hubortje[m]> <A[m]7 "I can't find it anywhere. Is tha"> already mentioned, but here as a direct answer: You can find Greentooth in the f-Droid repository
15:51:21 <dazinism> Incognito browsing
15:52:25 <crabman[m]> dazinism: Thanks for trying.  I will report back if I can find a solution.
16:11:32 <dazinism> crabman: having a bit more of a look, it looks like can still do it with older versions of Firefox. From what I can tell of what you want if I was in your position I'd open these files in bromite with the always open incognito setting enabled.
18:06:32 <A[m]7> Is there any applicable or even theoretical way to set up a limited privilege account that's running some minimal version of google services to allow apps like mysudo to run?
18:22:16 <zurki[m]> Theoretical yeah.
18:22:16 <zurki[m]> But I think last it was talked about (with me around) it came down to a questionable action of some kind.
18:22:16 <zurki[m]> Forget if legal or ethics wise.
18:22:55 <zurki[m]> Easiest way is to really just ask the Devs to setup their own notification server like signal does, I think.
18:58:58 * A[m]7 sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YuPaZBfzpRvWFQGpcEGujoNz/message.txt >
18:59:13 <A[m]7> <zurki[m] "Easiest way is to really just as"> What do you mean?
19:00:09 <louipc> for each app to have their own notification services
19:00:20 <zurki[m]> <A[m]7 "What do you mean?"> Signal has their own notification servers, so they don't need gapps.
19:00:42 <louipc> Please join #grapheneos-offtopic for discussion about other apps and services
20:06:37 <r0tt0r[m]>  anupritaisno1: btw have you checked the bootanination from the fork of grapheneos/branding? any advice if i proceed correctly before i send a pull request?
20:10:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> r0tt0r: ask strcat
20:20:14 <r0tt0r[m]>  strcat: hey i added a fork of.branding repo and prepare bootanimation.zip as outlined in the provides requirements. i could not check if that bootanimation generally works though it should. i understand size is a bit big and i can lower. sadly if i could use mp4 files the whole bootanimation would be like 200kb vs as png currently 20mb i think which is already png compressed
20:20:39 <r0tt0r[m]> also any change , wish, color adjust or whatsoever critics is welcome
20:20:52 <strcat[m]> I can't review that
20:21:02 <strcat[m]> I need someone to verify it works, is the proper format, etc.
20:21:03 <strcat[m]> and I have to like the end result
20:21:15 <strcat[m]> afaik the format has an intro, loop and then conclusion
20:22:00 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "and I have to like the end resul"> yes indeed i absolutely agree. currently intro animation and loading done finisher
20:22:18 <r0tt0r[m]> i could test on a moto g6 if the anination runs
20:22:26 <r0tt0r[m]> * i could test on a moto g6 if the animation runs
20:22:36 <r0tt0r[m]> bit dunno if thats possible
20:22:59 <r0tt0r[m]> also i dont know if ypu could push the animation onto beta channel?
20:23:06 <r0tt0r[m]> * also i dont know if you could push the animation onto beta channel?
20:23:29 <r0tt0r[m]> * but dunno if thats possible
20:24:15 <r0tt0r[m]> mainly i need to know if the animation as generated is working
20:25:09 <louipcm> maybe you could run it in emulator too
20:25:45 <r0tt0r[m]> huh well of graphene runs on that and its a valid test method
20:25:54 <r0tt0r[m]> * huh well if graphene runs on that and its a valid test method
21:10:40 <r0tt0r[m]> <louipcm "maybe you could run it in emulat"> ok the animation works
21:11:36 <louipcm> nice
21:14:06 <louipcm> you cant submit as a zip though. should be unpacked at least
21:14:45 <louipcm> i dont know the exact format needed
21:15:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> louipcm: what
21:15:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> It has to be a .zip
21:15:54 <louipcm> as a source?
21:15:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is no make file for it
21:16:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lineage runs a bash script to create a zip
21:16:18 <louipcm> right
21:16:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway we don't want to do that
21:16:37 <louipcm> or you could just add makefile
21:16:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Where?
21:17:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> louipcm: you're really making a big deal of something that isn't complicated
21:17:49 <louipcm> ok depends on what format strcat is looking for
21:18:16 <r0tt0r[m]> i followed the guides provided with png compress and zipping with zip command from the google guide
21:18:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Thing is it is kind of complicated
21:18:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google just says put the animation in product
21:18:50 <louipcm> i thought u said it wasn't complicated :p
21:18:53 <r0tt0r[m]> ye that was the funny part to put it into apex
21:19:40 <louipcm> u th boss then anupritaisno1 . I won't be handling the submission anyway
21:20:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> louipcm well at best we need different animations
21:20:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> For different resolutions
21:20:38 <louipcm> and that would be a per-device thing no?
21:20:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> We can't really play a 4k animation on a 1080p screen
21:20:43 <r0tt0r[m]> i fiddled with that before on custom rom and that went into mayhem as the default android bootanination showed no matter what i put into /product/media
21:20:47 <louipcm> right
21:21:11 <r0tt0r[m]> currently i rendered.at 1080x1920
21:21:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "i fiddled with that before on cu"> Aware
21:21:18 <louipcm> and that might be a great thing to build the zip with a makefile then wouldnt it :p
21:21:26 <r0tt0r[m]> * currently i rendered at 1080x1920
21:22:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "currently i rendered.at 1080x192"> Well just don't worry about making it demanding
21:22:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> And try to render at half res if you can and see if you notice a quality difference
21:22:44 <r0tt0r[m]> i also think 17mb for 200 png files is a bit too much
21:23:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> It isn't
21:23:02 <r0tt0r[m]> cant we use mp4 vids?
21:23:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> r0tt0r: here's some advice
21:23:19 <r0tt0r[m]> somewhen i knew mp4 can also woek
21:23:28 <r0tt0r[m]> * somewhen i knew mp4 can also work
21:23:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Loading screens aren't something you show to say a program is loading
21:23:49 <r0tt0r[m]> that would be 200kb at same quality
21:24:27 <r0tt0r[m]> well the android bootanimation has different stages
21:24:42 <louipcm> so would you have 3 mp4s
21:24:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Loading screens are supposed to build up excitement
21:24:50 <louipcm> start middle and end?
21:25:01 <r0tt0r[m]> yes i agree
21:25:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos already is fast enough at booting
21:25:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember that other ROMs need to do runtime optimization at boot
21:25:41 <r0tt0r[m]> ye thats the problem (sarcasm)
21:25:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> And graphene can skip that, we optimize everything already
21:26:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> So as long as you don't bring the loading time to something worse than the other ROMs
21:26:31 <r0tt0r[m]> theres not much to build up in general in 3 secs
21:26:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> And strcat likes it
21:26:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> It should work
21:27:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway it's best to create the animation in the phone's resolution
21:27:14 <r0tt0r[m]> i can lower resolution while keeping quality and reduce framerate
21:27:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> And once you are done, try to run the animation at half res
21:27:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
21:27:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't reduce the framerate
21:27:39 <r0tt0r[m]> currently its 30fps
21:27:49 <louipcm> yea dont reduce from 30
21:27:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you absolutely must, do not go below 75fps
21:28:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lol
21:28:15 <louipcm> lol why
21:28:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> louipcm: read what I said above
21:28:45 <louipcm> i would say 60 max
21:28:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> The loading screen must look smooth
21:29:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Users do notice
21:29:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> The difference between 75 and 90 is hard to tell as well
21:29:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Users might hate a choppy 30fps animation
21:29:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless r0tt0r you are a very good animator
21:29:49 <louipcm> lol the anim will be 90MB or something
21:30:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've seen animators who can do like 12fps
21:30:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> And make it feel like 60
21:30:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> But that's quite a lot of work
21:31:11 <louipcm> anupritaisno1:  whom
21:31:58 <r0tt0r[m]> let me test some stuff, i halfed resolution while doubling fps, as also i wanted to test if pngcrush might reduce filesizes in comparison to the other application
21:32:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway r0tt0r try to make it something that can attract users
21:32:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> So here's an example
21:32:24 <r0tt0r[m]> yes feed me some ideas
21:32:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let's say I am going to destroy a really old building full of old things
21:32:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I am also going to destroy a museum
21:32:56 <atasuke[m]> Hey guys, what kind of ide do you use ?
21:33:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> You have the option to stop me from destroying one of these
21:33:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Where would you stop me?
21:33:42 <r0tt0r[m]> depends as a museum is a building full of old things also
21:34:06 <louipcm> i would stop you before you started any destruction
21:34:19 <louipcm> unless you owned both buildings then you may proceed
21:34:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> You do see where I am trying to get btw
21:34:47 <dar_gomml[m]> Yeah don't save on FPS and/or resolution for the boot animation.
21:34:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> You see users are more likely to bitch about an ugly boot animation than say, 1 second longer boot
21:35:07 <r0tt0r[m]> i can make a crush copperhead and rebirth :) just jking
21:35:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> You might think these artificial waits are bad
21:36:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it has been proven repeatedly that they really aren't
21:36:14 <louipcm> make a big bang that creates the universe, then stars, then carbon, then graphene particles
21:36:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Haha yes
21:36:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway try not to flash images
21:36:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't want to trigger epilepsy patients
21:36:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> So keep flashing images minimum
21:37:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> On the other hand avoid a static image too
21:37:26 <r0tt0r[m]> ye it has to be decent i understand
21:37:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can cause burn-in with a static image and that will reflect in user experience
21:38:08 <r0tt0r[m]> <louipcm "make a big bang that creates the"> that doesnt sound too bad having a rotating particle cloud morphing into graphene
21:38:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> If users have burn in due to the boot animation they will be pissed
21:38:24 <r0tt0r[m]> but its only 3-5 secs till os is booting
21:38:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
21:38:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> What if the OS doesn't boot due to the user messing up?
21:39:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Users can mess up while installing, do unsupported bs and so on
21:39:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> And in the beta channel there was one build that got stuck at the bootanimation forever on the 3a
21:39:57 <r0tt0r[m]> ye indeed
21:40:05 <louipcm> yea but the big bang was only 10E−32 seconds
21:40:13 <louipcm> so you got lots of time in 3 seconds
21:40:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> louipcm: stop trolling
21:41:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> It isn't helping and is taking the conversation elsewhere
21:42:41 <louipcm> so what if the boot gets stuck
21:43:12 <louipcm> i mean whats the recourse/mitigation/etc
21:43:25 <louipcm> regarding boot animation
21:43:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipcm "i mean whats the recourse/mitiga"> Don't have a static image?
21:44:13 <louipcm> sure that helps
21:47:15 <r0tt0r[m]> also the different stages might give a first indicator at which part of os boot its failing, though logcat inevitable
21:50:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> r0tt0r: not a priority and pretty much useless
21:52:40 <r0tt0r[m]> ye i remember there was someone who made a logcat bootanimation
21:52:57 <r0tt0r[m]> that would be usefull but only nice for nerds
21:53:25 <r0tt0r[m]> users like elegant smooth animation representing the idea behind a rom
21:53:34 <r0tt0r[m]> or logo
21:55:58 <jenna546541[m]> I think that was the guy who made supersu
22:37:12 <r0tt0r[m]> ok reducing resolution by 50% and set fps 60 brought filesize down by 10mb while quality stays same. pngcrush or zopflinpng makes no difference, ok gonna make some new animation and see how it goes. will provide screenshots when ready
22:40:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> r0tt0r: make it 9000 fps /s
22:41:03 <xabi[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "You can cause burn-in with a sta"> Will a brief boot animation cause burn in?
22:41:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> xabi: depends
22:43:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "ok reducing resolution by 50% an"> Go to 75 fps if you can
22:45:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nvm pixel 3 can't go above 60
22:45:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> We'll 75 fps next year then lol
22:48:49 <louipc> i dont think people boot their phone that often for burn-in to be a huge concern do they?
22:52:14 <r0tt0r[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "r0tt0r: make it 9000 fps /s"> that is problematic for render as it will extend playlength and images generated as also make speed of animation quite unreasonable
22:52:41 <r0tt0r[m]> despite device limitation
22:52:43 <louipcm> hes trooling
22:52:52 <r0tt0r[m]> oh
22:52:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yas
22:53:04 <r0tt0r[m]> that i didnt get
22:53:45 <louipcm> if you made one 120fps you could downsample per device capability i guess?
22:54:18 <louipcm> also hi-res, downsampled per device
22:54:43 <r0tt0r[m]> 😄
22:54:57 <louipcm> or even pure vector, with proper res generated per device
22:55:58 <louipcm> this kinda flexibility is kinda what i was suggesting regarding makefile, submitting unpacked, etc
22:56:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> louipcm: again, no
22:57:06 <louipcm> you
22:58:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> louipcm: you realize it'll either be me or Daniel who'll end up maintaining the makefile?
22:58:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'll add unnecessary issues that need to be dealt with when we want to upgrade to a newer android version
22:59:12 <louipcm> uhh why?
22:59:36 <louipcm> it doesnt even need to be part of the main build system
22:59:45 <louipcm> could just be a complete seperate build, that would still be a benefit
22:59:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> louipcm: what might look fine right now won't be fine next year
23:00:07 <louipcm> would -> could
23:00:11 <louipcm> depends on animator's workflow
23:00:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> There may even be new restrictions on what binaries can be called
23:00:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> We can't remove these restrictions
23:00:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipcm "depends on animator's workflow"> No
23:00:51 <louipcm> like i said, doesnt need to be part of main build
23:01:09 <louipcm> no what
23:01:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then it is useless
23:02:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> A 720p60 bootanimation.zip is what we should target
23:02:57 <louipcm> its less useful than having animation source files integrated, sure. but if you're worried about build system restrictions changing then seperate it
23:03:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Again, no
23:03:13 <louipcm> anupritaisno1:  i thought you said it should be min 75
23:03:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah I turned back on it
23:03:42 <louipcm> so no 4k and no 90fps ever
23:03:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
23:03:54 <louipcm> or would you rather maintain seperate zips for each device
23:04:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> We go for 8k300 when the time comes
23:04:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> * We go for 8k300 when the time comes /s
23:06:12 <louipcm> anyway like it really does depend on animators workflow
23:06:28 <louipcm> he could do his own build system to generate zip to submit if he wants
23:06:30 <louipcm> what u gonna do
23:06:51 <louipcm> tell him no lol
23:07:10 <r0tt0r[m]> per device setting is only desc file adjustement. should not be too many
23:07:25 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you're giving the opposite advice of what I want
23:07:29 <strcat[m]> don't assume to know what I want
23:08:04 <strcat[m]> graphical assets are ideally vector assets with a script (nothing to do with the OS build system) to generate the raster graphics
23:08:10 <strcat[m]> that is what the project already does right now
23:08:23 <strcat[m]> having a hard-wired raster version is not ideal
23:09:18 <r0tt0r[m]> my animation is 95% official svg
23:09:29 <louipcm> cool
23:10:03 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/branding_tools
23:10:06 <strcat[m]> as an example
23:10:11 <strcat[m]> same approach should be used for wallpapers etc
23:11:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: so you want per device?
23:14:22 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "https://github.com/GrapheneOS/br"> i created a branch on branding repo bootanimation and would do the same for wallpapers. i got someones help as im not really known how its done right
23:28:15 <rayromano[m]> Hello everyone, I recently bootloaded Graphene OS and everything is working great on my Pixel 3a XL I am very proud of myself for doing so, huge shout out to The Hated One and Daniel Mckay; however there are a few apps that are of critical importance to my business that won't work when I downloaded them from the Aurora Store and one of them is "Burner" where I have two of my alternate business phone numbers on their
23:28:15 <rayromano[m]> servers. So far I can download the app and input my phone number but I get stuck where they text you a 6 digit code. When I input the 6 digit code there is an error and technical support can't seem to help me. My suspicion is that the Aurora Store version of the Burner app is the culprit? Is there any way to download the google play store on Graphene OS and download a functional version of the app?
23:28:24 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: I want to have a repo with scripts for generating them
23:28:48 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: then put the zip variants that we are actually using in branding (perhaps only 1 variant atm)
23:29:02 <strcat[m]> and then include it properly, perhaps per-device
23:29:19 <strcat[m]> come up with a good way of doing it so that there's a default one and then devices can override it
23:29:23 <strcat[m]> and I don't want it to be complex
23:32:15 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "and then include it properly, pe"> ok i see, well from my pov its quiet simple. have string replace first line of desc.txt with device specific values, the problem is that animations get speed up on higher fps which might look awkward depening on animation used
23:33:34 <louipc> rayromano[m]: aurora store version is the same as google play version. Please join #grapheneos-offtopic for further discussion of non grapheneos apps and services
23:35:02 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: that's not what I'm requesting
23:35:11 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: I'm not going to be able to include this if it's not done per the requirements
23:35:29 <strcat[m]> right now I'm not optimistic that this goes anywhere
23:35:37 <strcat[m]> maybe focus on wallpapers first
23:35:42 <strcat[m]> that's simpler
23:35:58 <strcat[m]> make a script that generates wallpapers from the svg logo using graphicsmagick
23:36:09 <strcat[m]> submit it to the branding_tools repository
23:36:21 <strcat[m]> set up proper inclusion of those via the branding repository for devices
23:36:30 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "r0tt0r: I want to have a repo wi"> ok sorry maybe i misunderstood. you mean by generating them the bootaninations itself?
23:36:37 <strcat[m]> start with wallpapers
23:36:52 <r0tt0r[m]> * ok sorry maybe i misunderstood. you mean by generating them the bootanimations itself?
23:36:52 <strcat[m]> boot animation thing is tabled for now
23:37:25 <strcat[m]> I'm not able to accept something that's not done per the requirements that have been specified
23:37:40 <strcat[m]> I recommend working on wallpapers because it's a lot simpler and is a good starting point
23:38:06 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "I recommend working on wallpaper"> ok np
23:38:17 <strcat[m]> different devices should probably have different sizes of wallpapers
23:38:25 <strcat[m]> unsure on what the best way is to approach it per device
23:38:37 <strcat[m]> so, that's something to figure out and script
23:38:47 <strcat[m]> and you can learn how this stuff gets included
23:38:56 <strcat[m]> branding_tools is where the script goes for generating the wallpapers
23:39:02 <strcat[m]> branding is where the resulting generated images go
23:39:14 <strcat[m]> and inclusion in the build system has to be set up
23:39:19 <strcat[m]> so that it can be done per-device in a simple way
23:39:21 <r0tt0r[m]> ahh well now i get it
23:39:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: btw in 2017-ish you used to do per device bootanimation, you don't want that approach?
23:39:53 <strcat[m]> boot animation will be similar - some devices will need different resolutions of it, some might need a lower frame rate (and that does NOT mean an animation that runs at a different speed)
23:40:00 <strcat[m]> I want to do it as I've specified
23:40:05 <strcat[m]> branding goes in branding/
23:40:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> K
23:40:10 <strcat[m]> scripting goes in branding_tools/
23:40:21 <strcat[m]> devices can have their own configuration of which to use
23:40:46 <louipcm> what about custom boot noise
23:40:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> NO
23:41:05 <strcat[m]> I want the wallpapers to simply be the logo, perhaps it makes sense to include a black on white one and a white on black one
23:41:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> That is just annoying
23:41:17 <strcat[m]> white on black one (black background) is probably what's wanted by default
23:41:20 <strcat[m]> perhaps only do that
23:41:34 <strcat[m]> it needs to be properly included
23:41:41 <louipcm> what if it sounds like your mom singing soft lullabies anupritaisno1
23:41:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipcm "what if it sounds like your mom "> I'm pretty sure that would be a nightmare
23:42:06 <strcat[m]> so, figure out the proper sizes to use per-device (that does not necessarily mean it's the resolution of the screen, in fact it probably isn't the right size)
23:42:07 <louipcm> lol ok
23:42:22 <strcat[m]> if people are going to make this into something problematic I'm going to reject it in advance
23:42:23 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <louipcm "what about custom boot noise"> This has to be one of the #1 things I hated about nearly every early Android phone
23:42:24 <strcat[m]> it's getting to that point
23:42:54 <strcat[m]> start with wallpapers, follow the requirements
23:43:05 <louipcm> 0xC0ncord:  i dunno the nokia one is iconic so i don't mind that
23:43:19 <strcat[m]> script to generate from the logo in branding_tools, put the output in branding (or give me the proper sizes to generate with the script and I'll do it)
23:43:24 <strcat[m]> look at the existing scripts in there for examples
23:43:41 <strcat[m]> you need to take the logo and generate a nice looking wallpaper with it centered with a lot of padding around it
23:43:47 <strcat[m]> use graphicsmagick / imagemagick
23:43:59 <strcat[m]> inkscape
23:44:07 <strcat[m]> look at the existing branding_tools scripts
23:44:21 <strcat[m]> what I want is a script that is passed the dimensions and generates a proper wallpaper, white logo on black background, simple
23:44:46 <strcat[m]> and I need the appropriate dimensions per device to be determined, and this to do be done for each of those sets of dimensions
23:44:53 <strcat[m]> and then configured to be included per-device properly
23:44:58 <strcat[m]> that is the set of tasks
23:45:10 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <louipcm "0xC0ncord:  i dunno the nokia on"> It's annoying because I don't like drawing attention just because I'm restarting my phone. All of the early Motorola phones had really annoying boot noises.
23:45:10 <strcat[m]> I won't accept something that's not done properly and that's not properly explained and justified
23:45:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "It's annoying because I don't li"> Hello moto
23:45:29 <strcat[m]> so if you decide a certain width x height is appropriate for the Pixel 4, I need to know why that's the case and how it handles rotation etc
23:45:43 <strcat[m]> so far, no one has been interested in doing this properly
23:45:54 <strcat[m]> people have made wallpapers and shown me them but that is not what I'm asking for to get it included
23:46:04 <strcat[m]> I will close / reject anything not meeting this requirements
23:46:14 <strcat[m]>  * I will close / reject anything not meeting these requirements
23:46:53 <strcat[m]> boot animations are more complicated since it has to be an appealing animation and it also can't be too large, but has to look good and be fluid regardless
23:46:55 <louipcm> wonder if boot noise volume could be configured
23:47:01 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Hello moto"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdZZCwcZOnY
23:47:07 <strcat[m]> it's not something configurable
23:47:15 <strcat[m]> it's an early boot animation before the OS data is ready
23:47:55 <louipcm> toobad
23:48:05 <M0xC0ncord[m]> A GrapheneOS boot animation  doesn't need to be that complicated. Something as simple as the OS logo rotating at different speeds would be fine and look decent.
23:48:20 <strcat[m]> yeah but look at what I wrote above about wallpapers
23:48:24 <strcat[m]> and now apply that to boot animations
23:48:38 <strcat[m]> there needs to be a way to generate the boot animation zip at different resolutions and frame rates
23:48:52 <strcat[m]> a program or script for doing it, perhaps something already exists for it
23:48:53 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Yeah I follow
23:49:01 <strcat[m]> and then the proper one has to be included per device
23:49:06 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Inkscape + imagemagick as you already said would work
23:49:20 <strcat[m]> and higher frame rate means more frames,  the animation should go at the same speed
23:49:28 <strcat[m]> the animation should look the same across devices
23:49:52 <strcat[m]> if a device has a different resolution then perhaps the boot animation zip needs to be a bit different
23:50:06 <strcat[m]> even if both are 720p, may need to size it differently
23:50:19 <strcat[m]> I cannot accept anything less than this being done properly
23:50:45 <res4[m]> <strcat[m] "white on black one (black backgr"> Would this not potentially result in some nasty burn-in?
23:50:51 <strcat[m]> wallpapers are the best place to start, or adjusting the color scheme (copying the Pixel theme in frameworks/base as the default would be fine)
23:51:15 <strcat[m]> res4: no, people don't sit there staring at their home screen
23:51:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <res4[m] "Would this not potentially resul"> If you are staring at your honr screen
23:51:21 <strcat[m]> it's not like the navigation bar and status bar
23:51:31 <strcat[m]> the screen goes off quickly if your device is idle
23:51:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Never mind Daniel said it
23:51:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: pm
23:55:01 <res4[m]> I still think versions with lower contrast (dark gray / gray; gray / light gray) would be gentler on the screen, the eyes, and would potentially look quite good. Should the code ever be implemented, those should be easy options to add and I think people would use them.
23:55:47 <strcat[m]> well similarly
23:55:59 <strcat[m]> the AOSP dark theme is lower contrast than the Pixel theme
23:56:03 <strcat[m]> and people complain about it
23:56:13 <strcat[m]> I think people would be happier if we used the Pixel theme colors
23:56:25 <strcat[m]> I want to have a consistent GrapheneOS color scheme though
23:56:26 <strcat[m]> not per-device
23:56:45 <strcat[m]> so we're not enabling Pixel theme on Pixels specifically, it's going to be a global change in frameworks/base, not a per-device overlay
23:56:58 <strcat[m]> the Pixel theme is closer to the theme colors we use at least
23:57:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> <res4[m] "I still think versions with lowe"> You can always change the wallpaper
23:57:16 <strcat[m]> the AOSP green isn't a good fit for GrapheneOS
23:57:19 <strcat[m]> anyway
23:57:21 <strcat[m]> not very important
23:57:40 <strcat[m]> if someone is interested in doing this properly I would accept a PR using the Pixel color schemes
23:57:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wallpaper has to at least make a good first impression
23:57:55 <strcat[m]> but it has to be done properly based on the overlays such as for the Pixel 4
23:58:07 <strcat[m]> these things are a low priority and I'm not going to do them
23:58:19 <strcat[m]> and I'm not going to take stuff that's done improperly / incompletely and fix it
23:58:28 <strcat[m]> will just close the PRs as out of scope
23:58:35 <strcat[m]> so, give me something meeting the requirements that's done right
23:58:39 <strcat[m]> and I can accept it
