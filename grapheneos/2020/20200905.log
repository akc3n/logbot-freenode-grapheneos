03:15:57 <status_offline[m> Hello guys. Can anybody confirm if KDE Connect works properly on GrapheneOS on pixel 3a? Thank you in advance
04:41:02 <vata0[m]> Hi. I am trying to find out which model of the pixel 3xl or the pixel 3a xl I should be looking for considering I’m with Verizon as my carrier.
04:43:20 <vata0[m]> I thought that a factory unlocked Verizon phone would be what I should be looking for but apparently I’ve misunderstood.  So I’m just trying to confirm first.
04:48:43 <NSA[m]> <vata0[m] "Hi. I am trying to find out whic"> You want an unlocked pixel not one sold by a carrier with a bootloader you cant unlock
04:52:37 <vata0[m]> NSA: https://www.ebay.com/itm/154054519215
04:52:38 <vata0[m]> Would this be the kind I’m looking for
05:04:50 * NSA[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tPZfsvJDDFxjiynkiwzdOLdp/message.txt >
05:05:11 <vata0[m]> Well thank you for your time
05:05:40 <NSA[m]> In my country pixels don't get their firmware modified for carriers so I was fine buying a carrier variant
05:06:24 <NSA[m]> But Verizon is the only carrier in the US I've heard that modify the firmware so I'm pretty sure you would he safe buying that
05:07:19 <vata0[m]> I’m starting to think I should just get a 4xl or 4axl and sit on it till there fully supported
05:07:21 <NSA[m]> As long as the phone doesn't say the carrier name at startup and come with carrier bloatware you're all good
05:08:46 * NSA[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/SxPRWlUYDPLuHwLsdyQSDoJA/message.txt >
05:09:25 <NSA[m]> That's kind of what you're looking for if you want to be 100% sure
05:09:46 <vata0[m]> I gotcha.
05:10:18 <vata0[m]> I saw on Reddit that people were recommending swappa as well for buying phones
05:10:48 <vata0[m]> I’ve never had to consider making sure I got one where the boot loader wasn’t a problem. I’ve always just made sure they were factory unlocked
05:11:33 <vata0[m]> A brand new 4a is only like 360 after tax and that’s unlocked from google
05:13:26 <NSA[m]> <vata0[m] "I saw on Reddit that people were"> I've never bought off eBay or swappa usually in stores you can get some good deals on android phones that are a year + old
05:14:09 <vata0[m]> Yea for me here I would have to go the eBay/amazon route to get a 3xl
05:15:51 <NSA[m]> <vata0[m] "Yea for me here I would have to "> Yeah I'm glad I got mine when I did because no one in my area sells them anymore
05:17:13 <zen_monkey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Literally somebody will come wit"> Can't you choose not to just answer the questions that are either already answered on the past or are part of FAQs? That way, we can test their resolve and commitment. If they are interested in the project, they will make efforts to find the answer. But sometimes people are non technical and really need assistance too.
05:25:00 <vata0[m]> NSA: yea. I kinda found out about all this late in the game. I mean it’s not to late but I can’t actually buy one new from google. So now I have to kinda jump through hoops to make sure I’m gettin the right one.
05:25:00 <vata0[m]> I’m so glad I cought the thing about the boot loader tho. It never occurred to me that factory unlocked could still have the boot loader locked.
05:26:23 <vata0[m]> I’ve flashed many Roms in the past but that was never something I ran into.
05:26:23 <vata0[m]> And for the last 5 or more years I’ve been on iOS. Which is still the devil but less of the devil then android. And I’ve always been jail broken.

05:28:14 <vata0[m]> In a long transition to move more towards privacy overt the Lary year I’ve been weeding out all the data mining and just unsafe shit I’ve been useing. My phone is the last step in the process.
05:29:22 <vata0[m]> I managed to find one video about calyxos. And it looked interesting.  It if ima kick it then I need to kick it fully.
05:30:25 <NSA[m]> <vata0[m] "I managed to find one video abou"> Yeah I've used both graphene and calyx and I would recommend chosing calyx unless you're Edward snowden
05:30:51 <M1[m]> I have a question too
05:30:55 <M1[m]> does outlook app work
05:31:05 <NSA[m]> <M1[m] "does outlook app work"> Yep
05:31:17 <vata0[m]> Ive been trying to get everyone to move over to element/matrix and if they all liked it I was gonna pop a server up. For us we been testing it for the last 2 weeks and it’s worked amazing.
05:31:18 <vata0[m]> I mention this cause we all have iPhones and iMessage is honestly the only thing thet tied me to Apple.  But since matrix is working so well I think the translation will be much more painless
05:31:21 <M1[m]> do you recommend any alternative to outlook
05:31:37 <NSA[m]> <M1[m] "do you recommend any alternative"> K9 mail on fdroid
05:32:37 <M1[m]> thanks
05:33:40 <M1[m]> should I also install open keychain
05:33:47 <vata0[m]> NSA: with all the foss alternatives and me not having to depend on anything that’s actually proprietary Graphene seemed like be better option

05:36:04 <vata0[m]> I used Keybase then zoom bought them. So they killed that for me
05:36:06 <M1[m]> Is signal worth using as default sms app
05:36:33 <NSA[m]> <vata0[m] "NSA: from what I understand and "> The only reason I can see that being is it doesn't require a phone number. A lot of people recommend signal over element becausd the matrix protocol leaks metadata
05:36:36 <vata0[m]> ::1: o don’t have experience with that to be able to tell you yes or no
05:36:44 <NSA[m]> <M1[m] "Is signal worth using as default"> 100%
05:36:54 <M1[m]> <vata0[m] "::1: o don’t have experience wit"> I have no friends using Signal
05:37:27 <vata0[m]> NSA: interesting I’ll have to look more into that.
05:37:58 <NSA[m]> <M1[m] "I have no friends using Signal"> Just ask them to switch over. It didn't take me long to get a couple of mine to switch over
05:38:13 <M1[m]> They prefer Telegram which I refuse to use
05:38:27 <vata0[m]> ::1: agreed
05:39:00 <NSA[m]> Texting your friends that use or don't use signal through the app is seamless
05:39:14 <NSA[m]> You send regular SMS and signal messages through the same app

05:43:04 <NSA[m]> With signal vs without signal
05:44:22 <NSA[m]> <vata0[m] "https://www.slant.co/versus/1989"> "Best for desktop"
05:47:08 <NSA[m]> Its less secure than signal on mobile and it lacks the features signal has
05:48:21 <NSA[m]> Signal doesn't seem geared towards desktop users but its possible to use it through their desktop app
05:55:36 <vata0[m]> NSA: looking at that sent me down a whole other path
05:55:52 <vata0[m]> https://cryptpad.fr
05:55:58 <vata0[m]> Ever heard of this
05:56:42 <NSA[m]> Nope
05:57:57 <NSA[m]> <vata0[m] "Ever heard of this "> Always encrypt your files yourself before uploading and use nextcloud
05:58:39 <vata0[m]> Yea next cloud is in the list. Just dint have the hardware to have my own server.
05:58:59 <vata0[m]> * Yea next cloud is on the list. Just dont have the hardware to have my own server.
05:59:27 <NSA[m]> I'm not really a big fan of storing data in the cloud
06:00:07 <vata0[m]> When you run your own next cloud it is but isn’t a cloud
06:00:41 <vata0[m]> It dosnt have to point out. You can just have it as local
06:02:17 <NSA[m]> "The cloud" is just someone else's computer. If you use services like icloud and google drive are you comfortable storing your data on someone else's computer which you have no control over?

06:30:45 <mastercakex[m]> As much as I hate WhatsApp and love GrapheneOS I had to install it just to use it with one contact
06:30:45 <mastercakex[m]> 1. How bad is it?
06:30:45 <mastercakex[m]> 2. I also don't get notifications constantly. Probably the process gets killed in the background after a while
06:51:09 <cn3m[m]> <zen_monkey[m] "Can't you choose not to just ans"> The problem is that becomes part of the record and people see that. If there are misleading(or straight up misquotes like what was in question) statements. That specific question I answered twice, on Reddit and Matrix. Took a good 30 minutes of my free time. This is worth it to me(as it is the developers) as people don't really read the FAQ.
06:57:09 <zen_monkey[m]> Really don't want to take up your time on this. But people who are already on this project or concept understand it. So they are not going to be misled or impacted by these statements. New comers anyways don't read history, so they don't get impacted too. I think this menace is common and going to continue. Just think about it. Whatever you guys think works ...
06:58:21 <cn3m[m]> Thanks for the input. I have thought about personalizing it less and just posting the FAQ entries
07:01:32 <vata0[m]> Are all pixel phones cdma&gsm
07:03:06 <vata0[m]> I’d imagine there both. Unless there outside the us. Then maybe only gsm
07:08:05 <cn3m[m]> jshoard: welcome

11:06:17 <Aphleese> Welp, I'm in the market for a new device and I'm trying to get a greater grasp on the limitations of this. In fact, I've not much insight due to lack of research, barring some few vids.
11:07:15 <hitchhooker[m]> cdesai, where you read/access the report?
11:07:19 <Aphleese> I suppose those google services are polled a lot from every app acquired fm play-store, scary when one thinks about it for more than half a second...
11:07:50 <hitchhooker[m]> I found where to take it
11:07:51 <cdesai> hitchhooker[m]: if you mean bugreport, you get a notification once taken and can then share it by tapping that
11:08:05 <cdesai> It will also show up in the Files app
11:08:35 <hitchhooker[m]> ah nice, wasnt just showing the notification
11:09:00 <cdesai> It can take some time
11:09:05 <hitchhooker[m]> so I start teh app and when it dies I get bug report?
11:09:14 <cdesai> Yes
11:09:22 <hitchhooker[m]> cool
11:11:06 <Autopsy[m]> Dunno if anyone is keeping tabs on apps that work and don't work, but Lidl Plus doesn't work on GrapheneOS.
11:11:40 <hitchhooker[m]> could be good idea

We are trying to genuinely build a community not a help desk center.
15:12:59 <aeonsolution[m]> The devs and users in this community that have been here a while-much longer than me-see there is a difference between newcomers coming in to learn and contribute vs security hobbyists/enthusiasts coming in here to armchair critic without providing any substantial evidence to back their claims much less show that they understand the material they share or defend.

16:54:04 <tve> I know that there are many APIs and tricky stuff like the signature spoofing necessary for certain in-app purchases, etc. So I'm looking for something that has a bit of a list of what's supported and what not and what the plans are.

16:56:29 <Autopsy[m]> Too many similar acronyms for different stuff.
16:56:52 <tve> whoops, sorry, yes, I did mean google play services.
16:56:53 <Autopsy[m]> <tve "I really like grapheneos but the"> CalyxOS might be good for you, if you can't do and/or live without those apps.
16:58:27 <tve> That may be, but there's zero transparency around its development. No community around it either, nothing. "It's great and here's the source code" kind'a...
16:58:44 <Autopsy[m]> Zero transparency?
16:58:57 <Autopsy[m]> You taking the piss?
17:00:10 <Autopsy[m]> There's a community on Freenode and Matrix.
17:03:32 <tve> Ah, didn't see that mentioned anywhere. I'll do another round of looking, thanks.
17:06:27 <tve> I did read reddit messages like https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/b9j6pe/compatibility_layer_for_google_services/ek7hcf1/ and was really wondering whether there's an up-to-date write-up of where grapheneos is at and heading...
17:06:27 <Autopsy[m]> It is a really good, secure ROM with microG baked in. Think of it as GrapheneOS with microG, without some hardening applied that GrapheneOS has. With verified boot, too.
17:07:52 <tamqcrg[m]> Having a persistent problem with signal failing to send SMS to non signal users. It sometimes sends okay, but normally fails instantly or after 20 seconds of trying. It seems that  I receive SMS okay.
17:08:01 <jpds> tve: All their code seems to be open-source: https://calyxos.org/development
17:08:10 <tamqcrg[m]> Oh wrong chat. Sorry.
17:09:15 <tve> @jpds: yup, I've now found the issue tracker on gitlab. I was mainly seeing the calyxos.org pages and they are very static...
17:10:13 <Autopsy[m]> <tve "I did read reddit messages like "> Like Metapod; just harden more.
17:10:16 <tve> BTW, I didn't mean to piss on calyxos, it was more an issue of me not wanting to contemplate an OS where there's no active community that I could find to ask questions and hear about the direction and issues. Happy to have been corrected.
17:10:39 <Autopsy[m]> Yeah, no problemo!
17:11:01 <Autopsy[m]> <tamqcrg[m] "Having a persistent problem with"> A tale as old as time.
17:12:26 <tve> I'm running my own build of /e/ (Q) on a pixel3a right now and am not thrilled by the overall security, but learned a lot about what needs google play services, etc. It's a steep learning curve!
17:12:56 <tve> Hence looking again for alternatives...
17:14:45 <Autopsy[m]> I think my advice, if you don't mind me saying, would be: what apps can you compromise with? Are there apps that have a privacy and security respecting alternative?
17:15:28 <tve> BTW, my biggest unresolved issue, tangential to grapheneos but thought I'd ask... Is there a way to do a "full" backup of the userdata partition (e.g. image)?
17:16:02 <tve> If I had that it would a lot easier for me to try grapheneos, calyxos, etc while being able to return to my current state afterwards.
17:20:20 <Autopsy[m]> Dunno if /e/ has verified boot or anything, but if your device has TWRP, I suppose you could use that to back it up, then try out GrapheneOS and/or CalyxOS, so you could revert back if necessary. Just make full backups first.
17:20:51 <tve> THere's no TWRP for pixel3a running Android 10 as far as I know?
17:21:03 <aeonsolution[m]> Seedvault which works on GrapheneOS and CalyxOS
17:21:47 <aeonsolution[m]> tve:  also read this https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
17:21:51 <tve> Looking... does that back up *everything* and not just the shared data or stuff than an app has marked as backup-worthy?
17:21:58 <aeonsolution[m]> and please read the whats on the website
17:23:20 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/stevesoltys/seedvault
17:23:36 <aeonsolution[m]> also please read https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask
17:24:12 <aeonsolution[m]> we appreciate the questions, but if you arent doing the bare minimum on your end, you wont get much help
17:24:29 <tve> I did read the website pretty much top-to-bottom. There's a lot of info, which is one of the things I really like about graphene. You have to realize that a lot of it is not really understandable by someone who is trying to come off stock google...
17:24:54 <tve> For example, the section on never-google-services states "Open APIs not tied to Google will continue to be implemented using open source providers like the Seedvault backup app."
17:24:54 <aeonsolution[m]> you dont have to try and figure out all in one day
17:25:04 <aeonsolution[m]> it takes time, please pace yourself
17:25:29 <tve> OK, I'll stop bugging you guys.
17:25:36 <Autopsy[m]> Absolutely. It is a marathon, not a sprint
17:25:37 <tve> Thanks for the pointers

18:54:40 <faxing[m]> aeonsolution: You didn't happen to ever find out anything with the Voicemail stuff, did you?
18:54:57 <aeonsolution[m]> still in the backlog
18:55:06 <faxing[m]>  * aeonsolution: Did you  ever happen to find out anything about the Voicemail stuff by any chance?
18:55:28 <aeonsolution[m]> i was able to find some vendor files that anu provided, but i still need to do some more research
18:55:39 <aeonsolution[m]> its not clear what im missing
18:55:39 <faxing[m]> Alright, all good - just checking
18:55:48 <aeonsolution[m]> i havent forgotten ;)
18:55:53 <faxing[m]> Thank you so much for trying to figure it out
18:56:00 <faxing[m]> I really appriciate it
18:56:03 <aeonsolution[m]> youre welcome
18:56:05 <faxing[m]>  * I really appreciate it
20:47:08 <WoC[m]> Is there any major difference between GrapheneOS and android ?
20:48:15 <atasuke[m]> WoC: GrapheneOS is Android. But with major security enhancements
20:48:30 <cn3m[m]> <WoC[m] "Is there any major difference be"> yes GrapheneOS is a substantial security overhaul with very high standards
20:48:50 <WoC[m]> Ok, thanks
