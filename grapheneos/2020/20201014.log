00:38:30 <HagbardCeline[m]> I'm getting a lot of device restarts on my pixel 3a.       Not really disruptive, but... Concerning?

01:43:35 <cicadasolver[m]> <Sheru[m] "> <@cicadasolver:matrix.org> Hi "> Oh yeah, that seems to be exactly the case!
01:44:06 <Sheru[m]> https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules
01:44:10 <Sheru[m]> The instruction is there
01:44:44 <cicadasolver[m]> Tnx Sheru!
01:44:44 <cicadasolver[m]> I'll check it out)
01:45:39 <cicadasolver[m]> And btw,
01:45:39 <cicadasolver[m]> Big thanks to developers and maintainers of GrapheneOS!
02:41:21 <cicadasolver[m]> Update: installation successful!
02:41:21 <cicadasolver[m]> Tnx again Sheru)

06:57:56 <dontdisturbme[m]> Is there any security concern if were to request for trusted devices like smart watches for smart unlock function?
06:58:59 <dontdisturbme[m]> Specifically for pixel 4 as there are no fingerprint sensors but face unlock which is useless when using with masks
07:05:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dontdisturbme[m] "Specifically for pixel 4 as ther"> Works for me
07:23:41 <hiace> Hey
07:24:15 <hiace> Is there a script that installs all dependencies needed to build grapheneos?
07:24:44 <hiace> Or does someone have an .iso file, preferable ubuntu 20.04lts with all the dependencies?
07:28:37 <dontdisturbme[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Works for me "> How do you use face unlock with masks on??
07:50:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> [dontdisturbme](https://matrix.to/#/@dontdisturbme:matrix.org) it just works?
07:54:30 <dontdisturbme[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "[dontdisturbme](https://matrix.t"> Erm...you are wearing the mask properly n cover up to the nose right? Kinda incredulous that you can unlock with your mask though
08:16:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dontdisturbme[m] "Erm...you are wearing the mask p"> Yes I do
08:21:44 <dontdisturbme[m]> So face unlock in GrapheneOS only requires just the eyes to unlock in your case? I'm not able to unlock while wearing any type of masks. If I pull it down below the nose, then it can unlock
08:44:07 <stronthoop> guys can GrapheneOS also be installed on a Oneplus 7 pro ?
08:47:11 <trismous[m]> No, GOS officially supports only Pixels
08:47:22 <stronthoop> ok thanks
08:47:25 <stronthoop> too bad ;)
09:01:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> [stronthoop](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_stronthoop:matrix.org) there is a replacement for op7pro only
09:05:12 <hypokeimenon[m]> Some awesome developer works on Lineage for the op7pro
09:05:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> Well GlassRom
09:06:35 <erikai> hi
09:07:50 <erikai> Just want to try GrapheneOS for the first time on a Pixel 3a. Shoult I update to Android11 befor flashing?
09:08:19 <erikai> Or better stay with the Android10 baseband?
09:08:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> [erikai](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_erikai:matrix.org) it is recommended
09:09:00 <erikai> thank you!
09:13:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> I can't lie, if asked someone for advice on two options and the person replied yes, I would still be very confused.
09:14:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> * [erikai](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_erikai:matrix.org) it is recommended to upgrade to 11 first
09:26:06 <erikai> thanks again, flash 11 is on the way :-)
10:23:10 <erikai> volte is not working O2 Germany, with LineageOS on same device it worked. Is there a change in baseband for GrapheneOS?
10:39:03 <dazinism> erikai: I think volte support is variable and depends on the phone network.  There are issues in github about it.
10:57:17 <erikai> dazinism: as mentioned before, it works with latest lineageos on same device
10:57:46 <Sheru[m]> Which GrapheneOS?
10:57:52 <Sheru[m]> (As in which device?)
10:58:51 <Sheru[m]> (Only 4 and 4XL(?) has maintainer iirc, and volte/carrier support does vary between device (on config and stuff))
11:06:28 <erikai> Sheru[m]: Pixel3a O2 Germany
11:22:10 <yap26it5> Hi, can someone point me to the most straightforward way to edit the hosts file in graphene OS?
11:34:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <yap26it5 "Hi, can someone point me to the "> Yes. Don't
11:34:54 <dazinism> erikai: look here https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/308
11:35:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've never seen a case where somebody validly needed to edit a hosts file
11:36:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you really want equivalent functionality run a home DNS server and set that as the DNS server in your router's dhcp server settings
11:38:24 <erikai> dazinism: thank you
11:38:45 <dazinism> erikai Think thats probably why volte isnt working for you. Maybe add a comment there? there?
11:40:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> [dazinism](https://matrix.to/#/@DzzzzzzR:matrix.org) no not there
11:40:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> APNs issue is resolved
11:41:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are missing overlays for a few carriers
11:41:27 <Sheru[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "We are missing overlays for a fe"> Were those APN from upstream?
11:41:28 <Sheru[m]> (Curious)
11:41:58 <erikai> For now I went back to lineage, try Graphene later again.
11:51:04 <dazinism> erikai: actually this issue possibly explains more https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/153

14:28:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> <prialgauskas_lt[ "You’ll know who I am"> What?
14:28:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do you need help?
14:39:59 <Sheru[m]> Not the person who is asked
14:40:00 <Sheru[m]> But need help rn
14:40:28 <Sheru[m]> On offtopic
14:53:42 <alex-resist> grapheneos-offtopic is not working for me
15:02:41 <Sheru[m]> <alex-resist "grapheneos-offtopic is not worki"> Try the `/join` command?

15:43:39 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Google Pixel 5 is out!
15:45:10 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Im delay, sorry. Lol
15:47:37 <uhoh[hehim][m]> I want to run Graphene in a VM because I don't have a phone. Is this possible?
16:01:07 <lolunlimited[m]> no
16:02:19 <lolunlimited[m]> pixel 4a official build expected release date for graphene os?
16:13:10 <freebass787[m]> Apologies if this has been covered before but does Graphene OS support volte on T-Mobile in the US?
16:34:41 <makingaliasesisa> uhoh [he/him]: https://grapheneos.org/build#build-targets it has some stuff about x86_64 but i don't really know how functional it is as it is most probably only used for testing.
19:20:24 <modp2[m]> Hi there, anyone having bluetooth issues after last update? Device is paired but no audio at all...
19:20:59 <bobfett> Have you rebooted? It solved my issue on Pixel 3XL
19:21:07 <modp2[m]> Pixel 3A
19:21:20 <modp2[m]> Yup i did but still no audio
19:24:45 <modp2[m]> Also changed headset but same issue
19:25:34 <bobfett> I have no issue at the moment
22:11:41 <coptocode[m]> Are there any plains for a GrapheneOs port to Moto G6 Ail?
22:22:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> <coptocode[m] "Are there any plains for a Graph"> No
22:23:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Your device doesn't even have a stable android 10 port
22:23:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> We cannot support this
22:24:09 <coptocode[m]> okay, thank you for you're time..
22:24:42 <sphinxcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
22:25:04 <coptocode[m]> hopefully one day it'd be on the roadmap, thank you for you time .
22:26:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> <coptocode[m] "hopefully one day it'd be on the"> No it will not
22:27:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are not going to support anything other than pixels
22:31:22 <res4[m]> <coptocode[m] "hopefully one day it'd be on the"> To clarify: Your device doesn't meet the security standards of the GrapheneOS project, and only the Pixel phones currently do.
22:36:22 <res4[m]> Just to make sure it doesn't come across like the people behind GOS support Google phones exclusively. It's the hardware that counts. iPhones would be fine as well in terms of security features, but you obviously can't flash an Android OS onto an iPhone.
22:41:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW there's glassrom for a few oneplus devices
22:43:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sadly oneplus devices have too many bypasses. Including a backdoor that allows you to read RAM and disk contents if you have physical access
22:44:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even when the bootloader is locked
