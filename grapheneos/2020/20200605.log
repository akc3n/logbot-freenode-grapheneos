00:01:16 <travankor> think so
00:01:41 <travankor> although just because it's open source doesn't means it's easy :p
00:37:57 <wonderfall[m]> Anyone else using RiotX from F-Droid? I'm getting these "Listening for events" notifications, now I don't mind having a fixed notification since I know that's the trade-off for not having Play Services, but a least I wish it was here for good and not coming forth and back, that's annoying.

00:51:57 <nickcalyx[m]> I use riotx on calyxos which has microg, so Google cloud messaging and for whatever its worth, riotx's notification thing flickers annoyingly
00:52:37 <cn3m[m]> nickcalyx: hey can I shoot you a dm?
00:53:08 <cn3m[m]> Slightly off topic
00:54:34 <nickcalyx[m]> sure
00:58:07 <cn3m[m]> Thanks
01:11:00 <wonderfall[m]> > riotx's notification thing flickers annoyingly
01:11:00 <wonderfall[m]> Right... So, I might take a look at some alternatives like Pattle. The latter seems to have less features but I don't mind that.
01:15:11 <analog[m]> Pattle's biggest problem is the lack of E2EE.
01:15:17 <wonderfall[m]> Yeah, just noticed that...
01:15:48 <analog[m]> It's still a pretty big W.I.P but otherwise it's pretty nice.
01:16:24 <wonderfall[m]> I like the UI for instance, pretty straightforward!
01:16:41 <analog[m]> Yeah, they fixed the UI in a recent update.
01:16:51 <analog[m]> Admittetly prior it wasn't very appealing.
01:17:48 <analog[m]> It's also built with Flutter if I recall.
01:26:47 <wonderfall[m]> That's what I just read on their Gitlab, yes. Regarding my issue, I might just settle on RiotX with session-notifications disabled, for now. With GrapheneOS I've learned to live without them anyway. :D
01:28:15 <analog[m]> I personally just prefer the regular Riot app, gives a similar experience to that on desktop and I've personally never experienced any problems with it. FluffyChat is also a cool client.
01:29:17 <analog[m]> Never dabbled with RiotX admittetly, only hearsays about its greatness.
01:32:06 <cn3m[m]> It's great if it doesn't freeze up or have the ghost message bug
01:34:33 <wonderfall[m]> I'm afraid the regular app will be discontinued, that's why I didn't bother to try, but perhaps I'm wrong. Fluffy Chat seems nice too
01:34:55 <analog[m]> May I ask why it'd be discontinued?
01:36:45 <wonderfall[m]> The "important announcement" on their README led me to think they will focus mainly on RiotX, and that security issues may not be addressed as quickly as usual. But it seems it's still well maintained, the last release was 3 days ago.
01:37:27 <analog[m]> wonderfall Well, then in that case using "discontinued" seems a bit misleading. They're just not set on high priority, but there is still some work put to it.
01:38:23 <wonderfall[m]> Oh I agree,  I just said it's now discontinued now but perhaps in the "near future", but that's too vague, sorry for the confusion.
01:38:27 <wonderfall[m]>  * Oh I agree,  I just said it's not discontinued now but perhaps in the "near future", but that's too vague, sorry for the confusion.
01:38:55 <wonderfall[m]> I might as well try it.
01:39:19 <analog[m]> wonderfall The phrasing certainly didn't give me that interpretation, but I see now.
01:40:14 <wonderfall[m]> It happens sometimes when I write in english, but still think in french. :)
01:41:18 <analog[m]> wonderfall Oh, that's cool. I also know a dimuitive amount of French due to being a Canadian citizen.
01:42:01 <wonderfall[m]> @ana
01:43:29 <wonderfall[m]> analog: Especially if you're from Quebec. :P
01:43:29 <wonderfall[m]> But yeah, that's frustrating sometimes, I didn't mean to write something I didn't think exactly.
01:43:29 <wonderfall[m]> Well, it's late here, have a good day!
01:43:49 <analog[m]> wonderfall Take care.
01:59:25 <travankor_> https://nitter.net/JonnyJ17/status/1268005528703123457
01:59:36 <travankor_> is this imsi jamming?
02:04:51 <travankor_> wasn’t ‘murica complaining about how authoritarian hong kong gov is a few weeks ago...
02:10:38 <TheJollyRoger> renlord: They're experimenting with it right now and FlexVer and LPCGuard was actually in early testing with their x86_
02:10:51 <TheJollyRoger> 64 Opteron KGPE D16s.
02:11:37 <TheJollyRoger> Development unfortunately seems to be on hold for the moment due to the pandemic.
02:17:33 <TheJollyRoger> Prior to though, I think the rationale would have been that the FlexVer module would verify the BMC and hostboot of the board, and then that acts as the root of trust. Once that's known to be OK and can attest to its authenticity via remote attestation, since the Petitboot is a tiny operating system, it could be possible to do signature verification on it pre-boot, in conjunction with an
02:17:34 <TheJollyRoger> authenticated mode of encryption.
02:18:11 <TheJollyRoger> I wouldn't know how to go about doing the whole "repair the system image using repair blocks" though.
02:19:22 <strcat[m]> paintedman: you also need to do coral-sepolicy probably
02:19:27 <strcat[m]> per crosshatch-sepolicy
02:19:32 <strcat[m]> although most of the changes are not currently there
02:25:45 <Danneskjold> how bad is it to install e.g. Messenger on grapheneOS
02:26:11 <Danneskjold> am I now being tracked by Zucc and Google
02:26:41 <strcat[m]> Danneskjold: I suggest reading all of the past questions / answers about the same topics
02:26:47 <strcat[m]> and about the app sandbox, profiles and so on
02:26:58 <Danneskjold> Yeah definitely looking for some reading
02:27:04 <strcat[m]> you're asking a very general / vague question that has been asked and answered 100 times, often in depth
02:27:11 <Danneskjold> where could I find that info
02:28:19 <TheJollyRoger> Danneskjold: on the website and FAQ. Hold on a moment and I will try to pull some stuff up for you.
02:29:08 <TheJollyRoger> Danneskjold:  First you're going to want to start here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#security-and-privacy
02:31:36 <TheJollyRoger> https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/fpc2av/apps_are_meant_to_be_able_to_enumerate_other_apps/
02:38:10 <Danneskjold> Okay so it seems that Messenger can't snoop around on my phone
02:38:42 <Danneskjold> But by logging into messenger with a particular IP/MAC address and my real world identity it seems like I've now got a tracker on my phoen
02:38:51 <Danneskjold> *phone i'm sober
02:41:30 <TheJollyRoger> Apps cannot read your phone's MAC address.
02:42:38 <Danneskjold> oh well that's perfect
02:43:01 <Danneskjold> so there's basically no way messenger could get information other than my fb account
02:43:15 <TheJollyRoger> Don't give it permission to what you don't want it to access.
02:43:31 <TheJollyRoger> Don't give it data you don't want it to analyze/feed to Zuck.
02:44:37 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't want it enumerating or talking to other apps on your phone (which it can't do without those other apps playing along, mind you), install it into a separate profile.
02:45:47 <Danneskjold> What's this Sensors permission and why is it given to apps by default? Seems like I wouldn't want things to have it
02:45:58 <Danneskjold> a quick ddg for 'grapheneos sensors permission' didn't pull up anything useful
02:46:41 <TheJollyRoger> Danneskjold: the reason why sensors are enabled by default is that they are not a part of the Android specification.
02:46:46 <TheJollyRoger> Apps have no way to request them.
02:47:02 <TheJollyRoger> Apps have to be specifically coded to be aware of and request the permissions from the OS. The same goes for the network permission.
02:47:18 <Danneskjold> ah so it would just break randomly if you didn't give it the permission
02:47:26 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't want the app to have sensors or network access by default, turn them off before you launch the app. When apps are installed on GrapheneOS, they are installed in a "stopped" state and cannot be run until the user taps on them.
02:47:40 <TheJollyRoger> For some apps that legitimately require sensors access, yes, it will break them.
02:47:53 <Danneskjold> Confirmed messenger lite just crashed when i took away network permission
02:48:19 <TheJollyRoger> These apps may include games like SuperTuxKart which uses your phone's tilt sensor as a steering wheel, or pedometer or fitness apps that use your phone's sensors to track your steps.
02:48:58 <TheJollyRoger> OpenCamera even needs the tilt sensors so it knows you're holding the phone in the correct orientation when you take a panoramic photo.
02:50:09 <TheJollyRoger> If apps were "GrapheneOS Aware" and included the means to request these permissions, or not request them, then we would be able to deny by default, but they aren't, so this is why by default they're enabled. You can however, turn them off before you launch the app.
03:07:09 <cn3m[m]> You can force them off with developer options if you want all sensors off with a tile. I'm not sure if that's the way to go
03:11:48 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think we should be encouraging the use of developer options, too much risk, too much attack surface.
03:19:04 <radixed9[m]> It could be an interesting feature to expose
03:19:25 <radixed9[m]> https://bgr.com/2020/06/04/android-11-beta-sideloading-apps-scoped-storage-security-privacy/
03:20:01 <radixed9[m]> That could be annoying for people without the play store
03:23:31 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I don't think we should be encou"> Very true
03:48:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Man CAF can sometimes suck
03:48:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: merged one tag
03:48:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Took me 8 hours to isolate a single change that broke audio
04:10:16 <TheJollyRoger> Is there any way to change application IDs? I'm trying to build a debug version of Vanadium and install it on an old phone to see if I'm building it right but it won't install onto the phone.
04:10:27 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm installing it onto an old phone running the factory Google OS)
04:10:34 <renlord> chagne the name then compile
04:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> Change the name then compile, okay!
04:10:49 <renlord> grep the actual real name, then replace those names
04:11:34 <TheJollyRoger> Er... in the Android Manifest or...?
04:11:40 <renlord> vanadium
04:11:48 <renlord> the chromium src
04:12:18 <renlord> it hsould be org....chrome, then change it to org..chrome1
04:12:22 <strcat[m]> manifest_package = "org.chromium.chrome"
04:12:24 <strcat[m]> change that line
04:12:31 <strcat[m]> that's it
04:12:35 <TheJollyRoger> Oh!
04:13:23 <strcat[m]> it can't be called vanadium right now
04:13:35 <strcat[m]> because we never resolved that issue
04:13:39 <strcat[m]> where migration is needed
04:13:43 <TheJollyRoger> Crud.
04:14:01 <renlord> that issue since i first participated in this project
04:14:03 <TheJollyRoger> No wonder it couldn't install onto my old phone then (I'm only doing this to test the build since my emulator seems to be borked, this isn't for actual use)
04:14:11 <renlord> 1 year now?
04:14:21 <strcat[m]> there is a LOT of stuff that needs to get done
04:14:24 <strcat[m]> I need a lot of help
04:14:36 <strcat[m]> very little support atm
04:14:47 <strcat[m]> and it mostly takes up more of my time than it saves atm
04:15:57 <TheJollyRoger> Here we are, under "chrome/android/BUILD.gn" ?
04:16:15 <strcat[m]> yes
04:18:01 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: you should check why it won't install
04:18:09 <strcat[m]> why do you have a package called org.chromium.chrome installed
04:18:12 <strcat[m]> that's not the app id for Chrome
04:18:17 <strcat[m]> very weird that it won't install
04:18:24 <strcat[m]> you should actually check the error message before wasting you time
04:18:29 <strcat[m]>  * you should actually check the error message before wasting your time
04:18:43 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: you said it's an old phone - I'd guess it's not Android Q so you can't install Trichrome
04:19:05 <strcat[m]> always read error messages
04:19:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "very weird that it won't install"> Is he on Q?
04:19:30 <strcat[m]> I don't know he said he tried to install it on an old phone
04:19:42 <strcat[m]> makes sense Trichrome wouldn't work and that's the only browser target supported by Vanadium
04:19:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> May be a case of installing the browser without the rest of the trichrome bundle
04:19:52 <strcat[m]> you can do that
04:19:58 <strcat[m]> it just won't load
04:20:09 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. it's uh... it's Android Q but it's the last Sailfish update. :(
04:20:22 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: well read the error message
04:20:31 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: is it the stock OS or GrapheneOS
04:20:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Strcat BTW after cherry-picking your changes
04:20:42 <strcat[m]> which changes
04:20:51 <strcat[m]> for what
04:21:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can I revert them to merge upstream hardening commits and then add the upstream change?
04:21:10 <TheJollyRoger> Stock OS, looks like uh... "Reconcile failed: Package org.chromium.chrome requires unavailable shared library org.chromium.trichromelibrary; failing!]"
04:21:14 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you mean
04:21:16 <strcat[m]> clarify
04:21:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example revert page sanitation with upstream init on alloc
04:21:28 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: you need to install the library app first
04:21:28 <TheJollyRoger> I think then what I'll try doing is seeing if I can install this to my daily driver if the application name is changed.
04:21:30 <strcat[m]> then the browser app
04:21:33 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
04:21:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Example revert page sanitation with upstream init on alloc implementation
04:21:39 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: it has nothing to do with the name
04:21:42 <strcat[m]> read the error message
04:21:46 <strcat[m]> Package org.chromium.chrome requires unavailable shared library org.chromium.trichromelibrary;
04:21:50 <strcat[m]> always read the error messages
04:21:58 <strcat[m]> don't assume you know why it doesn't work
04:22:03 <TheJollyRoger> Ack. Got it X(
04:22:09 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: the issue is you didn't install TrichromeLibrary.apk before TrichromeChrome.apk
04:22:21 <strcat[m]> TrichromeWebview and TrichromeChrome depend on TrichromeLibrary
04:22:28 <strcat[m]> that's how it works and why it's called Trichrome - there's a shared library apk
04:22:30 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Installing both of them in order now...
04:22:38 <TheJollyRoger> Last one...
04:22:54 <strcat[m]> as opposed to Monochrome which shared WebView/browser library/resources by using a single apk
04:23:00 <strcat[m]> this approach uses 3 apks
04:23:02 <TheJollyRoger> Oh O_O.
04:23:06 <strcat[m]> where one is a library
04:23:16 <strcat[m]> that's why they're called Monochrome (old way of sharing the code) and Trichrome (new way)
04:23:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Example revert page sanitation w"> Strcat example
04:23:23 <TheJollyRoger> Woah.
04:23:40 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: just do 1:1 with crosshatch for now
04:23:41 <strcat[m]> keep it simple
04:23:46 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. Okay, it worked.
04:23:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: just do 1:1 with "> It is at the moment
04:23:55 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: we'll use the upstream commit when it's actually in the sources
04:23:57 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like this Vanadium build worked...
04:24:00 * TheJollyRoger wipes sweat off his brow.
04:24:11 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's not worth backporting upstream changes that add docs, config options, etc.
04:24:14 <strcat[m]> it just makes stuff harder
04:24:15 <strcat[m]> more churn
04:24:16 <strcat[m]> more conflicts
04:24:19 <strcat[m]> more to review
04:24:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well just need to change pattern to zero in auto var init
04:24:52 <strcat[m]> just try keeping it 1:1 for now
04:24:59 <strcat[m]> and the main thing is getting working builds for the Pixel 4
04:25:01 <strcat[m]> FULLY working builds
04:25:09 <strcat[m]> the goal is not adding hardening beyond what Pixel 3 has
04:25:15 <strcat[m]> it's getting it working - right now it can't build or run
04:25:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW thought the original goal was to backport those?
04:25:21 <strcat[m]> don't overextend
04:25:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Alright
04:25:41 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no we don't want to backport changes that do the same thing as stuff we already have, no point
04:25:49 <strcat[m]> we'll use the upstream code when it's in the sources
04:25:54 <strcat[m]> and changes are still needed
04:26:05 <strcat[m]> for now we want to keep the 3 kernels in sync
04:26:13 <renlord> backport linux mainline?
04:26:15 <strcat[m]> the focus is on maintenance and moving forward with the project
04:26:23 <renlord> why not let aosp do it
04:26:39 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the focus right now is on fixing serious problems with maintenance, lack of current gen device support and bugs that are uncovered
04:26:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well they kind of did it
04:26:43 <strcat[m]> like the camera bugs that are uncovered
04:27:06 <renlord> june bulletin patched some camera issues
04:27:10 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the device/vendor/sepolicy stuff should be done - it is probably broken, but it should be finished
04:27:13 <renlord> i will revert the workaround and see if it boots now
04:27:13 <strcat[m]> renlord: still seems broken
04:27:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-4.14-stable/security/Kconfig.hardening
04:27:20 <renlord> strcat[m]: you tried?
04:27:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's still broken even without enabling the full stuff
04:27:29 <renlord> ok
04:27:36 <strcat[m]> renlord: I mean all you have to do is switch back and forth from portrait
04:27:39 <strcat[m]> and you can see it's still sketchy
04:27:48 <renlord> yeah, thats right
04:27:49 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 works pretty well now, Pixel 3 and 3a do not
04:28:01 <strcat[m]> the problem is the camx stuff
04:28:13 <strcat[m]> the code they fixed did make things better
04:28:23 <strcat[m]> just doesn't fix all the issues, only a couple
04:28:27 <renlord> strcat[m]: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/44
04:28:38 <renlord> this issue is mostly addressed already by tracking aosp-alliance?
04:28:51 <strcat[m]> only for Pixel 4 and paintedman told us that it's completely broken
04:28:51 <strcat[m]> so
04:28:54 <strcat[m]> no, not addressed at all
04:29:05 <renlord> :(
04:29:09 <strcat[m]> we may have to revert all those AOSP alliance changes to get things working initially
04:29:13 <strcat[m]> I need help with Pixel 4 support
04:29:18 <strcat[m]> and Pixel 3 support
04:29:22 <strcat[m]> and 3a
04:29:24 <strcat[m]> and 2
04:29:49 <strcat[m]> I need help with a LOT of things
04:29:54 <strcat[m]> focus is on maintenance and fixing issues right now - I'm unlikely to merge new features atm
04:29:54 <strcat[m]> we have a lot of work to do
04:31:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "I need help with Pixel 4 support"> Well on it
04:31:30 <renlord> anupritaisno1[m]: you has pixel4 phone?
04:31:32 <strcat[m]> you don't have the device tho
04:32:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord "anupritaisno1: you has pixel4 ph"> Nah quite the issue there
04:32:09 <renlord> strcat[m]: maybe you want to use the projects github feature to sort the issue tracker
04:32:21 <renlord> so people know what's priority and what's not
04:32:24 <strcat[m]> just adds more work
04:32:37 <strcat[m]> I don't want to waste more time on that kind of thing
04:32:49 <strcat[m]> there is no shortage of work to do
04:33:00 <strcat[m]> feature work should mostly be done in standalone projects
04:33:01 <strcat[m]> atm
04:33:20 <strcat[m]> if people want to work on the OS itself they should work on fixing / working around the issues we need to deal with
04:33:24 <strcat[m]> and helping with device support and maintenance
04:36:16 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. Argh.
04:47:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/34
04:47:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> What's the problem here exactly?
04:48:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or why can't it just be disabled?
04:50:51 <strcat[m]> I don't know if there's even a compiler option to do it right now
04:50:55 <strcat[m]> I haven't done research into it
04:50:58 <strcat[m]> it's a very, very low priority though
04:52:36 <renlord> we can just do this now `  PRODUCT_DISABLE_SCUDO := true` ?
04:52:45 <renlord> since graphene os is only supporting 64bit
04:52:45 <strcat[m]> renlord: we don't want to disable it
04:52:55 <strcat[m]> renlord: there are 32-bit processes
04:52:57 <strcat[m]> we want it used there
04:53:05 <strcat[m]> we want to disable it in 64-bit processes only
04:56:23 <renlord> how to tell if its a 32bit/64bit process?
04:56:30 <radixed9[m]> Scudo is the safer malloc Android is trying to use right?
04:56:52 <strcat[m]> yes but safer is relative to jemalloc
04:56:58 <strcat[m]> it is not particularly hardened in the hardened_malloc sense
04:57:01 <strcat[m]> it still has inline metadata, etc.
04:57:12 <strcat[m]> with weak protection
04:58:10 <radixed9[m]> Right, they would never go for the performance hit
04:58:27 <radixed9[m]> Better than nothing
04:58:32 <strcat[m]> they aren't using scudo globally at all
04:58:33 <strcat[m]> either
04:58:37 <strcat[m]> only in certain processes
04:58:40 <renlord> er, a bit confused here, why do we set LOCAL_MULTILIB for vanadium to both?
04:58:45 <renlord> instead of just 64bit exclusively?
04:58:57 <strcat[m]> renlord: what do you mean
04:59:03 <radixed9[m]> strcat: that's the goal long term right? I haven't followed it closely
04:59:20 <strcat[m]> it probably doesn't need to be set for TrichromeChrome
04:59:23 <strcat[m]> if that's what you mean
04:59:23 <renlord> module definition in android.mk
04:59:30 <strcat[m]> it's needed for Library and WebView because apps use the WebView
04:59:31 <strcat[m]> that are 32-bit
04:59:51 <renlord> ok understood.
05:00:32 <strcat[m]> renlord: changed it
05:00:36 <strcat[m]> will see if it breaks later
05:01:04 <renlord> there's a good number of other ones i think can be changed to just 64 also like auditor, pdfviewer?
05:01:38 <renlord> and i guess using this FLAG to decide if scudo should be disabled should be sufficient?
05:02:20 <strcat[m]> renlord: I don't think it's a problem right now
05:02:28 <strcat[m]> because scudo is only used for a couple processes in Android 10
05:02:38 <strcat[m]> and they are 32-bit iirc
05:02:39 <strcat[m]> but it will become a problem in Android 11
05:02:42 <strcat[m]> we'll need to make sure it's disabled globally on 64-bit
05:02:53 <renlord> strcat[m]: im just going thru the issues with 'past-feature' labels atm
05:02:58 <generateduser392> suggestions for voice recorder & adblocker for grapheneos?
05:03:09 <strcat[m]> generateduser392: see the FAQ section on ad-blocking
05:03:27 <strcat[m]> recommendation is to avoid using a VPN service based ad-blocker
05:03:30 <radixed9[m]> generateduser392: audio recorder on F-Droid & FAQ
05:03:48 <strcat[m]> use Private DNS with something like adguard DNS if you want system wide ad-blocking
05:04:27 <radixed9[m]> dns.adguard.com here went down once in the ages I used it
05:06:06 <generateduser392> <radixed9[m] "dns.adguard.com here went down o"> is list already pre-configured? am I able to add to it?
05:06:27 <radixed9[m]> generateduser392: sounds like you are looking for NextDNS
05:07:04 <radixed9[m]> I wouldn't count on blocklists much for privacy. I use Vanadium and don't worry too much
05:07:16 <strcat[m]> it reduces real privacy
05:07:27 <strcat[m]> apps and services can detect ad-blocking is in use and can detect what is being blocked
05:07:35 <strcat[m]> every custom change can be detected
05:07:42 <strcat[m]> apps can detect your dns service
05:07:43 <radixed9[m]> <strcat[m] "it reduces *real* privacy"> *it feels better though!* /s
05:07:56 <strcat[m]> if you use a VPN + VPN standard DNS service, that's less unique than using VPN + custom DNS service
05:08:08 <generateduser392> so just put adguard dns & block rest in browser?
05:08:18 <strcat[m]> generateduser392: yes that's a good approach
05:08:19 <radixed9[m]> generateduser392: I would recommend using Vanadium
05:08:22 <renlord> strcat[m]: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/67
05:08:31 <renlord> have to port sepolicies?
05:08:44 <strcat[m]> renlord: have to disable a bunch of code
05:08:47 <strcat[m]> not really worth doing atm
05:08:49 <strcat[m]> just marked it low priority
05:10:24 <radixed9[m]> I hate Android Studio
05:10:36 <renlord> radixed9[m]: lol, same.
05:10:53 <generateduser392> will private dns be used for all wifi? or will have to apply every time?
05:11:02 <radixed9[m]> generateduser392: all wifi connections
05:11:05 <renlord> i wish there was a nice vim plugin that works with the aosp tree
05:11:06 <strcat[m]> generateduser392: it is not specific to a network
05:11:15 <strcat[m]> it's used for all networking, not just Wi-Fi
05:11:18 <radixed9[m]> even all profiles iirc
05:11:21 <renlord> but the build system is so unique with aosp
05:11:44 <generateduser392> there's profile support on graphene?
05:12:00 <radixed9[m]> generateduser392: it is AOSP nothing is really removed
05:12:04 <strcat[m]> generateduser392: I strongly recommend reading the FAQ and posts elsewhere
05:12:12 <radixed9[m]>  * generateduser392: it is AOSP with hardening nothing is really removed
05:13:03 <generateduser392> <strcat[m] "generateduser392: I strongly rec"> sorry, new to graphene. previously used unofficial lineage where not much info given
05:14:04 <cyredanthem[m]> The documentation for the project is solid
05:15:04 <cyredanthem[m]> You can find anything you need between the website, GitHub issues, or Daniel's Reddit comments
05:16:37 <generateduser392> the profile I used to use in lineage was turning on/off wifi/cellular/location... when something else happens
05:16:42 <generateduser392> kind of like automation
05:16:58 <generateduser392> does graphene have something like this?
05:17:25 <generateduser392> it seems like FAQ's profile is different temp accounts
05:17:39 <generateduser392> same name but different purpose?
05:17:54 <renlord> they are not temp accounts, they are persistent profiles
05:18:00 <renlord> like user accounts on desktop.
05:18:10 <renlord> but with significantly more isolation
05:18:26 <strcat[m]> generateduser392: you're talking about some LineageOS feature which may or may not exist anymore in the same form
05:18:53 <generateduser392> <strcat[m] "generateduser392: you're talking"> seems like it, same name but totally different purpose
05:18:59 <strcat[m]> generateduser392: GrapheneOS is AOSP with privacy and security hardening + some extra things like Seedvault to fill in gaps from not having Play Services
05:19:09 <strcat[m]> generateduser392: GrapheneOS doesn't add assorted frills and features
05:19:20 <strcat[m]> it is not aimed at power users who want more configuration than AOSP, that's not the purpose of GrapheneOS
05:19:35 <strcat[m]> user profiles are a standard AOSP feature
05:19:45 <strcat[m]> generateduser392: I'd really recommend just reading the documentation and trying it
05:20:03 <generateduser392> <strcat[m] "generateduser392: I'd really rec"> will do
05:38:15 <strcat[m]> I added some notes on fingerprinting to the DNS and ad-blocking sections
05:42:05 <TheJollyRoger> Oh shoot. That means... uh...
05:42:12 <TheJollyRoger> I need to rebase. One moment.
05:56:32 <strcat[m]> expanded https://grapheneos.org/contact to try to cut down on the emails I get
06:00:46 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: left a review on the one you just updated explaining why I haven't merged yet
06:01:49 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops!
06:02:22 <cyredanthem[m]> You don't want to advertise my privacy screens powered by Bluetooth??
06:02:45 * TheJollyRoger goes to hurry.
06:03:19 <strcat[m]> renlord: leaving TriChromeChrome as multilib for now
06:03:27 <strcat[m]> renlord: cause it gets built that way
06:03:32 <strcat[m]> in theory it doesn't have to be but it is still
06:03:36 <strcat[m]> it's not a big deal
06:03:39 <strcat[m]> it does run only as 64-bit
06:03:56 <strcat[m]> it's cause the standard one is 32-bit mostly
06:04:22 <strcat[m]> and we use the pure 64-bit build instead (with only support for 32-bit apps using the WebView)
06:04:41 <strcat[m]> anyways they mark all 3 apks as multilib still
06:04:46 <strcat[m]> not just library + webview
06:04:52 <strcat[m]> I don't think it matters at all, makes no difference
06:05:02 <strcat[m]> there is no library in the browser one anyway
06:05:43 <strcat[m]>        0  Stored        0   0% 1980-00-00 00:00 00000000  lib/armeabi-v7a/libdummy.so
06:05:43 <strcat[m]>        0  Stored        0   0% 1980-00-00 00:00 00000000  lib/armeabi-v7a/libplaceholder.so
06:05:51 <cyredanthem[m]> I can't think of any power user project that has good security.
06:11:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: so I think the main thing left to be done is landing the kernel_google_coral changes
06:11:46 <strcat[m]> and the changes for qcacld
06:11:59 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: including setting up submodules - most should be usable as is from AOSP
06:12:02 <strcat[m]> similar to my setup for crosshatch
06:15:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Coral? Huh
06:15:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it probably has a lot of broken stuff so it can't actually be released - but once the kernel changes are all landed it can be built
06:15:46 <strcat[m]> and maybe it boots
06:19:28 <dazinism> generateduser392:  for info on user profiles https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
06:19:57 <dazinism> Also this may be helpful https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Home
06:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> cyredanthem[m]: I'm inclined to agree.
06:20:47 * TheJollyRoger points his finger and thumb at his foot, and shouts "clickety-click, BOOM!"
06:21:03 <cyredanthem[m]> TheJollyRoger: Windows 10 maybe?
06:21:16 <cyredanthem[m]> But security is debatable
06:21:53 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. I didn't ever get the impression that Windows 10 was ever aimed specifically towards power users...?
06:22:33 <cyredanthem[m]> I mean it does little to fight back and it has a lot of cool features built
06:24:02 <TheJollyRoger> I have to admit, I am very interested with the sandboxing/isolation features they've been touting.
06:24:47 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm on a Mac. Windows is for power users
06:25:00 <dazinism> lol
06:25:04 <cyredanthem[m]> Sure they don't have an open source kernel they could change if they want and they can't use Unixy things
06:25:09 <cyredanthem[m]> However Windows people are better people
06:25:31 <cyredanthem[m]> They are the salt of the earth as are the salt of the eyes
06:26:24 <dazinism> poor = power?
06:26:42 <cyredanthem[m]> No we're the poor ones
06:26:55 <cyredanthem[m]> We need to buy expensive stuff
06:27:45 <dazinism> lol
06:27:51 <TheJollyRoger> XD
06:31:06 <radixed9[m]> Any good security research to read? I am tired of coding
06:36:15 <strcat[m]> we also need to add Auditor support for the Pixel 4 and 4 XL
06:36:19 <strcat[m]> which may involve more changes than usual
06:36:30 <strcat[m]> along with the massive backlog of samples
06:36:40 <strcat[m]> that are not being handled because Auditor / AttestationServer lack a maintainer
06:36:47 <strcat[m]> so new devices haven't been added for months
06:36:53 <strcat[m]> despite samples being submitted
06:37:07 <dazinism> wonderfall: can disable the RiotX 'listening for events notification'. Android settings> apps & notifications
06:37:23 <strcat[m]> I will have to discontinue support for other devices in Auditor if it doesn't get a maintainer
06:37:51 <radixed9[m]> I am working on the updater for system apps. After I finish that I can take a look at Auditor.
06:38:14 <strcat[m]> radixed9: note you should add signing support to Updater for the channel metadata
06:38:16 <strcat[m]> via signify or something
06:38:22 <strcat[m]> ideally do it via inline signature
06:38:28 <strcat[m]> and then that can be reused
06:38:34 <strcat[m]> for metadata listing apps
06:38:57 <strcat[m]> atm Updater doesn't sign / verify channel metadata, just update metadata
06:39:08 <strcat[m]> so the signature doesn't cover the concept of stable vs. beta
06:39:10 <strcat[m]> yet
06:39:29 <radixed9[m]> I saw that issue I was going to ask you if I should do that first
06:39:42 <strcat[m]> radixed9: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/commit/b51bf7a3c16b34539cce8b2792fbc8b89c05a89d
06:39:45 <strcat[m]> I added this recently
06:40:03 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/script/commit/af1073b4bb84444a3aebcd6ab444998fd1d0d7fa
06:40:13 <strcat[m]> radixed9: it just needs a signify signature now to sign / verify the channel
06:40:29 <strcat[m]> the way I designed the metadata, new fields and new lines can be added
06:40:40 <strcat[m]> so it should be possible to add an inline signify signature to the file
06:41:10 <strcat[m]> and that should be pretty easy to verify via standard android crypto libs
06:41:25 <radixed9[m]> I am incredibly slow as this is my first open source project. Though I will work on this
06:42:47 <radixed9[m]> Signify with standard android crypto libraries. On it!
06:42:51 <aeonsolution[m]> radixed9 we're here to help each other out; it'd be great to have you onboard!
06:45:18 <radixed9[m]> aeonsolution: thank you. I have been studying the Updater app for a few days and playing around with the code. It is so well designed it seems like the perfect place to be right now
06:48:42 <radixed9[m]> I am a university student studying cyber ops. Fortunately that is still fun
06:50:14 <dazinism> radixed9: nice to have you poking around
06:50:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
06:50:44 <strcat[m]> also streaming support should be easy to add to Updater
06:51:03 <strcat[m]> can see I already did most
06:51:07 <strcat[m]> streaming_test part
06:51:19 <strcat[m]> all it needs is another streaming_test check for the initial zip download
06:51:23 <strcat[m]> to make it download a metadata-only zip
06:51:30 <strcat[m]> and then the release scripts need to generate that
06:51:53 <radixed9[m]> You would like that before system app updating?
06:51:56 <radixed9[m]> or after
06:51:59 <strcat[m]> after
06:52:01 <strcat[m]> it's low prio
06:52:07 <strcat[m]> or at the same time if you want something else to work on
06:52:17 * TheJollyRoger dusts off his hands.
06:53:48 <radixed9[m]> Thanks. I have signing support for channels first(which is currently the only issue with a hostile update server). Add system app updating(but lay the ground work by adding signed metadata so it can be expanded to extra apps). Then add streaming support(almost done already)
06:54:14 <strcat[m]> yeah system app updating in a different app tho
06:54:19 <strcat[m]> copy this app and change it
06:54:31 <radixed9[m]> Yep! I have that in my full notes
06:54:50 <radixed9[m]> After that all I should look into Auditor since that needs work?
06:55:15 <strcat[m]> yes although the app update / install system app will need ongoing work
06:55:45 <radixed9[m]> That is completely understood
06:56:11 <TheJollyRoger> Hey strcat, is it a good moment to PMesg you? If you're too busy, that's OK.
06:56:28 <TheJollyRoger> Since this is really low-priority.
06:58:07 <radixed9[m]> I have the 2 commits you just sent saved and the issues for all of these topics. Anything else I should have?(I copied the rest of your related messages)
06:58:31 <skratchnsniff[m]> I was here a few days ago with the weird multiuser profile issue. I reset my phone and the issue be gone now. No idea what I did to cause the issue. But as my other phones did not have the issue I put it down to noober error.
06:58:52 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, that be a relief!
07:00:53 <strcat[m]> radixed9: once the channel metadata is signed and we support streaming updates
07:01:06 <strcat[m]> we could eventually do away with the update zips completely
07:01:07 <strcat[m]> and just put the payload metadata into the channel metadata file
07:02:58 <strcat[m]> basically with streaming support
07:03:07 <strcat[m]> we'll have 2 kinds of update zips
07:03:14 <strcat[m]> one with payload.bin (the normal kind used now)
07:03:16 <strcat[m]> and one without
07:03:40 <strcat[m]> so instead of downloading the normal one, it downloads the one without payload.bin (new kind) and then passes the info about payload.bin to update_engine directly
07:03:49 <strcat[m]> and that downloads it directly to the alternate partition set
07:04:09 <strcat[m]> and then it verifies it itself before marking it ready
07:04:37 <strcat[m]> the only advantage of the current system is the double layer of signature verification (once by Updater, once by update_engine)
07:05:00 <strcat[m]> but it's unnecessary
07:05:02 <strcat[m]> anyways
07:05:11 <strcat[m]> once it's doing that for streaming updates
07:05:21 <strcat[m]> the new format of update zip is just some plain text metadata in a signed zip
07:05:37 <strcat[m]> so it could just be moved to the channel metadata file and do away with the update zips completely except for sideloading to recovery
07:05:39 <strcat[m]> shrug
07:06:37 <radixed9[m]> That is brilliant. You tell me what is most important and I will work on it. Whatever I can save you time on that's ideal. I know it takes a lot of work to rebuild the whole OS for every Vanadium release. Auditor and Updater both intrigue me. I am just here to learn and help a project that positively effected me. Your reddit post inspired me to just dive in

07:07:55 <TheJollyRoger> radixed9[m]: Auditor's REALLY cool, it seems each time it comes up, I learn more about the kinds of things it can do, the attestation's a fantastic technology.
07:08:39 <skratchnsniff[m]> <skratchnsniff[m] "I was here a few days ago with t"> (My name changed coz I forgot my riot password when I reset).
07:08:51 <TheJollyRoger> Aargh. >_<.
07:10:52 <radixed9[m]> TheJollyRoger: Awesome name man, do you use remote attestation? I haven't tried it yet
07:12:26 <skratchnsniff[m]> Will the Auditor give me an error message if I broke something?
07:13:03 <radixed9[m]> skratchnsniff: I would recommend reading the website it goes into great detail
07:13:14 <radixed9[m]> https://attestation.app/
07:13:18 <skratchnsniff[m]> I used it and the screen is kinda red but says Successfully performed basic initial verification and pairing.
07:13:21 <skratchnsniff[m]> Ok
07:14:32 <radixed9[m]> It isn't what you are talking about if I understand what you meant
07:17:43 <TheJollyRoger> Hey radixed9[m]! Yes! I do use Remote Attestation! I use the Attestation Server!
07:18:13 <TheJollyRoger> skratchnsniff[m]:  the first time, it will give you a "yellow" screen because the pairing is trust-upon-first-use.
07:18:21 <TheJollyRoger> Try it a second time and see what you get.
07:18:45 <TheJollyRoger> (Make sure the clock on both devices is correct, if there is a significant amount of clock skew you will get a red screen)
07:19:22 * radixed9[m] makes joke about time zones 
07:19:30 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
07:28:09 <skratchnsniff[m]> OK, nice and greeny blue now.
07:29:24 <radixed9[m]> Artem from APKMirror was very helpful. I asked him for that Janus POC and he got right back to me. In case anyone missed it from the previous discussions. Janus does NOT effect patched versions of Android(so GrapheneOS) and that I know of there is no reason(I have found yet) to deprecate v1 signing.
07:31:00 <strcat[m]> radixed9: v1 signing is substantially less hardened - it doesn't verify the whole zip, that's the issue with it
07:31:15 <strcat[m]> v2 was made to avoid vulnerabilities like that in the future
07:31:16 <strcat[m]> v1 is less secure
07:31:29 <strcat[m]> v3 is just v2 with support for rotating keys - otherwise the same as v2
07:31:43 <radixed9[m]> Right, but deprecating it now would likely do more harm than good
07:32:53 <strcat[m]> yeah but it'd be fine to warn
07:33:15 <radixed9[m]> I agree. Is there an issue for that?
07:34:41 <radixed9[m]> F-Droid is the only common source using v1 if I recall correctly
07:41:00 <strcat[m]> yes everyone else has long since moved on to v2
07:41:06 <strcat[m]> unless they are using some ancient SDK...
07:41:32 <radixed9[m]> ☹︎
07:41:37 <strcat[m]> radixed9: btw I think I essentially finished streaming support in Updater other than not having a preference for it now
07:41:46 <strcat[m]> radixed9: but what's missing is scripting to generate zips for it
07:42:04 <strcat[m]> radixed9: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/commit/f2d1e917f8405fb5cd6249d0d81d1be5cc9e6fba
07:42:05 <dazinism> Apparently its planned to move Fdroid repo build server to support v2 v3 and work is underway
07:42:12 <strcat[m]> but it's basically done in Updater as much as it can be for now, I think
07:42:14 <strcat[m]> assuming this builds
07:42:51 <strcat[m]> radixed9: so it'll use zips like `sargo-streaming-ota_update-BUILD_NUMBER.zip`
07:43:02 <strcat[m]> instead of `sargo-ota-update-BUILD_NUMBER.zip`
07:43:06 <strcat[m]> and same for delta updates
07:43:28 <strcat[m]> radixed9: just need the scripting to generate them as part of release.sh
07:43:41 <strcat[m]> basically, it needs to be the same zip, with the same metadata, etc. and signature
07:43:44 <strcat[m]> just without `payload.bin`
07:43:58 <strcat[m]> ah wait this is not quite right
07:43:59 <strcat[m]> sec
07:46:52 <strcat[m]> radixed9: needs a bit more work...
07:50:00 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/commit/7ea90c582eec857acc216d76633deb16f7745d5b
07:50:01 <strcat[m]> there
07:50:05 <strcat[m]> gonna try that
07:50:45 <strcat[m]> still needs another tiny change
07:51:18 <radixed9[m]> Just to clarify(for my GrapheneOS notes). Streaming updates is at the bottom of the Updater work, but still above the Auditor work?
07:51:55 <strcat[m]> streaming is a lower priority than most things
07:51:57 <strcat[m]> it should be easy to do tho
07:52:04 <strcat[m]> it's lower priority than most of Auditor
07:52:23 <radixed9[m]> I will keep it around as a side project in case I get burned out
07:52:44 <radixed9[m]> okay reordering my notes and adding the new stuff thanks

07:53:34 <strcat[m]> this is going to hit the 100MB hard limit in the near future
07:53:37 <strcat[m]> and then I'll be super annoyed
07:53:45 <strcat[m]> for a while I hosted it on bitbucket which is stupid
07:54:20 <strcat[m]> github doesn't like being used for storage of large files
07:54:40 <strcat[m]> git is fine for this with the caveat that it can't meaningfully diff them - but it's fine for archiving stuff when you want to keep all versions forever
07:54:51 <strcat[m]> also github gets mad about branch size and overall repo size and I need to trim it
07:55:31 <strcat[m]> also github gets mad about overall repo size, and I have to trim it occasionally... starting the history over again, losing older tags
07:55:33 <strcat[m]> really annoying
07:57:01 <radixed9[m]> There's still nothing better though...
07:58:09 <strcat[m]> yeah it just doesn't mix well with how Android distributes prebuilts
07:58:27 <strcat[m]> I think the best approach to repo size issue is to just archive the old repo by moving it
07:58:29 <strcat[m]> and make a new fresh one
07:58:45 <strcat[m]> instead of what I was doing before (deleting all the tags, etc.)
07:59:21 <renor> > also github gets mad about overall repo size, and I have to trim it occasionally... starting the history over again, losing older tags
07:59:21 <renor> > really annoying
07:59:21 <renor> What about self-hosted git manager like gitea/gitlab?
07:59:42 <strcat[m]> way too much work to host
07:59:44 <strcat[m]> and they are really buggy / bad
07:59:59 <strcat[m]> and it will reduce contributions substantially and we already barely get support
08:00:05 <dazinism> <radixed9[m] "https://bgr.com/2020/06/04/andro"> Think thats a terrible write up. Looks like it will restart an app (eg. Fdroid) when you first allow it to be used for installing unknown apps
08:00:25 <strcat[m]> dazinism: it also doesn't imply losing state
08:00:28 <strcat[m]> only if the app is broken
08:00:52 <dazinism> After that everything is same as before
08:01:25 <radixed9[m]> dazinism: I tend to auto filter articles. They don't sound so bad in my head
08:02:36 <dazinism> The article kind of gives the impression things will go wrong every time you install an app, not via Play
08:02:55 <radixed9[m]> In general news is a terrible source for security and privacy. I doubted I could have found a better article
08:04:41 <dazinism> Think I half caught someone on social media yesterday complaining about Android 11 messing with app installs not from Play.
08:05:03 <strcat[m]> the changes with this stuff are really good
08:05:06 <strcat[m]> and we certainly want them
08:05:12 <strcat[m]> there is no downside for us
08:05:16 <paintedman[m]> Could anyone tell me where I can download CalyxOS? I want to test WiFi on Pixel 4 XL, but all links on https://calyxos.org/get are dead
08:05:22 <strcat[m]> they are just misunderstanding what is going on and blaming the OS
08:05:44 <dazinism> Imagine it was somewhat mistaken outrage fed by this article or similar
08:06:02 <radixed9[m]> <strcat[m] "and it will reduce contributions"> The reason I didn't start working on anything for the project sooner is I worried that I would be wasting time since I am not a professional and this is a very serious project. It wasn't until I read that big comment you wrote on Reddit that I decided to try it. I do think this is a very valid concern
08:06:57 <dazinism> paintedman: think https://release.calyxinstitute.org/flame-factory-2020.05.26.20.zip works?
08:07:11 <radixed9[m]> paintedman: try their irc let me grab a link
08:07:48 <radixed9[m]> paintedman: there is someone looking for GrapheneOS testers with Pixel 4 fyi
08:08:17 <dazinism> Or is XL coral, I forget... hopefully can just edit that URL
08:10:00 <radixed9[m]> dazinism: XL is coral
08:13:43 <Break> Good morning :)
08:15:38 <paintedman[m]> dazinism: no, 404
08:15:52 <dazinism> paintedman: actually thats the same link as on their /get page & doesnt work. Pretty sure it did. Must be something broken,  somebody has already reported on their issue tracker
08:16:26 <paintedman[m]> ok, I'll try later, thank you
08:35:52 <jalb66> Is it posible to reduce the permissions in Vanadium?. I suppose that it could increase privacy in it. Now it has a lot of permissions working even if I only allow Network permission as I see with the F-droid app apps_Packages Info
08:42:33 <radixed9[m]> jalb66: Fingeprinting wise it appears you can't use sensors for fingerprinting with the default configuration on Vanadium. It stands to reason the fingerprint won't change with sensors off. The only advantage being with a full browser compromise they wouldn't be able to attempt a gyrophone
08:54:51 <jalb66> radixed9[m], yes, but there are a lot of permissions active: 29
08:55:39 <jalb66> Even Bromite has less permissions. For example, in Privacy browser I only see 5
08:55:57 <jalb66> I see it also happens with Stock apps mostly
08:56:18 <jalb66> IDN if this can be a risk to our privacy or not, just asking...
08:56:30 <radixed9[m]> <jalb66 "Even Bromite has less permission"> It is powered by Vanadium
08:56:36 <jalb66> I know
08:56:51 <radixed9[m]> It is not those are minor permissions
08:56:54 <strcat[m]> jalb66: you're just confusing yourself looking at non-user-facing permissions
08:57:17 <strcat[m]> jalb66: only the ones that are user facing with toggles are actual permissions part of the actual permission model
08:57:30 <radixed9[m]> it could ONLY matter in compromise(which is vastly harder to full compromise Vanadium than ANY other browser)
08:57:31 <strcat[m]> jalb66: just stop confusing yourself
08:57:37 <strcat[m]> there's a reason the normal UI doesn't show those
08:57:41 <strcat[m]> they don't do what you think
08:57:43 <strcat[m]> they are for developers
08:57:46 <radixed9[m]> Vanadium in a permissions sense is the most private
08:58:11 <jalb66> strcat[m], thanks!!
08:58:28 <jalb66> It's good to resolve these doubts 🙂
09:23:30 <jalb66> radixed9[m], thanks!
11:08:10 <joshman[m]> Guys. It drives me nuts. Somehow while on the phone I pull drop-down menu 9 out of 10 and make all the messy things with my ear like switching airplane mode on and off, turning BT on and off. Anyone experience that ?

11:35:51 <furofuro_01[m]> <dazinism "paintedman: think https://releas"> Guess there is a possibility for quick release Pixel 4a Calyx/Graphene OS soon (after it is released ofc)
11:43:20 <cn3m[m]> furofuro_01: 4a support is much easier once 4 support is out
11:43:25 <cn3m[m]> The other factor is that the Pixel 4 sucked and was very expensive
11:44:14 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "The other factor is that the Pix"> Yeah lol
11:44:18 <furofuro_01[m]> Hoping it is indeed $349
11:44:38 <VincentWantsToBa> cn3m: Security wise?
11:44:57 <cn3m[m]> That made building support for it unappealing. The 4a won't have that issue, it will be easy and appealing comparatively
11:45:07 <cn3m[m]> <furofuro_01[m] "Hoping it is indeed $349"> And 128GB
11:45:21 <cn3m[m]> <VincentWantsToBa "cn3m: Security wise?"> No the 4 is better than all other pixels security wise
11:45:25 <cn3m[m]> It just sucks as a phone
11:45:59 <cn3m[m]> Not worth the price of the upgrade over a 3 imi
11:46:10 <furofuro_01[m]> It is rumored though that it will have 3 code-name model?
11:46:16 <furofuro_01[m]> Pixel 4a?
11:46:17 <cn3m[m]> The gestures system is broken and the biometrics were a total security joke until a recent patch
11:46:19 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4 was a failure
11:48:22 <cn3m[m]> That's the 2 Pixel 5s and the 4a
11:48:36 <cn3m[m]> I'm 90% sure
11:48:39 <furofuro_01[m]> "The Camera version 7.3 code suggests there will be not two but three different models of Pixel 4a. They are code-named: Sunfish, redfin, and bramble."

19:51:54 <stuux[m]> When trying to run fasboot flashall -w for flashing my user_debug build on my pixel 3a I am getting the following error:
19:51:58 <stuux[m]> https://privatebin.net/?260f462fbf685094#7mQq8J3NJ1YctuA67A7E1rYqAB69ZEwPzYFwL1B92wxn
19:52:23 <stuux[m]> Has anyone an idea what to do about it?
20:03:05 <TheJollyRoger> stuux[m]: can you do me a quick sanity check and check your fastboot version...?
20:03:36 <strcat[m]> stuux: you haven't flashed the up-to-date firmware first
20:03:39 <strcat[m]> that's the issue
20:03:40 <cdesai> it looks like you're building an old version
20:03:47 <strcat[m]> Checking 'version-bootloader'                      FAILED
20:03:47 <strcat[m]> Device version-bootloader is 'b4s4-0.2-6355063'.
20:03:47 <strcat[m]> Update requires 'b4s4-0.2-6066691'.
20:03:58 <strcat[m]> cdesai: ah yeah guess that's it
20:04:00 <cdesai> the requires is older than device, and device has june update
20:04:02 <TheJollyRoger> AH!
20:04:30 <strcat[m]> stuux: if you really do want to install an old version you need to flash the firmware first
20:04:30 <stuux[m]> so i need to build again with the new version?
20:05:00 <strcat[m]> stuux: you should regardless but if you want to install the old version you need to flash the old firmware which requires that they haven't increased the rollback index for it
20:05:31 <stuux[m]> ok, how do i install the old firmware?
20:06:22 <generateduser392> is .SeedVaultAndroidBackup the folder that contains files from system backup?
20:07:42 <stuux[m]> > ok, how do i install the old firmware?
20:07:42 <stuux[m]> found it, thanks for the replies
20:11:16 <overheadscallop[> <generateduser392 "is .SeedVaultAndroidBackup the f"> yes, it should be encrypted
20:11:43 <overheadscallop[> not all apps are backed up though, seedvault respects apps which disable backups
20:12:09 <overheadscallop[> *the contents of `.SeedVaultAndroidBackup` should be encrypted
20:12:18 <generateduser392> I was thinking of having copy on phone and copy on desktop using syncthing
20:13:29 <overheadscallop[> I think there's a warning about local backups when you first set it up, but there shouldn't be any problems
20:14:09 <generateduser392> recommend having local backup?
20:14:32 <overheadscallop[> no it's just a generic one about how you have no redundancy with only a local backup
20:14:40 <generateduser392> oh
20:14:45 <overheadscallop[> if you plan to use syncthing to transfer to other nodes there shouldn't be a problem
20:14:50 <generateduser392> ok
20:15:00 <overheadscallop[> I haven't tried restoring from a  local backup before though
20:15:06 <overheadscallop[> might want to test it
20:15:51 <generateduser392> is there a site to read more about it?
20:16:23 <generateduser392> found this one https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android
20:16:56 <generateduser392> but doesn't say how to restore entire backup
20:17:17 <overheadscallop[> I think the calyx project page and the github are pretty much the only documentation right now
20:17:43 <generateduser392> both don't offer much info about restoring
20:17:57 <generateduser392> other than auto restore when install app
20:20:10 <generateduser392> can I delete local copy once transferred to computer?
20:21:31 <overheadscallop[> probably, I don't really know much about what changes between backups since I use nextcloud as the storage
20:22:03 <generateduser392> how is your setup?
20:22:28 <generateduser392> which option you chose for backup? local or usb?
20:22:59 <overheadscallop[> if you have nextcloud app with a logged in account, you can pick nextcloud as the backup location
20:23:18 <overheadscallop[> seedvault then syncs the backups to the nextcloud server storage
20:23:51 <overheadscallop[> haven't tried the local or usb methods
20:31:48 <TheJollyRoger> I use USB. I've got a Corsair Survivor USB drive which comes in its own nice, neat little screw-top case.
20:33:30 <generateduser392> <TheJollyRoger "I use USB. I've got a Corsair Su"> do you copy files onto computer afterwards?
20:33:30 <generateduser392> which format do you use for USB?
20:35:46 <TheJollyRoger> Hi generateduser392, I just use the default format; unfortunately it's FAT32, so the USB drive represents a short-term storage, before I copy it to the rest of my backups.
20:36:37 <TheJollyRoger> Since I have a nasty tendency to lose USB drives since they're so small.
20:37:06 <generateduser392> Do you check Automatic Restore option?
20:37:58 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think so, last time I had to use it I just plugged it in and it worked at the launcher.
20:38:30 <generateduser392> does it display prompt?
20:39:01 <TheJollyRoger> You should be able to just plug it in and it'll ask you when you first come off a factory reset.
20:39:14 <TheJollyRoger> And you see the welcome to GrapheneOS screen.
20:40:53 <generateduser392> do you have to reselect backup location the next time you back up via USB?
20:53:31 <TheJollyRoger> so far I haven't.
20:56:33 <generateduser392> alright, thanks
20:59:06 <radixed9[m]> Apple Music works great on GrapheneOS
21:12:57 <dazinism> Idea for an handy standalone app. Install it on two user profiles
21:12:58 <xabi[m]> <radixed9[m] "Has anyone seen/commented on thi"> He uses firefox
21:13:25 <dazinism> enables you to set up a connection (via network - data staying strictly on device) to enable transfer files between the 2 user profiles.
21:14:06 <dazinism> xabi: pinned the comment about using Vanadium and Firefox being an issue
21:14:57 <radixed9[m]> Fennec F-Droid is worse than Firefox.. It is worse
21:15:40 <radixed9[m]> dazinism: Firefox Send or Tresorit send could do this. Or do you mean local network? I don't think this is allowed between profiles
21:15:50 <radixed9[m]>  * dazinism: Firefox Send or Tresorit Send could do this. Or do you mean local network? I don't think this is allowed between profiles
21:23:35 <strcat[m]> help is needed with device support
21:23:49 <xabi[m]> Could syncthing be used between profiles?
21:23:49 <strcat[m]> this is the last month for landing support for this year's generation of devices
21:24:15 <strcat[m]> I made the repos but I'm not seeing action / pull requests / active work being done
21:24:25 <xabi[m]> I use my nextcloud to Switch files when i dont have a pendrive handy
21:25:36 <radixed9[m]> strcat: I have bonito, but I am not at that level yet.. I will try to move to maintence on sargo and bonito when I get more experience
21:25:48 <xabi[m]> <strcat[m] "help is needed with device suppo"> How can non skilled people help?
21:26:10 <strcat[m]> develop the skills to help
21:26:49 <xabi[m]> I could help with documentation/translations
21:27:06 <strcat[m]> we don't want to do translations
21:27:10 <radixed9[m]> <xabi[m] "I could help with documentation/"> neither are needed
21:27:27 <radixed9[m]> documentation requires too much verification
21:27:42 <strcat[m]> and unsure how people could help with documentation if they aren't developers
21:28:48 <analog[m]> strcat You don't necessarily have to be a developer to rewrite the existing documentation in another language.
21:28:59 <radixed9[m]> analog: You kinda do
21:29:00 <dallemon[m]> wasn't anupritaisno1 working on pixel 4 support for grapheneos?
21:29:07 <strcat[m]> analog: you would
21:29:19 <strcat[m]> analog: how can we trust random people that aren't experienced developers to do proper translations
21:29:23 <radixed9[m]> It needs to be accurate and up to the standards of the project
21:29:25 <strcat[m]> also who is going to review their work
21:29:30 <strcat[m]> we can't do translations atm
21:29:55 <analog[m]> strcat You're practically trusting someone random regardless of whether or not they are a developer.
21:29:57 <strcat[m]> translations != rote work involving going over stuff and changing words to another language
21:30:17 <strcat[m]> analog: no, we aren't, because we don't accept changes that aren't reviewed by us
21:30:22 <radixed9[m]> Someone can prove themselves as a developer
21:30:52 <analog[m]> <strcat[m] "analog: no, we aren't, because w"> And how would you review documentation written in a foreign language? Use a translator?
21:31:10 <wonderfall[m]> > Did you speak french
21:31:10 <wonderfall[m]> @ana
21:31:12 <strcat[m]> dallemon: anupritaisno1 doesn't have a Pixel 4, I'm not sure how he's going to be able to work productively on it
21:31:19 <wonderfall[m]> Did I?
21:31:24 <strcat[m]> dallemon: I can't really see that going anywhere
21:31:27 <wonderfall[m]>  * > Did you speak french
21:31:27 <wonderfall[m]> @analog
21:31:45 <strcat[m]> analog: we aren't accepting changes we can't review
21:31:54 <wonderfall[m]> (Oops, not yet used to Riot...)
21:32:06 <strcat[m]> analog: translations won't be accepted atm and we aren't asking for people to do them
21:32:18 <strcat[m]> it is not helping the project, we aren't asking for that
21:32:23 <analog[m]> <strcat[m] "analog: we aren't accepting chan"> Well exactly, so whether or not they have skills in development or not is irrelevant because it's random anyway. Unless you meant someone who actually started developing Graphene. It's ambigious.
21:32:35 <xabi[m]> Wouldnt losing the fingerprint sensor make the device less secure? It involves typing the password everytime screen is turned on or profile changed
21:32:42 <analog[m]> <strcat[m] "analog: translations won't be ac"> I'm not disagreeing with this for the record.
21:32:49 <strcat[m]> someone that's not a developer can't translate docs that are highly technical and require them to deeply understand it
21:32:51 <dallemon[m]> strcat: oh, i just saw a few people talking here and assumed he had a device
21:32:59 <strcat[m]> dallemon: nope he doesn't have a device
21:33:05 <strcat[m]> atm no one is actively working on it that I see
21:33:14 <strcat[m]> paintedman did some initial work but there is not progress happening
21:33:24 <strcat[m]> I don't see anyone actively working on it and this is the last month to add it
21:33:31 <strcat[m]> at the end of the month I'll repo the repos and it'll be off the table
21:33:44 <strcat[m]> and as I said multiple times we won't accept work on the Pixel 4a if the 4 and 4 XL are not added
21:33:45 <strcat[m]> so that is off the table pretty soon
21:33:56 <strcat[m]> we'll try again with the Pixel 5 it looks like
21:34:03 <strcat[m]> maybe people are interested in helping then
21:34:06 <strcat[m]> if not we won't add that either
21:34:07 <cn3m[m]> The problem is the Pixel 4 was a terrible expensive phone
21:34:13 <analog[m]> strcat They just require basic linguistics to rewrite the documentation from English to another language. It's not difficult to plagirize in a different language.
21:34:15 <strcat[m]> okay but it has to be added for the 4a to be added
21:34:21 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 5 shouldn't have either problem
21:34:32 <analog[m]>  * strcat They just require basic linguistics to rewrite the documentation from English to another language. It's not difficult to plagarize in a different language.
21:34:34 <strcat[m]> analog: no it is not basic linguistics to translate technical / security docs to another language ACCURATELY
21:34:45 <strcat[m]> in a way that properly communicates the original meaning
21:34:49 <cn3m[m]> <analog[m] "strcat They just require basic l"> You haven't seen the /r/Firefox rants about the documentation
21:34:51 <strcat[m]> and doesn't lose ANY of the subtle nuance
21:35:04 <cn3m[m]> Sarcasm ofc
21:35:23 <strcat[m]> also I'll disable translated docs once they are out-of-date, if we had any
21:35:26 <strcat[m]> and the docs are regularly improved
21:35:38 <strcat[m]> so doing that is making a commitment to working on it on a daily basis to keep up
21:35:41 <analog[m]> <strcat[m] "analog: no it is not basic lingu"> I agree with the fact that it requires some level of technical knowledge but they don't specifically have to be a developer is my point.
21:35:53 <strcat[m]> they do have to be a developer / security researcher
21:36:00 <strcat[m]> fluent in how the terms in those areas work in that language
21:36:08 <strcat[m]> someone that knows french cannot translate technical docs to french
21:36:31 <strcat[m]> they have to be fluent in how these things are done in that language
21:37:11 <xabi[m]> Most of the time translating the technical terms breaks the translation, because they make no sense in a different language
21:37:29 <strcat[m]> even just doing the wording for the english docs is hard
21:37:43 <xabi[m]> And using the foreign word sounds unnatural
21:37:48 <radixed9[m]> English makes most sense for the project
21:37:52 <radixed9[m]> for now
21:38:04 <paintedman[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): I'm here. So we need to work on coral-sepolicy, prepare 1:1 kernel and figure out what's the problem with wifi in android-prepare-vendor to get pixel 4 supported?
21:38:23 <strcat[m]> xabi: there are languages like french where they have terms for most things but doesn't mean it isn't very hard to translate it without losing stuff or changing meaning
21:38:31 <xabi[m]> I guess that most ppl can understand English to a certain level
21:38:37 <strcat[m]> there are many places where subtle wording is really important
21:38:50 <strcat[m]> a lot of it is technical documentation
21:38:53 <strcat[m]> or is giving privacy/security advice
21:38:59 <analog[m]> strcat Plagarizing won't guarantee fleuncy and albeit would be better if they did have such technical knowledge I still think plagarism would be mostly accurate but I could just be too anecdotal.
21:39:01 <strcat[m]> it is crucial to preserve the same nuance / details
21:39:22 <strcat[m]> analog: I would rather have people read the english documentation with a poor grasp of english than inaccurate docs in their native language
21:39:23 <xabi[m]> Makes sense, I agree
21:39:39 <strcat[m]> if people do translations it's unofficial, won't be up-to-date and will be recommended against
21:39:57 <xabi[m]> The coding part comes a bit late at my age
21:39:58 <strcat[m]> similar to people making install videos - are you going to remake the video each time there's a change?
21:40:05 <analog[m]> <strcat[m] "analog: I would rather have peop"> Yeah, we agree here.
21:40:15 <strcat[m]> and are you going to remake the video each time an issue is pointed out?
21:40:17 <strcat[m]> it just doesn't work
21:40:31 <radixed9[m]> <xabi[m] "The coding part comes a bit late"> No one is too old or too young to learn
21:40:54 <wonderfall[m]> In any case, if you're going to make some translation work, I would gladly to contribute (french here). But I definitely agree that people should be encouraged to read english documentation, as a matter of fact it's a great advice in general. The same goes for books: translation inherently alters the original message, and thus makes approximations, sometimes.

21:41:24 <TheJollyRoger> Aw crap! When I hit --fixup and renamed the commit it lost some of the comments.
21:41:28 <strcat[m]> and I'd rather just not do that right now
21:41:30 <strcat[m]> or in the near future
21:41:31 <TheJollyRoger> Shoot.
21:41:31 <analog[m]> <strcat[m] "similar to people making install"> This is a false equivalence because remaking videos to changeg something and changing documentation have completely different complexity.

21:41:44 <xabi[m]> <strcat[m] "similar to people making install"> Install videos don't make any sense, it s just typing 5 lines in CLI, the sh or bat script make it a 5 min process
21:42:02 <analog[m]> You have to re-render the video, rerecord certain parts as with documentation you can easily change one part of the page in a matter of minutes.
21:42:03 <TheJollyRoger> Oh whew. It saved it in conversation.
21:42:04 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
21:42:30 <xabi[m]> Graphene os is easier to install than any other custom ROM
21:42:53 <analog[m]> <xabi[m] "Install videos don't make any se"> Exactly.
21:43:21 <analog[m]> Editing the video and editing documentation are also pretty different because of the processes.
21:44:11 <analog[m]> It's a weak argument.
21:44:35 <xabi[m]> Unlock bootloader, sh the installer and relock, easy, fast and well explained in the website
21:46:20 <strcat[m]> analog: except that I regularly sit down and totally rewrite a section of the docs
21:46:53 <strcat[m]> so are they going to do the translation from scratch or just leave it a poor translation of the current docs due to only doing incremental edits
21:47:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: BTW are gapps okay on a hardened ROM
21:47:23 <analog[m]> strcat Good on you, there's no advocation for foreign copies of your documentation. But requiring to be a developer to plagarize the documentation in another language to an accurate degree is not a ncessity.
21:47:26 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: define what you mean
21:47:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> This guy messaged me and wanted me to add them so just curious
21:48:03 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: some of the GrapheneOS features are incompatible with Play Services or modify code that is provided by Play Services when using it
21:48:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah just a private build
21:48:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: also the only appropriate way to do it would be properly bundling it via the non-public code for integrating it into the source tree
21:48:23 <strcat[m]> that isn't available
21:48:29 <strcat[m]> how would you bundle it properly? you can't
21:48:44 <strcat[m]> there isn't a project that does it properlyt
21:48:48 <strcat[m]>  * there isn't a project that does it properly
21:48:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "how would you bundle it properly"> Dunno, also does that open security holes?
21:49:07 <strcat[m]> the proper way to do it would be using android-prepare-vendor and actually doing it properly
21:49:10 <strcat[m]> including all the resources
21:49:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Probably opengapps though
21:49:37 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't think that makes sense
21:49:43 <strcat[m]> why don't they just use stock
21:50:05 <strcat[m]> the hardening features, etc. are not developed within the constraints that would be there if we had to be compatible with Play Services
21:50:09 <strcat[m]> it will be broken
21:50:46 <strcat[m]> also what if all this effort was directed towards making the actual GrapheneOS project better
21:50:59 <strcat[m]> we can support non-Pixel devices that meet the requirements upstream if people are going to work on it
21:51:07 <strcat[m]> and people can work on filling in gaps from not having Play Services
21:52:29 <radixed9[m]> Android 11 Beta is intriguing as well. If you want gapps it might be worth trying that. GrapheneOS with GAPPS would be illegal and wouldn't be helpful or practical
21:52:53 <strcat[m]> the project needs a ton of help
21:52:58 <strcat[m]> a ton of things are being neglected / not maintained
21:53:13 <strcat[m]> Auditor doesn't even have support for the stock Pixel 4 or 4 XL
21:53:21 <strcat[m]> let alone all the other devices people submitted samples for
21:53:28 <strcat[m]> let alone GrapheneOS on those
21:53:36 <strcat[m]> how about people get to work and start helping with the project
21:53:50 <strcat[m]> no more daily emails asking me to do stuff or asking when things will happen
21:54:22 <analog[m]> <strcat[m] "how about people get to work and"> You need to be more persuasive. Excessively pleading for help doesn't seem to be an effective strategy, try it alongside passive marketing.
21:54:36 <radixed9[m]> analog: Give it a rest man
21:54:51 <TheJollyRoger> strcat, could I have the sample data? I still haven't figured out how to extract the certificates fully, but I want to try again.
21:55:22 <strcat[m]> yes but I don't have time to try walking you through it
21:55:31 <strcat[m]> tried before
21:55:39 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. I'll try again on my own.
21:55:49 <analog[m]> <radixed9[m] "analog: Give it a rest man  "> ?
21:56:32 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: adding the Pixel 4 and 4 XL may be quite involved
21:56:37 <strcat[m]> I think the attestation root may have changed
21:56:39 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Okay :(
21:56:41 <strcat[m]> the app is not designed to handle that
21:56:44 <strcat[m]> it requires substantial work on the code
21:57:05 <strcat[m]> if Auditor doesn't have a maintainer / developer at all, it can't continue
21:57:10 <strcat[m]> same goes for AttestationServer
21:57:16 <radixed9[m]> analog: Daniel says he wants the help to come from the community(that was the reddit post that inspired me to dive in). You gave him a hard time when everyone agreed on the translations
21:57:34 <strcat[m]> will need to just drop it as a project despite how compelling it is because there hasn't been enough interest in it
21:57:41 <strcat[m]> particularly the lack of help developing it
21:57:46 <strcat[m]> no one has contributed to it iirc
21:57:58 <strcat[m]> either the app or server
21:58:22 <analog[m]> radixed9 That's not giving him a hard time. I'm allowed to disagree with someone's opinions, I don't advocate for foreign documentation but I just don't think it's an absolute necessity to be a developer to plagarize to an accurate degree.
21:58:40 <strcat[m]> cdesai helped with the QR code stuff but it was when he was one of the developers
21:58:52 <strcat[m]> and we ended up just using a library that's now unmaintained and has a lot of problems
21:58:59 <analog[m]> We've already moved on from that topic.
21:59:02 <strcat[m]> and I've brought up that this library and the sqlite one need maintenance / overhauls
21:59:05 <strcat[m]> but no one has helped
21:59:08 <strcat[m]> ofc
21:59:15 <radixed9[m]> strcat: If you can give me a few weeks working on the apps are a priority for me. I would like to help maintain Updater and Auditor. If Auditor sticks around that is
21:59:43 <analog[m]> The initial toll that the pleading would've had on people subsequently fades each time it is repeated, passive marketing could be helpful to be more persuasive.
21:59:45 <radixed9[m]> The Updater is taking a lot of time
21:59:48 <cdesai> For the qr code bit it can be switched to whatever settings is using now for wifi passwords
22:00:15 <strcat[m]> cdesai: if it works properly
22:00:23 <strcat[m]> cdesai: the attestation QR codes are super dense
22:00:31 <cdesai> Yeah, I remember
22:01:45 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger:  I will send the file to your matrix account
22:01:50 <strcat[m]> JollyRoger:
22:02:06 <TheJollyRoger> OK!
22:02:40 <TheJollyRoger> My phone is on the CTS, I will try to walk myself through it using our old conversation history as best I can.
22:06:36 <radixed9[m]> TheJollyRoger: If you need someone to bounce ideas off of I am more than happy to work with you. Auditor is something I want to work on and I have skimmed the code
22:07:01 <TheJollyRoger> radixed9[m]: I'd love to!
22:08:22 <radixed9[m]> You can reach me here or on Signal. Whichever you rather
22:10:03 <strcat[m]> need someone with a Pixel 4 to work on Pixel 4 Auditor support
22:10:04 <strcat[m]> using the stock OS
22:10:06 <strcat[m]> that's the first step before adding GrapheneOS support
22:10:22 <strcat[m]> and this would have to be done by the end of the month as part of adding Pixel 4 support of the 4, 4 XL and 4a are going to be added
22:10:30 <strcat[m]> I set a deadline of the end of June based on the approach of the Android 11 release
22:10:35 <strcat[m]> which will require a month or more of work
22:10:40 <strcat[m]> and then ongoing work to restore features
22:10:48 <strcat[m]> we can't be adding devices or splitting efforts at that time
22:11:06 <strcat[m]> waiting until the deadline approaches is not a viable approach to getting things done
22:11:22 <strcat[m]> it will be a serious problem if this doesn't happen
22:11:49 <strcat[m]> will need to reconsider the project and the approach being taken, the community has to demonstrate that having this as an open source community project is going to work
22:11:59 <strcat[m]> right now it's not working
22:12:45 <radixed9[m]> Isn't the Pixel 4 a really bad phone?
22:14:52 <strcat[m]> no
22:15:08 <strcat[m]> if people want the project to continue it needs to add current generation devices
22:15:17 <strcat[m]> if people want the Pixel 4a added, the 4 and 4 XL are prerequisites for that
22:15:24 <strcat[m]> look at how the 3, 3 XL, 3a and 3a XL support works
22:15:31 <strcat[m]> if we don't add the 4 and 4 XL we are clearly not doing the 4a
22:15:42 <strcat[m]> I need people to help, not arguing or questioning the project's goals
22:15:55 <strcat[m]> I won't publish a public July release if this help is not provided
22:16:05 <strcat[m]> I will keep the tags and binary releases internal from July onwards
22:16:21 <strcat[m]> they are not needed to do development
22:16:27 <strcat[m]> won't be publishing them anymore
22:16:46 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense to spend so much time on releases
22:17:00 <strcat[m]> can instead devote that time to development
22:17:16 <strcat[m]> similarly, why bother making all this documentation, etc. particularly for development when there has been no substantial help gotten from it
22:17:30 <radixed9[m]> I would seriously consider selling my Pixel 3a XL and buying a 4, but I don't think there's anyway I could do it before the deadline.
22:17:42 <strcat[m]> I have probably spent 1000 hours making it easier for others to contribute and gotten maybe ~10 hours worth of my time out of that in help?
22:18:21 <radixed9[m]> My laptop is dying and needs a replacement, but I am open to putting that off. I don't think I could be of much help with the 4
22:18:58 <strcat[m]> it is approaching the point that if someone is not actively working on Pixel 4 support right now they won't be able to contribute in time to meet the deadline
22:19:05 <strcat[m]> it's June 5th
22:19:11 <strcat[m]> when I'm asking for help with something for half a year
22:19:16 <strcat[m]> and people wait until the deadline that was set
22:19:20 <strcat[m]> that doesn't work
22:20:02 <radixed9[m]> I am too late.. I can keep working on apps and eventually the 3a family
22:22:08 <strcat[m]> and btw I bought both devices so that I can test releases (I will not be working on adding support for them)
22:22:12 <strcat[m]> so that money is invested alreadty
22:22:16 <strcat[m]>  * so that money is invested already
22:22:57 <strcat[m]> first step is probably adding Auditor support for the Pixel 4
22:23:10 <strcat[m]> I won't bother replacing the stock OS with a test build until that's done
22:23:25 <strcat[m]> it may require substantial changes to Auditor
22:23:30 <strcat[m]> since it's a new generation device
22:23:35 <strcat[m]> the API may have changed, the root may have changed
22:23:41 <radixed9[m]> I really can't afford picking one up especially if I can't port it and then I don't have GrapheneOS on my daily driver anymore
22:23:43 <strcat[m]> if the root changed that requires substantial work and a bump in the Auditor protocol
22:23:54 <radixed9[m]>  * I really can't afford picking one up especially if I can't port it in time and then I don't have GrapheneOS on my daily driver anymore
22:23:56 <strcat[m]> radixed9: it doesn't make sense to sell a device
22:23:58 <strcat[m]> to buy it
22:24:04 <strcat[m]> so you can't help then someone else has to help
22:25:41 <overheadscallop[> TheJollyRoger: my pixel 4 arrived, let me know if there's anything I can help with
22:25:46 <strcat[m]> there are 3 priorities for Auditor:
22:26:15 <strcat[m]> 1) adding support for new devices, starting with the Pixel 4 (best to have one for locally testing) for Auditor + AttestationServer
22:26:33 <strcat[m]> that includes going through all the submitted samples after handling the Pixel 4 and adding all those, can see what that involves from the past work on it
22:26:44 <strcat[m]> this hasn't been done for MONTHS for there are many months of submitted samples that haven't been handled
22:27:03 <strcat[m]> it is a substantial buildup of work and right now the app is letting down the users who submit samples
22:27:40 <strcat[m]> 2. addressing the lack of maintenance for the Java sqlite library used by the server, perhaps by making a fork with published releases
22:28:00 <strcat[m]> 3. the same thing for the QR code reader UI (camera integration)
22:28:12 <strcat[m]> that is not the only work that needs to be done, that is the tip of the iceberg
22:28:16 <strcat[m]> but those are the priorities for Auditor
22:28:35 <strcat[m]> I can give similar lists of priorities for many other areas of the project
22:28:45 <strcat[m]> the project needs a lot of developers working on it
22:29:02 <radixed9[m]> strcat: just to be clear you want me still working on Updater? I already quit the play stub to work on Updater and I don't like quitting things. I could switch to Auditor if that is critical..
22:29:07 <strcat[m]> it is not going to work if everything is left up to me, I don't see how I could possibly get it all done, especially with my time/energy wasted dealing with other things
22:29:24 <strcat[m]> radixed9: there are many things that need to be done
22:29:31 <strcat[m]> I need more than 1 person to help
22:29:39 <strcat[m]> it all has to be done in parallel
22:29:41 <strcat[m]> not by 1 person
22:30:09 <strcat[m]> radixed9: the main priority for Auditor is adding Pixel  support since it has newer generation attestation features / changes
22:30:19 <strcat[m]> so it's important to address that or no further devices can be added and the project is dead
22:30:40 <strcat[m]> if it's not going to happen, might as well wrap up Auditor, it has to have active development/maintenance
22:30:52 <strcat[m]> half a year later and it hasn't been done
22:30:53 <strcat[m]> that's not good
22:30:58 <strcat[m]> half a year of devices not added based on samples
22:31:06 <strcat[m]> even though it's said that if people will submit samples, devices will get added
22:31:23 <strcat[m]> also the more it builds up, the more work it's going to be to do in one go
22:31:26 <strcat[m]> it gets harder and harder not easier
22:31:29 <strcat[m]> it is falling behind
22:31:39 <strcat[m]> every day there are more samples not handled
22:32:02 <strcat[m]> we are not that far away from behind 2 generations behind the attestation support
22:32:10 <radixed9[m]> If someone with a Pixel 4 needs help I will help them with Auditor in my free time. They need to reach out to me. Otherwise, I am going to work on what I have already invested in(the Updater)
22:32:10 <strcat[m]> becomes a useless / dead app
22:32:32 <strcat[m]> radixed9: I don't think it will be productive trying to test remotely and passing logs to the person doing dev work
22:32:35 <strcat[m]> I don't think that works
22:32:57 <strcat[m]> doing development where you have to send each iteration to someone to test and have them test it per instructions and capture logs is not productive
22:32:59 <strcat[m]> it's a waste of time
22:33:13 <strcat[m]> I don't want people to waste their time taking non-productive approaches to development
22:33:38 <radixed9[m]> Okay, I will give up on Pixel 4 entirely and focus on what I have invested in/already own right now
22:33:50 <strcat[m]> you are not the only person who can help
22:34:06 <strcat[m]> the project needs help on a bunch of things
22:39:14 <radixed9[m]> Thanks I'll do what I want to do. It won't hurt at least 😆
22:39:43 <TheJollyRoger> The next batch of debugging cables are coming, but the serial TTL cables are being held up at the border.
22:39:50 <TheJollyRoger> I'm still waiting on them after a month.
22:40:49 <TheJollyRoger> Because I'm running short on money, the ones I send out from now on will not have cases. I can't afford to keep blowing $20 on each one just to SLA a case for each one.
22:41:13 <TheJollyRoger> So instead I'm just going to wrap them in tape, which will be good enough.
22:43:26 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: aren't the people getting them paying for them?
22:43:35 <TheJollyRoger> No.
22:43:57 <TheJollyRoger> They're my donation to the project.
22:46:01 <TheJollyRoger> I was able to get the cost down to $20 per plastic shell on the Mk. IIs and the Mk. IIIs , but in the end, those shells aren't necessary for the debugging cable to function.
22:46:41 <TheJollyRoger> The only reason they're there is to prevent the exposed connectors from being touched to something and risk shorting the cellphone out, so for the time being I'm just advising people wrap the entire PCB in tape before using it.
22:50:53 <TheJollyRoger> You have the only two prototype Mk. I cables that were produced. I discontinued the Mk. I because of the issue of the plug breaking off and moved to a C-to-C design which I called the Mk. II. I unfortunately had to discontinue the Mk. II because my PCB vendor discontinued the form factor that I used for it. The Mk. IIIs are now where I'm at, they're functionally identical to the Mk. IIs but the
22:50:54 <TheJollyRoger> USB on one side is mounted inverted and I have to solder the jumpers on those myself.
22:51:44 <TheJollyRoger> I still have enough parts to convert the remaining Mk. Is to Mk. IIs with full cases, those I set aside for you specifically.
22:53:36 <TheJollyRoger> So when the remaining Mk. I breaks, I can retrofit it to a Mk. II.
22:56:52 <strcat[m]> I'm not actively using it atm
22:57:04 <strcat[m]> I don't work on device support really, no one is doing it atm
22:57:14 <strcat[m]> one of many neglected areas
22:57:24 <TheJollyRoger> I understand.
22:59:39 <TheJollyRoger> Well, if you're not using it this might be probably the best time for me to retrofit the broken one...
23:00:09 <TheJollyRoger> I dunno.
23:00:11 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe later.
23:00:30 <TheJollyRoger> CTS report incoming.
23:01:39 <TheJollyRoger> I'm still willing to provide cables to maintainers, just going forward they'll be wrapped in tape rather than have 3D printed plastic cases.
23:06:18 <strcat[m]> should let people pay for them if they want fancier ones
23:06:27 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
23:06:38 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. That I can do!
23:07:31 <TheJollyRoger> Well... provided I can get enough people to order in at the same time. I need to meet the MOQ of $80 worth of SLA resin, so that's usually ~4 sets.
23:07:46 <TheJollyRoger> Painting it though is free ^_^.
23:07:51 <TheJollyRoger> (Since I do that myself!)
23:07:57 <paintedman[m]> <strcat[m] "I won't publish a public July re"> Ok, we have a deadline. Do we have a plan? What exact work we need to do for supporting pixel 4?
23:09:51 <paintedman[m]> I'm new to project, may be this was discussed a lot of times earlier, give me a link, or faq if it exists
23:10:28 <TheJollyRoger> Well, there's the official grapheneos.org faq at https://grapheneos.org/faq . But for maintaining a device...
23:11:28 <paintedman[m]> I really want to help but still don't see clearly all aspects of maintaining a device
23:11:32 <strcat[m]> paintedman: need to add Pixel 4 support to Auditor/AttestationServer for the stock OS, that's one thing that has to happen
23:11:36 <TheJollyRoger> For getting Pixel 4 support, it's going to require that the hardening work for Pixel 3s and the current generation of devices be ported to the Pixel 4, as well as the security improvements, support for auditor,
23:11:40 <strcat[m]> I can add it for GrapheneOS once the stock OS is added
23:11:44 <strcat[m]> paintedman: that needs to happen ASAP
23:11:55 <strcat[m]> may require Auditor/AttestationServer protocol enhancements
23:11:57 <strcat[m]> if the root cert is new
23:12:34 <strcat[m]> paintedman: also need to get the initial 1:1 port of the kernel changes done
23:12:45 <strcat[m]> that's not done, not possible to build upstream GrapheneOS for the device at all atm
23:13:14 <strcat[m]> paintedman: need a 1:1 port of the commits including doing the build with a comparable build script, etc.
23:13:22 <strcat[m]> comparable submodule setup
23:13:45 <strcat[m]> paintedman: now isn't the time to switch to a different approach - it needs to be done per the existing Pixel 3 approach
23:13:53 <strcat[m]> if something about it is changed it needs to be changed for all devices
23:14:02 <strcat[m]> devices don't take their own path
23:14:24 <strcat[m]> paintedman: so, once it's possible to actually build (i.e. kernel stuff is done), then any issues need to be resolved
23:14:34 <strcat[m]> paintedman: Wi-Fi obviously needs to work and there can't be awful hacks / workarounds
23:14:46 <strcat[m]> paintedman: right now I would recommend dealing with the kernel stuff
23:14:51 <strcat[m]> someone else can look into Auditor support
23:15:00 <strcat[m]> I don't recommend that the same person does both
23:15:04 <strcat[m]> Auditor support is separate
23:15:09 <strcat[m]> not really related to the other work
23:15:28 <strcat[m]> and need to be making consistent progress day to day or it's going nowhere
23:18:54 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution did you offer to help people get GrapheneOS build setups? I am going to have to learn and do this myself in case there are no public build or I'm going to slammed by build questions on the sub I can't answer.
23:19:01 <paintedman[m]> <strcat[m] "paintedman: right now I would re"> Understood. anupritaisno1 wanted to prepare the kernel, so I can look at coral-sepolicy and after that check the kernel too
23:19:20 <strcat[m]> paintedman: I did the sepolicy repo
23:19:30 <strcat[m]> not much needs to be done there atm since the past changes are missing anyway
23:19:47 <strcat[m]> paintedman: the kernel is what needs to be focused on
23:19:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1 doesn't have a device to test / debug it locally atm
23:19:56 <strcat[m]> someone else can do Auditor
23:22:20 <paintedman[m]> Ok, so I can just modify commits in my repo in a proper way and test kernel on my phone
23:23:15 <strcat[m]> yes
23:23:21 <strcat[m]> make it 1:1 to crosshatch and I can merge that
23:23:29 <strcat[m]> also use the upstream repos for the modules if there are only changes
23:23:41 <strcat[m]> for crosshatch only techpack/audio and qcacld-3.0 itself needed changes
23:23:52 <strcat[m]> and make sure to apply the qcacld-3.0 changes if they're still relevant / needed
23:25:51 <paintedman[m]> <strcat[m] "for crosshatch only techpack/aud"> Almost the same for coral. Btw I tried to use qcacld-3.0 from Google repos as is, and there was problems with enabling wifi.
23:26:21 <strcat[m]> paintedman: look at the changes for qcacld-3.0
23:26:24 <strcat[m]> for crosshatch
23:26:51 <strcat[m]> paintedman: also it wasn't clear to me what problem you had with wifi or how you resolved it - I see you reverted  the android-prepare-vendor changes to build components from source, etc.
23:27:10 <strcat[m]> there can't be official Pixel 4 support with workarounds / hacks like that
23:27:14 <paintedman[m]> It's two different problems
23:27:14 <strcat[m]> need to get it working properly
23:27:25 <strcat[m]> paintedman: follow the lead of crosshatch for the kernel part
23:27:41 <strcat[m]> it is one of 2 module repos that had to be forked before, presumably still need it
23:30:17 <paintedman[m]> Ok, I'll try to do it soon
23:31:22 <strcat[m]> paintedman: both wifi issues need a clean / proper fix
23:31:34 <strcat[m]> and all other functionality needs to be working too
23:31:38 <strcat[m]> including Auditor support
23:39:56 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS Blueline CTS report for "run cts" is posted.
23:40:29 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to try running everything and see what I get.
23:41:36 <TheJollyRoger> The app "android.admin.cts" and "android.admin.app" won't seem to get off my phone. Should I just try a factory reset?
23:43:35 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I gotta try flashing my newly compiled image anyways...
23:43:37 <TheJollyRoger> Ack.
23:43:41 <TheJollyRoger> Might as well.
