00:09:14 <dazinism> Apps can have their data encrypted with keys held by titan and also use the other key protection measures - say requiring biometric authentication, or user pressing a button.
00:10:12 <dazinism> Can flush the keys after x time, or when taken from foreground or screen lock
00:13:10 <dazinism> So apps can make use of titan to give good data privacy, even after the profile is uklocked
00:13:50 <dazinism> Trouble is not many do
00:16:54 <dazinism> ...maybe flush the keys is the wrong term. Flush the data
00:25:10 <LinusSexTips[m]> Is it possible to use biometrics for authentication in apps (ex. Bitwarden or my bank app) but not use it for unlocking the device?
00:31:01 <dazinism> Not sure thats possible.
00:32:16 <dazinism> Maybe having a work profile with fingerprint unlocking and those apps would get you something like that?
00:36:02 <dazinism> Need to consider work profile has some issues. Also your workflow with bitwarden may suffer.

03:38:08 <zxwayland> i concluded smartphones are a rip off scam! its so fragile and easy to break! its so annoying to buy another Pixel 3a and start all over to flash Grapehene OS on it
03:38:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> zxwayland: I agree
03:38:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just found out that pixel 4 still uses UFS 2.1
03:38:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> For the price tag that's absolutely unacceptable
03:39:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> I really hope one day grapheneos moves to in-house hardware
03:40:25 <zxwayland> oh
03:40:41 <zxwayland> i cracked my screen. and i paid 110 bucks for a screen replacement
03:41:06 <zxwayland> when i tried to take off the screen. its so glued so hard. i had to like crack the old screen even more
03:41:50 <zxwayland> and when i try to press in a little bit of preasure to fit in the new screen. the back of the left side broke. I broke the new screen! what the heck man
03:42:47 <zxwayland> and the motherboard connect was smashed. why is it so fragile? it cost like 400 bucks for a new one from google. thats the same cost of a new pixel 3a!
03:46:59 <zxwayland> The first old Noklia phones were like very hard to break. You had to run it over a car to fully break it!
04:10:31 <greenmoon[m]> Get some wooden floor instead of concrete, my phone screen never broke when it drop on it ðŸ‘€
04:10:46 <greenmoon[m]> Or carpet ðŸ˜€
04:11:21 <mrmanpants[m]> when using fingerprint, is it possible to stop being asked the password about every week?
04:11:27 <zxwayland> what if it a big impact?
04:12:13 <greenmoon[m]> Yea it probably break on big impact on wood
04:13:55 <zxwayland> oh no
04:14:01 <zxwayland> can i post a link on here?
04:14:29 <cn3m[m]> <zxwayland "can i post a link on here?"> if it doesn't violate the rules and it is on topic. Yes

04:15:23 <zxwayland> https://esolutions.shop/shop/e-os-fairphone-3/
04:15:43 <zxwayland> well its the other privacy OS, but its easy to fix with one screw driver
04:15:46 <cn3m[m]> <zxwayland "https://esolutions.shop/shop/e-o"> ew
04:16:06 <zxwayland> yeah i know. but the phone is easier to fix
04:16:09 <cn3m[m]> /e/ manages to lower the bar on security lower than Lineage
04:16:28 <cn3m[m]> they also rebrand everyone else's projects as their own
04:16:53 <zxwayland> well, it would be nice to easily fix the pixel phones
04:16:54 <zxwayland> its not
04:17:14 <zxwayland> i am sure linux people would like to tinker the os and fix thier own phones too
04:17:36 <cn3m[m]> iPhones are pretty easy to tinker with and have much better privacy and security
04:18:14 <cn3m[m]> iPhone 11 Pro Max even with it's 4 meters of water resistance got 6/10 on iFixIt
04:18:30 <cn3m[m]> people really shouldn't be buying a phone that isn't a Pixel or iPhone
04:18:39 <greenmoon[m]> Isn't the fingerprint reader disabled when you change the screen?
04:18:45 <zxwayland> this is citied on Wikipedia
04:18:47 <zxwayland> Fairphone 3 "has been manufactured in a factory that pays the local living wage".[7] "The tin and tungsten used in its construction is conflict free, the gold is Fairtrade, and the copper and plastics are recycled."[6]
04:19:36 <cn3m[m]> <greenmoon[m] "Isn't the fingerprint reader dis"> yes, for security reasons iPhones are leading the way on hardware security. Geniune screen detection for one https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/08/hacking_a_phone.html
04:19:46 <zxwayland> sounds ethnical to me
04:20:16 <cn3m[m]> You only really have two good choices security and privacy wise. Pixels and iPhones
04:20:43 <zxwayland> okay, that sounds good too
04:21:13 <zxwayland> but you have to baby the pixel phone. and hope it doesn't damaged well. than poof! its all gone
04:21:40 <greenmoon[m]> Get a case if you are worried about that
04:21:58 <zxwayland> I did
04:21:58 <cn3m[m]> Get an iPhone you can hang onto them for 5-7 years and then Apple will recycle it for you. Fairphones are disposable
04:22:03 <zxwayland> it doesn't help that much
04:22:08 <cn3m[m]> the lack of software support is a real issue
04:22:20 <cn3m[m]> I don't care how ethical the building is if it is disposable
04:22:50 <greenmoon[m]> A flip case that protect the screen or some screen protection with glass in maybe
04:23:15 <zxwayland> i got a new pixel 3a case too. I purposely got a gay and super glittery case. Cause i think smartphones are made cheaply and fragile. Its to profit as much as possible to the big companies
04:23:48 <greenmoon[m]> Stop smashing your phones against walls

04:26:16 <zxwayland> it is 39â‚¬?
04:26:42 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> i have zero idea how riot works tbh. i created an account to join this room
04:26:55 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> sorry if i look like a spam account
04:26:55 <cn3m[m]> <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq "i have zero idea how riot works "> welcome
04:27:37 <cn3m[m]> np
04:27:38 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> ive been thinking about making the change to grapheneOS whenever i get a new phone
04:27:54 <larncat[m]> in my hunt for Pixel 3s, I ended up buying 2. They were pretty hard to find.. and if 1 breaks or disappears I have a good backup.
04:27:55 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> rn using an OP6T
04:28:32 <larncat[m]> I'm noticing camera crashes in one phone particularly.
04:28:54 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> <larncat[m] "in my hunt for Pixel 3s, I ended"> ever thought of waiting for the 4a to come out? those were going to be $400 us iirc
04:29:02 <greenmoon[m]> I hope it have a brand new battery otherwise the original one would be quite old!
04:30:27 <theultron[m]> Does Android 10 blocks background camera and mic usage?
04:30:39 <larncat[m]> mainly when changing cameras, and sometimes when launching the camera. Neither builtin nor Open Camera can use the front wide angle cam.
04:31:00 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "Does Android 10 blocks backgroun"> yes on a recent patch
04:31:19 <theultron[m]> Great. Thanks!
04:31:43 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> is XPlua a good privacy oriented module
04:31:56 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> been hearing alot of clashing opinions on it
04:32:01 <cn3m[m]> theultron: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuInUW77CPo
04:32:06 <cn3m[m]> good video on bypassing it
04:32:08 <cn3m[m]> twas fixed
04:32:16 <cn3m[m]> <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq "is XPlua a good privacy oriented"> it is utterly terrible
04:32:41 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> care to explain why?
04:32:46 <zxwayland> maybe the new pixel 4a would be good
04:32:59 <theultron[m]> Android 11 will leave XPrivacyLua mostly redundant.
04:33:23 <cn3m[m]> <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq "care to explain why? "> breaks the entire security model of the OS, adds a ton of attack surface, and applies all the changes to the app by client side
04:33:28 <cn3m[m]> very bypassable
04:33:34 <cn3m[m]> very insecure
04:33:52 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> doesnt that come with using edxposed tho?
04:34:01 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> or xposed
04:34:02 <cn3m[m]> <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq "doesnt that come with using edxp"> xposed yes
04:34:11 <cn3m[m]> xposed is bad
04:34:22 <cn3m[m]> xprivacylua is probably doing more harm than good
04:34:30 <cn3m[m]> since it is not the app that would bypass the hooks
04:34:34 <cn3m[m]> it is the trackers
04:34:57 <zxwayland> larncat[m], what happens if both of your pixel 3a breaks?
04:35:06 <jknsec[m]> Is Android 11 expected to improve the permissions model and process handling to be more comparable to that of an iPhone?
04:35:07 <cn3m[m]> the app would appear to not be functioning normally, but the trackers can
04:35:08 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> ah ok
04:35:44 <cn3m[m]> <jknsec[m] "Is Android 11 expected to improv"> a lot of the privacy features are terribly implemented in Android 11
04:35:56 <jknsec[m]> So the inverse
04:36:05 <larncat[m]> zxwayland, brave new world.
04:36:17 <jknsec[m]> It's more a downgrade than upgrade
04:36:29 <cn3m[m]> for example the installed apps permission is hidden which is the same as it currently is xD
04:36:31 <LinusSexTips[m]> <zxwayland "larncat, what happens if both of"> you buy another one ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤
04:36:38 <larncat[m]> pixel 3 actually.
04:36:46 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> so hypothetically, if i wanted a privacy oriented phone, without the ability to flash GrapheneOS (bc not pixel) I shouldnt be looking to use xposed/edxposed
04:36:47 <zxwayland> thats a lot of money!
04:36:52 <cn3m[m]> the scoped storage is more encouraged, but still not forced so the same position that we were in since 4.4

04:37:17 <larncat[m]> are the camera crashes common on the p3? it is somewhat problematic.
04:37:18 <jknsec[m]> Sigh
04:37:20 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> i have a oneplus device

04:38:23 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> i rooted because of the whole backdooring thing they had on beta tbh.
04:38:29 <cn3m[m]> jknsec: yeah Android 11 was disappointing imo, iOS 14 probably in contrast made that feel worse though
04:39:00 <theultron[m]> cn3m: Check screenshot. Mostly redundant with Android 10. I use one time permission with MIUI 12 and it won't be able to bypass that + i have indicators for usage.
04:39:32 <zxwayland> maybe i would get a pixel 3 just in case. but i want it to be on sale
04:39:40 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "cn3m: Check screenshot. Mostly r"> MIUI sucks though and probably is not a robust implementation they change so much
04:39:49 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> <cn3m[m] "glassrom is all I would run on t"> glassroom?
04:40:18 <cn3m[m]> <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq "glassroom? "> anupritaisno1: makes it not sure if it supports your device
04:40:41 <cn3m[m]> it has a locked bootloader and some hardening patches
04:40:48 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> its a rom or a sandbox app?
04:40:55 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> hold up ill read up on it
04:41:05 <cn3m[m]> it is an rom
04:41:05 <jknsec[m]> cn3m Can Graphene take inspiration from iOS 14's permission/security model or are we limited by the stock ASOP base? Considering how much custom work is done I'm not sure what's applicable
04:41:28 <cn3m[m]> <jknsec[m] "cn3m Can Graphene take inspirati"> it could be done for sure if people worked on it
04:41:39 <cn3m[m]> though we already have the no tracking id which saves a step
04:42:03 <cn3m[m]> we could use indicators, scoped apps, stronger background limits, and better app shaming
04:42:23 <cn3m[m]> the problem is app shaming doesn't work as well for us since devs don't care as much
04:42:39 <jknsec[m]> Ah
04:42:42 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS could use a custom storage sharing option too
04:42:52 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> ohh
04:42:56 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS profiles are very good though
04:44:26 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> its glassrom
04:44:29 <jknsec[m]> We need more skilled disenfranchised ex apple devs
04:44:55 <cn3m[m]> <jknsec[m] "We need more skilled disenfranch"> why Apple users pay twice as much, Apple has far better developer resources, and they have less devices to support
04:45:08 <cn3m[m]> why on earth would an Apple dev want to develop for Android and take it seriously?
04:45:21 <jknsec[m]> Fair :P
04:45:40 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> you know, i really expected google to be the android competitor
04:45:45 <jknsec[m]> Probably get paid way more
04:45:51 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> when they started making new phones
04:45:57 <jknsec[m]> Working for Apple
04:46:07 <cn3m[m]> I am a better at Android development, but I rather work on Apple any day
04:46:59 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> im best at not developing at all
04:47:18 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> all of my coding projects are spaghettis
04:47:35 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> im probably worse than yanderedev
04:48:08 <theultron[m]> cn3m: We can't say MIUI implementation is not robust just because they modify a lot of code and are closed source. It has brought one time permissions for everything and indicators before AOSP. Phone are much secure for the masses who don't have something like GrapheneOS. It leaves common android threats like RATs pretty much useless. Something like SpyNote or SpyMax. It is also giving me very hard time running
04:48:08 <theultron[m]> background stuff with Tasker which has root permissions. So the phone is much more secure for the common public than they were before.
04:48:45 <cn3m[m]> Android standards are so fragmented too
04:48:46 <cn3m[m]> only 10% of devices on the latest OS?
04:48:46 <cn3m[m]> that is bad when on iOS we are talking almost 90% and the rest probably only one version behind
04:48:47 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "cn3m: We can't say MIUI implemen"> they add a ton of attack surface though
04:49:11 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> attack surface?
04:49:37 <cn3m[m]> <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq "attack surface? "> they add a lot of complexity with the interface and system ui
04:50:00 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> doesnt that apply to every OS then?
04:50:26 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> hell you can make the same argumwnt for Windows/Mac/linux
04:50:58 <cn3m[m]> <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq "doesnt that apply to every OS th"> yeah, but they are forking the code and keeping it closed and they don't have a good track record
04:51:21 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> windows has the shittiest track record known to man
04:51:26 <jknsec[m]> One of the problems with Android is that everything is so fragmented, to hardware, software, etc. that the security model becomes absolute horrendous simply because there is "too much".
04:51:45 <theultron[m]> <cn3m[m] "they add a ton of attack surface"> You are missing the point. It makes phone secure for general public who is more under the threat to download a RAT on their mobile from internet than they being exploited for custom OS weaknesses.
04:52:56 <cn3m[m]> The RAT is MIUI /s
04:53:54 <greenmoon[m]> Damn I was watch miui 12 launch event and it got some new neat feature once again
04:53:59 <pbjpajgfbhunyjaq> miui is spyware
04:54:18 <greenmoon[m]> They always add nice features
04:54:39 <greenmoon[m]> Ya ok
04:55:24 <theultron[m]> <cn3m[m] "The RAT is MIUI /s"> Common people don't care about privacy.
04:55:39 <theultron[m]> They let Google, FB, Tiktok or what not take away their privacy.
04:55:41 <sushiman[m]> which is such a stuoid thing to not care about
04:55:44 <theultron[m]> Whatsapp
04:56:02 <jknsec[m]> I love Graphene and cn3m makes me feel bad for it, lol.
04:56:13 <theultron[m]> But it's waste of time for to convince people to care about privacy. Because they won't.
04:56:26 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "They let Google, FB, Tiktok or w"> Google doesn't belong in the same sentence. Facebook and TikTok are using extremely advanced scroll tracking
04:56:31 <cn3m[m]> which is very similar to eye tracking
04:56:35 <sushiman[m]> i wish i could jump to graphene but i already bought a phone 3 years ago and dont plan on buying a new one
04:56:39 <cn3m[m]> which is basically giving everything away

04:57:07 <alicebobandeve> Guys, some people have notifications turned on for GOS for updates on GOS. Please take this irrelevant and stupid argument to #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
04:57:24 <theultron[m]> Google don't need scroll tracking because they have your browser searches, websites you go to through their searches, they read your email and they track you via location history.
04:58:07 <cn3m[m]> they don't read your emails and clearly ask for location permissions
04:59:15 <theultron[m]> Have you forgot that you need to untick everything in Google and general people don't even know they have to untick something?
04:59:36 <jknsec[m]> Ironically the most prevalent of privacy abuses is that which users willingly accept for the sake of convenience
05:00:39 <theultron[m]> Chrome sends your device hardware identifier with searches and you say Google is not in the same category as FB & TikTok.
05:01:01 <jknsec[m]> But they make it so that such abuses are opt-out versus opt-in
05:01:34 <theultron[m]> <jknsec[m] "But they make it so that such ab"> Because they know majority don't even know they have to opt out of something.

05:30:13 <sushiman[m]> but its better than not using anything, correct?
05:30:29 <jknsec[m]> As far as security is concerned what I've learned is that you shouldn't need to install additional apps for simple features that should be handled by the OS directly
05:31:15 <cn3m[m]> <sushiman[m] "but its better than not using an"> gives you a false sense of security so maybe maybe not

05:35:27 <jknsec[m]> Desktop security model is a crapshoot anyway
05:35:52 <cn3m[m]> <jknsec[m] "Desktop security model is a crap"> that is why you should trust the developer as much as possible since everything you install is kinda super powered
05:36:16 <cn3m[m]> For example Windows and macOS have amazing sandboxing on store apps
05:36:16 <cn3m[m]> use those
05:36:18 <cn3m[m]> and the stock apps
05:36:29 <cn3m[m]> Linux don't leave the repos
05:36:45 <cn3m[m]> everyone in that repo essentially already has root access to your OS don't add anyone else to that trust model
05:37:56 <jknsec[m]> Does Edge actually take advantage of Windows security features or no?
05:37:59 <cn3m[m]> If you don't trust the apps or repos from your OS maker you have bigger issues
05:38:03 <sushiman[m]> huh. i really expected firefox to be the better browser for desktop
05:38:24 <cn3m[m]> <jknsec[m] "Does Edge actually take advantag"> yeah it is basically Chrome with better privacy(it checks Windows privacy settings and follows that) and supports WDAG
05:38:27 <sushiman[m]> ive set it up like how privacytools.io has instructed so
05:38:42 <cn3m[m]> <sushiman[m] "huh. i really expected firefox t"> read their bugzillas no they are pretty bad
05:38:46 <jknsec[m]> Oh nice
05:38:50 <cn3m[m]> Windows it is passable
05:38:58 <cn3m[m]> though everything else it is very bad
05:39:05 <cn3m[m]> the privacy is pretty meh to bad too
05:39:15 <jknsec[m]> Usually use Ungoogled Chromium on Windows
05:39:30 <cn3m[m]> I would use Edge Chromium with some light tweaks
05:39:41 <cn3m[m]> they get updates out quicker
05:39:45 <cn3m[m]> they are in the trust model of your OS
05:39:51 <sushiman[m]> if i ever switch again itd probably be ungoogled chromium then
05:39:55 <cn3m[m]> WDAG is fantastic
05:40:08 <jknsec[m]> Ah alright. Noted. Thanks for the advice.
05:40:13 <sushiman[m]> but rn i have no reason to switch from firefox
05:40:24 <sushiman[m]> and ive grown very fond of it
05:40:46 <cn3m[m]> Firefox is pretty terrible for security and privacy, but if you like it stick with it
05:41:44 <theultron[m]> Chromium Edge is the most secure browser on Windows. One thing is bad from privacy perspective with it that it sends hardware device identifier to Microsoft.
05:42:09 <cn3m[m]> In general the advice is you are using Chromium on GrapheneOS for the webview
05:42:10 <cn3m[m]> you should use that everywhere else
05:42:19 <cn3m[m]> your main browser(Vanadium) and on your PC
05:42:27 <cn3m[m]> otherwise it is more attack surface
05:42:33 <cn3m[m]> having 2 browsers is less secure than one
05:43:00 <jknsec[m]> Vanadium/Safari > Edge Chromium with Windows > Bromite > Ungoogled Chromium > Chrome > Firefox > Everything else
05:43:01 * theultron[m] uploaded an image: image.png (57KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/RIKlayvDobyzzLOODXlSshbl >
05:43:13 <theultron[m]> But Microsoft allows you to delete diagnostic data.
05:43:18 <jknsec[m]> For security
05:43:23 <cn3m[m]> <jknsec[m] "Vanadium/Safari > Edge Chromium "> 100% agree
05:43:37 <cn3m[m]> Chrome is more secure though due to quicker patching
05:43:42 <cn3m[m]> than Ungoogled Chromium
05:43:47 <jknsec[m]> Fair
05:44:15 <jknsec[m]> Ungoogled Chromium is def better for privacy but is behind on security
05:44:38 <cn3m[m]> I have Edge as my backup browser on GrapheneOS personally since I already trust it on my PC
05:44:43 <cn3m[m]> it is in my trust model
05:44:47 <cn3m[m]> Bromite isn't
05:45:35 <theultron[m]>  * But Microsoft allows you to delete diagnostic data. Edge follows the same diagnostic setting as you have set in Windows. So you can delete all data in one single click.
05:46:06 <cn3m[m]> Chromium, GrapheneOS, Windows are all currently in my trust model. That means Edge is fine on both devices of course
05:54:50 <sushiman[m]> vanadium is an android browser?
05:56:43 <sheruleeya[m]> At least on GrapheneOS
05:59:56 <strcat[m]> github thinks it's so clever doing automatic vulnerability reports
06:00:14 <strcat[m]> so it sees outdated npm dependencies in some AOSP sample code in the development repository and sends PRs
06:00:46 <strcat[m]> I looked at what the vulnerabilities are and it's all 'prototype pollution'
06:00:48 <strcat[m]> lol
06:00:49 <strcat[m]> what a joke
06:01:15 <cn3m[m]> I mean some people really need that haha
06:01:30 <strcat[m]> also npm is so terrible
06:01:43 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "also npm is so terrible"> I'll drink to that
06:01:45 <strcat[m]> love how `npm update` only updates top-level dependencies and does minimal upgrades to deps of deps, deps of those, etc.
06:02:01 <strcat[m]> I tried `npm update --depth 100`
06:02:16 <strcat[m]> but in the end I just removed all of the crap and just did npm install fresh and it produces a different result
06:02:38 <strcat[m]> since update doesn't really update it to what it'd get from a clean setup
06:02:39 <strcat[m]> pretty dumb
06:03:14 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_development/tree/10/tools/winscope
06:03:19 <strcat[m]> it gets really mad about this crap
06:03:45 <strcat[m]> but it's a development tool and this isn't where you get the most recent releases of those
06:04:09 <strcat[m]> just how AOSP works, lots of stuff in the same source tree and it all shares the master branch
06:04:32 <strcat[m]> but for stable releases, AOSP OS releases for devices are not the same stable branch as the SDK, and there is one for platform-tools, etc.
06:05:28 <strcat[m]> also really struggling to see why prototype pollution is worth of sending me a bunch of emails
06:05:29 <strcat[m]> thanks github
06:05:30 <cn3m[m]> My pet peeve today is I had to spend a few hours on /r/GrapheneOS proving to everyone why root is a bad idea and that linux desktop sucks. I am so glad for this community that Matrix took over
06:06:36 <strcat[m]> my main irritation with this is it tries to make automated pull requests
06:06:40 <strcat[m]> that are just bad
06:07:55 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "my main irritation with this is "> that is a little extreme even for beginners
06:09:02 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/pull/119
06:09:16 <strcat[m]> what actually had to be done: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/commit/0870c781e9e20d3c15f47dbeea681e805c164f6b
06:09:45 <strcat[m]> just hadn't realized `npm update` doesn't work
06:09:59 <strcat[m]> not that it really matters when it's just local with all trusted input
06:10:21 <strcat[m]> and not using any automatic code generation or anything, they're just dependencies of linters, etc.
06:10:34 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/blob/master/validate_static
06:10:39 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/blob/master/process_static
06:10:41 <strcat[m]> that stuff
06:10:49 <strcat[m]> cn3m: anyways it's a super annoying feature
06:11:17 <strcat[m]> I should at least be able to configure it not to give me alert email spam for 'prototype pollution'
06:11:44 <strcat[m]> I really couldn't care less if these trash javascript packages monkey patch prototypes to stuff, not my problem
06:12:02 <strcat[m]> yeah they shouldn't do that but I don't see how that would matter to me
06:13:11 <strcat[m]> cn3m: it seems like the issue is they don't want arguments to the cli tools to give arbitrary code exec
06:16:03 <cn3m[m]> yeah machines are never going to take programmers job exhibit #174898931
06:16:03 <strcat[m]> cn3m: I'd generally assume if an attacker can pass arbitrary flags to CLI tools *that* is the problem... lol
06:16:04 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: it seems like the issue is"> right
06:16:07 <cn3m[m]> that bot is so annoying
06:16:32 <cn3m[m]> they should put info how to fully skip it in the PR strcat:
06:16:32 <cn3m[m]> not after you close the issue
06:16:45 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: I'd generally assume if an"> security theater though! Better than nothing! /s
06:16:54 <strcat[m]> the idea of it isn't bad but really
06:17:01 <strcat[m]> why not just regularly update deps
06:17:12 <strcat[m]> why update only the dep this bot decides to warn about for a silly reason
06:17:18 <strcat[m]> shrug
06:17:38 <strcat[m]> too bad the fucking package manager for this garbage ecosystem doesn't actually update everything without passing some extra flags
06:17:44 <cn3m[m]> Hopefully they clean it up since it could be great
06:17:51 <cn3m[m]> with some love
06:18:02 <strcat[m]> I don't mind alerts that much but I turned off automatic pull requests
06:18:11 <strcat[m]> I never want bot-generated pull requests
06:18:23 <strcat[m]> and the alerts are still pretty dumb
06:18:37 <strcat[m]> like getting warned about that AOSP repository because of a tool that isn't provided by this branch
06:18:38 <cn3m[m]> it is not like you don't get enough email anyway
06:19:48 <strcat[m]> cn3m: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/tools/winscope/package.json
06:19:51 <strcat[m]> it send me like
06:19:57 <strcat[m]> 80 alerts for this shit
06:20:17 <strcat[m]> it mapped out the dependency tree this creates and made dozens and dozens of alerts
06:20:23 <cn3m[m]> okay now that is a little funny
06:20:41 <strcat[m]> every few weeks it sends more alerts
06:20:45 <cdesai> Would be funnier if it sent those to aosp-mirror as well
06:20:48 <strcat[m]> for this winscope shit
06:20:58 <strcat[m]> cdesai: I assume it does if they have this enabled
06:21:03 <strcat[m]> it might only be enabled for recent repos
06:21:22 <jknsec[m]> Don't you know these are real and valid errors?!
06:21:41 <jknsec[m]> It says so right here
06:22:26 <jknsec[m]> Listen to the emails Daniel
06:22:32 <cn3m[m]> just to confirm it is a known fact that Pixelbook does not support custom verified boot keys right>
06:23:19 <strcat[m]> I doubt it supports it in a reasonable way
06:23:41 <strcat[m]> and it's a ChromeOS device isn't it
06:23:56 <cn3m[m]> yes, so I can say never for GrapheneOS support
06:24:01 <strcat[m]> ChromeOS devices don't support custom verified boot keys like Pixels
06:24:03 <cn3m[m]> just making sure(subreddit stuff)
06:24:09 <strcat[m]> and they don't have stuff like the hardware-backed keystore
06:24:11 <strcat[m]> among other things
06:24:26 <strcat[m]> they aren't the same kind of hardware they're for running ChromeOS which uses crappy TPM APIs still
06:24:45 <strcat[m]> ChromeOS approach to encryption, verified boot, key management, etc. is way less modern now
06:25:07 <strcat[m]> because the implementations it has are earlier
06:25:15 <strcat[m]> and they didn't care about proper support for alternate OSes
06:25:20 <cn3m[m]> thanks I am going to pretty much reword that and approve the question it is so common
06:25:26 <strcat[m]> Pixels go out of the way to make sure 100% of the security features work for another OS
06:25:39 <strcat[m]> Pixel phones that is
06:25:59 <strcat[m]> so yeah if anyone has been running `npm update` that doesn't work
06:26:04 <strcat[m]> only useful thing out of this
06:26:28 <cn3m[m]> really someone should just use an iPad if they are looking for a "GrapheneOS" laptop sadly
06:26:29 <strcat[m]> best option just to rm -rf and fresh install every time
06:26:55 <cn3m[m]> Pixelbooks are pretty, but yeah too many issues
06:27:00 <strcat[m]> this is my punishment for wanting to do linting of JS / CSS / HTML
06:27:06 <strcat[m]> these tools require like
06:27:11 <strcat[m]> 150 npm dependencies each
06:29:10 <strcat[m]> so I use the leading CSS minifier (csso), JS minifier (terser), HTML minifier (html-minifier) and some linters (jshint, stylelint)
06:29:17 <strcat[m]> that is 342 total packages
06:29:19 <cn3m[m]> I had to use node.js omce
06:29:20 <cn3m[m]> never again
06:29:50 <strcat[m]> those are the only things this uses though
06:30:08 <strcat[m]> static site generation linting / minification
06:30:25 <strcat[m]> i.e. take in trusted static input, lint it and output minified site
06:31:00 <strcat[m]> but since this stuff is all based on this ecosystem I now get email spam from github warning me these people screwed up and added CLI switches that give arbitrary code exec, etc.
06:31:29 <strcat[m]> as far as I'm concerned if someone passes attack controller switches to these CLI tools that's the problem...
06:31:37 <strcat[m]> I mean I'd assume you get code exec from that
06:31:52 <tencarsb[m]> Sorry for "noob" question: "your device is loading a different operating system" at startup is the normal MSG?
06:31:57 <strcat[m]> chances are people doing that have shell expansion too
06:32:08 <strcat[m]> tencarsb: well you are loading a different OS than the stock one
06:32:14 <strcat[m]> tencarsb: and it has verified boot
06:32:19 <cn3m[m]> <tencarsb[m] "Sorry for "noob" question: "your"> yes
06:32:24 <sixBit[m]> <jknsec[m] "Vanadium/Safari > Edge Chromium "> Do you set any special settings / extension for Edge on Win?
06:32:42 <strcat[m]> tencarsb: it indicates that it is using verified boot with the custom key flashed as part of installing it
06:32:42 <cn3m[m]> <sixBit[m] "Do you set any special settings "> ask me in off topic and I will answer
06:32:52 <strcat[m]> tencarsb: if it was unlocked and not verifying it would say that instead
06:33:30 <sixBit[m]> <cn3m[m] "ask me in off topic and I will a"> Mind sharing the off topic channel?
06:34:23 <strcat[m]> glad I don't use any templating system or w/e atm or I'd have to deal with 1000 dependencies for site generation
06:34:44 <cn3m[m]> strcat: I have so much respect for you and your patience
06:35:21 <cn3m[m]> you are a very mature person to be able to work on all this stuff and still be able to interact with the community as thoughtfully as you do
06:35:51 <strcat[m]> if you look at the deps it includes stuff like `is-number`
06:35:53 <strcat[m]> `is-number` is up to 7.0.0
06:36:05 <cn3m[m]> #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org sixBit
06:36:24 <cdesai> Put that in the topic?
06:39:11 <tencarsb[m]> Thanks all!
06:40:22 <strcat[m]> most of the issues for that AOSP winscope development tool are that the library they used to parse config files has dozens of vulnerabilities
06:40:36 <strcat[m]> because yaml
06:41:54 <strcat[m]> cn3m: I think it'd warn even if the repo was a fork of a mirror on github
06:41:57 <strcat[m]> unsure about that
06:46:10 <cn3m[m]> programming is depressing
06:47:36 <strcat[m]> btw this list of deps
06:47:38 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_development/blob/master/tools/winscope/package.json
06:47:53 <strcat[m]> that becomes eight hundred and fifty eight packages
06:48:02 <strcat[m]> npm lol
06:48:56 <strcat[m]> cn3m: they don't even use the stuff where vulns are being reported it's just some optional feature of a dep of a dep of a dep or something
06:49:04 <strcat[m]> w/e

14:44:03 <rivetrenuck9> Is there instructions on how to install Protonmail from their APK site?
14:45:02 <f8sai[m]> Try doing local verification on Auditor to check for integrity?
14:46:42 <f8sai[m]> <rivetrenuck9 "There are two items that I am no"> Welp, since you had to connect to internet anyways, maybe remote verification would do
14:46:54 <rivetrenuck9> How would I do that?

14:47:58 <rivetrenuck9> Would this make phone less secure since I have already connected to internet?
14:48:19 <f8sai[m]> Auditor is already installed by default on Graphene
14:48:24 <f8sai[m]> But if you have a spare Android phone
14:48:38 <f8sai[m]> It's better to do an offline local verification
14:48:53 <rivetrenuck9> Sure, unfortunately I don't
14:49:11 <rivetrenuck9> the alternative being attestation?
14:49:25 <f8sai[m]> Well, gotta opt for remote attestation
14:49:42 <rivetrenuck9> Which is also done via the Auditor App?
14:50:52 <rivetrenuck9> https://attestation.app/tutorial is that the scheduled remote verification section?

17:00:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> sushi man: since it is off topic you should pm me. Also we have a plan to implement it better
17:05:05 <sushiman[m]> "anupritaisno1" (https://matrix.to/#/@anupritaisno1:m.apex.to): ill pm you in a bit
17:08:16 <strcat[m]> cdesai: you'd need to look at all the things is_official_build turns on
17:08:19 <strcat[m]> and enable those manually
17:08:38 <strcat[m]> stuff related to resources as a priority
17:08:42 <strcat[m]> since it's probably one of those
17:09:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can we just git blame?
17:09:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might actually be faster than whatever the hell we are doing rn
17:12:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Can we just git bisect?
17:13:20 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I left a comment on the issuetracker, might be easier to just add a trichrome_chrome_apk
17:13:26 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: it's a LOT of source code
17:13:33 <cdesai> and a lot of commits from one release to the next
17:15:20 <cdesai> I already had a brief look that day, but nothing stood out. feel free to dig in more
17:15:32 <cdesai> the official blogspot has a web link to the changes
17:16:05 <strcat[m]> yes adding an apk target probably easiest
17:16:16 <strcat[m]> avoids this bundle stuff that's not very mature
17:17:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): is there an issue tracker issue open?
17:17:38 <strcat[m]> yes
17:17:50 <strcat[m]> upstream
17:17:51 <strcat[m]> by cdesai
17:18:01 <strcat[m]> we need this resolved ASAP
17:18:06 <strcat[m]> that might mean making an apk target
17:18:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Haven't received any response from the home server provider
17:18:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll see if I can build elsewhere
17:29:19 <cn3m[m]> <sushiman[m] "hosts file adblocking "> just use PrivateDNS with dns.adguard.com or something
17:29:51 <sushiman[m]> yeah will do that
18:14:03 <aeonsolution[m]> cdesai: is the `is_official_build = true` conflicting with another setting? did you find a different error? i may be able to find something if you have new info. `gn args out/Default --list=is_official_build`
18:15:05 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: i think I've been accidentally pinging you by adding reactions to your posts
18:15:12 <aeonsolution[m]> my bad
18:43:23 <cdesai> aeonsolution[m]: no, not setting -> works, setting it -> fails.
19:08:28 <Erraverunt> Hmm, help guys. Trying to install graphene os on windows but getting fastboot too old error when fastboot is version 30
19:30:32 <broda721[m]> Did you add fastboot to your path?
19:31:01 <Erraverunt> No
19:36:02 <Erraverunt> couldn't get it working with powershell and now cant download platform tools from there, how do you manually add the path if you use manully downloaded fastboot?
19:38:03 <Erraverunt> Hmm I'll boot and see if it helps
19:38:03 <crueltekk[m]> <Erraverunt "couldn't get it working with pow"> https://wiki.lineageos.org/adb_fastboot_guide.html
19:38:38 <crueltekk[m]> Don't worry about cmd/powershell aslong you add it to your path you can use it in both :)
19:38:56 <crueltekk[m]> * Don't worry about cmd/powershell aslong you add it to your path you can use ADB/fastboot in both :)
19:43:04 <Erraverunt> Thanks, by manually adding path got it working
20:01:01 <strcat[m]> crueltekk: Erraverunt: why not just follow the instructions in our installation guide
20:01:36 <Erraverunt> I did, but somehow screved something with the powershell and downloading the tools
20:01:48 <Erraverunt> But all is working now!
20:04:37 <bombadil> hi, I'm currently starting to get intereste in the graphene os, now for a personal project I would like to change a litle bit the frontend, but I can't find this in the github, could someone tell me where can I find this?
20:04:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): BTW can you go to pm for a sec (OT)
20:08:14 <strcat[m]> bombadil: not clear what you mean
20:09:01 <bombadil> so defenetly graphene os need some kind of frontend, is this to be found in the github?
20:09:46 <bombadil> or does graphene os use already developed frontend? so I mean graphical interface
20:09:54 <bombadil> UI
20:11:34 <strcat[m]> which part of the UI?
20:12:00 <strcat[m]> bombadil: I think you need to start by reading https://grapheneos.org/source
20:12:45 <bombadil> general, so maybe I should explain what I want to do, I would like a super minimal UI, so where I can only call or write messages
20:14:30 <strcat[m]> bombadil: traditional texts and calls aren't secure and should be avoided
20:14:39 <strcat[m]> also very little of that has to do with the UI
20:15:08 <strcat[m]> if you want to lock things down so that only a single app like Signal can be used that can already be done with a device manager
20:15:10 <strcat[m]> doesn't require any changes to the code
20:17:01 <bombadil> yes I understand your point, but my point was to simplify the ui so that the phone distracts me less, so for example I unlock the phone and I have only two possibilities, call or write a message, this then are sended to the relative app.
20:18:19 <jknsec[m]> That's not in GrapheneOS's design model and never will be
20:19:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> @paintedman:matrix.org: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/android-prepare-vendor/pull/8
20:19:13 <bombadil> but I mean if it's free software I still should be able to take it and change it just for me, no?
20:19:28 <strcat[m]> bombadil: disable the other apps
20:20:01 <strcat[m]> bombadil: I don't really see why you'd need to change the code just disable all the apps on the home screen and install Signal
20:20:10 <jknsec[m]> Oh right I didn't even think of that
20:20:21 <strcat[m]> or use a device manager to lock down what can be used
20:20:21 <jknsec[m]> Duh
20:20:38 <bombadil> strcat: I mean something like the "light phone", just I don't like to spend 300 euros for something like that
20:20:49 <strcat[m]> bombadil: you can take it and change it as you wish but what you want doesn't require changing anything
20:21:27 <strcat[m]> bombadil: and being able to change it doesn't mean you can request resources here to help with doing what you want
20:21:34 <strcat[m]> also as I said
20:21:38 <strcat[m]> traditional calls and texts are not secure
20:21:41 <strcat[m]> and should be avoided
20:22:09 <strcat[m]> this channel is about GrapheneOS - not other projects
20:22:21 <jknsec[m]> Signal us the gold standard of encrypted communication which is why it's so recommended
20:23:00 <bombadil> I just wanted to explore the project, I just thought it followed the free software phylosophy
20:23:26 <strcat[m]> bombadil: you seem really confused
20:23:37 <strcat[m]> as I suggested before why don't you read https://grapheneos.org/source which explains the layout of the sources
20:23:37 <strcat[m]> and where they are hosted
20:24:31 <jknsec[m]> bombadil To strcat's point: You can modify it as much as you won't since that's the nature of free software. However, in doing so, you are no longer using GrapheneOS but instead an entirely new OS that you are responsible for.
20:24:31 <strcat> but you don't need to change the code to do something you can already do, it's not clear what you want to achieve
20:25:07 <strcat> this is the GrapheneOS channel about using and developing GrapheneOS
20:25:07 <jknsec[m]> * bombadil To strcat's point: You can modify it as much as you want since that's the nature of free software. However, in doing so, you are no longer using GrapheneOS but instead an entirely new OS that you are responsible for.
20:25:33 <jknsec[m]> Hence do not expect us to help you
20:25:59 <strcat> I gave you suggestions on how to accomplish what you want with the existing project which does not require making a fork / new OS
20:26:13 <strcat> still not clear what you want to do that's not already supported
20:26:29 <bombadil> I understand both of your points, and I understand your concerning with security, my point was a more experimental point, I was thinking about this project today and wanted to get some information from where to start
20:27:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> <jknsec[m] "Hence do not expect us to help y"> Who's "us" BTW
20:27:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> I only see you
20:27:50 <jknsec[m]> shouldn't have included myself
20:28:01 <jknsec[m]> strcat, devs, etc.
20:28:20 <strcat> using a different launcher doesn't require changing the base OS
20:28:31 <strcat> neither does disabling user-facing apps
20:28:48 <strcat> not clear what you want to change about the UI or why you would need to make a fork to do that
20:29:15 <jknsec[m]> anupritaisno1 Do you mean literally or proverbially?
20:30:12 <bombadil> the point wasn't on "asking you for help", but just exploring the a little bit
20:30:44 <jknsec[m]> strcat is here as well so that might be an issue with your client if you're not seeing the convo
20:30:51 <bombadil> at the end my question was on how the os handled the fronted for the UI
20:31:16 <strcat> still not clear what you mean by that and my suggestion was to look at the page documenting where sources are hosted
20:31:23 <strcat> since you seem to be missing most of the sources
20:32:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Took a while to read past messages
20:32:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> bombadil: you are looking for changes in launcher and frameworks/base
20:33:26 <strcat> using a different launcher doesn't require changing the OS
20:33:32 <strcat> mentioned that above
20:34:04 <strcat> the launcher included with the OS is just a default
20:34:14 <strcat> don't need to fork the OS to use a different one
20:34:25 <bombadil> thank you anupritaisno1
20:34:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "using a different launcher doesn"> I think he wants something like Samsung ultra power saving that basically kills almost the entire OS to just allow calls and SMS
20:34:41 <strcat> traditional calls / SMS are insecure
20:34:46 <jknsec[m]> Even though it's recommended to use the built-in launcher iirc as an additional launcher increases attack surface
20:34:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Most of the changes can be launcher implemented
20:35:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "traditional calls / SMS are inse"> Well it's his own fork so we don't have to care now do we?
20:35:25 <jknsec[m]> Lol
20:35:29 <strcat> if it's not about GrapheneOS it's not on-topic here
20:35:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <jknsec[m] "Even though it's recommended to "> All apps you install increase attack surface. This is a flawed argument
20:35:45 <strcat> it's not a generic AOSP development channel
20:35:57 <strcat> it's a channel about GrapheneOS
20:36:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> bombadil: well I've told you where to look
20:36:32 <jknsec[m]> anupritaisno1 Isn't the one bundled with GOS hardened or is it just a default ASOP launcher
20:36:50 <jknsec[m]> I can't remember
20:36:57 <strcat> what about the launcher is there to harden
20:37:16 <strcat> other than not introducing a bunch of attack surface or vulnerabilities
20:37:24 <jknsec[m]> Fair.
20:37:32 <strcat> I don't think issues like apps disabling their own activities etc. or renaming them is really tied to the launcher
20:37:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> bombadil: now the rest is up to you
20:38:03 <jknsec[m]> I was told to use the default a while back
20:38:20 <strcat> most alternatives probably don't care much for privacy/security
20:38:27 <strcat> it's a good idea to use the standard launcher in most cases
20:38:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh
20:38:38 <strcat> most an alternative is not inherently worse
20:38:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> A launcher is supposed go launch apps
20:38:46 <strcat> but an alternative is not inherently worse*
20:38:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> You are not supposed to stare at your launcher
20:39:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or admire how beautiful it is
20:39:21 <bombadil> yes as I said I just got this idea today so I was just exploring, if something cool comes out I'll do a post on reddit if someone is interested then
20:39:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or add 10000 different views
20:39:37 <jknsec[m]> Haha
20:39:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or create fancy animations
20:39:47 <jknsec[m]> ^
20:40:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is just like all the stupid twrp forks out there
20:40:11 <jknsec[m]> It's more of a utility and doesn't really need to be changed
20:40:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seriously. Why do you need a flashlight, mobile data, Bluetooth, a video player, internet connection and theming in a recovery?
20:41:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is really just scope creep
20:41:24 <maybemaybe[m]> Does GrapheneOS support a YubiKey via NFC? Any experience?
20:41:29 <jknsec[m]> But much customization
20:41:47 <jknsec[m]> *But muh customization
20:41:55 <strcat> maybemaybe[m]: yes it works but most apps won't support U2F/FIDO2 2FA without the Play Services library they use for it
20:42:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> <jknsec[m] "But much customization"> Most twrp forks are so insecure if you get hacked you deserved it
20:42:20 <TheJollyRoger> maybemaybe[m]: I have been able to get Yubikeys, and J3H145DIs running ANNSI SmartPGP to work with OpenKeyChain via NFC. At the moment they don't work with--
20:42:37 <TheJollyRoger> --yeah.
20:42:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have to focus on security and usability
20:43:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Usability=core features work
20:43:09 <jknsec[m]> Exactly
20:43:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't need 10000 features scope creeping their way into a hardened ROM
20:43:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> That'll only make merging security patches difficult
20:44:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> And introduce more problems of their own
20:44:08 <jknsec[m]> I have always noticed very pretty looking feature creep that, while it looks fancy, really just makes thing infinitely shittier
20:44:56 <jknsec[m]> And, to your point, makes dev much more difficult
20:45:40 <jknsec[m]> GrapheneOS functions fine as it is in terms of UI
20:46:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> It already is
20:46:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ideally we want to make sure our changes reach upstream
20:47:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> By upstreaming the changes we can get third parties to better support them
20:48:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> By doing so our own work also is simplified
20:48:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> The most ideal case is that grapheneos in its entirety becomes part of upstream AOSP
20:48:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then grapheneos can go into the hardware space and engineer security focused hardware
20:48:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Those are the long term goals anyway
20:53:10 <blacklight447[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "The most ideal case is that grap"> How likely do you think it is that google will implement network and sensor permissions?
20:53:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well
20:53:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Slightly likely
20:56:01 <blacklight447[m]> Its been one of my pet peeves , i just want to be able to say: this app has no way of reaching out over the web on its own
20:56:22 <blacklight447[m]> Now with the network switch, we are halfway there
20:57:14 <blacklight447[m]> Now with android 11 making it possible to cut down on communication between apps, we can finally start something that wpuls function like a proper firewall
21:08:05 <jknsec[m]> If GrapheneOS became part of upstream ASOP the Android security model would benefit significantly
21:09:01 <jknsec[m]> Even large portions being integrated upstream would be a huge boon for development
21:11:45 <wreck[m]> >GrapheneOS has made substantial contributions to the privacy and security of the Android Open Source Project, along with contributions to the Linux kernel, LLVM, OpenBSD and other projects. Much of our past work is no longer part of the downstream GrapheneOS project because we've successfully landed many patches upstream. We've had even more success with making suggestions and participating in design discussions to
21:11:45 <wreck[m]> steer things in the direction we want. Many upstream changes in AOSP such as removing app access to low-level process, network, timing and profiling information originated in the GrapheneOS project. The needs of the upstream projects are often different from ours, so they'll often reimplement the features in a more flexible way. We've almost always been able to move to using the upstream features and even when we still
21:11:45 <wreck[m]> need our own implementation it helps to have the concepts/restrictions considered by the upstream project and apps needing to be compatible with it. Getting features upstream often leads to an improved user experience and app compatibility.
21:11:54 <wreck[m]> from https://grapheneos.org/
21:12:24 <strcat[m]> mostly in the past
21:12:40 <strcat[m]> also a lot of the past work isn't really revived yet
21:12:47 <strcat[m]> hasn't been ported to the current release
21:12:50 <paintedman[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "@paintedman:matrix.org: https://"> Hi! Please, write messages like this straight to DM. I don't attentively read this chat lately because it always discusses the same questions, like how to flash graphene os on pixel 3, etc
21:13:36 <paintedman[m]> And ok, I'll test this as soon as I have free time
21:15:59 <blacklight447[m]> So daniel, question, would it be possible, using the new android intent in android 11 about knowing what apps are on a phone, could we make that a permission, like, if i just want to shut down the capability of that app being able to discover others
21:18:01 <blacklight447[m]> Because im pretty sure im overlooking/oversimplifying it, but id like to know if its a possibility
21:19:55 <cn3m[m]> blacklight447: it is and always has been a hidden permission much like the networking permission switch
21:20:26 <cn3m[m]> it wouldn't be difficult to re-implement that with this permission to deny that permission
21:20:57 <cn3m[m]> however, I am uncertain if it would have proper fallback or if apps would crash(not hard to test with apk modifying)
21:21:09 <cn3m[m]> it is not as elegant as the network permission, but it could easily be a toggle
21:21:25 <cn3m[m]> nothing stopping that in Android 10
21:22:39 <blacklight447[m]> I would really like that
21:23:42 <blacklight447[m]> Shutting down app communication and networking pretty much airgaps it (as far as softwarr can airgap stuff)
21:24:16 <blacklight447[m]> No way of sending stuff out on their own because they have no network, and no way of leaking info thru other apps via app communication
21:24:42 <blacklight447[m]> Keeping them on their own little isolated island (without having to create a seperate android profile for them)
21:28:21 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense for the network toggle to be upstream
21:28:29 <strcat[m]> it's not a good approach and isn't particularly useful, really
21:28:41 <strcat[m]> you're just misguided about what actually matters and what can / cannot work
21:29:30 <strcat[m]> you both seem confused about what Android 11 changes and how things work now
21:30:33 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: what you're saying isn't true about the network permission and app communication
21:30:53 <strcat[m]> because users can and do grant apps access to other permissions and access to files on a case-by-case basis
21:31:03 <strcat[m]> and I'm not really sure what you think Android 11 changes that makes this any different
21:31:10 <strcat[m]> don't really know what this conversation is about
21:35:12 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of features that would be useful
21:36:10 <strcat[m]> however, the resources needed to properly maintain the past and current features are substantial
21:36:30 <strcat[m]> a lot of past features have not been restored and this cycle is coming to an end, so everything will need to be ported forward
21:37:24 <strcat[m]> you can look through the issue tracker and see that is lot is planned, and you can also see that there isn't really much active work on that stuff
21:44:08 <blacklight447[m]> I was talking about the fact that any app can communicate and see with any other app atm
21:44:33 <strcat[m]> within a profile yes
21:44:36 <strcat[m]> iOS is the same in reality
21:44:45 <blacklight447[m]> And in in android 11 if im not mistaken, they will implement a way that apps have to fill in a list of apps they need access to in their manifest
21:44:46 <strcat[m]> not sure what you think Android 11 changes about this
21:45:04 <blacklight447[m]> If its not in the manifest, they dont get access
21:45:45 <blacklight447[m]> Thing is, it seems like its up to the app developer to say what apps it wants access to, and i wondered if i could turn that around
21:46:00 <blacklight447[m]> That the user can select what apps an app gets access too
21:46:23 <strcat[m]> it isn't just a list of apps
21:46:46 <strcat[m]> this doesn't really change anything and doesn't enable us to do anything we couldn't have done just as easily before
21:47:07 <strcat[m]> it only helps with static analysis of apps which is not something we do
21:47:26 <strcat[m]> that's also why most of the non-runtime (aka dangerous) permissions exist: static analysis of apps
21:47:45 <strcat[m]> they are not user-facing permissions, are not designed as such and would not be useful to expose as such for the most part
21:47:52 <pikey[m]> Could someone please tell me where to get a stock image for pixel 3 to put it back to factory ready to sell
21:48:01 <strcat[m]> people who know enough about it to be aware of that are just misguided about what it all does and accomplishes
21:48:13 <strcat[m]> if you aren't doing static analysis of apps like Google none of this has any value
21:48:20 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "they are not user-facing permiss"> Then why do we have the network toggle then
21:48:24 <strcat[m]> or hardening your own app
21:48:46 <blacklight447[m]> As its normally a non runtime permission
21:48:57 <cdesai> strcat[m]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/be712e648cb870eb125ce6832fec55859e3f56ec
21:49:39 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really fit into how things work well
21:50:21 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: the network permission toggle is probably not a good idea
21:50:25 <cn3m[m]> yeah the Android 11 changes just make visualization of all apps just weirder
21:50:30 <strcat[m]> gives people the wrong impression and makes them do misguided things
21:50:39 <cn3m[m]> Android 10 has a permissions ofr it
21:50:40 <cn3m[m]> but it is partial
21:50:47 <cn3m[m]> the Android 11 change is just weird
21:50:52 <strcat[m]> the Android 11 change is not weird
21:51:01 <strcat[m]> it is just not doing what people here seem to think
21:51:23 <strcat[m]> the low-level permissions marked in the manifest are not for users to control what apps can access and are not designed in a way that would be sensible for users to control
21:51:46 <strcat[m]> they are for opportunistic reduction of attack surface (protecting your own app from exploitation) and static analysis of apps as I explained
21:51:47 <blacklight447[m]> Then what does it do.
21:52:13 <blacklight447[m]> Protecting your own app?
21:52:38 <strcat[m]> yes reducing attack surface of an app
21:52:40 <blacklight447[m]> Like can you set what apps can access/see your app?
21:52:49 <strcat[m]> no\
21:53:07 <strcat[m]> not what I said
21:53:28 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: developers already had full control of which apps could access their app's APIs
21:53:40 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: you have to explicitly export APIs if you want other apps to be able to access them
21:53:49 <strcat[m]> your internal app data is never accessible to other apps
21:54:18 <strcat[m]> the new feature in Android 11 requires you to list out what your app needs to access, as a form of attack surface reduction like Content-Security-Policy
21:54:34 <strcat[m]> listing out a declarative policy of what your app needs to access (it is NOT a list of apps it needs to access - it can also list intents, etc.)
21:54:46 <strcat[m]> you're misunderstanding the purpose of it
21:55:07 <strcat[m]> it is not there as a way to restrict what apps can do and has no use for that
21:55:28 <strcat[m]> it doesn't add any infrastructure useful for that either - anything that would be useful for that already existed
21:55:46 <cn3m[m]> I think it is weird that it is in the privacy section*
21:56:05 <strcat[m]> it helps apps avoid leaking data by accident
21:56:09 <strcat[m]> by making mistakes
21:56:19 <strcat[m]> since they have to list out every form of access they expect to have to other apps
21:56:24 <strcat[m]> it's like CSP
21:56:50 <strcat[m]> cn3m: also Google does static and dynamic analysis of apps / antivirus type stuff
21:56:51 <strcat[m]> this helps them do that
21:56:59 <strcat[m]> does not help us with anything
21:57:08 <strcat[m]> aside from it being nice that apps have something like CSP for intents
21:58:14 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "it's like CSP"> This actually made it clear to me
21:58:22 <hasnoname[m]> Whats the unlock method for p4/xl?
21:59:47 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: unclear what you mean
22:00:05 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install
22:00:23 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "hasnoname: unclear what you mean"> Sorry, I meant screen unlocking the device
22:00:40 <strcat[m]> still unclear what you mean
22:00:51 <strcat[m]> you set a passphrase, PIN or pattern as the main unlock method same as other devices
22:00:51 <LinusSexTips[m]> You mean what options are available?
22:00:57 <hasnoname[m]> I know p4 doesn't have fingerprint unlocking mechanism
22:01:08 <strcat[m]> fingerprint unlock is never a primary unlock mechanism
22:01:20 <strcat[m]> it's only available as a secondary unlock mechanism like other biometric unlock
22:01:36 <strcat[m]> the Pixel 4 has a facial IR scanner instead of fingerprint IR scanner
22:01:56 <strcat[m]> either way that is NOT available as a primary unlock method
22:01:58 <strcat[m]> only secondary unlock
22:02:01 <strcat[m]> same as all biometrics
22:02:17 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "it's only available as a seconda"> Right, facial scanner works with GOS? I wasnt sure if Gos is compatible with project soli
22:02:34 <strcat[m]> don't think it has to do with project soli
22:02:41 <strcat[m]> the facial scanner works fine
22:03:23 <hasnoname[m]> Oh ok
22:03:31 <strcat[m]> high level implementation is not much different from fingerprint unlock
22:03:34 <hasnoname[m]> I thought both were linked
22:03:36 <strcat[m]> just a different biometric unlock method
22:04:05 <strcat[m]> OS doesn't have much involvement in it the hardware does it
22:04:12 <strcat[m]> and TEE
22:04:46 <hasnoname[m]> Thanks. Works well in dark as well?
22:06:15 <strcat[m]> doesn't have to do with visible light spectrum
22:06:37 <strcat[m]> it would work fine in total darkness
22:06:47 <strcat[m]> it's just a fancier version of fingerprint scanning really
22:06:52 <strcat[m]> 3D IR scanning of your face
22:07:17 <strcat[m]> not much different aside from fancier hardware - makes little difference to the OS
22:07:23 <strcat[m]> it's treated fairly similarly
22:07:35 <strcat[m]> and for apps too
22:08:12 <strcat[m]> it has some additional settings exposed that weren't available in Settings for fingerprint unlock
22:08:36 <strcat[m]> like disabling face unlock and using it only to authorize access to app keys, etc.
22:08:55 <strcat[m]> that exists for fingerprint unlock but isn't in the standard UI for whatever reason
22:09:26 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: it's really not very different and apps that moved on to BiometricManager from FingerprintManager support both already
22:15:43 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "hasnoname: it's really not very "> Thanks for the explanation
22:53:45 <grindlefang[m]> Is building Vanadium still broken ?
