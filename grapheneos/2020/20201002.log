00:22:40 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone have any alternatives to the news app on iOS
00:23:21 <bypassbobby[m]> * Anyone have any alternatives to the news app on iOS  on graphene
00:36:39 <alzxjm[m]1> bypassbobby: not really. I use the RSS app Newsblur, which is nice because it loads whole webpages (when possible)
00:37:07 <poisonoushydra> https://news.ycombinator.com <--- You can subscribe to this feed for some good IT / Cybersecurity news.
00:39:07 <poisonoushydra> I tend to just use a local news outlet and subscribe to the feeds I want to stay current on (such as https://www.cbc.ca/rss/ for Canada).
00:43:54 <poisonoushydra> You have to pay for Newsblur, though?
00:45:22 <alzxjm[m]1> Yep. Don't you have to pay for Apple News too?
00:45:41 <alzxjm[m]1> Is a subscription package I thought.
00:45:55 <alzxjm[m]1> You could use Google News in Vanadium without an account.
00:47:10 <alzxjm[m]1> It works just like the app. Might even be a PWA but I'm not sure how to tell.
00:48:52 <poisonoushydra> Oh wait... there is a free option but the distinction between the free versus paid option is not very clear.
00:50:05 <alzxjm[m]1> I think you can only add a limited amount of feeds on the free version.
00:50:39 <alzxjm[m]1> Use it and if you like it, pay up. It's important to support FOSS projects and their developers.
00:50:56 <alzxjm[m]1> There are myriad RSS apps.
00:58:25 <poisonoushydra> Hmm... the site is confusing and cluttered but the app itself seems to work well. Thanks for the suggestion.
01:03:33 <alzxjm[m]1> The UI is...not amazing. Miniflux is a really great service you can self-host. Which I've done. Sort of the opposite of Newsblur in how minimalist it is. But Newsblur loads whole pages including metadata (blog author, tags, etc), which is awesome.
01:09:33 <poisonoushydra> I believe I was using Aggregator for a while but the interface was just too clunky for me.
01:10:11 <poisonoushydra> It also has not been updated since 2018 so that concerns me.

I am on a 3a XL atm (this is my primary phone, can't do much on it). I just had my internship's pay and wanted to work on Pixel 5. But we will not get upstream AOSP before months so I prefer working on an older device. The 4a was in my choice, but what suits the best for you since you are

05:53:09 <anon_reee> I'm using DAVx5 to sync my calendar with Graphene's default calendar app. but the calendar has no settings, I can't see if it has notifications or not? or how to configure notifications?
05:56:04 <anon_reee> the default calendar app is honestly pretty shitty. I think it should be updated with something a lot more robust. you should be able to create/edit events on the phone; events should be listed in the monthly view without having to click a specific day; and there should be settings for customising notifications etc
05:56:35 <anon_reee> that's a pivotal feature for a lot of users. especially non-tech savvy users. they won't know how to use the calendar app or what DAVx5 is.
06:00:57 <null[m]> Have you tried Etar? It's ever so slightly better than stock.
06:01:09 <kryptonymous[m]> Search the channel for calendar recommendations. The app is basically just a placeholder. Last I remember Daniel recommended Etar.

06:20:34 <anon_reee> Etar is a lot better
06:20:38 <anon_reee> that should work
07:25:36 <cn3m> Vincent Le Roux: I don’t know but if it is you should make an issue on GitHub
09:03:36 <anupritaisno1[m4> <cn3m "GrapheneOS has far better privac"> grapheneos actually has better performance. look at the code
09:04:14 <anupritaisno1[m4> it is just the initial app lauch time that gets affected. grapheneos will run the actual apps a lot faster
09:06:20 <cn3m> GrapheneOS is smoother from a technical level is my understanding, but using both I’d say a marginal win goes to CalyxOS

09:54:29 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, that's why update to 21
09:54:54 <auditor> ok
09:55:02 <auditor> how can update the app?
09:55:17 <auditor> it usually updates itself
09:56:28 <alzxjm[m]1> Download the apk from the releases section on github. It's signed with the same signature so you can update it.

11:13:08 <mrxx_0[m]> @redu
11:13:41 <mrxx_0[m]> redu321: What phone do you have ? Which build version ? And stable or beta ?
11:14:27 <redu321[m]> I have a pixel 4. stable version
12:15:08 <zfnmxt> I'm sure this question has been asked many times, so I apologize for the repetition. Can we reasonably expect the Pixel 5 to be supported in the future? (Or, perhaps better, is there a reason that we *shouldn't* expect it to be?)
12:17:04 <Sheru[m]> <zfnmxt "I'm sure this question has been "> Hire a maintainer then it'll be reasonable
12:17:09 <Sheru[m]> Or find one
12:17:38 <Sheru[m]> <zfnmxt "I'm sure this question has been "> There is. Without a dedicated device maintainer, no new phones will be supported
12:17:46 <zfnmxt> Sheru[m]: I guess I meant aside from the proverbial we-need-a-maintainer bit.
12:18:01 <zfnmxt> I.e., perhaps the security hardware of the device isn't fit for the project or something. That's what I was getting at.
12:18:47 <Sheru[m]> Oh, assuming Pixel 5 retains Pixel 4 security and support for custom verified boot sure
12:19:24 <dazinism> It would be a pretty big shock if a future Pixel wasnt suitable.
12:20:09 <Sheru[m]> <dazinism "It would be a pretty big shock i"> It is possible when they don't custom verified boot keys the moment they switched to their own chips
12:20:20 <zfnmxt> Okay, thanks. :)
12:20:30 <dazinism> Unlike every other phone manufacturer Google put in a fair bit of work to support full security features with alternative operating systems
12:21:10 <Sheru[m]> <dazinism "Unlike every other phone manufac"> None comes close as of now
12:21:10 <dazinism> Also the hardware security is top notch
12:21:22 <zfnmxt> I'll just wait until grapheneOS is officially supported on the 5 or the 4a, I guess. :)
12:21:38 <zfnmxt> (Or, *if*, I guess!)
12:22:20 <dazinism> All other companies, even the other Android giants, make a bit of a mess of security.
12:22:27 <alzxjm[m]1> <dazinism "Unlike every other phone manufac"> As I understand it Qualcomm is the party here that makes alternate OS's with lockable bootloaders really possible. Google just doesn't restrict that ability in the way that other OEMs do.
12:22:31 <alzxjm[m]1> Not that it matters in practice.
12:23:11 <Sheru[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "Not that it matters in practice."> Samsung kills the support for custom verified boot for most part and releases way less source code for vendor and stuff
12:23:46 <Sheru[m]> Which was the second supposedly candidate
12:24:20 <alzxjm[m]1> <Sheru[m] "Samsung kills the support for cu"> I meant that it doesn't really matter whom we have to thank between Google and Qualcomm that Pixels are so friendly to non-stock OS's. It certainly does matter that Samsung mucks it up so badly.
12:25:28 <Sheru[m]> <Sheru[m] "Which was the second supposedly "> This is just my opinion tbh
12:25:43 <dazinism> Google and Qualcomm both put in efforts.

12:40:18 <Boggy> Newbie question here I want to grab the APK of Ledger Live from another phone and install on my graphene handset. Is this a bad idea security wise?
12:41:34 <Boggy> im prsuming the best way is to use ADB backup command
12:42:31 <voodoo> Hi, i wonder if a phone with grapheneos is installed, without sim and on airplane mode, connected to a MIFI hotspot, can location be traced? And can data leaknthru the mifi spot? Wil the mifi hotspot show what imei is connected to it?
12:43:21 <Sheru[m]> Depends?
12:43:28 <Sheru[m]> Might want to check the apk signature through https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.oF2pks.applicationsinfo/
12:43:32 <Boggy> voodoo My understanding if Grapene will change mac address
12:43:43 <Boggy> *rotate MAC
12:44:18 <voodoo> Yes mac is rotating but i dont know if the mifi wil show the imei from connected device
12:44:20 <Boggy> Sheru[m]thanks man ill do that
12:44:52 <Sheru[m]> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps#Verifying_apk_files_and_apps
12:44:56 <voodoo> If not than airplane mode with graphene connected to mifi would be fully anonymous
12:44:58 <Sheru[m]> This will help
12:44:59 <Boggy> @voodoo the Mifi will show imei to the ISP
12:45:37 <Boggy> but wont show the IMEI of the graphene handset
12:45:46 <Sheru[m]> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups#adb_backup
12:45:50 <voodoo> So the mifi will show and it s own imei and my phone imei because i m connected to it?
12:46:17 <voodoo> Ow sorry i did not rwad your last , thank you
12:46:37 <Boggy> nope it wont pass the imei of the graphene handset
12:46:45 <voodoo> And if someone would hack my mifi , my graphene phone would not be compromised?
12:49:48 <Boggy> @voodoo unlikely, but its out of my my knowledge. im pretty sure Graphene has hardened 802.1x ip stack
12:50:17 <voodoo> oke thank you very much for the reply boggy
13:03:43 <graphenefan> is ther any proven premium non pixel phone that works perfectly with grapehenos?
13:04:06 <Sheru[m]> None as of now
13:07:45 <Sheru[m]> See freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos for quick earlier discussion about some devices not meeting the conditions and other past messages on similar topics
13:29:22 <dazinism> Yeah the 1st big problem is no other phone vendor is providing proper support for verified boot with alternative operating systems.
13:29:40 <dazinism> OnePlus is closest, but they keep messing it up real bad
13:30:28 <dazinism> Its like they want to, but keep failing big, in different ways
13:31:26 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/verified-boot
13:32:50 <dazinism> Also apparently the rest of the security is a mess.

18:44:24 <curiousabe[m]> dazinism: ok thanks, I'll update it to android 11 first then
19:14:47 <bonjour> hello! i just installed grapheneos on my pixel 3a. i have also installed the auditor app on the pixel 3a and my old pixel (1). however when my pixel 3a (auditee) scans the qr code of the pixel (auditor), i get a massive error message "Error encountered generating attestation: Failed to verify certificate Certificate:". What should I do?
19:18:32 <propertype[m]> <bonjour "hello! i just installed graphene"> Known Problem. There is already a new version of auditor in play store that has not yet been pushed to grapheme.
19:20:07 <alzxjm[m]1> bonjour:  Please go here: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases/tag/21 and download the APK.
19:20:07 <alzxjm[m]1> Install that. It contains a fix.
19:20:28 <alzxjm[m]1> That APK is signed with the same signature as the Auditor app in your Graphene install so it will upgrade successfully.
19:20:32 <bonjour> thanks!
19:20:48 <alzxjm[m]1> bonjour: Auditor-21.apk, to be clear.
19:21:30 <lev[m]> hmm since the latest patch Slack crashes on start
19:21:49 <lev[m]> I've captured the crash in a log, but I am having difficulty finding the relevant piece
19:22:11 <lev[m]> oh also it looks like there is a teeny incremental update available, checking to see if that improves anything
19:22:21 <lev[m]> and it does
19:22:23 <lev[m]> lol
19:22:24 <lev[m]> crisis averted
19:28:50 <bonjour> should i be discouraged from installing any google apps on my new grapheneos phone?
19:29:34 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, some of them don't even work
19:29:48 <Sheru[m]> But it depends on what you use it fot
19:30:07 <Sheru[m]>  * But it depends on what you use it fof
19:30:18 <Sheru[m]>  * But it depends on what you use it for
19:30:36 <Sheru[m]> Some said maps and gboard works
19:32:33 <alzxjm[m]1> Google Photos works as an offline gallery for editing. No Google account, Network permission denied.
19:32:37 <alzxjm[m]1> Google Maps works well.
19:33:03 <alzxjm[m]1> Gboard works fine, but does not have offline dictation as it does on Pixels with Play Services.
19:35:06 <bonjour> alright cool. would it be safe to use gboard?
19:35:19 <bonjour> or you know safer than it would be to use it on the stock os
19:36:14 <alzxjm[m]1> bonjour: The lead GrapheneOS developer, strcat, has said that the keyboard is highly trusted and turning off permissions will not magically make it "safe" and that if you don't trust it you shouldn't use it.
19:36:24 <Sheru[m]> By using the keyboard app, it is trusted with what you type and what is on the clipboard
19:36:38 <bonjour> yeah makes sense
19:36:50 <Sheru[m]>  * By using the keyboard app, it is trusted with typestrokes and what is on the clipboard
19:37:00 <alzxjm[m]1> For my part, sometimes Gboard is easier to use for gesture typing so I use it with the Network perm denied and hope for the best. As much as possible I try to use the stock (GrapheneOS) keyboard.
19:37:25 <bonjour> do you have any good keyboard recommendations? or should i just stick with the stock keyboard like yourself?
19:37:57 <alzxjm[m]1> AnySoftKeyboard has swipe typing as a beta features, which works OK.
19:38:15 <alzxjm[m]1> As much as is possible it's good to use stock apps because they're already trusted.
19:38:42 <bonjour> nice thanks!
19:38:46 <alzxjm[m]1> Installing 3rd party apps, especially ones with access to sensitive data like keystrokes, only adds more parties you have to trust.
19:38:56 <Sheru[m]> Stick with GrapheneOS keyboard if possible, minimize internet exposure of non-stock keyboard, as app-to-app communication does not usually check for permissions
19:39:59 <bonjour> will do! too bad i've not been able to get rid of my google account yet. i think youtube is probably the sole reason i keep it around these days
19:40:25 <bonjour> do any of you use the youtube app? that is if you watch youtube at all
19:44:53 <alzxjm[m]1> bonjour: NewPipe
19:45:06 <alzxjm[m]1> NewPipe is better than the YouTube app even on stock.
19:45:07 <alzxjm[m]1> It's in a custom F-Droid repo.
19:48:30 <bonjour> alzxjm[m]1: lovely! i'll have a look :-)
20:09:19 <anupritaisno1[m4> <alzxjm[m]1 "NewPipe is better than the YouTu"> Disagree. Discussion in OT
20:41:50 * curiousabe[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UQhTLKqGWsFGAnxmXmbionNe/message.txt >
20:42:38 <curiousabe[m]> I also tried running the bat file but that just opens up a cmd windows that instalntly shuts down
20:43:57 <anupritaisno1[m4> [curiousabe](https://matrix.to/#/@curiousabe:matrix.org): would you like some remote support?
20:44:12 <curiousabe[m]> anupritaisno1: wow that would be super kind of you!
20:44:34 <anupritaisno1[m4> No it's just that I have nothing to do while this build finishes
20:44:47 <anupritaisno1[m4> Might as well
20:45:00 <curiousabe[m]> super appriciated!
20:45:23 <anupritaisno1[m4> Pm me then
21:01:27 <anupritaisno1[m4> issue solved
23:27:06 <strcat[m]> we're making a new release bundling v21 of Auditor
23:27:17 <strcat[m]> the secure element on certain devices has a time issue after a certain date
23:27:23 <strcat[m]> we had to work around it
23:27:39 <strcat[m]> should get an upstream fix in the next few months, until then we need to just work around it
23:27:50 <strcat[m]> I've been talking to the Android keystore lead about it
23:31:27 <strcat[m]> you can install the v21 Auditor update from either https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases/tag/21 or the Play Store for now
23:31:43 <strcat[m]> both are signed with the same key so you can install updates to PdfViewer and Auditor via Aurora Store if you want on GrapheneOS
23:32:18 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/compare/20...21
23:32:26 <strcat[m]> pretty small release just changing our workaround - we knew about the problem and previously worked around it in v19
23:32:39 <strcat[m]> but the symptoms of it got worse simply from time passing because it's some weird time encoding bug
23:32:48 <strcat[m]> in how time is synced from OS -> secure element
23:33:06 <strcat[m]> basically for purposes like throttling things the secure element has a secure internal timer
23:33:21 <strcat[m]> but for simply setting dates on certificates, etc. it uses time it gets from the OS
23:33:41 <strcat[m]> and that's somehow being synced to it wrong - not just on GrapheneOS, this happens on the stock OS too, it's an Android 11 issue in the OS or the secure element firmware on Pixels
23:33:45 <strcat[m]> unsure
23:34:03 <strcat[m]> we first noticed it on the stock OS and v19 had the initial workaround to fix it for stock (before GrapheneOS for Android 11 was released to Beta)
