00:09:59 <TheJollyRoger> Building in progress!
00:10:52 <aeonsolution[m]> \o/
00:12:27 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you aeonsolution[m]!!!
00:12:31 <TheJollyRoger> And Thank you JTL!!!
00:12:36 <TheJollyRoger> and thank you strcat!
00:12:37 <JTL> :)
00:12:57 <aeonsolution[m]> :^)
00:20:13 <brenneke[m]> Has anyone actually seen Signal app from web update automatically? Installed from web APK, have it blacklisted in Aurora and been watching....web version recently updated but no update to phone. Is there anything I can do to make it happen?
00:21:19 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: yep, it updates for me all the time.
00:21:33 <dazinism> brenneke: dont know if it gets every update. But I'm pretty sure I had it try, at least once.
00:22:14 <TheJollyRoger> Now that the commands work, I think I'm going to give this a fresh start to make sure I can repeat the process.
00:23:18 <aeonsolution[m]> TheJollyRoger: Hey Jolly, if you are building the development branch, it should build and flash no problem but there are issues with the OS that come originate from android-prepare-vendor.
00:23:23 <dazinism> I use the "unofficial Firefox" Fdroid repo. Which I think is 'curated' by one of the DAV5x decelopers
00:23:28 <TheJollyRoger> aeonsolution[m]: got it!
00:23:30 <dallemon[m]> <brenneke[m] "Has anyone actually seen Signal "> Usually it will prompt you not too long before it expires
00:23:39 <TheJollyRoger> I think I might have to order another phone for development XD.
00:23:49 <JTL> Ahahhaa
00:24:49 <dazinism> Theres at least 3 Fdroid repos that scrape the apk from the Signal website.
00:25:48 <dazinism> Unofficial Firefox, CalyxOS and some other, I cant remember right now.
00:26:14 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "brenneke: yep, it updates for me"> OK thanks, maybe give it a few days and reboots.
00:27:42 * brenneke[m] posted a file: Screenshot_20200520-182729.png (159KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/AuVVYTGVDegMuKMkMaxNDLJS >
00:27:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It sometimes takes a little bit of "kicking"
00:28:06 <brenneke[m]> Just turned that on, might help?
00:28:16 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, just keep it online and let it ping.
01:32:25 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: can you point me to chromium base 83, I'm been looking here:
01:32:26 <aeonsolution[m]> https://chromium.googlesource.com/
01:32:26 <aeonsolution[m]> https://source.chromium.org/chromium?originalUrl=https:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F
01:36:10 <renlord>  aeonsolution[m] you need to checkout the tag
01:36:28 <renlord> sync the chromium repository
01:36:33 <renlord> then checkout the 83 tagv
01:36:50 <renlord> then apply the vanadium patches
01:36:57 <renlord> fix conflicts along the way
01:37:02 <renlord> then update the patches upstream
01:37:34 <renlord> so strcat can re-apply the patches without issue and then he'll build it and ship it in the next release
01:40:53 <twitx[m]> Is it safe to turn off OEM Unlocking (I've onced messed up my system disabling this) but can it be disabled or should I just leave it enabled?
01:40:57 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, so i think i found the tags, but I don't know which one is base 83
01:41:05 <aeonsolution[m]> https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/10.0.601.0:?originalUrl=https:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F
01:41:35 <aeonsolution[m]> <twitx[m] "Is it safe to turn off OEM Unloc"> no, you need to lock it to complete the install to have verified boot
01:42:14 <aeonsolution[m]> ignore that, i misread
01:43:40 <aeonsolution[m]> why are you trying to OEM Unlock your device?
01:44:53 <twitx[m]> No I've activated it when installing GrapheneOS I just want to make sure you can disable it without somehow not being able to boot (reflashing the device)
01:46:43 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#disabling-oem-unlocking
01:46:48 <twitx[m]> * No I've activated it when installing GrapheneOS I just want to make sure you can disable it without somehow not being able to boot (which then leads to reflashing the device)
01:47:14 <twitx[m]> Ohh okay thanks
01:47:30 <aeonsolution[m]> you're welcome
01:56:33 <tomg0770[m]> hello
01:57:38 <madaidan[m]> <tomg0770[m] "hello"> Hi
01:57:51 <tomg0770[m]> I was wondering if someone can help me with my Pixel 3 XL not being able to flash? I apologize if this isn't what this chat is for. I just been trying all day and losing patiences lol
02:17:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> tomg0770: ask a specific question/give a specific symptom and someone will surely help
02:56:28 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy tomg0770[m], what problem are you having? I can walk you through the process later or send you a prepare-host script if you can tell me what operating system you're running, and what's going on. As a quick sanity check, make sure when you hit fastboot --version, it returns at least 30.0. If it doesn't, you're going to get the "no OS found" error.
03:00:34 <cyredanthem[m]> TheJollyRoger: you're a natural treasure
03:02:03 <graphman2020[m]> Hi TheJollyRoger new to this OS. Tomorrow I will be installing Graphene in an Pixel 3 using windows 10- I know..I Know. Would appreciate if you could send me a host script. Thanks in advance.
03:03:13 <madaidan[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "TheJollyRoger: you're a natural "> Everyone loves TheJollyRoger
03:03:45 <cyredanthem[m]> graphman2020: Windows 10 has excellent anti exploitation. Depending on your threat model it can make a lot of sense
03:05:05 <madaidan[m]> Wouldn't call it "excellent". More "decent".
03:05:34 <cyredanthem[m]> Excellent for a desktop OS you can easily get?
03:06:02 <renlord> it has more decent out-of-box security than i'd say gnu/linux
03:06:06 <cyredanthem[m]> Decent in the grand scale of things
03:06:06 <madaidan[m]> GrapheneOS or at least AOSP would be what I call excellent
03:06:18 <renlord> it being windows 10
03:06:24 <graphman2020[m]> Madaidanüëçüèª
03:06:44 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "it has more decent out-of-box se"> Linux has no security
03:07:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hi graphman2020[m], you won't need much of a prepare-host script, since you'll have no dependencies and you won't have udev.
03:07:37 <renlord> madaidan[m]: why?
03:07:38 <madaidan[m]> It's like running everything in ring 0 due to the complete lack of any real boundaries/mitigations
03:07:55 <renlord> but you inherently trust that the kernel does correct things
03:08:06 <TheJollyRoger> You'll just need to download platform-tools-latest.zip from Google Android. There is nothing wrong with running Windows 10. We aren't a bunch of privacy neckbeards rehashing old privacy security myths :)
03:08:14 <graphman2020[m]> TheJollyRoger: got it. Thanks
03:08:15 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm trying to think of one aspect of Linux that has relatively good security on a desktop system
03:08:25 <renlord> i assume in windows its the same, you expect SYSTEM to be doing correct things 100% of the time
03:09:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. If you still run into trouble I can jump in and walk you through it, but on Windows 10 you have no dependencies, no e2fsprogs to install, no udev rules to whitelist... you won't have to deal with the bogosities that Linux has accumulated.
03:09:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ehehe X3. I appreciate the support guys :D
03:09:49 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "but you inherently trust that th"> By "Linux" I'm referring to the standard Linux distro
03:10:11 <cyredanthem[m]> Debian for example doesn't have any meaningful security model even compared to Windows 10..
03:10:17 <cyredanthem[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Debian for example doesn't have "> Windows 10 at least tries
03:10:36 <TheJollyRoger> graphman2020[m]: a majority of problems occur when you run an old or depreciated version of fastboot. Make sure to do a quick sanity check by running "fastboot --version" and it returns something like 30.0.[something].
03:10:43 <renlord> binutils dont even run things in ring0
03:10:56 <renlord> still a bit vague to me
03:11:22 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "binutils dont even run things in"> "It's like"
03:11:50 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixel 3 handsets need fastboot to support autodetection or you'll get the infamous "no operating system found" error. So make sure you use platform-tools-latest.
03:12:04 <TheJollyRoger> and it is at least 30.
03:12:16 <madaidan[m]> For an attacker to get easy code execution in ring 0, they just need to intercept/keylog the sudo password then `modprobe`
03:12:23 <Shippwrecked[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "I'm trying to think of one aspec"> It has security through obscurity that's really it
03:12:24 <graphman2020[m]> TheJollyRoger: So far unlocked bootlouder, now just flash the OS.
03:12:58 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Oh yeah. One more thing... use the USB A to USB C cable that came with the device. Plug it directly into the motherboard, not into a front port and not into a hub.
03:13:04 <renlord> madaidan[m]: sounds like a dodgy distro
03:13:09 <graphman2020[m]> I already feel at home here
03:13:17 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
03:13:17 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "madaidan.: sounds like a dodgy d"> Sounds like every distro
03:13:39 <cyredanthem[m]> > madaidan.: sounds like a dodgy distro
03:13:39 <cyredanthem[m]> Name me one that's no trivial to pull this off,
03:14:16 <TheJollyRoger> The reason for this is that fastboot will use all the traces of your USB cable, and sometimes hubs and cheap cables skimp on these.
03:14:28 <TheJollyRoger> Sometimes, even front ports too.
03:14:38 <graphman2020[m]> TheJollyRoger: My problem my machine is a laptop with no USB port. So I have to use a hub.
03:14:53 <TheJollyRoger> Plug it directly into the laptop then, if you can. It won't take too long.
03:15:36 <graphman2020[m]> TheJollyRoger: got it. Will see how things go tomorrow
03:16:02 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, best of luck!
03:16:53 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): Seriously I'm not aware of a single Linux distro beside ChromeOS(partially Qubes, but on technicality) that correctly protects the root account.
03:17:06 <graphman2020[m]> TheJollyRoger: ay ah captain. If I run into rough waters I‚Äôll make sure to post here.
03:17:25 <renlord> cyredanthem[m]: how do you mean by protect?
03:17:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr! :) I might be asleep but ping my name and that usually gets me if I'm near my PC.
03:18:13 <cyredanthem[m]> Not have a trivial bypass like fakesudo, or ld_preload attacks, /proc/ leaks, or whatever you want to get the root password
03:18:20 <graphman2020[m]> üëåüèªüëåüèª
03:18:25 <cyredanthem[m]> I could list more, but that covers the basics
03:19:19 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "cyredanthem: how do you mean by "> That doesn't allow trivial privilege escalation
03:19:41 <cyredanthem[m]> KickSecure did great work so far. My only hiccup is not having Wayland yet. Epic work so far.
03:19:59 <madaidan[m]> I can setup a keylogger for your sudo password using X11, /proc, LD_PRELOAD etc.
03:20:13 <renlord> yes agreed ^
03:20:18 <cyredanthem[m]> You published code for at least one of those
03:20:26 <madaidan[m]> Or I can just make your sudo command do something else with `sudo() { ... }` or changing $PATH
03:21:02 <cyredanthem[m]> Can you explain the first one. I've never done that
03:21:20 <madaidan[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Can you explain the first one. I"> You mean X11?
03:21:58 <madaidan[m]> Find your keyboard ID with `xinput list` then run `xinput test X`
03:21:58 <madaidan[m]> X being the keyboard ID.
03:22:12 <renlord> xorg gives me nightmares
03:22:16 <cyredanthem[m]> No the changing your sudo command
03:22:25 <renlord> one of many compelling reasons for me to just use windows as base
03:22:31 <cyredanthem[m]> So technically that's the only attack you know of that works on KickSecure right now? madaidan.
03:22:49 <madaidan[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "No the changing your sudo comman"> Run `sudo() { echo "rekt lmao"; }` in your shell
03:23:07 <cyredanthem[m]> Thanks
03:23:19 <madaidan[m]> Would be easy to make it intercept the password
03:24:03 <madaidan[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "So technically that's the only a"> https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation
03:24:12 <renlord> i suppose, just running an erroneous application will give you easy access
03:24:51 <cyredanthem[m]> <madaidan[m] "Would be easy to make it interce"> madaidan.: danke I'll read that again been a few weeks
03:24:59 <cyredanthem[m]> I probably missed or forgot some stuff
03:28:46 <renlord> probably have to spend some time to properly setup windows 10
03:28:54 <renlord> any good windows 10 hardening stuff?
03:29:13 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "any good windows 10 hardening st"> Delete system32
03:29:23 <renlord> will it still boot ok?
03:29:30 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): use macOS
03:29:30 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "will it still boot ok?"> Yes
03:29:33 * TheJollyRoger cackles.
03:29:39 <madaidan[m]> It's just additional attack surface
03:29:51 <renlord> cyredanthem[m]: this is desktop
03:30:05 <renlord> and i dont want to go thru the pains of tinkering a hackintosh
03:30:22 <cyredanthem[m]> Verified boot, privacy, no root app installs so profiles are semi isolated, other stuffs.
03:30:34 <TheJollyRoger> Outta curiosity... has anyone ever here used Windows Server in Server Core?
03:31:08 <renlord> i think in a server setting, linux is ok
03:31:18 <renlord> if you appropriately sandbox everything
03:31:36 <TheJollyRoger> A while back I got some Windows Server licenses through my school because the school were simply giving them away, and I was too cheap to buy Windows 7 so I simply installed Windows Server 2008R2 and then dressed it up as regular Windows.
03:32:00 <cyredanthem[m]> > and i dont want to go thru the pains of tinkering a hackintosh
03:32:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Hackintosh really doesn't have verified boot(not that macOS verified boot is perfect). It has verified boot in bios on Hackintosh
03:32:27 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "if you appropriately sandbox eve"> Until you're hit with remote kernel exploits because not applying prehistoric security measures isn't exactly a good idea
03:32:32 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 is pretty comparable to Hackintosh in my opinion. macOS wins on privacy though
03:32:43 <cyredanthem[m]> Hackintosh is at least FOSS for all the non Apple stuff
03:33:15 <renlord> windows 10 now ships windows sandbox as a feature
03:34:04 <cyredanthem[m]> > > <@freenode_renlord:matrix.org> if you appropriately sandbox everything
03:34:04 <cyredanthem[m]> > Until you're hit with remote kernel exploits because not applying prehistoric security measures isn't exactly a good idea
03:34:04 <cyredanthem[m]> Exactly, Desktop security is screwed in general. Server is where Linux really doesn't shine
03:34:37 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 Sandbox is amazing
03:34:37 <cyredanthem[m]> I browser in there exclusively
03:34:38 <cyredanthem[m]> I know it's my gaming rig so gaming is the most risky part, but still
03:34:56 <renlord> cant you run gaming inside the windows sandbox?
03:34:59 <renlord> my plan is to do that
03:35:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Haha no use Sandboxie in another profile
03:35:32 <cyredanthem[m]> That's what cn3m recommended at least
03:35:54 <renlord> have a link to this guide?
03:36:39 <cyredanthem[m]> cn3m is here I just can't ping him
03:36:58 <cyredanthem[m]> My app is stupid
03:37:09 <cyredanthem[m]> Can someone ping him?
03:37:10 <renlord> the reply-to from matrix displays very poorly on irc
03:37:14 <Shippwrecked[m]> cn3m:
03:37:25 <cn3m[m]> sup dudes
03:38:12 <cn3m[m]> create a gaming user in Windows > run Sandboxie and your games in a sandbox > profit. You can install them without admin access
03:38:13 <cn3m[m]> it also keeps everything contained to that profile
03:38:40 <cn3m[m]> steam and games have horrible security and privacy and should be isolated
03:38:45 <cn3m[m]> of course Sandboxie driver could be exploited
03:39:03 <renlord> no need to do crazy pcie passthrough shits yeah?
03:39:06 <cn3m[m]> however that's far less likely than the practical threats of installing everything with administration access
03:39:10 <cn3m[m]> no
03:39:29 <cn3m[m]> it's easy and technically open source
03:39:35 <renlord> sounds pretty usable to me
03:39:35 <cn3m[m]> it requires a signed driver thoiuh
03:39:37 <renlord> i will switch
03:39:58 <cn3m[m]> it's not emulated so performance is great
03:40:13 <cn3m[m]> it's hit and miss on what will run, but it should be pretty solid
03:40:14 <renlord> signed gpu driver?
03:40:33 <renlord> there are such things nowadays?
03:40:40 <cn3m[m]> Sandboxie has it's own driver
03:40:44 <cn3m[m]> It's signed
03:41:00 <cn3m[m]> so it's not easy to build and get your own signed
03:41:03 <cn3m[m]> it's doable, but it's not 100% open source
03:41:49 <cn3m[m]> Sandboxie has a lot of flaws, but if you contain everything to another profile you avoid them
03:43:16 <cn3m[m]> gaming is the biggest security and privacy risk on Windows imo so this stuff is pretty helpful
03:44:48 <cn3m[m]> Sandboxie virtual filesystems should be pretty manageable for moving games, but personally I have a dedicated system that I don't care if it gets pwned from gaming
03:45:20 <renlord> any success stories you'd like to share?
03:45:25 <renlord> pwning incidents?
03:45:34 <renlord> thwarted pwning incidents
03:46:25 <cyredanthem[m]> Keep in mind Sandboxie is not a great privacy tool since you can actually use TeamViewer inside of it. It's a cool tool in very specific scenarios
03:47:15 <cn3m[m]> @freenode_renlord:matrix.org well I don't want to take a chance with Chromium 79 with no sandbox on steam browser and running a ton of random apps
03:48:21 <cn3m[m]> there's also exploits I expect to become more common, but even StarCraft had exploits
03:48:32 <cn3m[m]> Minecraft is a very safe game since Java so there's a win for a Java game ironically
04:06:15 <matic_nick[m]> I've read of this "os" night few nights ago, apparently with same principle as Qubes but it utilizes kvm instead of xen. They did pretty compelling keypoints; sanbox etc. and how broken linux desktop is. Unfortunately it was a late night read on some github issues, I've been trying to track it down for discussions here.

04:12:34 <matic_nick[m]> <matic_nick[m] "I've read of this "os" night few"> I discovered it mentioned in a github issue. Fuck would've been a nice discussion. Thing I could faintly remember is the main dev is based on Ireland/Scotland? Apparently it had some backing by some orgs as well
04:14:20 <Shippwrecked[m]> I use whonix in live mode for general browsing
04:14:30 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Link?"> Forgot to bookmark it unfortunately.
04:14:35 <Shippwrecked[m]> Disk is read only so persistent exploits are hard without a sandbox escape
04:14:57 <Shippwrecked[m]> VMs run in KVM confined by SELinux
04:15:06 <cyredanthem[m]> I mean it's possible for sure
04:16:04 <Shippwrecked[m]> Not perfect but hard to do better on linux
04:18:01 <matic_nick[m]> <matic_nick[m] "Forgot to bookmark it unfortunat"> Apparently they're a security research as well. I was gonna ask here if they're legit but I just couldn't track it down
04:29:17 <cn3m[m]> I think most people here would recommend ChromeOS or macOS as they have more complete security models. These Linux systems usually don't do some major things or trust way too many random maintainers
04:29:33 <cn3m[m]> says as a Fedora used
04:29:47 <cn3m[m]> says as a Fedora user
04:34:00 <matic_nick[m]> Yeah but the my main issue with those is the device support limitations. But generally I don't really have problem recommending macos.
04:35:30 <matic_nick[m]> What's the community's consensus on Qubes though?
04:36:25 <cyredanthem[m]> > What's the community's consensus on Qubes though?
04:36:25 <cyredanthem[m]> Way too many maintainers and insecure guest OSs. It's also a one trick pony and leans hard on the Xen hypervisor
04:36:51 <cyredanthem[m]> It's good in a very specific way, not so much in the others
04:38:24 <cyredanthem[m]> In some ways Qubes is less secure than Fedora. If I recall correctly it turns off SELinux
04:38:34 <matic_nick[m]> There have been some talks incorporating Silvelblue into Qubes which is interesting
04:38:41 <cyredanthem[m]> It also runs on an older version of Fedora
04:39:06 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "It also runs on an older version"> That's the problem
04:39:12 <cyredanthem[m]> > There have been some talks incorporating Silvelblue into Qubes which is interesting
04:39:12 <cyredanthem[m]> Silverblue has no discernable advantages
04:39:51 <matic_nick[m]> https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1919#issuecomment-480546054
04:40:08 <cyredanthem[m]> It's using a poor sandbox, unenforced immutability, and lax SELinux rules
04:40:28 <cyredanthem[m]> If you understand the system and how it works it makes no difference exploiting it or regular Fedora
04:41:27 <matic_nick[m]> I agree
04:41:32 <cyredanthem[m]> Fedora Silverblue has no real security benefits
04:41:50 <cyredanthem[m]> Right now at least. All those features make it super stable
04:44:30 <youraveragecanuc> What are your thoughts on using Fedora with Wayland and flatpaks, with flatseal to restrict apps' access to things like the user's home directory?
04:45:41 <cyredanthem[m]> > What are your thoughts on using Fedora with Wayland and flatpaks, with flatseal to restrict apps' access to things like the user's home directory?

04:51:53 <cyredanthem[m]> Virtualization
04:52:45 <cyredanthem[m]> Kicksecure is close and has good stuff. It needs Wayland
04:56:41 <renlord> nsjail?
04:56:57 <renlord> you need to author your own profiles though
04:57:17 <renlord> its the same for sandboxie, i tried it just now
04:57:25 <renlord> you still need to configure the sandbox
04:58:53 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Kicksecure is close and has good"> Won't Debian make it less secure?
05:01:46 <cyredanthem[m]> matic_nick: yes sir
05:01:56 <cyredanthem[m]> Overall there are more important factors
05:02:03 <renlord> maybe i'll just use arch with nsjail for now
05:02:12 <renlord> im terribly unproductive on windows
05:05:30 <cyredanthem[m]> > you still need to configure the sandbox
05:05:30 <cyredanthem[m]> It's fine our of the box if you use another profile
05:09:13 <matic_nick[m]> Is there active collab between GrapheneOS and Qubes? I read early on there will be "some works"
05:09:24 <renlord> no
05:10:10 <matic_nick[m]> Ah that's unfortunate
05:10:37 <cyredanthem[m]> At some point it was floated that Qubes could use GrapheneOS, but no one worked on it
05:11:05 <JTL> I'd be curious how the UI would work, since the Android UI is really "mobile first"
05:11:16 <JTL> Feels kinda clunky "swiping" with the mouse
05:11:18 <JTL> etc
05:11:29 <cyredanthem[m]> Gestures on trackpad?
05:11:42 <JTL> Heh maybe
05:12:10 <JTL> Linux gesture support for trackpads has been iffy, and I don't know how easy it is to "pass through" to the VM
05:12:32 <cyredanthem[m]> True
05:12:44 <cyredanthem[m]> GrapheneOS is secure enough it's worth it I think
05:19:40 <matic_nick[m]> Yeah Qubes could really need some Grapheneos
05:31:34 <matic_nick[m]> Maybe off topic but I'm really curios. Is calyx in partnership with copperhead? I think I spotted "calyx" on copperhead site a while ago
05:32:24 <cyredanthem[m]> <matic_nick[m] "Yeah Qubes could really need som"> @nickcalyx:matrix.org:
05:32:33 <cyredanthem[m]> Whoops wrong quote
05:33:12 <cyredanthem[m]> I highly doubt it
05:33:25 <cyredanthem[m]> They could be using something the calyx people made?
05:33:41 <matic_nick[m]> They took it off now tho
05:33:58 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "They could be using something th"> Most likely
05:34:05 <cyredanthem[m]> Archive?
05:34:55 <cyredanthem[m]> I always check the site from an archive anyway. I don't ever want to give those slimeballs a view
05:37:39 <matic_nick[m]> Not in the archives too
05:46:20 <Shippwrecked[m]> <youraveragecanuc "What are your thoughts on using "> It would at least make fakesudo harder if an attacker can't easily write to .bashrc within the sandbox
05:47:00 <Shippwrecked[m]> I think flatpak is a decent project and doing what they can but you can't really fix the linux desktop security model at that level
06:05:30 <cyredanthem[m]> Flatpak doesn't really make a notable difference at all though
06:23:58 <Shippwrecked[m]> I like it more for cross platform compatibility reasons than security
06:24:18 <Shippwrecked[m]> You can't really fix linux desktop security without much deeper changes
06:38:30 <cyredanthem[m]> It's a lost cause. Only Google cracked it with ChromeOS and Android. Hopefully Kicksecure gets there
06:57:36 <renlord> ios is ok also
07:15:19 <mxnorvak[m]> On the topic of windows 10 hardening, are there any other recommendations besides removing system 32?
07:19:10 <renlord> the system32 removal is a meme
07:19:23 <renlord> kek
07:20:01 <JTL> ^^
07:20:07 <renlord> https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/delete-system32
07:20:21 <renlord> madaidan[m]: pls indicate sarcasm
07:20:29 <renlord> lulz
07:20:47 <renlord> i said many times, to the naive user, it is not obvious lol.
07:22:27 <cyredanthem[m]> > ios is ok also
07:22:27 <cyredanthem[m]> iOS is BSD
07:22:41 <cyredanthem[m]> iOS and macOS are the only sane examples of BSD done well
07:22:45 <cyredanthem[m]> Synopsis only really Google and Apple know what to do for security at all for consumers
07:22:58 <cyredanthem[m]> BSD for desktop is so laughable
07:24:04 <cyredanthem[m]> No sandbox for FreeBSD and it's friends. macOS is literally the only example of a BSD desktop with a comprehensive sandbox at all that suits browsers
07:25:50 <cyredanthem[m]> GrapheneOS > iOS > Android > ChromeOS > macOS > Windows 10 > everything else is filled with little trivial mistakes everywhere
07:25:55 <renlord> ios is not bsd anymore
07:26:22 <renlord> and i doubt macos can be called bsd also
07:26:59 <cyredanthem[m]> I mean Darwin is more BSD than it is Linux
07:27:14 <renlord> linux is not even unix
07:27:19 <renlord> like unix lulz
07:27:29 <cyredanthem[m]> I guess it's just Darwin now
07:29:35 <renlord> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU
07:38:42 <mxnorvak[m]> <renlord "i said many times, to the naive "> Yeah, i couldn't really tell xD,
07:39:57 <mxnorvak[m]> I'd like to know what you guys recommend tho
07:40:33 <renlord> an ipad
07:46:11 <cyredanthem[m]> iPad is the most secure desktop experience you'll find that's also private. ChromeOS is good for security (not quite iPadOS level), but not nearly as good for privacy.
07:46:50 <cyredanthem[m]> If you can get by with a basic Linux emulator. Desktop Safari. 3 window multitasking. You'll be fine
07:47:41 <cyredanthem[m]> If you can't then get another device to do what you can't on the iPad. I have a gaming PC so a Pixel with GrapheneOS and an iPad could work for me.
07:48:37 <cyredanthem[m]> mxnorvak: basically mobile OSs are very strong and desktop ones aren't. ChromeOS is the best featured one, but that's a privacy cost. You're chasing your tail trying to find a secure desktop
07:55:53 <cyredanthem[m]> I should note the cheap iPad doesn't have the latest security hardware features. I know the A10 that is using still has checkm8 flaw(basically you should reboot your tablet after leaving it unattended for more than 10 minutes every time). A11 was also a big jump for security hardening features. It's probably not a deal breaker and it's still much better than the alternative systems for a desktop, but it's worth
07:55:53 <cyredanthem[m]> noting that renlord probably meant the iPad Pro. The current chips are better and the iPad Pro has a better connection method for a keyboard.
08:35:22 <mxnorvak[m]> Thanks for all the explanations, tbh i was just looking for a way to harden the windows 10 i already have installed, Ipad doesn't have the functionalities i need although it's more secure
08:38:15 <cyredanthem[m]> > Thanks for all the explanations, tbh i was just looking for a way to harden the windows 10 i already have installed, Ipad doesn't have the functionalities i need although it's more secure
08:38:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 is pretty strong out of the box. Just make liberal use of the Windows sandbox
08:38:29 <cyredanthem[m]> Do you do any gaming?
08:39:25 <cyredanthem[m]> If you do any gaming I generally recommend using cn3m's method
08:39:33 <cyredanthem[m]> Having a gaming user and install all the games in Sandboxie(which is a super overrated program, but at least you don't need admin rights to install your games)
08:39:51 <cyredanthem[m]> Then your main profile isn't effected by the crap games doel
08:39:55 <cyredanthem[m]> Do*
08:41:27 <cyredanthem[m]> That's all I can think of beside normal privacy measures
08:42:06 <mxnorvak[m]> I do occasionally play some games, besides that it's all modeling and rendering and editing
08:42:54 <cyredanthem[m]> I guess reinstall Windows 2004 and do that method for the games
08:42:55 <mxnorvak[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Having a gaming user and install"> Sure I'll check it out thanks
08:45:42 <mxnorvak[m]> Do you know if always being logged as a standard user has any benefits? Just so that you aren't always in the admin user profile
08:46:39 <cyredanthem[m]> I am not a Windows expert so if someone is more knowledgeable please correct me
08:47:32 <cyredanthem[m]> However it shouldn't matter, beside the standard account has to put in the admin password beside just saying ok
08:47:34 <cyredanthem[m]> Which means shoulder surfing if you use that password anywhere else could be an issue
08:55:06 <mxnorvak[m]> Thanks :)
10:58:36 <matic_nick[m]> To those that builds what workstation are you guys rocking?
11:01:34 <renlord> ryzen 2700
11:03:15 <matic_nick[m]> How long does it compile? Last I did with my i7 4770 it took ages
11:04:17 <matic_nick[m]> And that was without all the mitigations
11:05:56 <renlord> maybe around 2 hours
11:06:10 <renlord> a bit less than 2 hours
11:13:12 <matic_nick[m]> Wow not too bad. I plan on upgrading soon maybe 3900x would suffice. I miss doing builds on my own lol.
12:30:08 <cdesai> https://partnerdash.google.com/apps/simulator/#?l=en&model=Pixel_4 this looks quite useful
13:33:00 <parazen616[m]> I use threema 4work. Since it's a one time purchase I can't install it via aurora. I don't want to install the Google play store. Is there another way to install paid apps? Most of the apps I use are open source projects anyway..
13:33:55 <parazen616[m]> But it would be nice to have those few which are not
14:29:45 <limitless0[m]> <parazen616[m] "I use threema 4work. Since it's "> Have you tried to log in top google playstore via browser?
15:41:13 <strcat> madaidan[m]: the ##linux-hardened channel does have some occasional activity but it's not frequent
15:41:25 <strcat> madaidan[m]: that whole area is way more dead than you would think especially with how it's covered
15:41:46 <strcat> madaidan[m]: it's the shared channel for linux-hardened + KSPP
15:41:50 <strcat> neither project has much going on
15:42:18 <strcat> it's mostly just Google doing a few things on their own and some other people doing things on their own
15:42:21 <strcat> not a coordinated project
16:23:21 <joeri_poeri[m]1> would installing gboard without network permissions and with no other google apps installed keep the app from leaking data?
16:29:33 <strcat> joeri_poeri[m]1: read what's written about the network and permission model / app communication elsewhere
16:29:39 <strcat> it's not a question specific to any given app
16:30:00 <joeri_poeri[m]1> ah okay good point!
16:36:01 <j3ghprjfo[m]> <parazen616[m] "I use threema 4work. Since it's "> I would contact the developer of the app and see if they can transfer you're license or at least honor your license without the play store. You would be surprised by how many developers will do this.
16:37:26 <nickcalyx[m]> Aurora let's you log in with google credentials to download your paid apps
16:37:48 <dallemon[m]> <parazen616[m] "I use threema 4work. Since it's "> I have installed several paid apps by using a real Google account with aurora, but it off course depends on the way their licensing works
17:04:58 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "madaidan.: that whole area is wa"> Oh, that's sad. I wanna help but I'd need ideas/a reference.
17:19:02 <stuux[m]> Are there any naming conventions for PRs ?
17:30:38 <aeonsolution[m]> i would suggest looking at the logs to figure out the patterns and follow the conventions set by the maintainers stuux, small commits are better because its hard to have conversations on a large set of changes
17:31:10 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it never really took off
17:31:33 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I made the channel early on and no one was really ever interested in contributing other than 1 inexperienced person who got driven off by people giving him trouble
17:31:46 <strcat[m]> anthraxx is just maintaining the code but some of it has faded away
17:31:55 <strcat[m]> and it's not really being actively developed / advanced
17:32:15 <strcat[m]> KSPP is just a term to refer to anyone working on hardening upstream and isn't a coordinated project
17:32:23 <strcat[m]> and there is really not that much going on
17:46:36 <mrxx_0[m]> To people who are working on Graphene what can I do to help ? Where can I start ? What notion ? It makes me sad that no one (as far as I know) is working to port GOS on the Pixel 4 .... And I want to fix that
17:49:53 <mrxx_0[m]> If someone can tell me where should I start I would gladly do it .. But I'm kinda lost in here
17:51:49 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <mrxx_0[m] "If someone can tell me where sho"> GrapheneOS.org/build
17:52:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Happy to have you around, kick some ass!
17:55:00 <mrxx_0[m]> Didn't think that there was an explanation on the website ... Thanks Danny@WorkOrderPro , first I need to get my hands on a Pixel 4
18:10:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> mrxx_0: The page name isn't as obvious for all of its purposes as it could be, maybe. Happy to help!
18:11:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Buy a 3a, they're like $160, haha, and the 4 has a weak battery from most reports.
18:13:57 <strcat> we need people to get the 4 and 4 XL and help with adding support for them
18:14:07 <strcat> Pixel 4a support will only be added if we add Pixel 4 and 4 XL support
18:14:18 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "anthraxx is just maintaining the"> That's one of the things I want to help with but I couldn't find any of those faded features.
18:14:28 <madaidan[m]> I've looked through a bunch of old releases.
18:14:28 <strcat> need people to start stepping up as maintainers for the already supported devices or they will not continue to be supported
18:14:45 <strcat> and we need maintainers for the Pixel 4 and 4 XL
18:14:52 <strcat> and later the Pixel 4a *if* those become supported
18:15:02 <strcat> if they aren't, Pixel 4a is not on the table as a possibly supported device
18:15:47 <anthraxx> madaidan[m]: strcat[m]: there is just a single one and its reverted in the tree for tracking
18:16:22 <strcat> anthraxx: assorted features were lost before you took over
18:16:36 <strcat> anthraxx: and didn't the feature of checking for zero on slab init also get lost - zeroing again on slab init isn't the same
18:16:40 <anthraxx> https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened/issues/4
18:16:46 <strcat> zero on free and checking for zero on init catches write-after-free
18:16:52 <strcat> zeroing again doesn't catch it
18:17:10 <anthraxx> strcat: thats still preserved
18:17:28 <strcat> ah
18:18:58 <madaidan[m]> <anthraxx "https://github.com/anthraxx/linu"> That looks like the feature is just wrong and not something that can be fixed.
18:27:59 <madaidan[m]> So is there anything else that was lost?
18:28:31 <anthraxx> madaidan[m]: guess only strcat can point us to it, was before my time :)
18:36:55 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: yes assorted things I can';t remember all of it
18:37:01 <strcat[m]> I was dropping stuff over time
18:37:06 <strcat[m]> because I didn't have time to redo it as things changed
18:37:26 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: not all the old tags / branches are in that old repo
18:38:19 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: yes assorted things I"> Can you remember any at all or point where to look?
18:39:38 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: not all the old tags "> Where are they then?
18:40:09 <madaidan[m]> The old thestinger/linux-hardened or copperhead/linux-hardened?
19:02:43 <strcat> madaidan[m]: AndroidHardeningArchive
19:05:32 <madaidan[m]> I couldn't find anything except stuff that was upstreamed.
19:05:56 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "madaidan.: AndroidHardeningArchi"> Yeah, I checked a bunch of old tags there.
19:06:18 <madaidan[m]> Might go searching again.
19:09:55 <ransome[m]> Hi. I'm running my Searx instance and would like use it as my default search engine for Vanadium. Is there any way to add it manually like I do on Chromium on my laptop?
19:11:17 <ransome[m]>  * Hi. I'm running my own Searx instance and would like use it as my default search engine for Vanadium. Is there any way to add it manually like I do on Chromium on my laptop?
19:15:49 <strcat[m]> ransome: go to the search engine, and add it via the menu
19:15:55 <strcat[m]> it shows recent search engines in the search engine menu
19:16:03 <strcat[m]> as long as they are properly implemented
19:17:42 <ransome[m]> That doesnt work for me :( On my laptop with ungoogled chromium it appears as a recently used search engine. On Vanadium it doesnt unfortunatel
19:17:43 <ransome[m]> y
19:18:47 <ransome[m]> Same happens when I use the Wikipedia search and I guess that's implemented propperly
19:19:01 <ransome[m]>  * Same happens when I use the Wikipedia search and I guess that's implemented properly

19:23:29 <strcat> ransome[m]: did you do a search with it
19:23:39 <ransome[m]> yes
19:24:21 <strcat> ransome[m]: dunno exactly how adding them works
19:24:42 <ransome[m]> usually like you described
19:24:55 <ransome[m]> at least on desktop chromium
19:25:45 <ransome[m]> I just installed Bromite and i'm havnig the same problem. Maybe it's a general restriction on mobile versions or forks of chromium
19:27:33 <strcat> ransome[m]: you can definitely add search engines but they may have to be done a certain way
19:27:41 <mrxx_0[m]> <ransome[m] "I just installed Bromite and i'm"> That would be weird
19:27:56 <ransome[m]> I agree
19:28:52 <strcat> ransome[m]: there needs to be an Open Search Description Document (OSDD)
19:29:01 <strcat> ransome[m]: try visiting the desktop site in Vanadium
19:29:14 <strcat> the issue may be that the mobile site doesn't provide the proper open search thing
19:29:20 <ransome[m]> good idea let me try
19:31:09 <ransome[m]> that actually worked with Wikipedia!
19:31:15 <ransome[m]> not for Searx though
19:31:28 <ransome[m]> i'll look up that OSDD thingy
19:31:30 <strcat> ransome[m]: does it show up as a recent search engine on desktop tho?
19:31:46 <ransome[m]> Wiki does yes
19:31:49 <strcat> the issue is just that for mobile they decided that by now everyone should have OSDD
19:31:56 <strcat> it's pretty stupid if their mobile site leaves it out
19:31:58 <ransome[m]> my own Searx instance does not though
19:32:19 <strcat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch
19:33:32 <mrxx_0[m]> Just to make sure, can I run a ROM on an emulator ? Or you must have the phone physically?
19:33:54 <strcat> mrxx_0[m]: what exactly are you talking about
19:34:20 <strcat> mrxx_0[m]: like what are you trying to do
19:34:38 <mrxx_0[m]> strcat I want to port Graphene for the Pixel 4
19:34:50 <strcat> you need a Pixel 4 for that
19:34:57 <strcat> there is an emulator but it is not helpful for this
19:35:03 <strcat> you need the hardware to add support for it
19:35:08 <mrxx_0[m]> OK I get it
19:35:39 <strcat> ransome[m]: https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md#examples
19:36:05 <ransome[m]> thanks
19:36:14 <strcat> dunno exactly how to set it up
19:36:23 <ransome[m]> I just looked it up and the opensearch.xml is on my server and is accessible
19:36:24 <strcat> but that's what chromium and firefox use for search engines
19:36:55 <strcat> it needs a link rel setup
19:36:57 <strcat> on the page
19:36:58 <ransome[m]> I'll dig depper into it, it's definitely the way to go here
19:37:01 <ransome[m]> thanks a lot
19:37:06 <strcat> https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md#autodiscovery
19:37:46 <strcat> https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/issues/891
19:37:46 <ransome[m]> I have this on the page: "<link title="searx" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" rel="search" href="/opensearch.xml"/>"
19:37:59 <strcat> do  you have BASE_URL set
19:38:11 <strcat> maybe it doesn't know the url to refer to your site
19:38:22 <ransome[m]> yep double checked it
19:38:43 <strcat> it might not support IP addresses if it's not a domain
19:39:18 <ransome[m]> it's a proper domain
19:48:22 <ransome[m]> I also tried some other public instances of Searx and those have the same problem than my private one. Next I'm going to try to figure out what Wikipedia does differently than the Searx instances in general
19:48:38 <strcat> maybe their opensearch is broken
19:49:45 <ransome[m]> could be, but if that's the case, it's only broken on mobile as on desktop it's works flawlessly (same for Firefox)
19:50:06 <strcat> it may be stricter for mobile
19:53:57 <ransome[m]> https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/issues/1666
19:54:06 <ransome[m]> ok it's a known thing and has been added to their milestones
19:56:12 <ransome[m]> strcat: Thanks again for the hint
19:56:30 <strcat> ransome[m]: probably something wrong with their opensearch setup
19:56:47 <strcat> ransome[m]: they sometimes take the opportunity to make things stricter on chromium for android
19:56:56 <strcat> since it's new relative to desktop
19:57:07 <strcat> so they don't feel a need to support legacy ways of doing things
19:57:50 <strcat> similarly I would not expect extensions until there is a very overhauled version of extensions that are much less of a privacy/security issue - if they add them at all
19:57:59 <ransome[m]> with almost open 500 issues on github I think it just doesn't get the priority atm
19:59:01 <ransome[m]> but as I'm hosting it myself I will take a look into the code and see if I can find anything that looks like they implemented it weirdly
20:00:01 <mrxx_0[m]> No one here has a Pixel 4 or 4 XL ?
20:00:01 <mrxx_0[m]> I'm a student (21) with no job and I already bought the 3A XL in March. I really want to help Graphene, but should I start to work for the 3A first ? What is your advise ? :)
20:04:59 <strcat> dunno but the project needs a lot of help
20:05:05 <strcat> right now I need help migrating Vanadium to Chromium 83
20:05:21 <strcat> there are major issues and I've invested a lot of time already, I asked for help already but I don't have help with it
20:06:29 <mrxx_0[m]> Then you're gonna have it
20:06:54 <mrxx_0[m]> I just want to do that : help
20:07:32 <strcat> there's a linker error atm
20:07:34 <strcat> don't know why
20:07:39 <BalooRJ> As someone who owns the Pixel 3A....will definitely promote anyone working on the 3a. It's the only new phone with a headphone jack.
20:10:08 <strcat> ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: content::CrossOriginEmbedderPolicyReporter::Clone(mojo::PendingReceiver<network::mojom::CrossOriginEmbedderPolicyReporter>)
20:20:14 <strcat[m]> ok worked around that problem
