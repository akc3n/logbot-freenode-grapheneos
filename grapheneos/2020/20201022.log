01:00:57 <mak1991[m]> mak1991: anupritaison1 will it be changed
01:00:58 <mak1991[m]> how we can help to improve the build of pixel 4a
01:08:08 <signalarch[m]> Anyone have slight screen flickering on the pixel 4?
01:25:13 <hanetzer> hullo, anyone here answer to 'thestinger'?
01:27:30 <prisonplanet[m]> Hi brothers, does anyone know if and when pixel 5 will be supported by Graphene ?
01:31:25 <louipc> hanetzer: not me. but whats your question?
01:31:39 <louipc> prisonplanet[m]: theres no plan for pixel5 at the moment
01:31:50 <louipc> requires someone to volunteer as maintainer
01:35:37 <joltman[m]> GrapheneOS support for Pixel 5 and 4a+5g are both pretty far off at this point. Might be a year? It's just guessing at this point.
01:36:03 <hanetzer> louipc: its not to do with graphineos itself, I just happened to see their gh profile included a lot of graphineos repos so thought I may be able to find them here :)
01:37:32 <sphinxcat[m]> [hanetzer](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_hanetzer:matrix.org): thestinger = strcat = Daniel Micay
01:38:14 <hanetzer> yee, that realname is correct.
01:38:52 <louipc> doxxed
01:40:36 <madaidan[m]> no its strcpy
01:41:56 <louipc> malloc
01:45:08 <madaidan[m]> <louipc "malloc"> yes he named hardened_malloc after himself
01:45:43 <LinusSexTips[m]> lmao
01:46:00 <M0xC0ncord[m]> More like named after how I feel about his work
01:46:37 <hanetzer> giggity
01:47:38 <madaidan[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "More like named after how I feel"> Hardened?
01:47:46 <M0xC0ncord[m]> yesss
01:49:04 <madaidan[m]> I'd imagine malloc's work would harden many people
01:50:56 <hanetzer> so hardened coreboot wen? :P
02:51:24 <nc1236[m]> What's the state of grapheneOS on the Pixel 2 XL?
02:56:30 <joltman[m]> GrapheneOS should work on it, but Google no longer supports it, so any security vulnerabilities on the firmware probably won't be patched, so it's not really a recommended device. 2 and 2XL are considered legacy devices.
02:58:07 <joltman[m]> I'm guessing that there's little if any new development effort going into development on the 2/2XL.
03:01:05 <joltman[m]> I wouldn't expect any bugs found on that device to get fixed. They might, but don't depend on it.
03:03:25 <nc1236[m]> ah, thanks
03:06:53 <nc1236[m]> i suppose I'll upgrade some time in the future anyways
04:58:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> <hanetzer "so hardened coreboot wen? :P"> Never
07:19:01 <gello37383> Hi
07:19:06 <gello37383> Is anyone here
07:36:06 <redibc[m]> Hello everyone
07:37:13 <redibc[m]> I know you can break the encryption on normal android devices. Is there a different type of encryption through graphene than out of the box android? I want to get a pixel 3 but I need a physically encrypted phone that can't be broken. Is there anything that's similar to veracrypt for this?
08:21:48 <dazinism> Pixels since the pixel 3 have the Titan security chip which improved device encryption security significantly.
08:22:30 <dazinism> The swap from full disk encryption to file based encryption is also a big potential benefit
08:23:49 <dazinism> Means devices powered on, but locked, can have whole user profiles which are encrypted (if they aren't logged in)
08:26:32 <dazinism> Nothing is ever completely secure, but if you use a long password for secondary user profiles its extremely difficult to get at its data when its not logged in
08:41:02 <dazinism> redibc: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
08:50:09 <dazinism> There are android apps that provide use of veracrypt containers. Adding this extra layer of encryption may, or may not, make sense. Depends on what you are going to use the device for and how you are going to use whatever data it is that you want to have "unbreakable" encryption.
08:51:52 <dazinism> Adding apps also means you are trusting more parties to provide your "unbreakable" encryption
09:04:26 <bobfett> Do you have any ideas why my phone start bootloops right now? I was listening to music and my phone started non stop bootloops. It was quite hot, could it be that? Any help is appreciated
09:20:55 <bobfett> How can I enter fastboot or something to be able to use my phone more than 2 seconds at a time before reboot
09:20:56 <bobfett>  * How can I enter fastboot or something to be able to use my phone more than 2 seconds at a time before reboot?
09:24:26 <bobfett> I manage to understand how to do it
10:27:43 <timont[m]> Glad to hear feel free ask help if need be
11:18:46 <renlord> bobfett: does it drop you back into fastboot mode?
11:18:54 <renlord> after several loops
11:26:20 <renex> With GrapheneOs is it possible to record the phone calls?
11:27:48 <renlord> you can record yourself but not the counterparty
11:28:57 <renex> Is that a Android thing or specific to GrapheneOs?
11:29:25 <renlord> android
11:29:42 <renlord> more specifically aosp
11:29:46 <renlord> dont know what other vendors do
11:30:21 <renex> GrapheneOs has no plans to enable it?
11:30:27 <renlord> no
11:31:02 <renex> because of policy or technical issues?
11:31:32 <renlord> nobody seems interested
11:43:07 <sphinxcat[m]> [renex](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_renex:matrix.org): https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/65#issuecomment-496925635
11:44:55 <renex> Thanks for the link
11:46:15 <sphinxcat[m]> The relevant part starts at "No, GrapheneOS doesn't add features like this as a general rule..."
11:47:28 <renex> I understand that Gos wants steer away from legacy call making, but for most people there always be a need to make legacy calls, be it to contractors or officials, and it would be good to be able to record those calls
11:56:10 <belay_that_order> hello all. i have a problem with unlocking the bootloader of my pixel 3a (non-service-provide-locked version). i cannot run the fastboot flashing unlock command, or almost any command in fastboot. but the fastboot itself does recognize my device with ./fastboot devices. last time in this support group, i was advised to start with ordering an Anker cable for data transfer, as the Pixels are fickle about cabling.
11:56:10 <belay_that_order> that i did do, and the PC does not even see the phone. the cable itself, is USB 3.0 A - C
11:56:42 <belay_that_order> tl;dr i cannot get past the fastboot flashing unlock in order to boot graphene on my pixel 3a
12:06:37 <bobfett> <renlord "bobfett: does it drop you back i"> No, I had to turn it off and turn it on on fastboot myself. Maybe I did not let it boot loop enough? I just had the GrapheneOS logo, not the Google one, so it might not have been a real bootloop (os malfunctioning?)
12:09:12 <bobfett> It might be faulty hardware... I hope not. What is the expected output if something is malfunctioning like memory or other hardware stuff, silently failing or rebooting the os? Or it depends?
13:18:45 <strcat[m]> belay_that_order: Pixels are not really 'fickle' about cables but rather a lot of USB cables, ports, hubs, etc. are broken and not reliable enough for fastboot
13:19:49 <strcat[m]> fastboot is very low level and assumes that there is a proper implementation of USB, it can't handle a connection that drops and corrupts data, it needs a stable connection that works properly, which isn't a lot to ask but a lot of USB implementations are terrible
13:20:27 <strcat[m]> if you can't even use fastboot flashing unlock, something is very wrong, that's not a demanding part of the process
13:21:19 <strcat[m]> renex: we're not going to work on fancy features for legacy calls and texts, especially features that aren't in the stock OS, which implies they aren't all that important or mainstream
13:43:32 <belay_that_order> <strcat[m] "if you can't even use fastboot f"> what can be very wrong here, i need suggestions. if possible i would use the 'return phone to supplier' as a last resort because of reasons
13:43:53 <belay_that_order> can it be done with the current device, is what im asking. is there a way to find more info about this using IMEI?
13:44:21 <strcat[m]> I doubt there is an issue with the phone
13:45:02 <strcat[m]> if it's not a Verizon model, that means you can toggle on OEM unlocking in the OS, and then you can unlock with fastboot
13:45:17 <strcat[m]> there isn't a reason to think there's a problem like that
13:45:43 <strcat[m]> were you enable to toggle on OEM unlocking? if you were, it's not a Verizon model and can be unlocked
13:46:39 <strcat[m]> belay_that_order: as I explained above, many USB ports / hubs / cables are broken, and fastboot requires a reliable USB connection, it doesn't implement a bunch of fault tolerance, the USB connection has to work
13:46:58 <strcat[m]>  * belay_that_order: as I explained above, many USB ports / hubs / cables are broken and fastboot requires a reliable USB connection, it doesn't implement a bunch of fault tolerance, the USB connection has to work
13:49:23 <belay_that_order> strcat: yeah im able to do the OEM unlock toggle, and i am currently using only the cable that came with the device. it's able to transfer data, use adb and fastboot to an extent. so, seeing as im unable to run a simple command in fastboot, i have zero confidence that the rest of my flashing procedure would go as required
13:50:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> [belay_that_order](https://matrix.to/#/@belay_that_order:matrix.org) fastboot flashing unlock and wait
13:51:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> It might be that your connection is so slow it takes a while to send the message
13:51:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Obviously you can't flash anything with that speed
13:51:51 <belay_that_order> it immediately prints 'failed' as a response
13:54:59 <strcat[m]> belay_that_order: have you followed our USB troubleshooting guide
13:55:06 <strcat[m]> provide information on what you're using to flash
13:55:10 <strcat[m]> it's not just the cable that's relevant
13:55:31 <strcat[m]> also don't the devices just come with a USB C to C cable nowadays? which device model are you talking about?
13:55:56 <strcat[m]> I see you say 3a above
13:56:25 <belay_that_order> <strcat[m] "also don't the devices just come"> they do but i specifically ordered A - C so i can have it used on my personal pc
13:56:42 <strcat[m]> which cable did you order
13:56:51 <strcat[m]> and what are you connecting it to?
13:56:53 <belay_that_order> it's pixel 3a, not sure what you mean by which model
13:57:06 <strcat[m]> that's what I meant, 3a
13:57:07 <belay_that_order> <strcat[m] "which cable did you order"> Anker, straight from anker amazon page
13:57:17 <strcat[m]> so what are you connecting it to
13:57:20 <strcat[m]> and which OS
13:57:27 <belay_that_order> win 10
13:57:33 <belay_that_order> using usb c - c
13:57:38 <strcat[m]> a laptop or desktop etc
13:57:45 <belay_that_order> laptop
13:57:48 <strcat[m]> belay_that_order: I thought you said A to C?
13:58:02 <belay_that_order> yes, but like i said, it doesnt work at all, except for charging
13:58:11 <belay_that_order> so, back to the factory c -c one
13:58:18 <strcat[m]> which laptop
13:58:23 <strcat[m]> it sounds like it has broken USB
13:58:25 <belay_that_order> dell latitude
13:58:34 <strcat[m]> I'd suggest flashing from a different computer
13:58:40 <belay_that_order> tried, same result
13:58:52 <strcat[m]> both cables and the phone are probably fine
13:59:01 <strcat[m]> what kind of other computer did you try?
13:59:13 <belay_that_order> a lenovo
13:59:15 <belay_that_order> uh
13:59:16 <belay_that_order> legin
13:59:20 <belay_that_order> *legion
13:59:28 <belay_that_order> also usb  c, win 10
13:59:33 <belay_that_order> up to date erything
13:59:47 <belay_that_order> behaviour identical to pc #1, dell latitude
14:01:09 <belay_that_order> fastboot version 30.0.3-6597393
14:01:27 <belay_that_order> adb same ver
14:02:13 <strcat[m]> unlikely to matter but the install guide currently uses 30.0.4
14:03:28 <belay_that_order> i would assume so
14:03:55 <belay_that_order> what i would assume, is that im either missing something very basic either on my phone or the pc
14:04:07 <belay_that_order> that enables the fastboot protocol to run the commands on the phone
14:04:22 <belay_that_order> but my knowledge is not even basic, regarding this, so i wanted to ask someone here
14:04:27 <strcat[m]> do you have 30.0.3 because you downloaded it a while ago?
14:04:39 <strcat[m]> since the install guide has used 30.0.4 for quite a while
14:04:39 <belay_that_order> well, hm
14:04:47 <belay_that_order> a while ago would be august?
14:04:59 <strcat[m]> no, further back
14:05:14 <strcat[m]> were you following the official install guide?
14:05:33 <strcat[m]> make sure you didn't install any weird third party fastboot or particularly drivers - you shouldn't need to install any drivers on Windows 10
14:05:54 <belay_that_order> i did
14:06:09 <belay_that_order> but i thought that the fastboot version is even lower that 30.0.3
14:06:16 <belay_that_order> ok, will try that next
14:13:45 <strcat[m]> belay_that_order: make sure you have no weird third party fastboot / adb driver or anything like that
14:13:49 <strcat[m]> belay_that_order: it's odd that you ended up with fastboot 30.0.3
14:14:48 <strcat[m]> ah I guess if you did both computers in August 30.0.3 was newest though
14:15:01 <strcat[m]> dunno what's wrong, very strange you're having those issues
14:15:23 <strcat[m]> haven't seen the specific symptoms you're experiencing before
14:15:55 <strcat[m]> guess it's possible that the phone hardware is faulty but seems really odd and I don't really see how it'd cause that issue
14:16:03 <strcat[m]> don't have any other ideas though
14:17:31 <dragonfly826[m]> Hello, I just wanted to hear the communities opinion as to what the best choice for a browser in graphene may be? This is assuming you will use Tor on a daily basis for most things, are you better off with vanadium with orbot vs Tor browser? Or could maybe bromite with orbot be a better choice as it includes randomized finger printing?
14:30:34 <redibc[m]> What type of pixel 3 should I buy to use graphene os?
14:33:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> Stick with Vanadium. I don't know the advice on Orbot
14:35:24 <dragonfly826[m]> I'm a bit concerned with fingerprinting tho 😞, and I really do not want to not use tor
14:35:46 <dragonfly826[m]> Help me out here guys
14:38:57 <strcat[m]> redibc: a Pixel 4 or soon the 4a should be supported (soon meaning a month or two)
14:39:37 <strcat[m]> dragonfly826: there isn't a good answer, use Bromite / Vanadium with Orbot or use the Tor Browser, different compromises
14:39:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixel 4 is the only device I'd recommend
14:39:48 <belay_that_order> <strcat[m] "ah I guess if you did both compu"> trying out the 30.0.4 and fastboot does not even print the device on ./fastboot devices
14:40:07 <redibc[m]> What about digital forensics on the phone. If someone tries to get in it how can I encrypt it with something like veracrypt
14:40:09 <strcat[m]> dragonfly826: if you use Bromite / Vanadium, make sure to use Incognito mode with it
14:40:32 <strcat[m]> dragonfly826: and whether you use Bromite, Vanadium or the Tor Browser, treat each instance of the app as 1 session / identity
14:40:44 <redibc[m]> Okay I'll get the pixel 4 then
14:41:02 <strcat[m]> redibc: data is always encrypted
14:41:18 <strcat[m]> all metadata and data is encrypted via ext4 encryption
14:41:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Bromite is not really on par though?
14:41:47 <strcat[m]> file data and file names inside profiles are encrypted with per-profile keys based on the unlock credentials
14:42:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Bromite doesn't use our defaults nor do they force 64-bit for hardened malloc
14:42:14 <redibc[m]> What can tla's gather from the use of it is what I want to know
14:42:42 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: 64-bit provides more than hardened_malloc
14:43:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: 64-bit provides m"> Aware but hardened malloc is definitely the main reason
14:43:19 <strcat[m]> redibc: all data and metadata is encryption, data and file names within profiles with a key derived from the unlock passphrase
14:43:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are parts of bromite that will be using scudo
14:43:50 <strcat[m]> redibc: the owner profile contains sensitive global system data (that's why it always has to be logged in before being able to use other profiles)
14:44:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> So that's immediately a downgrade
14:44:04 <strcat[m]> redibc: for example app usage stats, etc. is part of the owner profile's data
14:44:28 <strcat[m]> (doesn't mean the owner profile user can access app usage stats for other users, they can't, just explaining how the encryption works)
14:45:11 <strcat[m]> when the device boots up, only 'device encrypted' data is available, which is data that's explicitly stored outside a profile to make it available in early boot before unlocking
14:45:26 <strcat[m]> for example, accessibility services need to be available then, keyboards need to be available if they are going to be usable to unlock, etc.
14:45:46 <strcat[m]> apps can explicitly go out of the way to store certain data as device encrypted, and they can mark components as available pre-unlock
14:45:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "when the device boots up, only '"> Sounds pretty fancy lol
14:45:52 <strcat[m]> all data and metadata is always encrypted
14:46:24 <strcat[m]> the vast majority of data including your home directory, all the stuff tied to the profile, app data, etc. is stored within profiles
14:46:34 <strcat[m]> and each profile has a unique encryption key derived from the unlock credentials
14:46:39 <strcat[m]> the owner profile is special
14:46:51 <redibc[m]> What about cell tower data
14:47:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically the updater app [redibc](https://matrix.to/#/@redibc:matrix.org) is an example
14:47:05 <strcat[m]> various system apps run as the owner profile user, so the owner profile protects more data than a typical profile (such as usage stats)
14:47:13 <strcat[m]>  * various system apps run as the owner profile user, so the owner profile protects more data than a typical profile
14:47:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> It can run before the owner enters the password
14:47:36 <strcat[m]> redibc: don't know what you mean about cell tower data
14:47:50 <strcat[m]> there isn't data stored about cell phone towers
14:48:19 <redibc[m]> Okay
14:49:40 <dragonfly826[m]> Okay, one big thanks to everyone who answered
14:51:23 <dragonfly826[m]> So with that said, regardless of what I do, its probably not a very good idea to use bromite then? Is it that big of a loop hole?
14:56:18 <strcat[m]> dragonfly826: it's a lot better than a Firefox-based browser security-wise
14:58:42 <redibc[m]> What pixel should I get the 4a or 4?
15:03:18 <pikey[m]> personal preference and budget
15:03:33 <pikey[m]> i am going for 4a once i work out how to backup my 3 !
15:04:13 <pikey[m]> i had 3a and 3. preferred 3 for size, a tad smaller, but i miss the 3.5mm jack so much and i detest face unlock so much that I would never consider a 4. 4a looks a friggin bargain
15:04:44 <redibc[m]> Yea forget biometrics
15:04:56 <redibc[m]> I don't ever want to use anything that has it
15:05:08 <redibc[m]> Its a personal identifier in itself
15:06:44 <joltman[m]> If you have a cell phone plan for your device, then you're already tying your identity to it whether you use a fingerprint reader or not.
15:08:17 <pikey[m]> yeop
15:08:17 <joltman[m]> 4a isn't supported by GrapheneOS yet, so there's that to consider.
15:08:32 <pikey[m]> yep, i am waiting for that too. kinda the biggest obstacle :D
15:08:45 <pikey[m]> but not in a hurry as i need time to learn how to backup the phone anyway first
15:08:59 <joltman[m]> That's pretty much the only reason I decided to get the 3XL instead of the 4a.
15:10:00 <joltman[m]> I'll probably keep the 3XL until there is support for 5 or 5XL...because 5g.
15:10:18 <adeus[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Pixel 4 is the only device I'd r"> Damn but no fingerprint have to use facial recognition
15:10:42 <joltman[m]> You don't have to use facial recognition
15:10:47 <joltman[m]> just sayin
15:11:13 <joltman[m]> If I used 4/4XL, I'd just use passcode or pattern. Wouldn't use the facial.
15:12:04 <pikey[m]> i love the fingerprint on 3/3a
15:12:13 <pikey[m]> main reason for choosing 4a, plus 3.5mm and price
15:12:29 <pikey[m]> "Pixel 4 is the only device I'd recommend" - why is that?
15:15:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pikey[m] ""Pixel 4 is the only device I'd "> strcat is the grapheneos developer
15:15:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> He isn't a device maintainer
15:16:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Somebody has to step up to maintain devices
15:16:31 <pikey[m]> not sure i follow if that was for me
15:16:37 <pikey[m]> i just wondered why you would only recommend P4
15:16:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you'd look at git I did 3,3a kernel bringup, the entire bringup and then also did 4
15:16:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> But you need to understand
15:17:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> I only have the pixel 4
15:17:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are trying to support the other devices
15:17:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> But maintainers are not present for those
15:17:43 <lpcvoid[m]1> Face unlock on my p4xl works absolutely flawless, for what it's worth. Doesn't matter what rotation or how far away really or if it's in the morning and I look tired as fuck. Works really way and unlocks in like 500ms
15:17:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm not the 4a maintainer even when I did the entire bringup
15:18:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> The 4xl maintainer is not very active
15:18:27 <lpcvoid[m]1> Works in the sun too, was worried there because of the ir cams. But no complaints
15:18:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> But he's also quite good with his skill and what he does so he can get issues on the xl variant solved
15:19:05 <pikey[m]> <lpcvoid[m]1 "Face unlock on my p4xl works abs"> it's not for me. i want to be able to have my phone in front of my face without it being unlocked
15:19:32 <lpcvoid[m]1> That makes sense indeed, I can see that peoblem, yes
15:19:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tl;dr we don't have device maintainers and so far only 4 and 4 xl have competent/experienced maintainers
15:20:15 <pikey[m]> i am sure i would be impressed by it, but that problem would make it annoying. having said that, i occasionally unlock in my pocket while chatting to someone in the street, and a newpipe video starts playing loud out of my pocket :D
15:20:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do you seriously think we can ship 4a as stable just because we fixed auditor?
15:20:42 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Tl;dr we don't have device maint"> ah i see thanks. are you saying 4a is likely to remain unsupported?
15:20:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> An entire bringup was done blindly. That is a huge problem
15:21:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pikey[m] "ah i see thanks. are you saying "> It will be supported but without a maintainer it will be dropped at any time if it is too much to support
15:21:23 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Do you seriously think we can sh"> not sure if you're addressing me. if so, woooosh, over my head. no clue what you're talkihg about. only context i understand "bringup" in, is kids, and puppies. :D
15:22:03 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It will be supported but without"> ok, i dont understand any of this. but i will stick with 3 for now anyway
15:22:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW the pixel 5 also has a very good maintainer so that may become the most recommended device to buy for graphene in the future
15:23:25 <doobry[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I only have the pixel 4 "> Did you order a 4a? I thought that you mentioned it somewhere before.
15:24:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <doobry[m] "Did you order a 4a? I thought th"> No I did not
15:25:29 <doobry[m]> Would donations to do so help you? Or is it more that you don't want to be in charge anyway?
15:25:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> [doobry](https://matrix.to/#/@doobry:systemli.org) you can donate to strcat
15:25:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> And he'll send devices to whoever he sees fit
15:28:06 <joltman[m]> I ordered a new 4a earlier this week and pulled that trigger too early and cancelled the order. Decided to make a third attempt at buying a refurb 3XL.
15:28:07 <pikey[m]> ha, i didn't know there was a P5!
15:28:29 <joltman[m]> end of this month is official release for P5
15:28:30 <pikey[m]> just looking at it now, wow, fingerprint sensor!!
15:28:41 <joltman[m]> and 5g
15:28:42 <pikey[m]> i bet there's no 3.5mm jack :(
15:28:52 <joltman[m]> i don't think so
15:29:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> [pikey](https://matrix.to/#/@pikey:matrix.org) imagine needing one lol
15:29:28 <joltman[m]> But support for 5 will take some time
15:29:49 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "[pikey](https://matrix.to/#/@pik"> I don't need imagination for that
15:30:26 <pikey[m]> i guess i don't understand the terminology, what does "support" mean? What I thought it meant is "there's a graphenOS installer for it".
15:30:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have a oneplus phone which has analog output on the USB C port
15:30:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> It outputs 24bit at 384khz
15:32:38 <pikey[m]> i have a P3. I want rid of it. I will go back to 3a if needed (I have one probelm with that, storage space, i need 128 really), but I was hoping of going to the 4a when I can run graphene on it. I am guessing the comments above mean its unlikely that the 4a will ever run graphene unless new devs can help make that possible. is that right? if so, its 3a or wait for 5 perhaps
15:36:04 <jpds> "a Pixel 4 or soon the 4a should be supported (soon meaning a month or two)" - from literally an hour ago
15:40:46 <pikey[m]> not sure what your point is
15:40:55 <pikey[m]> "Do you seriously think we can ship 4a as stable just because we fixed auditor?" - from literaly 20 minutes ago.
15:41:37 <pikey[m]> which, along with other comments, from an authoritative member in here, caused me to think 4a is unlikely to become fully 'supported/maintained'. great news if my understanding is incorrect. i would love the 4a, its by far the best pick for me
15:42:14 <jpds> In that case, I'd just buy it as you'll probably be unhappy with any other option?
15:42:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pikey[m] "which, along with other comments"> It's basically in the same boat as the 2 and the 3 series of phones
15:42:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is no maintainer
15:42:51 <pikey[m]> ? i am using a 3, working fine! if in same boat as that, I will grab a 4a tomorrow!
15:42:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> It may be dropped at any time if it is too much to support
15:43:14 <pikey[m]> well i guess that applies to every single device/release
15:43:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well 4 and 4xl both have dedicated maintainers who are watching the chat for bugs
15:43:44 <pikey[m]> so best bet is what i am lokoing for, as a move away from my 3. 3a is a posible too. but if 4a can run graphene, i will take the gamble on it becoming too much to support
15:43:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> And fixing issues as they occur
15:44:03 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Well 4 and 4xl both have dedicat"> ah I see, thanks. those are both out for me, sadly.
15:44:26 <joltman[m]> difference between a device having a maintainer (4/4XL) who could potentially leave and a device that already has no maintainer
15:44:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> [pikey](https://matrix.to/#/@pikey:matrix.org) https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-prepare-vendor/issues/34
15:44:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Here's an example. Both me and the 4 xl maintainer got apv support out for it that quickly
15:45:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> 4/4xl are the only ones to not have any unique problems on the R vendor
15:45:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> All other devices have some bits here and there that aren't confirmed
15:46:12 <pikey[m]> "R vendor" - what is one of those?
15:46:42 <jacksen> High to everyone  I recently bought a google pixal 4 xl and I am not able to unlock the boot loader it tells me that I need to put in a sim card to activate it how do i tell if its carrear branded?
15:46:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> * 4/4xl are the only ones to not have any unique problems on the 11 vendor
15:47:08 <pikey[m]> "High to everyone" - speak for yourself. lol
15:47:32 <dragonfly826[m]> Hi everyone again, Any proposals for apps that encrypt your notes?
15:47:41 <pikey[m]> can i ask, is anyone using graphene on pixel 4a?
15:48:09 <pikey[m]> not sure about notes apps, bitwarden has secure notes, which i tend to use
15:48:12 <joltman[m]> I think there is a Google warranty site that will accept an IMEI input that will check warranty status on it and also give an indication of vendor.
15:50:12 <joltman[m]> On 3XL, you can usually look at IMEI and first two digits are "35" for Verizon version and "99" for the Google version, but I'm guessing that's different on 4s
15:50:28 <joltman[m]> i.e. 4/4XL/4a
15:51:58 <cicadasolver[m]> <joltman[m] "On 3XL, you can usually look at "> Actually, I don't think that's accurate
15:52:16 <cicadasolver[m]> * Actually, I don't think that's accurate.
15:52:16 <cicadasolver[m]> My IMEI starts with 35 and I'm writing this from my 4xl running GrapheneOS
15:52:46 <joltman[m]> Like I said, I don't think the same logic applies to 4* phones
15:53:49 <joltman[m]> And not sure if it's 100% accurate even for 3XL, but it has been accurate for every one I've checked.
15:55:48 <joltman[m]> https://store.google.com/repair
15:56:50 <jacksen> does that mean that they did away with the fact that carrears had to unlock the boot loader?
15:56:58 <joltman[m]> That's a more definitive way to determine if it's a Verizon or Google phone. It'll say Verizon or VZ if it's a Verizon phone, I believe.
15:57:27 <jacksen> joltman understood thanks allot man
15:57:30 <joltman[m]> Apparently carriers only have to unlock it for network, not bootloader.
15:57:42 <jacksen> since the seller never sadly said on his ebay when i bought this brand new phone
15:57:51 <jacksen> he claimed it was unlocked
15:58:00 <jacksen> I no that OEM unlocking is different to sim unlocking
15:58:16 <joltman[m]> "unlocked" or even "factory unlocked" basically means that you can use it on any network
15:59:00 <joltman[m]> They need to confirm that "OEM Unlocking" is not grayed out, usually by providing a screen shot.
15:59:44 <joltman[m]> But the last 3XL I bought, the seller provided a phony screen shot showing it as unlockable, but the phone I received wasn't. Just sent it back yesterday.
16:00:15 <joltman[m]> He blamed his vendor for mixing up equipment...whatever. Giving a bad review after my refund clears.
16:03:35 <joltman[m]> Here's what I look for when buying one of these phones: 1) screen shot showing "OEM Unlocking" option available; 2) Assurance from seller that it's bootloader unlockable; 3) IMEI (if they will tell you); and 4) reputation/reviews of seller
16:04:04 <joltman[m]> Best situation is when #1 AND #4 are good
16:05:35 <joltman[m]> seller Farewellcell on Swappa.com seems to be legit, but I'll know more early next week
16:06:56 <joltman[m]> seller Wirelessshow has good reputation, but still screwed me
16:07:05 <jacksen> I tried this site but it  tells me to contact google should i do this
16:07:21 <jacksen> I ask since Not sure if i will get anywhere with them
16:08:17 <joltman[m]> If they will give you the IMEI of the device, then you can contact Google via that warranty website I posted, but most sellers won't give you the IMEI.
16:08:38 <joltman[m]> And there's still the question of whether you can trust the seller to give the correct IMEI.
16:09:08 <joltman[m]> Without the IMEI, there's not really anything Google can help you with or tell you
16:10:06 <joltman[m]> Part numbers are often the same for bootloader locked and unlocked versions
16:11:05 <jacksen> I already got it that is the problem I got it and when i try unlocking the boot loader it says i need a sim card in
16:11:32 <jacksen> the guy seemed lijit he gave the phone  in 2 days
16:12:46 <joltman[m]> Did you already enable the "OEM Unlocking" option? That comes before actually unlocking the bootloader.
16:13:16 <jacksen> this is the option I have trouble with the "OEM Unlocking"  is greyed out it says put in a sim card or connect to the internet
16:13:37 <joltman[m]> I haven't found the speed of delivery matters much. I got a bum phone quickly, too.
16:14:08 <joltman[m]> What does the Google warranty site say about your IMEI?
16:14:41 <joltman[m]> I haven't heard that inserting a SIM card is required to toggle "OEM Unlocking"
16:15:47 <joltman[m]> I think I've heard that connecting to internet has helped enable the option, but not sure if that's really required.
16:17:05 <cicadasolver[m]> <joltman[m] "I think I've heard that connecti"> It was at least for me.
16:17:08 <joltman[m]> I don't think it should be required
16:18:00 <joltman[m]> I think I've seen people report ability to unlock even without connecting, but maybe those are cases where it had already previously been connected.
16:18:55 <joltman[m]> I would certainly try it, but you might still want to check the warranty site first
16:24:05 <jacksen> I tried both not connecting to the internet and then connecting
16:24:25 <jacksen> talking to google now lets see if i can get any info thanks guys you are all great.
16:37:43 <joltman[m]> good luck
17:01:36 <jacksen> A bit worried google are taking a while to get the info
17:01:51 <jacksen> I mean if the phone is black listed I will not have the cops coming?
17:02:13 <jacksen> It was not too cheap it was like at $500
17:08:47 <joltman[m]> Shouldn't be anything to worry about if you haven't done anything wrong. Plus, Google shouldn't care if a prior user skipped out on a cell phone bill with one of the carriers.
17:11:07 <jacksen> ok its not as bad as i tought lol but its bad they claim that the device isw not  in the databsae
17:11:51 <jacksen> they are asking for the sku number on the box  is this normal the way they act as though the device is not a real google pixal
17:12:07 <jacksen> Sorry databaseSOrry
17:13:21 <jacksen> Understood all i did was buy a device from ebay I did nothing wrong
17:13:41 <jacksen> be right back real life calls thanks for the help again  will remain hear
17:21:51 <joltman[m]> So, possible Chinese counterfeit Pixel? Haven't heard much about that happening, but haven't searched for that either.
17:23:21 <joltman[m]> Not sure, but the Verizon phones might not be in the Google database.  I know some are because Google has sent out refurb replacements to its customers that were originally Verizon phones.
17:24:00 <redibc[m]> Would graphene work on a fake chinese pixel?
17:27:03 <redibc[m]> What do you think of buying those 3.month unlimited plans for 50 dollars that normally cost 180 dollars. You can find it off ebay
17:48:50 <spathionema[m]> I bought a Pixel 4a thinking the official Graphene build would be released soon... anyone know when it will be released?
17:59:32 <jacksen> Sorry freenode kicked me off i think since i had to be inactiv its the same guy again
18:00:52 <jacksen> Ok just found out when i do the IMEI search on   Verizon:  site they recognise it do i have any way to get  the OEM unlocked or am i totaly out of luck
18:02:19 <joltman[m]> Haven't heard of Verizon OEM unlocking any pixels for people.
18:02:51 <spathionema[m]> I read what anupritaisno1 said about the 4a... Graphene's looking slow... anyone know anything about CalyxOS?
18:02:59 <joltman[m]> I've seen a few reports of people doing some risky stuff to overcome that, but heard of more who bricked their phones trying to do it. Not really recommended.
18:03:15 <MaximBaz[m]> check here, my phone is recognized there, but if it is unlocked it will have NVZW: https://www.verizon.com/od/prepaid/bring-your-own-device/#/checkDevice
18:03:18 <joltman[m]> Safest to return or resell the device and get what you need.
18:05:13 <MaximBaz[m]> spathionema: fyi I also bought 4a, I just built graphene myself and flashed it earlier today, seems to work just fine 😉
18:06:34 <jacksen> Understood thank you The seller  was not clear that it was a carrear locked phone
18:06:48 <jacksen> Going to ask for my money back nicely of course
18:07:57 <joltman[m]> I don't think it's accurate to say that it's "carrier locked". It can probably be used on any network. You just can't overwrite the Android OS.
18:08:40 <spathionema[m]> Maxim Baz:  that's great. It seems like Graphene won't release an official build soon, so I might have to use a different OS... any suggestions?
18:09:26 <joltman[m]> You might want to look for physical defects or other problems with the device if you need a good excuse for returning it.
18:09:58 <joltman[m]> Or maybe just vaguely return it as "item not as described."
18:10:30 <joltman[m]> If you paid with PayPal, they usually side with the buyer.
18:11:06 <joltman[m]> But first try to get the seller to peacefully agree to accept the return.
18:11:46 <jacksen> Nods I really try not returning items honestly if i can avoid it but since i spent a good amount of cash and its not meeting my needs i want to return it
18:12:11 <jacksen> Thank you so much guys
18:12:42 <joltman[m]> If you give the reason as "not OEM unlockable" right away, then it might haunt you later if you try to change the reason for returning, so keep that in mind. Worst case, you just resell it.
18:13:15 <jacksen> Understood I will just give a reason that can not be refuted kind of thing I get it
18:13:46 <jacksen> Since OEM unlocking will not be recognised by everyone since not everyone is a tinkerer or a developer
18:14:49 <joltman[m]> If the seller specifically claimed that it was OEM unlockable or showed a screenshot of the setting not grayed out, then you could totally use that as an excuse right off the bat.
18:15:32 <joltman[m]> But if he just said "unlocked", then it's ambiguous, and most people consider that to be "carrier unlocked."
18:16:02 <jacksen> Yup he said unlocked
18:17:13 <jacksen> thanks for the great advice I will follow it when trying to return it I will try returning it first before reselling
18:18:02 <joltman[m]> 1) return agreement by seller; 2) PayPal dispute; 3) resell
18:18:09 <jacksen> Just wish to ask is there anything I can do to help the community back I mean once i get graphine os  is there anything i can do to give back to the community you guys are cool and I am really greatful for the help
18:18:17 <joltman[m]> that would be the order I'd follow
18:18:32 <jacksen> Understood thanks doode
18:19:02 <joltman[m]> probably testing help if you don't have the programming skills
18:19:24 <jacksen> and maybe help with some programming
18:19:57 <jacksen> Understood
18:20:00 <spathionema[m]> is copperhead malicious?
18:20:03 <joltman[m]> that would be awesome
18:25:11 <jacksen> I would want to say yes only because it seems that you have to pay them just to get access to there factory images or source code

19:25:13 <NewGOSuser> Hi all, I'm new to Graphene and this forum. I just wanted to ask your views on the app stores in Graphene. I have been using a combination of F-Droid and Aurora store but am wanting to migrate fully to Aurora, as I can get everything I want from there (unlike F-Droid). Is there a reason why I shouldn't do this? I seem to recall a conversation
19:25:14 <NewGOSuser> around F-Droid not quite being the secure service that it purports to be (something to do with signing keys???). How does Aurora Store compare?
19:25:46 <NewGOSuser> Sorry if this has been covered before (probably to death) but I couldn't find it on here
19:52:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> [NewGOSuser](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_NewGOSuser:matrix.org) both have terrible issues
19:52:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fdroid doesn't sign correctly and messes up security
19:53:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Aurora store stores the apk files on the internal storage where anything can modify them
19:54:44 <uchihaitachi[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Aurora store stores the apk file"> where they supposed to be stored? or what's the right mechanism?
19:57:38 <NewGOSuser> That means everything's f*cked up. What can be done if there are no app stores...
19:58:28 <im_a_robot[m]> <NewGOSuser "Hi all, I'm new to Graphene and "> Fdroid Apps are all Open Source and better for Your Privacy and Security than the Aurora (Google Play Store) Apps
19:59:10 <NewGOSuser> Graphene Store, please. If I can get 10 like to this proposal, then please consider developing one.
20:00:19 <im_a_robot[m]> <NewGOSuser "That means everything's f*cked u"> Just because they both have some Issues doesnt mean you shouldnt use them.
20:02:38 <im_a_robot[m]> <NewGOSuser "Graphene Store, please. If I can"> It would be the better Option to fix those Issues than building a completely new Store
20:04:40 <uchihaitachi[m]> im_a_robot: I don't think F-Droid is as secure as Play Store. But the model is nicer; more awareness about privacy.
20:05:00 <elmyder[m]> there are other places to get apks than app stores, but the best option will depend on the app. f droid is pretty good all things considered
20:05:08 <NewGOSuser> anupritaisno1[m] Interested in your comments about the issues with both app stores. Can you explain what could happen as a reasonable worst case in both F-Froid and Aurora Store?
20:05:19 <im_a_robot[m]> <uchihaitachi[m] "im_a_robot: I don't think F-Droi"> Play Store has malware
20:05:48 <elmyder[m]> yeah you have to balance the security of the app store itself with the security of the apps hosted on it
20:05:55 <im_a_robot[m]> They only check new apps with an AI
20:06:06 <uchihaitachi[m]> <im_a_robot[m] "Play Store has malware"> What do you mean by malware?
20:06:37 <im_a_robot[m]> <uchihaitachi[m] "What do you mean by malware?"> Search for malware in Google play store apps and you will find alot
20:07:19 <im_a_robot[m]> The Store App is pretty Secure but some Apps they host arent
20:08:27 <uchihaitachi[m]> im_a_robot: Trusting the apps themselves is another issue.

20:18:02 <im_a_robot[m]> NewGOSuser: so Fdroid should be safe to use
20:19:29 <Lynn[m]2> F-Droid has fundamental issues, and so does Google Play Store. But neither are great options. 😛
20:23:23 <NewGOSuser> Thanks Lynn. Very informative. You mentioned F-Droid uses V.1 signing, but Graphene and newer Android versions aren't affected. You then go on to say F-Droid has fundamental issues. Is that because of their reproducing source code policies? The signing issues is irrelevant to GrapheneOS users, right?
20:23:56 <NewGOSuser> Also, you mention Google Play Store. Do you throw in Aurora store with that?

20:24:00 <im_a_robot[m]> Issues and security Bugs will always exist and with enought time and money everything (even a Graphene Phone) can be hacked or exploited
20:24:01 <im_a_robot[m]> As long as you arent a political target you shouldnt be paranoid about it
20:24:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fdroid still uses sha1 to verify apps
20:24:16 <Lynn[m]2> anupritaisno1 Really? I haven't looked at the source code for it. I thought they did. 🤷‍♀️
20:24:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fdroid checking apps for tampering is the same rabbit hole as anti viruses enumerating badness
20:24:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because you can compromise fdroid itself and effectively hide
20:24:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Lynn](https://matrix.to/#/@lynn:spitetech.com) also they did a malpractice
20:25:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Instead of using stronger signatures already supported by android, they rolled out their own crypto
20:25:06 <Lynn[m]2> <anupritaisno1[m] "Fdroid still uses sha1 to verify"> *Still??*
20:25:20 <Lynn[m]2> I thought we were over sha1 lolo
20:25:43 <Lynn[m]2> <anupritaisno1[m] "Instead of using stronger signat"> Fuck.. I still haven't read their source code. Now I really want to
20:26:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Instead of using stronger signat"> Lynn surely this is a big nono for crypto guys? I mean you do condemn telegram for rolling out their own
20:26:34 <Lynn[m]2> Definitely not a good thing.
20:26:42 <Lynn[m]2> Yeah Telegram is crap
20:26:47 <Lynn[m]2> I wouldn't trust those devs one bit
20:27:04 <NewGOSuser> Oh shit.
20:27:15 <Lynn[m]2> anupritaisno1 Thanks for the insight. I've been so busy on other projects I kind of put F-Droid on a back burner.
20:28:05 <Lynn[m]2> But here's the thing: choosing good cryptographic primitives is actually pretty easy. So I don't understand why so many projects are still using/are going to use PBKDF2, SHA1, etc.
20:29:17 <NewGOSuser> I'm curious why the Guardian Project trusts F-Droid if it's this disastrous. I mean in some extreme cases, people's lives can depend on them.
20:30:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> <NewGOSuser "I'm curious why the Guardian Pro"> If journalists use this, they probably have it coming for them
20:30:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> KGB/CCP: open up
20:30:20 <Lynn[m]2> NewGOSuser Because some of these attacks are actually pretty expensive to pull off ... 😛 But at the same time it's a big nono
20:31:12 <NewGOSuser> So how/where do you install apps?
20:31:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Lynn](https://matrix.to/#/@lynn:spitetech.com) so windows has this toggle to force fips complaint ciphers. Have you looked into it?
20:31:36 <Lynn[m]2> e.g: NextCloud has some pretty big nonos. But nothing impact enough to scare the devs into fixing it.
20:31:58 <Lynn[m]2> <anupritaisno1[m] "[Lynn](https://matrix.to/#/@lynn"> Ah, I haven't used Windows in a while. Where can I check that? I have a Windows computer, I just don't use it often.
20:32:48 <NewGOSuser> Lynn[m]2 Do you use Linux, by any chance?
20:33:11 <Lynn[m]2> <NewGOSuser "So how/where do you install apps"> Well if you're an advanced user, I'd recommend downloading the source code and compiling it. If semi-advanced use `apksigner` with v2 signing, verify the APK, download from github probs
20:33:31 <Lynn[m]2> Last alternative is Google Play Store, or F-Droid.
20:33:40 <Lynn[m]2> 🤷 Not many good options.
20:33:47 <Lynn[m]2> <NewGOSuser "Lynn Do you use Linux, by any ch"> Yes.
20:34:17 <NewGOSuser> Out of curiosity, does iOS Lynn[m]2 By Play Store, do you bundle Aurora Store in that?
20:34:35 <NewGOSuser> Sorry, ignore first bit about iOS
20:34:39 <Lynn[m]2> ?
20:35:25 <Lynn[m]2> I haven't looked at Aurora Store's code, but if anything, I'd be wary downloading random open source applications that market themselves as secure.
20:35:42 <Lynn[m]2> F-Droid is full of random "secure" apps.
20:35:58 <Lynn[m]2> Aurora Store may be one of them. 🤷
20:36:50 <Lynn[m]2> And considering people recommended AndOTP for years, it's hard to say what could be wrong with popular open source projects.
20:38:06 <Lynn[m]2>  * And considering people recommended AndOTP for years, it's hard to say what could be wrong with popular open source projects from a high overview.
20:38:33 <NewGOSuser> lynn[m]2: Do I detect that you don't rate andOTP or have I misunderstood?
20:39:45 <Lynn[m]2> Could you rephrase that please?
20:42:21 <NewGOSuser> Never mind, I didn't quite understand your andOTP comment.
20:43:44 <Lynn[m]2> NewGOSuser Tip, don't use AndOTP. Use Aegis.
20:44:43 <NewGOSuser> I thought that's what you were saying...
20:46:31 <NewGOSuser> Lynn[m]2 How do you keep apps updated if I were to use one of the methods you outlined above?
20:47:25 <Lynn[m]2> NewGOSuser Subscribe to the RSS feeds via a feeder, or manually check. 🤷 You'll have to download and install the APK yourself, check the signature, etc.
20:52:19 <NewGOSuser> So manually check each app to see if an updated version has come out? Whaaaaaaaaaat?????
20:52:35 <NewGOSuser> A bit cumbersome......
20:53:20 <Lynn[m]2> Like I said. For advanced users. 🙂
20:54:00 <joltman[m]> how much time is your privacy and security worth to you?
20:54:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Lynn](https://matrix.to/#/@lynn:spitetech.com) you know there's this thing. It's pretty new so I wouldn't have expected anyone in this chat to have heard it
20:54:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> But I believe that you need to know about it the most
20:55:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's called
20:55:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
20:56:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> I am pretty serious
20:56:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> You have turned this chat into a chat about your crypto knowledge and how telegram is bad and idk what else
20:56:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is a chat for grapheneos
20:56:49 <Lynn[m]2> anupritaisno1 Sorry. 👍️
20:58:15 <NewGOSuser> Thanks all, I think I got all I need here.
21:14:24 <lev[m]> doing a 'factory reset' from within the OS iterates the keys, right?
21:14:32 <lev[m]> or should I do that from fastbootd or something instead
21:28:16 <dazinism> NewGOSuser: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
21:32:20 <NewGOSuser> dazinism Thanks. Very useful.
21:41:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <uchihaitachi[m] "where they supposed to be stored"> The right place to store them is not in the shared storage
21:41:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is slightly better with scoped storage but still a bad idea
21:42:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Many applications just aren't updated for scoped storage
21:42:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> So they can read everything
21:46:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> So one of the places you could store it in
21:46:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Would be app data
22:11:59 <nightjar[m]> There is a workaround for Aurora store using internal storage. If you go into Aurora Store settings > Downloads > and toggle Download Apps in Internal Storage you can then revoke the storage permission and it works fine.
22:12:04 <nightjar[m]> But yeah storing them in shared storage by default is bad
