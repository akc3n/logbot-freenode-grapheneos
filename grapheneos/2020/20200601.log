00:01:39 <cn3m[m]> hypothetically how well would it work to move the verification and decryption to a flash drive that is either remove after boot or non writeable by physical switch? Say if a device didn't support Secure Boot?
00:01:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> That is an option
00:02:21 <cn3m[m]> That's what Hackintosh does to enforce verified boot
00:02:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW there can be a chkboot for that
00:02:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> The system does reverse verification on the kernel that booted it
00:02:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> If it's not matching it stops booting
00:03:05 <cn3m[m]> that could be comprised by smart mlaware though no?
00:03:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
00:03:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> The best bet is
00:03:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fully encrypted boot

00:06:03 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org I mean it's not bad, but it does need a Google account. You can opt out of all the concerning stuff though
00:08:16 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Do you HAVE to use a google account? Why not make a version without Google accout
00:08:40 <bulletproofman[m> I don't trust Google to honor settings. They were caught many times.

00:31:54 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Have you tried it? I don't see any of my machines being certified.. also why are the machines certified for a limited time?
00:32:52 <cn3m[m]> it runs on everything
00:33:28 <TheJollyRoger> Hey korma[m], I wonder if they ended up doing something like hard-coding it with a dependency on Google Software Frameworks without a fallback, or if there's a bug in the client software that causes it to access memory out of bounds.
00:36:18 <cn3m[m]> might be worth trying to on Stock with Google disabled
00:37:18 <cn3m[m]> if it works fine it might be a security issue
00:37:54 <korma[m]> Interesting. So basically when I re-install the apo with aurora store, it works fine for a few mins/hour and then keep crashing again
00:38:55 <korma[m]> Stock is the rep for app without signing in to google right?
00:45:01 <cn3m[m]> does anyone have that link to the 174 malicious programs that went through the open source supply chains?
00:45:11 <cn3m[m]> that was a good study
01:00:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hey cn3m[m], I don't offhand, I will keep an eye out for it!
01:01:31 <cn3m[m]> thanks  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org

01:29:41 <radixed9[m]> I am trying Packet Capture right now
01:36:50 <mxnorvak[m]> Is there any recommended way to charge your phone? I mean some say its better if it never reaches 0% and doesn't get charged to 100% and that you keep it in between like 10 and 90 ,but is there any science to it, tried searching and every website is just a copy of a copy
01:37:42 <radixed9[m]> The certs appear to install on Android 7.1.2. They however don't appear to seem to actually work and it doesn't carry over to the owner profile. This could be different in newer versions
01:39:45 <radixed9[m]>  * TheJollyRoger: cn3m I will test root certs in another profile with my extra tablet. Does anyone know which app?
01:40:35 <j3ghprjfo[m]> mxnorvak: my understanding is that all modern phones take care of this on there own. 0% doesn't actually equal 0% battery power

04:00:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Same with walnuts, technically.
04:01:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well
04:02:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless you use fake chocolate
04:03:35 <analog[m]> Eggplants are also a fruit

04:06:15 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: hehehehe, sounds like the time I found I could disable the Intel Management Engine on my old PC by shorting the power supply!
04:06:24 <TheJollyRoger> It stank really bad, but now that computer is IME free :D
04:06:29 <bulletproofman[m> <anupritaisno1[m] "Just remove the init code"> But that's the one that starts all the processes
04:07:09 <bulletproofman[m> Wait
04:07:14 * TheJollyRoger cackles.
04:07:15 <bulletproofman[m> Oh i get it
04:07:28 <bulletproofman[m> I'm slow sorry
04:07:33 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe no worries XP.
04:07:38 <bulletproofman[m> 😑
04:07:39 <analog[m]> We need a wooshproofman here
04:08:14 <bulletproofman[m> analog: u___u
04:08:26 <TheJollyRoger> (No kidding though, I fried the thing really good. Smoke was pouring out of the case.)
04:09:03 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: ur insane cap
04:09:14 <TheJollyRoger> Hee hee... I think that computer's time had come :P.
04:09:23 <bulletproofman[m> If i'm being real. I hate IME
04:09:32 <bulletproofman[m> Arm doesn't have these problems right?
04:09:48 <TheJollyRoger> Well, here's my take on it:
04:10:14 <TheJollyRoger> Management interfaces are actually a part of modern, performant CPUs these days, there's no two ways about this.
04:10:22 <TheJollyRoger> If you want the CPU to start, that is.
04:11:07 <TheJollyRoger> There's actually *nothing* wrong with using a smaller, less powerful, and *MUCH MUCH MUCH less complex* discrete computer system to start a larger, more complex and much more powerful system.
04:12:05 <TheJollyRoger> Even my Talos II has a management interface, it's called the OpenBMC.
04:12:25 <TheJollyRoger> *It's called the BMC, which runs OpenBMC.
04:12:42 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: Buuut it'S OPEN
04:13:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, which brings us to part two: I think the big problem that rubs a lot of security researchers the wrong way is that Intel is fascinatingly tight-lipped about theirs, despite its highly privileged position.
04:13:41 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: Yeah i mean shit that's a lil.... weird
04:13:48 <bulletproofman[m> And.... suspicious
04:13:59 <bulletproofman[m> Hmmmmmm
04:15:10 <TheJollyRoger> To Intel's credit, one of the reasons they can't, is because they've signed deals with content publishers and vendors for protected playback and content protection.
04:15:41 <TheJollyRoger> Since unfortunately, hollywood loves its DRM.
04:16:58 <TheJollyRoger> Sadly enough as well, the IME's role in maintaining platform security is also unknown.
04:17:03 <TheJollyRoger> Which I think is really depressing.
04:17:36 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: :S
04:17:42 <bulletproofman[m> It makes me maad
04:17:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. In the 1990's, System Management Mode was originally designed as a way to allow for power state to be managed by the host, without having to trust the host with that kind of responsibility.
04:18:32 <TheJollyRoger> But since then, System Management Mode ended up being ended up used for a lot of other things and becoming more and more bloated with functionality of "Hey we don't want the host OS to futz with this? Just throw it into System Management Mode."
04:18:34 <bulletproofman[m> Without having to trust the host is the key right
04:19:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Then it became apparent that SMM wasn't enough, and they needed something that could reign in SMM...
04:19:12 <bulletproofman[m> And the bloat is what introduced attavk surfzce?
04:19:31 <TheJollyRoger> Not quite. SMM presents some attack surface on its own, but it's distinct (and separate from) the Intel Management Engine.
04:19:50 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: Oh roger that
04:20:13 <TheJollyRoger> The Intel Management Engine's role in /keeping SMM in check/ is something I really don't know and for that matter, I don't know if anyone else does.
04:20:43 <bulletproofman[m> So what about
04:20:50 <bulletproofman[m> Amd
04:21:03 <bulletproofman[m> What's their deal?
04:21:05 <TheJollyRoger> So this is why running me_cleaner could actually be doing you a disservice.
04:21:34 <TheJollyRoger> AMD has their own which is analogous. Around ~2012 the Platform Security Processor (AMD Secure Technology) became non-optional.
04:22:45 <TheJollyRoger> AMD is in a similar position to Intel. If they want to be able to give their customers things like the ability to play DRM-protected or copy protected content, they need to make that same deal with the devil that Intel did.
04:24:32 <bulletproofman[m> I'm glad talos exists
04:24:35 <TheJollyRoger> Similarly though, I don't believe these "PSP Kill Switches" or "Disable Bits" are worth much more than virtue signalling and marketing gimmicks to people who don't know any better, since if you were to disable the PSP, what unparks your cores and initializes your DRAM timing prior to host initialization?
04:24:41 <TheJollyRoger> Me too :D
04:24:46 <bulletproofman[m> Even tho it's expensive as shit
04:25:18 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, yeah... but everything's relative. At my old company, we used to lease our workstations.
04:25:24 <bulletproofman[m> One thung i fail to understznd
04:25:44 <TheJollyRoger> We would fork over $7000 over a period of /three years/ for those crappy workstations, and at the end of those three years, you had to give the station back to Dell.
04:25:45 <bulletproofman[m> How will apple keep software working
04:25:53 <bulletproofman[m> If they switch to Arm
04:26:22 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not sure.
04:26:37 <bulletproofman[m> Wouldn't that change things a lot or am i understanding things weird
04:26:42 <TheJollyRoger> It would.
04:27:07 <TheJollyRoger> They'd have to release both arm and x86 versions of their software. But I don't think switching architectures has actually stopped them before, since they've done it in the past.
04:27:58 <TheJollyRoger> Back in 2005 I think they made the jump from PowerPC (back then, this was 32 bit big-endian PowerPC, which is not the same as POWER9) to i386.
04:28:07 <bulletproofman[m> Wasnt that like a Loong time ago
04:28:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Fifteen years!
04:28:36 <bulletproofman[m> Boooooi what are they doing
04:29:26 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know. But I think if anyone could do it, it's probably Apple, since they do all their software development in parallel with their hardware development.
04:29:43 <TheJollyRoger> So they have much more awareness of what their buyers are doing and buying and what platforms are out there.
04:30:11 <bulletproofman[m> I guess
04:30:16 <bulletproofman[m> Partially open sourcr
04:30:27 <bulletproofman[m> Arm
04:30:42 <bulletproofman[m> Isn't arm partially open source
04:30:44 <TheJollyRoger> Given that these days when you buy software only dinosaurs and gaming consoles actually get a physical copy on physical media (and sometimes, not even then), they're actually in an even better position to do this /now/ than they were fifteen years ago.
04:30:56 <bulletproofman[m> Fckin hell my sausage fingers
04:32:23 <TheJollyRoger> It's up to the vendor.
04:33:56 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: There was this processor
04:34:05 <bulletproofman[m> A while back
04:34:16 <bulletproofman[m> Called Risc v
04:34:27 <TheJollyRoger> ARM Holdings actually makes its money licensing the IP to other vendors, so no, it's not open.
04:34:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, what about it?
04:36:27 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: Is it good securiry wise?
04:36:33 <TheJollyRoger> Well, RISC-V is not a processor, but rather, RISC-V is a sheet of paper. It's an ISA that's BSD-Licensed. So this means that RISC-V chips are only as open as their vendors will /make them./
04:36:44 <TheJollyRoger> It's a sheet of paper.
04:36:53 <TheJollyRoger> It's an ISA.
04:37:40 <TheJollyRoger> The Linux and FOSS community seems to forget this and the hype around it has translated into confusion that because the ISA will be open, the chip will be open.
04:37:57 <TheJollyRoger> This isn't the case: the largest deployment of RISC-V processors is, in a hilarious irony, in Nvidia GPUs.
04:38:25 <TheJollyRoger> Because it allows NVIDIA to not need to pay big fat profits licensing its falcon processor.
04:38:55 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: :(
04:39:05 <bulletproofman[m> :"(
04:39:15 <TheJollyRoger> And NVIDIA has the dubious honour of being the only company that Linus Torvalds has called "the worst company ever to work with" and cussed them out on-camera with his middle finger.
04:39:38 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: lol i remzmber that
04:39:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe yeah :D
04:40:30 <bulletproofman[m> What do you think about buying old thinkpads
04:40:46 <bulletproofman[m> You see from what i gathered from the infobu guys give
04:41:00 <TheJollyRoger> So... all in all, that's the thing about hype. While it's really nice to think about, sometimes people (especially in echo chambers like Reddit) get carried away with unrealistic hopes and then end up confusing their unrealistic hopes with "what will be."
04:41:06 <bulletproofman[m> It's technically a bad idea right? You know the IME fre thinkpads
04:41:12 <TheJollyRoger> Well...
04:41:35 <bulletproofman[m> It's the microcode isn't it
04:41:41 <TheJollyRoger> Damn, makes me feel nostalgic, I remember when those were a dime a dozen and then December 2017 hit and the prices got jacked way up!
04:42:26 <twitx[m]> Some Question if you have Bluetooth enabled won't it brodcasts its ID and somebody could find out this way where you were by your ID? (by ID I mean the BSSID that can't be changed and it seems like Bluetooth has that aswell?) (I understand the BSSID part about WI-FI but still not about Bluetooth(if it exists)) (sorry if I'm wrong about that)
04:42:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. Many of those old CPUs, like old Core2Duos and Dual Cores are no longer recieving microcode updates for chip level vulnerabilities.
04:42:59 <bulletproofman[m> twitx: innit how contact tracing works
04:43:24 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: Oh i feel like i'm starting to understand and reason better and i just joined this sub yesterday
04:43:41 <bulletproofman[m> For real thank you guys i feel like i'm learning, albeit slowly
04:43:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hi twitx[m], I haven't dug into or looked much into Bluetooth at this moment, maybe somenoe else will be able to chime in. GrapheneOS doesn't include play services for Google's COVID tracking though.
04:43:52 <TheJollyRoger> bulletproofman[m: hey man no worries we all start somewhere! :)
04:44:23 <TheJollyRoger> So without those microcode updates that provide the mitigations, it's kinda like... what would be the best way to describe it...
04:44:54 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: I have an image in my mind. A ship with holes
04:44:55 <TheJollyRoger> it'd be kinda like removing the screws from your front door, tearing your front door off its hinges, then nailing it over your rear bay window and saying "There we go, nobody's going to break in now!"
04:45:02 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
04:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, ahahahaha, or that :D

04:49:05 <fishingtackle[m]> <twitx[m] "Did it still not help fishingtac"> I am opting for the non glass screen protector and the $3 rubber case this time.
04:49:17 <TheJollyRoger> I've got two cases (one I accidentally ordered by mistake when I forgot to click "remove from cart") one is a UAG case which has high rubber curbs around the sides, the other is a slimmer Spigen case.
04:49:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, and glass screen protectors work wonders!
04:49:51 <bulletproofman[m> TheJollyRoger: I saw those UAG cases. They are so sexy.
04:49:53 <TheJollyRoger> Saved my phone once when it slipped out of my pocket and smashed screen-side down onto my front steps.
04:49:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah! They look great :D
04:50:25 <TheJollyRoger> The screen protector shattered into pieces but luckily the phone beneath it was saved, so I peeled it off, wiped it off and stuck another one on in its place.
04:50:34 <fishingtackle[m]> Why me?
04:50:50 <TheJollyRoger> fishingtackle[m]: Jeez :( That's really bad luck :(
04:50:55 <fishingtackle[m]> It isn't fair...
04:51:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(
04:52:25 <twitx[m]> I have the Google Pixel case currently it once fell on well rocks but I can still use my Phone I just can't use the Notification Bar and sometimes the Keyboard just randomly types but expect that it still works
04:52:52 <TheJollyRoger> If you guys really need the protection I really recommend those Spigen hard glass screen protectors, they're great and I think they come in 3-packs. If you have some sealast packing tape you can even save them if you put them on wrong, as well.
04:53:35 <bulletproofman[m> twitx: My phone screen is cravked the HOUSe. And the return button doesn't always work. Did I mention that the friggin phone is old

05:20:43 <renor> Do I really have to have Google Camera on a sparate profile to improve privacy/security? I don't see how can it be bad if I disable the network permission to it...
05:22:23 <furofuro_01[m]> Remember when I said I despise surveillance and don't want to live in US? I might have changed my mind now due to a new law to be passed there. (This gives the more necessity to seek for a secure phone this time around.)

05:40:29 <JTL> furofuro_01[m]: what law?
05:41:25 <furofuro_01[m]> Basically, the military can surveil messages and calls from telco
05:41:30 <furofuro_01[m]> <JTL "furofuro_01: what law?"> Dont want to disclose due to this being logged and public
05:43:21 <furofuro_01[m]> * Basically, the military can surveil messages and calls from telco for like 2 months. Definitely keeping my silence, for the best privacy is when you dont say it. However, I might keep myself here (matrix) due to E2E encryption on private messages, or use Signal with random numbers.
05:44:43 <furofuro_01[m]> Just check r/privacytoolsio

05:47:28 <furofuro_01[m]> Nope. Definitely not in China

05:50:15 <furofuro_01[m]> More reason to use VPN
05:53:40 <cn3m[m]> fun fact
05:53:43 <cn3m[m]> I just wrote a big guide
05:53:59 <cn3m[m]> on all the ways to get your real ip with an app on iOS or Android
05:56:31 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: drop it
05:57:01 <cn3m[m]> https://reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/gq8qk9/ios_or_grapheneos_which_is_further_along_with/fshyy7j?context=3
05:58:40 <furofuro_01[m]> In short, I should not use VPN on 2 profiles?
05:59:53 <furofuro_01[m]> No wonder I had the same bug (even on LineageOS I cant just reformat rn due to circumstances)
06:01:25 <cn3m[m]> it's the same across all Androids would be a safe assumption
06:02:16 <furofuro_01[m]> Kinda a bummer I cant compartmentalize personal with main profile where both have VPN
06:02:29 <furofuro_01[m]> Unless I have a router with VPN
06:04:07 <bulletproofman[m> Why not just get a vpn router
06:04:28 <bulletproofman[m> Problem solved
06:04:30 <furofuro_01[m]> I dont have one right now
06:04:49 <furofuro_01[m]> I cant flash any other VPN-supporting firmwares in Tenda F3
06:06:58 <furofuro_01[m]> send help
06:07:44 <cn3m[m]> well you can use multiple vpns and it works for browsers and webapps it'll just screw up your apps
06:08:02 <cn3m[m]> if you only run trusted apps and keep all untrusted code in the browser it's probably fine
06:14:13 <furofuro_01[m]> Does "Frost" count as webapp?
06:14:50 <furofuro_01[m]> As far as I know, it is a webapp wrapper for facebook...
06:15:32 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "well you can use multiple vpns a"> And yes, I mostly use webapps and browser for browsing... (Guess thats why my download speed on newpipe is way too fast I guess?)
06:17:55 <cn3m[m]> <furofuro_01[m] "Does "Frost" count as webapp?"> yes it's using the Vanadium hardened Trichrome WebView on GrapheneOS. It's a trade off security wise with Bromite so YMMV
06:18:38 <cn3m[m]> I get the most questions about VPN and Firewall bypasses. People forget just how powerful apps are ha
06:20:52 <furofuro_01[m]> Nice.
06:24:03 <furofuro_01[m]> So, if I get it right... I am getting way faster download speed on Newpipe because it sees my real IP?
06:42:37 <cn3m[m]> <furofuro_01[m] "So, if I get it right... I am ge"> it's not impossible
06:42:42 <cn3m[m]> it would take a bit of testing to certify that as related

06:53:43 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org in?
07:00:14 <bulletproofman[m> When it comes to downloading

07:05:00 <cn3m[m]> Technically

07:08:12 <cn3m[m]> it's not a priority for me to explain a non privacy or security related technical topic
07:09:48 <bulletproofman[m> Alright, imma just say i saw that link
07:10:01 <bulletproofman[m> I friggin love your explanations, which is why
07:10:17 <bulletproofman[m> I need to understand how tf
07:10:23 <bulletproofman[m> Does this whole PRISM thing work
07:10:32 <bulletproofman[m> I see conflicting info everywhere
07:10:36 <bulletproofman[m> And it's VERY confusing.
07:10:58 <cn3m[m]> I'd say probably not, but maybe
07:11:55 <cn3m[m]> keep in mind all these programs worked since no one uses HTTPS and crazy legal gymnastics
07:12:09 <cn3m[m]> both of those things are dead (at least right now)
07:12:23 <cn3m[m]> there could be more creative ways of course
07:14:00 <bulletproofman[m> PLEASE
07:14:01 <bulletproofman[m> Elaborate
07:14:17 <bulletproofman[m> I genuinely trust what you say bro
07:14:27 <bulletproofman[m> Cause i know u know wtf u talk about
07:15:50 <cn3m[m]> so Section 215 is deaf
07:15:51 <cn3m[m]> dead*
07:16:09 <cn3m[m]> for now at least which is the whole FISA court and that bullshit
07:16:24 <cn3m[m]> the beating heart of the NSA program
07:16:52 <cn3m[m]> Coronavirus delayed the renewal and Trump says Biden is spying on him with the NSA so it's just dead at this point
07:17:20 <cn3m[m]> now everything is encrypted too
07:17:41 <cn3m[m]> in transit so no more easy spying on the Google Yahoo link
07:17:55 <cn3m[m]> and a zillion other spy methods
07:18:43 <cn3m[m]> security has also come a very long way making exploits harder, domain verification is obviously a thing now
07:18:52 <cn3m[m]> People can't even phathom how much better privacy and security tech is now
07:19:47 <cn3m[m]> Congress also passed that transparency law so now we can see the number of national security requests and even get some copies of NSLs
07:20:34 <cn3m[m]> NSA Mass Spying is probably dead. There's some limited targeting left related to actual crimes. I highly doubt any of us are effected
07:21:06 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "for now at least which is the wh"> Shit ur right i just checked that
07:21:36 <bulletproofman[m> Hold on what about things like XKeyScore
07:21:53 <bulletproofman[m> And and tempora and all those scary program
07:22:01 <bulletproofman[m> No way those aren't being used in one way or another
07:22:13 <bulletproofman[m> It's too powerful to now be abused
07:22:21 <bulletproofman[m> Even illegally
07:22:23 <cn3m[m]> XKeyScore is a search engine
07:23:01 <cn3m[m]> tempora is fucked up by HTTPS
07:23:35 <cn3m[m]> everything is illegal now or broken or well recorded at this point
07:25:44 <bulletproofman[m> Xkeyscore and optic nerve are what scare me most
07:26:37 <cn3m[m]> California and the EU are also making this stuff even harder. Apple using their encryption on almost all sensitive services and focusing on offline processing means there's almost no data to collect. Google even has the option for full e2ee Chrome Sync(which is partially anyway) and e2ee Android backup. Google is slowly following Apples lead moving the live captions to local processing.
07:26:55 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "Xkeyscore and optic nerve are wh"> XKeyScore is just a search engine no?
07:27:18 <bulletproofman[m> It searches PRIVATe things too
07:27:28 <cn3m[m]> Optic Nerve was an HTTP dealio iirc
07:27:41 <bulletproofman[m> Like ur fb messages emaild comments etc.
07:28:08 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "Optic Nerve was an HTTP dealio i"> Wait what i don't get it
07:28:19 <cn3m[m]> that's what I'm saying that information is much harder to get if not impossible
07:28:25 <cn3m[m]> XKeyScore is probably no more than an archive at this point
07:28:42 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org back in 2012 you could go to a coffee shop and capture everything anyone did
07:29:09 <cn3m[m]> there was no real usage of HTTPS. Sometimes passwords, but then they cookie would be insecure
07:29:12 <cn3m[m]> the web was fucked
07:29:13 <cn3m[m]> this is why so much of the spying worked
07:29:31 <cn3m[m]> people forget how bad it was
07:29:49 <bulletproofman[m> Optic nerve works even with ur gafgets turned off

07:33:14 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org he said she forgot to close it. that's a drama anyway
07:33:15 <bulletproofman[m> That whole clip and everything in it scared me tbh
07:33:32 <cn3m[m]> Facebook isn't encrypted
07:33:41 <cn3m[m]> or wasn't
07:34:29 <bulletproofman[m> What about all that contact info and and the friggin camera and mic can be turned on with a laptop that is turned off
07:34:32 <cn3m[m]> worth keeping in mind that the internet is fundamentally a different internet than when Snowden was sharing info
07:35:13 <cn3m[m]> Optic Nerve takes advantage of a Yahoo program bro
07:35:18 <cn3m[m]> Facebook isn't encrypted
07:35:31 <cn3m[m]> wasn't*
07:35:40 <cn3m[m]> they could gobble up this data like anyone else could if they had that much access to the net
07:35:52 <bulletproofman[m> <cn3m[m] "Optic Nerve takes advantage of a"> Which one was it
07:35:59 <cn3m[m]> NSA spying is incredibly crude in design it's not impressive
07:36:46 <cn3m[m]> Yahoo! Messenger
07:37:01 <cn3m[m]> it was unencrypted
07:37:10 <cn3m[m]> Apple for instance forced all apps to be encrypted 4 years ago
07:37:22 <cn3m[m]> everything
07:37:22 <cn3m[m]> the web is completely different
07:37:37 <cn3m[m]> it sounded like Voodoo, but it wasn't
07:39:11 <bulletproofman[m> It's all like voodoo to me i'm just
07:39:36 <bulletproofman[m> It's like a christian got proved that god doesn't exist
07:39:47 <bulletproofman[m> This is how i feel
07:39:59 <bulletproofman[m> I'm so overwhelmed. I'm sorry
07:40:16 <cn3m[m]> NSA is more of a devil than a God
07:40:28 <bulletproofman[m> You probably won't understand how much pressure all this stuff  was to me
07:40:46 <bulletproofman[m> It was negatively affecting my mental health cause i felt watched alAys
07:41:14 <bulletproofman[m> Always.. and now it's like.. was i over catastrophizing things?
07:41:31 <cn3m[m]> the problem is people who know their shit like Daniel and others are too busy to really spread their message. I'm getting rusty when I would be researching
07:41:45 <cn3m[m]> since I'm helping people
07:42:19 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: I'm really grateful to you man. Istg. I'm crying like a lil bitch rn.
07:42:30 <bulletproofman[m> Fuuuck i'm such a wimp 😢😢
07:43:18 <cn3m[m]> So yeah NSA Mass Spying is almost certainly dead for the moment. It's not impossible and it's probably going to take another form in the future, but rest easy
07:43:43 <cn3m[m]> the thing is I can't sell you anything if I don't say the world is fucking ending
07:43:45 <cn3m[m]> I also can't do my serious research
07:44:11 <cn3m[m]> neither of those problems matter to security and privacy charlatans
07:44:29 <bulletproofman[m> I disagree!
07:44:44 <bulletproofman[m> There are people who want truth
07:44:48 <bulletproofman[m> I want truth
07:44:56 <cn3m[m]> I don't have any reason to explain this shit to people beside helping the project. It's a waste of my time and skill beside helping this project
07:44:58 <bulletproofman[m> I don't care about tribalism
07:45:06 <bulletproofman[m> Fuck that fuck that FUD bs
07:45:12 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org great, but I don't get anything out of it
07:45:17 <bulletproofman[m> I want
07:45:32 <bulletproofman[m> TRUTH. This should be spread.
07:45:43 <bulletproofman[m> It does help
07:45:52 <bulletproofman[m> I think it genuinely changes minds
07:46:12 <bulletproofman[m> People who care about logiv sill listen
07:46:30 <bulletproofman[m> Will listen*
07:46:33 <cn3m[m]> I agree, but I spend 3-6 hours a day explaining this to people and it doesn't really pay off for most knowledge people
07:47:11 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: have you considered writing an article or a mini book of sorts?
07:47:28 <bulletproofman[m> To explain all of this fiasco with facts anf sources?
07:47:29 <cn3m[m]> fuck no
07:47:50 <cn3m[m]> I can't commit that much time to something people won't read
07:48:15 <bulletproofman[m> Maybe we should just nuke r/privacy
07:48:27 <cn3m[m]> people need it in bite sized pieces and I need to argue with them and explain how they think about everything wrong
07:48:36 <bulletproofman[m> That shit is a pit of cancer
07:48:43 <cn3m[m]> it's gotta be one on one
07:49:02 <cn3m[m]> I barely care
07:49:18 <cn3m[m]> I only really care about helping GrapheneOS and a little PTIO
07:49:31 <cn3m[m]> I believe in those projects
07:49:43 <cn3m[m]> I can help in this way
07:50:07 <bulletproofman[m> Alright. But i want to thank you for this. It's an eye opener. You may not.understand the depth of how much this conversation affected me. But it really did. Positively. Thank you.
07:50:45 <cn3m[m]> I'm so glad man we've all been there
07:53:27 <cn3m[m]> the problem is the frightened hoards are very hard to deal with
07:53:46 <cn3m[m]> smart people like this community and serious researchers no better than to waste their time
07:54:33 <cn3m[m]> the ROI for me is shit
07:56:16 <cn3m[m]> I'm not that knowledgeable either. Compare me to Daniel and I'm toast. Madaidan knows more than me too
07:56:19 <cn3m[m]> countless other guys
07:56:57 <cn3m[m]> the people who really know stuff don't have much time beside research and development
07:56:59 <cn3m[m]> which is how they stay informed
07:57:13 <cn3m[m]> I had to do a bunch of research and correct a mistake I made today
07:57:55 <bulletproofman[m> You keep doing what you do. I think your skills are needed in such things more.
07:58:34 <cn3m[m]> Yeah that's the thing I'm in a weird limbo mode
07:58:56 <cn3m[m]> I don't know enough to really be useful doing a lot of work and research
07:59:25 <cn3m[m]> I could help GrapheneOS with some development, but I need people to take over what I'm doing
07:59:43 <JTL> We all start somewhere
07:59:44 <JTL> :)
07:59:57 <cn3m[m]> 10 people working hard to fight misinformation would be great. If they each did 30 minutes a day
08:00:28 <cn3m[m]> I'd go to working on GrapheneOS or a personal project even research
08:01:45 <bulletproofman[m> I'd love to do that but i have to learn more first. Learn the facts.
08:03:44 <cn3m[m]> yeah you'll get there if you try
09:02:58 <bulletproofman[m> I just remembered something important. My country is preparing to get 5G soon. What are your thoughts on it everyone?
09:04:02 <fishingtackle[m]> Another Graphene phone is born..
09:04:48 <bulletproofman[m> I'm actually asking about privacy and security effects of 5G
09:05:12 <bulletproofman[m> Cause some people say it's fine, some people say it's bad. I looked up information on it
09:05:35 <bulletproofman[m> But i get conflicting info and most of the results are talking about health stuff
09:05:56 <bulletproofman[m> Annd the fact that some people think it causes corona which is..... interesting // eyeroll
09:22:56 <cn3m[m]> it's no different than the jump with 4g
09:22:58 <cn3m[m]> nothing too special
09:23:00 <cn3m[m]> might make e2ee make more sense
09:23:41 <cn3m[m]> right now FaceTime is hot garbage due to end to end encryption not allowing you to rencode
09:24:31 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org that's my main hope. That there will be more support for internet intensive solutions that benefit privacy and security
09:25:22 <cn3m[m]> welcome
09:25:49 <cn3m[m]> <addikted2graphene[m] "RiotIM from FDroid also not comp"> what?
09:26:00 <addikted2graphen> RiotIM from FDroid also not compatible?
09:26:00 <addikted2graphen> RiotX is working but I also had this issue with Orbot.
09:26:00 <addikted2graphen> Me?
09:26:01 <bulletproofman[m> addikted2graphene: i'm using RiotX
09:26:16 <cn3m[m]> what issue?
09:26:26 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: thanks!
09:26:37 <addikted2graphen> I was using RiotIM and the last update says that RuotIM not compatible.
09:26:52 <addikted2graphen> RiotIM
09:27:04 <cn3m[m]> weird

09:35:33 <addikted2graphen> But it makes me glad I have my graphene
09:35:56 <cn3m[m]> I love GrapheneOS
09:36:12 <addikted2graphen> It rox
09:42:14 <cn3m[m]> I just can't wait for issues #156 and #213 to be fixed
09:47:52 <addikted2graphen> Sorry I am not technical.. What is this issue?
09:48:44 <cn3m[m]> just common just like apps getting ip and firewall bypasses
09:48:57 <addikted2graphen> Damn.
09:49:04 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is still ahead on both, but could use a little love on those issues
09:49:47 <cn3m[m]> I can give you a more technical explanation of you'd like
09:50:03 <cn3m[m]> if*
09:50:09 <addikted2graphen> Sure if I am not wasting your time.
09:51:31 <cn3m[m]> <addikted2graphen "Sure if I am not wasting your ti"> Firewall the system has a ton of leak points so GrapheneOS fixes this by using a slightly modified network permission toggle. Apps still freely talk together
09:52:14 <addikted2graphen> K
09:52:28 <cn3m[m]> that means your untrusted app you run without network permission can talk to another app that can explicitly or accidently share that data
09:52:55 <cn3m[m]> this can be solved by a toggle to disable all ipc per app
09:53:01 <cn3m[m]> this would also give security benefits as well
09:53:41 <cn3m[m]> Firefox had a hijack vulnerability that used ipc to effectively get around the sandbox due to a Firefox flaw
09:54:10 <cn3m[m]> this would be a great feature
09:54:52 <cn3m[m]> the other one is that VPNs are really leaky, but that's an upstream issue. The current advice is use a VPN in only one profile that blocks connections beside the VPN
09:55:12 <addikted2graphen> Is that toggle automatically blocked in Grapheme?
09:55:31 <cn3m[m]> <addikted2graphen "Is that toggle automatically blo"> which toggle?
09:55:39 <addikted2graphen> I mean, toggled to block the leak.
09:56:05 <cn3m[m]> that toggle doesn't exist yet
09:56:20 <addikted2graphen> Oh, OK, sorry. Sounds awesome.
09:56:30 <cn3m[m]> iOS effectively is the only OS with it, but it's on by default
09:58:04 <addikted2graphen> So is it OK to use a VPN like Wireguard?
09:58:42 <cn3m[m]> <addikted2graphen "So is it OK to use a VPN like Wi"> how many profiles do you have with VPNs?
09:58:46 <cn3m[m]> shelter counts too
09:59:09 <addikted2graphen> I don't know what a profile is...
09:59:18 <cn3m[m]> <addikted2graphen "So is it OK to use a VPN like Wi"> worst case it's just going to leak your ip which was going to happen with it off
09:59:35 <cn3m[m]> <addikted2graphen "I don't know what a profile is.."> a user on the phone or a shelter work profile
09:59:50 <addikted2graphen> Oh, I only have one phone profile.
09:59:58 <addikted2graphen> Should I have more?
10:00:13 <cn3m[m]> and you're blocking connections without the VPN?
10:00:25 <addikted2graphen> Yeah, block all
10:00:31 <cn3m[m]> <addikted2graphen "Should I have more?"> depends on your needa
10:01:14 <cn3m[m]> it obviously can cause VPN issues right now (all of Android), but the isolation is incredible
10:02:03 <addikted2graphen> So like have the same chat app in each profile?
10:02:32 <addikted2graphen> Like one profile for work, one for everyday?
10:03:12 <cn3m[m]> well that too but
10:03:36 <cn3m[m]> it protects your app list, contacts, storage, calendar, and other stuff
10:03:52 <addikted2graphen> Oh, cool.
10:04:04 <cn3m[m]> it even "partially" isolates powerful user allowed malware like accessibility settings
10:04:38 <addikted2graphen> Awesome. I might have to mess around with profiles. Thanks.
10:05:12 <cn3m[m]> yeah basically it allows you to mix the freedom of Android with the privacy and security of iOS
10:05:35 <addikted2graphen> Sounds amazing.
10:05:36 <cn3m[m]> on iOS every app is in what would best be described as a hybrid profile
10:06:00 <cn3m[m]> there's nothing quite like it on Android
10:06:35 <cn3m[m]> Profiles are a more bruteforce method to the problem that offers you more freedom, but at a large usability cost
10:11:38 <addikted2graphen> Thanks, I am going to see what I can do with profile settings. I have a social problem which is that a number of friends can only use WhatsApp. I use a shitty old phone for that app but it will soon die. If I have an additional GrapheneOS phone would it reduce the risks of malware from WhatsApp?
10:12:01 <addikted2graphen> Like if it was a dedicated Whatsapp phone.
10:12:14 <cn3m[m]> <addikted2graphen "Thanks, I am going to see what I"> WhatsApp won't hack you
10:12:25 <addikted2graphen> They cannot use Signal where they live.
10:13:10 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: The fact that it's FB irks me. I hate FB and anything under it.
10:13:17 <yolotrolo[m]> i have noticed that apps in work profile can still see the connections made by apps of the main profile, i thought the network was isolated as well because you can use separate vpn and vpn in main profile don't affect the work profile
10:14:05 <cn3m[m]> <yolotrolo[m] "i have noticed that apps in work"> you're going to need to explain that a little more
10:14:28 <cn3m[m]> <addikted2graphen "Like if it was a dedicated Whats"> WhatsApp isn't a threat to your phone really
10:14:44 <cn3m[m]> it doesn't query packages afaik
10:15:03 <cn3m[m]> your VPN setup shouldn't leak
10:15:47 <yolotrolo[m]> <cn3m[m] "you're going to need to explain "> well it's simple, apps in work profile can see the connections of the main profile, at least on aosp android10
10:16:12 <cn3m[m]> the issue with WhatsApp would be more if you had gapps
10:16:15 <yolotrolo[m]> install net monitor from fdroid on your work profile and check it
10:16:23 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/sHGDdwWIwClzZDXKnSaLkWuH >
10:17:17 <yolotrolo[m]> the names of apps are not shown but you can still see to which server they connect to
10:17:38 <addikted2graphen> <cn3m[m] "WhatsApp isn't a threat to your "> I thought it was easier for people to send malware through it. If I made a phone setup for this purpose would that app be best installed in a separate profile?
10:17:53 <cn3m[m]> that's using a VPN right? @yolotrolo:matrix.org
10:18:07 <yolotrolo[m]> no without vpn
10:18:36 <yolotrolo[m]> well i'm using netguard
10:18:40 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/TzyXSaOWarFLIqmAxgBzivFx >
10:18:44 <yolotrolo[m]> on both profiles
10:19:09 <cn3m[m]> privacy breaching malware is a little bit of a concern
10:19:10 <addikted2graphen> <cn3m[m] "> <@addikted2graphene:matrix.org"> That is what I was hoping.
10:19:50 <addikted2graphen> <cn3m[m] "privacy breaching malware is a l"> Yeah, I hate using it but no way to get around it on their end.
10:20:19 <cn3m[m]> WhatsApp is pretty safe on GrapheneOS
10:20:47 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: How does FB make money of Whatsapp?
10:21:16 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "cn3m: How does FB make money of "> gonna be ads soon I think
10:22:35 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: But what about now?
10:23:37 <cn3m[m]> WhatsApp used to be partly paid
10:23:46 <cn3m[m]> that's how they made money iirc
10:24:27 <cn3m[m]> Facebook bought it to maintain market dominance and to support their long term goal of a cross messenger network using Signal
10:25:09 <cn3m[m]> Facebook wants to have all the world using a massive 2 billion person network based on the most secure communications protocol available
10:25:44 <cn3m[m]> people would not have any reason to leave since they would have the reach and security to dominate the market
10:26:10 <bulletproofman[m> But.. when the ads join in the chat
10:26:17 <bulletproofman[m> That'll change
10:26:28 <bulletproofman[m> Isn't it?
10:26:50 <cn3m[m]> not necessarily
10:27:23 <bulletproofman[m> Metadata alone is gonna be helpful
10:27:26 <cn3m[m]> ads don't have to read your messages in that app to be effective if they get data from how you use other platforms (mainly Instagram) they are gold
10:28:05 <cn3m[m]> Instagram has the key advantage of being the only Facebook product you can't opt out of targeted ads
10:28:35 <bulletproofman[m> How is that an advantage i-
10:28:44 <cn3m[m]> so if WhatsApp security and privacy draw people in and can talk to everyone people won't want to leave the Facebook ecosystem which means Instagram becomes more appealing
10:29:25 <cn3m[m]> which means they can data harvest Instagram to feed your private and secure WhatsApp with relevant ads
10:29:29 <cn3m[m]> that's their view any way
10:30:03 <bulletproofman[m> Ohhhh
10:30:12 <bulletproofman[m> Now ur making sense
10:30:25 <bulletproofman[m> So it's by proxy
10:30:34 <cn3m[m]> the other thing is
10:30:49 <cn3m[m]> if you can message WhatsApp people on Instagram and vice versa
10:31:06 <cn3m[m]> more people will use Instagram as it will also be Signal powered
10:31:54 <cn3m[m]> Instagram can be good on messaging and creepy on everything else
10:32:23 <cn3m[m]> Facebook has the best secure messaging on any mass scale ever seen
10:32:45 <bulletproofman[m> BUT
10:32:57 <bulletproofman[m> Whatsapp backups are unencrypted
10:33:04 <cn3m[m]> I trust Apple orders of magnitude more and Google a little more, but they just don't have as good as a technical setup
10:33:05 <bulletproofman[m> On drive
10:33:18 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "Whatsapp backups are unencrypted"> very true
10:33:33 <bulletproofman[m> See this is where the big issue is
10:33:49 <cn3m[m]> iirc Facebook can't see it though
10:33:50 <bulletproofman[m> The backups donlt even take space from ur drive
10:33:55 <bulletproofman[m> That's weiird
10:33:59 <bulletproofman[m> Google can.
10:34:07 <cn3m[m]> only Google can which I trust a lot more especially the cloud
10:34:07 <bulletproofman[m> And mine it.
10:34:18 <bulletproofman[m> They scan evrrything on ur drive.
10:34:32 <cn3m[m]> for child abuse
10:34:41 <bulletproofman[m> Meh I don't want any of them near my data.
10:34:51 <cn3m[m]> Google doesn't even read your email for ads anymore
10:35:11 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: How come?
10:35:45 <cn3m[m]> they switched to G-Suite privacy policy for Gmail in 2017
10:36:14 <cn3m[m]> they cut off their email ad targeting in 2017
10:37:46 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Maybe they're secretly doing it.
10:38:40 <cn3m[m]> Google is big on transparency
10:38:44 <jalb> They lied before, will you trust them? (facebook, Apple, Google...), not me. But who knows
10:38:54 <cn3m[m]> and security
10:38:55 <cn3m[m]> they aren't going to lie about that
10:39:17 <cn3m[m]> their privacy policy for G-Suite is pretty clear
10:39:25 <bulletproofman[m> Security sure. But transparency... questionable.
10:39:26 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_jalb:matrix.org when did Google lie?
10:39:41 <jalb> Many times these past years
10:39:59 <jalb> Even when you disabled the localiation it continued working
10:40:07 <jalb> etc
10:40:10 <cn3m[m]> everything is very well documented and as an app developer I knew every scandal way before it happened
10:40:26 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_jalb:matrix.org clearly documented and a different system
10:41:06 <cn3m[m]> Google advertising id is a sham, but they don't hide that in docs
10:41:07 <addikted2graphen> In the app permissions for Gallery, what is the background data toggle for?
10:41:12 <jalb> disable localization and check the connections of the gps, it connects to Google
10:41:17 <cn3m[m]> you can't opt out really
10:41:41 <jalb> In a normal android phone
10:42:04 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Isnlt the locztion tracking code in Google play service?
10:42:15 <jalb> Sorry, I can't trust what they say, and Snowden talked about them
10:42:17 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "cn3m: Isnlt the locztion trackin"> yeah
10:42:19 <cn3m[m]> it's all documented though
10:42:31 <yolotrolo[m]> yea i think he mean the location service not the gps
10:42:41 <jalb> But you're free to believe them, of course
10:42:45 <jalb> Maybe you're right
10:42:59 <cn3m[m]> I am not saying to trust them. though they follow their privacy policy and documentation
10:43:00 <cn3m[m]> they don't technically lie
10:43:06 <jalb> ok
10:43:35 <bulletproofman[m> Technically.
10:43:38 <cn3m[m]> I worked a lot with Apple and Google. I feel like Apple is vastly more trustworthy. However, Google is more transparent
10:43:44 <bulletproofman[m> They are being sneaky about it
10:43:55 <jalb> Now all iPhones have a 0-day
10:44:10 <bulletproofman[m> It's like "hey it's in the docs. We didnlt lie" sure. But u were being sneaky.
10:44:48 <cn3m[m]> As a developer, I take Apple at their word. They have made mistakes, but they fix it quickly. Google I have to vet everything they say against themselves.
10:45:32 <cn3m[m]> <jalb "Now all iPhones have a 0-day"> yeah that's interesting, thankfully they have a good store model for this. GrapheneOS needs a store with out the Janus attack badly
10:45:41 <jalb> When your business is to track people to gain money, who knows what could happen...
10:46:00 <cn3m[m]> haha yeah I'm glad I'm away from that
10:46:01 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: When you delete your Google account. Does Google reallly delete it from their servers and backup?
10:46:16 <jalb> cn3m[m], lol :)
10:46:36 <jalb> bulletproofman[m, I don t think so, Amazon saves them too
10:46:40 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "cn3m: When you delete your Googl"> if they don't I'm suing them even if I go bankrupt when they get hacked
10:46:42 <jalb> Facebook, etc
10:47:04 <cn3m[m]> they won't risk not deleting data they are legally required too and that they outlined their deletion plan
10:47:27 <bulletproofman[m> I know Yahoo does. FB certainly keeps what they have on you.
10:47:40 <jalb> I wouldn't be surprised if some day you discover all your information and voices in Google/Amazon/Facebook servers
10:47:41 <cn3m[m]> Google takes 90 days I think to actually scrub everything which is longer than full deletion takes
10:47:51 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: I hope so.
10:47:54 <renlord> there are technical grounds to support not deleting immediately
10:48:15 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "I know Yahoo does. FB certainly "> Facebook's policy is too specifically scrub the backup servers after a while
10:48:23 <cn3m[m]> they would get their asses sued to a hack
10:48:37 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "there are technical grounds to s"> yeah of course I'm just being technical
10:48:41 <jalb> cn3m[m], yes, that's what they say, but their history is not very good about it
10:49:11 <yolotrolo[m]> i can't even access to my old account they ask my to verify using my ID or something like that
10:49:12 <jalb> And also the USA government to discover some information in there
10:49:40 <bulletproofman[m> They track users who do NOT have fb. Therefore NOT agreed to the TOS.
10:49:50 <bulletproofman[m> Via shadow profiles.
10:50:00 <jalb> And trackers in almost very website
10:50:10 <bulletproofman[m> We all saw the congress stuff.
10:50:11 <jalb> *every
10:50:19 <cn3m[m]> They would get sued to hell if they don't delete the data in takeout. Shadow profiles they'll keep I'm sure
10:50:34 <cn3m[m]> the data you explicitly give them is toast
10:50:39 <jalb> cn3m[m], they gain more money that paying that penalty
10:50:52 <bulletproofman[m> The like button is basically an embedded full fb site. It's alwzy there in the background. Watching..
10:51:03 <jalb> Who knows...
10:51:19 <cn3m[m]> <jalb "cn3m, they gain more money that "> Facebook is facing up to a $600 billion fine from Australia. Who knows fines are climbing
10:51:40 <bulletproofman[m> But i never agreed for a profile of me to get harvested even a shadow one.
10:51:57 <cn3m[m]> especially when they still have shadow profiles why not delete the real ones?
10:51:59 <bulletproofman[m> A trillion dollar fine would do
10:52:09 <bulletproofman[m> But you know what else would be best?
10:52:12 <jalb> cn3m[m], how many times EU has sued them?
10:52:23 <cn3m[m]> <bulletproofman[m "A trillion dollar fine would do"> that's more than they are worth...
10:52:25 <jalb> Not respecting users
10:52:32 <bulletproofman[m> If facebook breaks up
10:52:32 <bulletproofman[m> Fb a company
10:52:36 <jalb> They gain money with all that stuff
10:52:43 <cn3m[m]> <jalb "cn3m, how many times EU has sued"> never that much and it gets higher every time
10:52:43 <bulletproofman[m> Whatsapp a company
10:52:49 <bulletproofman[m> And instagram a company.
10:52:50 <jalb> cn3m[m], yes
10:52:59 <cn3m[m]> That's how it was
10:53:13 <jalb> cn3m[m], I really miss the old internet when it began
10:53:25 <bulletproofman[m> I knowwww it's frustrating
10:53:49 <bulletproofman[m> Fck i wish i was born in myspace days
10:53:55 <cn3m[m]> anti trust laws should slash companies up a little Alphabet being Google, Android, Chrome, and Maps as separate companies could be interesting
10:54:03 <renlord> FAANG is the new standard oil

10:54:28 <jalb> More than 50 years old here...
10:54:34 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: AND YOUTUBE
10:54:47 <cn3m[m]> yes YouTube should be it's own company
10:55:07 <jalb> Many people are moving to libr or a name like that now...
10:55:14 <jalb> From youtube
10:55:28 <cn3m[m]> lbry
10:55:28 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: It's my main concern actually. They have monopoly for everythingg.
10:55:37 <bulletproofman[m> Lbry
10:55:40 <bulletproofman[m> I'm interested in it.
10:55:46 <jalb> cn3m[m], yes!, what do you think of it?
10:55:58 <jalb> Very slow in my laptop
10:56:04 <cn3m[m]>  @bulletproofman:matrix.org at least it's an open source based monopoly
10:56:15 <cn3m[m]> <jalb "cn3m, yes!, what do you think of"> I have no idea
10:56:31 <cn3m[m]> I haven't researched it at all
10:56:35 <jalb> ok, it seems to use p2p but very slow with only 2 GB RAM here
10:57:24 <bulletproofman[m> It's decentralized
10:57:31 <bulletproofman[m> Pays with crypto
10:57:44 <bulletproofman[m> U earn crypto watchinng videos
10:57:48 <jalb> I hope it's not mining crypto...
10:58:17 <cn3m[m]> yeah it sounds sketchy I'm gonna nope out
10:58:25 <bulletproofman[m> U can pay ffav creators with crypto too
10:58:28 <cn3m[m]> I rather just use YouTube without an account
10:58:32 <cn3m[m]> their code is fine
10:59:26 <bulletproofman[m> cn3mLbry is open source
10:59:56 <cn3m[m]> I'll pass thanks
10:59:56 <renlord> anti-trust does not apply since google does not necessarily sideline other video services
11:00:29 <renlord> if you search there are still vimeo videos and what not
11:00:31 <cn3m[m]> I thought they had something about that
11:01:03 <renlord> anti-trust applied when they preferenced google shopping hits before other providers IIRC
11:02:22 <renlord> in anycase, apple should be slapped with anti-trust
11:02:31 <renlord> with their wall-garden
11:02:39 <renlord> especially that NFC lockdown
11:03:00 <cn3m[m]> they also had the advertising exclusivity clause iirc
11:03:04 <renlord> your consumer rights to purchased hardware is infringed.
11:03:21 <cn3m[m]> search too
11:03:27 <bulletproofman[m> Thiss
11:03:41 <renlord> i have a much more negative outlook on apple than Google
11:03:56 <cn3m[m]> I love Google tries to tell me Chrome is more secure than Edge no way in hell..
11:04:02 <bulletproofman[m> https://alternativeto.net/software/lbry/reviews/
11:04:20 <renlord> Edge (IE) -- maybe
11:04:26 <renlord> Edge (Chromium) -- maybe not
11:04:30 <cn3m[m]> Smartscreen is much better and WDAG is so cool
11:04:37 <renlord> the edge branding is so weird
11:04:38 <yolotrolo[m]> alternative to is really nice i wish it was more used
11:05:09 <cn3m[m]> Edge Chromium
11:05:56 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_renlord:matrix.org I rather have Apple screw my right to repair and such than Google screw my data
11:06:12 <cn3m[m]> both options are bad I know
11:06:17 <renlord> cn3m[m]: not just right to repair
11:06:47 <cn3m[m]> and such that's what I mean related stuff
11:06:49 <renlord> its a lot more than just that
11:06:54 <cn3m[m]> you're limited how you use it
11:07:03 <bulletproofman[m> yolotrolo: often visit it
11:07:22 <cn3m[m]> which is fine. I can't find an iPad alternative. I'll pay for that
11:07:33 <cn3m[m]> if that's how they need to make money I'm cool with it
11:07:39 <renlord> :(
11:07:53 <yolotrolo[m]> <bulletproofman[m "yolotrolo: often visit it"> yea i do it as well
11:08:02 <bulletproofman[m> I'm cool with

11:08:47 <cn3m[m]> night mate
11:08:52 <bulletproofman[m> Also thanks cn3m  ur awesomeee
11:10:48 <cn3m[m]> the problem with Apple is there's no alternative that balances safety with usability. I have to recommend them to all my friends and family. Everything is just too creepy or broken for the average person
11:23:01 <totemswitch[m]> Safty? What are you protecting if your data is alresdy in their hands? I mean if we are still talking about the average joe
11:30:35 <cn3m[m]> I tell them to turn off the big 4 iOS settings
11:45:32 <orge_td[m]> How do you remove the warning message at boot?
11:47:24 <renlord> orge_td[m]: not possible
11:48:27 <orge_td[m]> OK this is kind of built in reminder but yes it's what i was after anyway
11:50:36 <orge_td[m]> What is the top ten apps i should install?
12:03:18 <furofuro_01[m]> <orge_td[m] "What is the top ten apps i shoul"> Depends on your needs to be honest, but if you need free VPN, ProtonVPN works enough.
12:10:52 <orge_td[m]> Thanks
12:10:52 <renor> Do I really have to have Google Camera on a sparate profile to improve privacy/security as commented here before? What privacy implications could it have by having it on my main profile? I don't see how can it be bad if I disable the network permission to it...
12:15:52 <boniek[m]> <orge_td[m] "What is the top ten apps i shoul"> Also look at NewPipe (youtube app), Should I Answer (call blocking app), Slide (reddit app), simple gallery pro (free on fdroid), vlc (video player), tor browser, binary eye (barcode scanner)

12:45:40 <furofuro_01[m]> Just a hypothetical question, which device is worth more buying for, Pixel for GrapheneOS or Thinkpad for QubesOS?
12:46:13 <furofuro_01[m]> In terms of security, privacy, convenience and compatibility in daily life, given ISP and huge company as threat model.
12:55:48 <furofuro_01[m]> Is there any security or privacy issues I should look for?
12:57:48 <furofuro_01[m]> More on QubesOS though
12:58:45 <furofuro_01[m]> * More on QubesOS issues I mean, compared to GrapheneOS (although they are quite a different model, the former focus on compartmentalization)
12:59:47 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Has anyone run into packages failing to install?
13:00:12 <j3ghprjfo[m]> I'm trying to install wireguard from fdroid but keeping getting a failed to install warning
13:44:31 <twitx[m]> I kinda wonder why do people like Thinkpads so much?
13:53:27 <zaxxa[m]> In the past it was because of build quality and ease of repair
13:53:37 <zaxxa[m]> Particularly when IBM owned the brand
13:55:13 <EssentialChaos[m>  Afaik, they have a good keyboard
13:56:03 <dazinism> They have also been possibly the only laptop with manuals online for how to take them apart and replace parts.
13:57:25 <dazinism> Also were built reasonably well, although build/design quality has been falling
14:00:05 <dazinism> Possible to pick up old ones fairly cheap, where corporates or governments have replaced them & often can fit a load of RAM and get something reasonable.
14:01:10 <dazinism> <EssentialChaos[m " Afaik, they have a good keyboar"> Some have horrible keyboards / touchpads.
14:10:18 <orge_td[m]> On thinkpad p52 here is all good workstation
14:11:03 <orge_td[m]> I like it's rétro look
14:54:19 <blacklight447[m]> <twitx[m] "I kinda wonder why do people lik"> Good build quality, good linux support, easy to repair, dirt cheap when bought second hand
14:54:55 <blacklight447[m]> You can get qubes running with a thinkpad x230
14:55:28 <blacklight447[m]> Plop in an extra 8 gb of memory for 16gb in total and plug in an ssd and you have quite a capable qubes machine for about 300 bucks
14:56:00 <blacklight447[m]> Myself i waiting for the new thinkpads with ryzen 4800u's
14:56:51 <blacklight447[m]> 8 cores 16 threads which only use 15watt , together with a terabyte nvme ssd and 32 gb off ddr4 ram, awwwwwwwwh yeah baby
14:58:25 <twitx[m]> <blacklight447[m] "You can get qubes running with a"> Interesting but I currently rather use a PC instead of a Laptop (yes I know you can make it similar to a PC experince but yeah) (hmm I'll might buy a Laptop in some years)
14:59:15 <twitx[m]> I currently still have a Laptop but its kinda broken and repairing it wouldn't make sense
16:34:10 <brenneke[m]> Can anyone comment on whether Aegis Authenticator app is safe to use?
16:42:26 <cn3m[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Myself i waiting for the new thi"> Verify it doesn't look suspicious (no network permission would be a good sign). This one only needs Camera and fingerprint for me. I got from F-Droid and am careful with updates (Janus vulnerability)
16:44:09 <cn3m[m]> it also doesn't have any broadcast receivers too assess
16:44:39 <cn3m[m]> That's the kind of things anyone can do with an app like Stanley
16:44:47 <zaxxa[m]> I use aegis from f droid store
16:51:09 <dazinism> Noticed this issue and questioned using andOTP
16:51:11 <dazinism> https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP/issues/427
16:52:17 <dazinism> This blog post made me think the aegis devs are somewhat competent
16:52:19 <dazinism> https://alexbakker.me/post/mysterious-google-titan-m-bug-cve-2019-9465.html
16:53:11 <cn3m[m]> yeah apparently my crypto guy who found the NextCloud bug said Aegis is best
16:53:12 <cn3m[m]> I'm going with that now
16:54:11 <cn3m[m]> I don't know jack about crypto that's just one area I trust companies that have good track records in other areas
16:58:40 <brenneke[m]> <cn3m[m] "yeah apparently my crypto guy wh"> Sweet thanks. What is in it for them to develop and maintain a free app like that?
17:00:15 <zaxxa[m]> One thing I will say about andotp is that the developer acknowledges the problems with it
17:00:53 <zaxxa[m]> In the post you linked they already state they are rewriting the app
17:02:11 <cn3m[m]> I love how people complain about GrapheneOS short device support. You totally miss the goal for the project.
17:03:56 <cn3m[m]>  @brenneke:matrix.org it has encrypted backup
17:04:06 <cn3m[m]> probably for a resume

17:13:47 <cn3m[m]> if all memory exploits were impossible on Graphene/Vanadium(they aren't, but let's say they were) there would be a 3% chance that any given exploit chain for a Pixel running Stock Android with Chrome would run on the GrapheneOS and Vanadium

18:23:37 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: update it to that if you can
18:23:43 <bulletproofman[m> cn3m: Not the projet, i'm curious about how long he has been developing
18:23:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Should I close that pr and open a new one?
18:23:44 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: if it's a stable release
18:23:49 <strcat[m]> we don't use the dev releases
18:23:51 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yeah just close it
18:23:57 <strcat[m]> and make sure to use the latest stable release
18:24:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay will do
18:24:05 <bulletproofman[m> He seems pretty young, i'm curious
18:24:18 <cn3m[m]> gotcha
18:24:31 <cdesai> strcat[m]: trying now
18:24:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh okay
18:24:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's a prerelease
18:25:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> So I'll not touch that pr
18:27:49 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: did you just use the upstream code btw
18:27:50 <strcat[m]> no changes?
18:28:02 <strcat[m]> and did you use their build or your own
18:36:48 <strcat[m]> cdesai: just need to figure out if it's actually removed or just moved
18:36:48 <strcat[m]> and if it is removed we can probably drop it for all devices?
18:39:09 <cdesai> embms.apk
18:41:20 <cdesai> strcat[m]: it might be gone, there's a vendor/etc/permissions/embms.xml in may which isn't found anymore either
18:41:55 <cdesai> and so system/framework/embmslibrary.jar is gone too
19:13:56 <cdesai[m]> .git is 23G
19:13:57 <cdesai[m]> <anupritaisno "BTW how huge is chromium these d"> my chromium/src is 40G
19:23:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah resolving deltas be like
19:43:13 <cdesai[m]> strcat: btw I tried to fix 83 build without enable_reporting, but it's a rabbit hole :(
19:44:13 <strcat[m]> cdesai: it's not used anyway
19:44:14 <strcat[m]> it just disables unused code
19:52:54 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: where did you get the pdf.js you used exactly
19:54:11 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases/download/v2.4.456/pdfjs-2.4.456-dist.zip ?
19:54:23 <strcat[m]> I'm probably going to do our own build but need to know where you got this
19:54:30 <strcat[m]> I don't see minified builds in their dist zip
20:13:40 <xabi[m]>  Is there anyway to remove the google bootanimation?
20:15:21 <orge_td[m]> Apparently no
20:21:32 <strcat[m]> xabi: use a device from a different vendor with a different bootloader splash
21:30:34 <xabi[m]> I dont think that grapheneos would work o a device without that silly logo xD
21:32:00 <renlord> but there's no other supported device from vendors besides google?
21:32:17 <renlord> another alternative to start your own multi-billion dollar prefab and flash your own bootloader splash
21:32:31 <renlord> do you need financing?
21:33:00 <JTL> lol renlord
21:36:24 <strcat[m]> xabi: it can work fine on other devices
21:36:30 <strcat[m]> can already be built for them without much work
21:36:33 <strcat[m]> you're free to do that
21:52:42 <xabi[m]> <renlord "do you need financing?"> I could launch a kickstarter
21:53:20 <renlord> i like it.
21:55:18 <xabi[m]> <strcat[m] "can already be built for them wi"> I don't have the skills, I built a kernel for htc magic and custom cyanogenmod ROM, i havent done anything since that day :( it was fun but there are more skilled people that know how to do things properly
22:03:27 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_renlord:matrix.org laughs in HiKey
22:03:28 <cn3m[m]> /s
22:04:54 <renlord[m]> Do you casually carry a ups with that hikey to use as a mobile device?
22:05:27 <cn3m[m]>  @renlord:matrix.org my commitment is immeasurable
22:07:35 <cn3m[m]> what are all your thoughts on Gboard with the toggle? I use it, but I know it's technically flawed until #156(I think it's that one)
22:10:49 <renlord[m]> List of used packages get phoned home?
22:11:26 <cn3m[m]> wait nope it's #213 crap
22:11:53 <cn3m[m]> the ipc it could leak data I highly doubt it is
22:12:12 <cn3m[m]> nope not that one either
22:12:38 <renlord> ipc leak data? @_@
22:13:24 <cn3m[m]> oh wait yeah it's #156
22:13:27 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_renlord:matrix.org I mean you can have any two apps talk together
22:14:18 <cn3m[m]> Gboard could talk to any app with mutual consent and send your data to the homeserver it's extremely unlikely to be in the wild, but the firewall is far from perfect
22:14:37 <cn3m[m]> now bypassing NetGuard and AFWall+ is very real world even by accident
22:15:41 <renlord> apps communicate with each other using intents
22:16:16 <renlord> i dont think they can bypass each other unless explicit user permission has been granted
22:17:44 <renlord> i dont use netguard/afwall+ its likely that these apps dont even work properly in android since they dont control access/policy in the networking stack directly
22:17:57 <renlord> (shrugs)
22:19:29 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "i dont think they can bypass eac"> it's not all user approved there's data exfil that can be done between apps without user consent. A good example being Gboard controls your clipboard entirely
22:19:57 <cn3m[m]> you can do storage of course (which Gboard doesn't need to have)
22:21:51 <cn3m[m]> you can do storage of course (which Gboard doesn't need to have)
22:24:26 <renlord> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes#clipboard-data
22:25:13 <renlord> if you're not comfortable with gboard being your IME, you can always just use the stock keyboard
22:26:48 <cn3m[m]> that's very true, I am a bit rusty on the technicals of leaking beside AFWall+ and NetGuard which I bypassed both on accident
22:27:11 <renlord> i have a suspicion that they just dont work on android
22:27:27 <renlord> and they provide a false sense of security.
22:29:06 <cx2[m]> Doesn’t it seem just a bit suspicious that gboard doesn’t request any permissions at all? Doesn’t request network permissions, but is opt-out of analytics, usage statistics, etc...
22:29:38 <renlord> cx2[m]: please.
22:29:42 <cn3m[m]> <cx2[m] "Doesn’t it seem just a bit suspi"> it has network permissions
22:29:55 <renlord> cx2[m]: open up app info and you can see that it has 6 permissions toggles.
22:30:38 <cn3m[m]> it has almost 15 permissions
22:30:58 <renlord> dont know, didnt check manifest. But in App Info, it is 6 permissions that are user-toggable.
22:31:11 <renlord> *user-toggleable
22:32:01 <renlord> this disproportionate amount of scrutiny and suspicion towards google applications is just weird
22:32:40 <renlord> it probably makes more sense if people apply this level of precaution towards FDroid applications instead.
22:33:13 <cx2[m]> I”m only seeing 4... I installed it while trying to pay attention to what you guys are saying.... out of the box it at least doesn’t request permissions at all.... “No Permissions Allowed”
22:33:39 <cx2[m]> That’s on CalyxOS though...would it even install on Graphene?
22:33:57 <cn3m[m]> 21 total permissions and 7 broadcast receivers
22:34:14 <cn3m[m]>  @cx2:matrix.org CalyxOS is missing two permissions
22:34:44 <renlord> they dont implement sensors/network permissions
22:34:52 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_renlord:matrix.org I trust Google, but someone was pushing me for a black and white answer on a filtered post if Gboard could spy on you
22:34:54 <renlord> *user-toggleable
22:35:02 <cn3m[m]> I don't think they would go that far to get data
22:35:46 <renlord> the best answer is probably along the lines of "dont install apps that you dont trust"
22:36:50 <cx2[m]> Ok.... threw it one of the Graphene handsets, I see the 6 permissions there
22:37:03 <xabi[m]> I m quite happy that stock aosp keyboard works well enough for me
22:37:22 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "the best answer is probably alon"> that's what I ended up with. It's too hard to give it a black and white asnwer
22:37:34 <cn3m[m]> <cx2[m] "Ok.... threw it one of the Graph"> I've got pixel envy
22:37:35 <cn3m[m]> I only have one
22:37:55 <renlord> cn3m[m]: do you use your hikey as a server?
22:37:56 <cn3m[m]> I'm sticking with Gboard
22:39:13 <cn3m[m]> no I have an old laptop with Arch and some hardening
22:39:17 <cx2[m]> I think what people want to know, and don’t know how to find out on their own is wether or not Google is siphoning off their personally identifiable information. Really that’s what it comes down to.
22:39:17 <cx2[m]> AOSP is fine.... OpenBoard is decent.... AnySoftKeyboard feels a little bloated.... But Gboard is just really good
22:39:22 <xabi[m]> What s so great about gboard?
22:39:38 <cn3m[m]> <xabi[m] "What s so great about gboard?"> better tracing
22:40:42 <renlord> if i had to speculate, probably not anymore, they care more about personas as oppose to personally identifiable identities
22:40:50 <xabi[m]> Predictive texting, swipe or just more accurate key presses?
22:41:00 <renlord> personas are what they sell for revenue-generating ads
22:41:19 <renlord> collecting personally identifiable data is a really big liability these days
22:41:38 <renlord> all it takes is for a relatively disgrunted software engineer to whistleblow and they are fucked.
22:41:41 <cn3m[m]> Gboard is good imo privacy wise I opted out of everything and blocked network they would really have to be sketchy
22:41:45 <cn3m[m]> I also only run it though a VPN
22:42:02 <cn3m[m]> yeah Google is pretty reasonably transparent
22:42:05 <renlord> so on the balance of probabilities i dont think they do malicious things to collect personally identifiable data
22:42:29 <renlord> but obviously they do collect data to categorise/build personas
22:42:34 <cn3m[m]> personally I trust it
22:42:51 <cn3m[m]> if people don't there's a technical way it could leak
22:43:26 <cn3m[m]> but they don't have my IP, they have almost no network paths, and they have no ad id, and I've opted out of everything
22:43:39 <cx2[m]> <renlord "if i had to speculate, probably "> Good point.... personas. For me personally, it’s “are you taking every keystroke and thus have a carbon copy of every text input...”
22:44:22 <cn3m[m]>  @cx2:matrix.org you'd have to MITM the whole system and long term I think if they were really doing that
22:45:00 <cn3m[m]> MITM works mostly to catch strange behavior
22:45:20 <cn3m[m]> like if a chip was trying to bypass system networking
22:45:33 <cx2[m]> <renlord "but obviously they do collect da"> That’s the creepy part. I don’t have a “threat model” per se, I’m not a person at risk, etc.  Other than the microsofts and googles, and amazons of the world constantly trying to sneak in.
22:46:16 <cn3m[m]>  @cx2:matrix.org yeah just use Gboard
22:46:22 <renlord> people who have genuine threat models probably should engage in tradecraft
22:46:37 <renlord> to blend into ordinary personas
22:47:32 <cn3m[m]> I trust Gboard just can't say that with an absolute guarantee
22:47:34 <cx2[m]> I think “threat model” is thrown around WAY too much IMHO.... i mean. You have a threat model of X and you’re openly posting to unencrypted matrix channels? Come on freetard
22:48:09 <renlord> the scientific community has a very specific usecase for threat models
22:48:30 <cn3m[m]> that's the funny part the people who really know stuff aren't on /r/privacy
22:48:38 <renlord> it lets them justify why something is a problem and how it is solved by the proposed solution
22:48:41 <cx2[m]> <cn3m[m] " @cx2:matrix.org yeah just use G"> I plan on it. I mean, threw calyx on one of the handsets for a reason... don’t tell
22:48:59 <cn3m[m]> I'm only there for purely selfish reasons to fight misinformation for GrapheneOS
22:49:25 <cn3m[m]> that benefits me the more accurate the image GrapheneOS has
22:50:13 <cn3m[m]> the real experts at hiding aren't in the open
22:51:27 <cn3m[m]> threat modeling is a little bit of a buzzword
22:52:06 * cx2[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/aecpldIqOdFQzsqiwfNUTgzl >
22:52:34 <cn3m[m]> most people only are active in the privacy community if they are trying to sell something or have a superiority complex
22:52:47 <cx2[m]> <cn3m[m] "threat modeling is a little bit "> A little bit?? I’d say a MASSIVE bit.
22:53:10 <cn3m[m]> Or they are talking about their actual research
22:53:28 <cn3m[m]> that's rare though with the backlash no wonder Daniel keeps stuff in the community
22:53:32 <cx2[m]> <cn3m[m] "most people only are active in t"> Right, a superiority complex derived from self “taught” notions.... which is the most irritating part
22:54:56 <cn3m[m]> I really don't care what people use. I personally want to see GrapheneOS succeed and misinformation gets in the way of that
22:55:17 <cn3m[m]> I want to see all good projects succeed
22:55:31 <cn3m[m]> even iOS deserves a lot of credit in my book
22:57:39 <cx2[m]> Not a super huge fan of iPhone... but that’s purely from a usabilty standpoint. iPad on the other hand? Put it this way... I just got the new “magic keyboard” what an awesome combo.....
22:57:39 <cx2[m]> People are talking shit about it already... of course, but the thing is pretty great if you ask me.
22:57:44 <cn3m[m]> Tor Project generally
22:58:06 <cn3m[m]> I haven't seen anything sketchy on the MITM for my iPad
22:58:57 <cx2[m]> That seems to be the general consensus. Do you have an iPad Pro? If so, would HIGHLY recommend the new keyboard. Literally came in today.
22:59:37 <cn3m[m]> I don't have that one yet
22:59:38 <cn3m[m]> thanks
22:59:40 <cn3m[m]> https://nitter.net/FiloSottile/status/1267563464110866432#m
23:02:22 <cx2[m]> “Compelled access....” gotta love lockdown mode.
23:02:56 <cx2[m]> Then again, you’d be hard pressed to find me in a scenario where I would need it, I still like the idea of it.
23:05:21 <cn3m[m]> I don't use fingerprint
23:05:58 <cn3m[m]> I only check my phone for here/Reddit, Twitter, and email
23:07:30 <cx2[m]> Good move.... I need to get on that band wagon....to help I have just recently discovered all of the things I can do with the Feeder app... like piping in twitter feeds..... invidious, blogs, etc.
23:07:52 <cx2[m]> Thought he camera with Visual Core is prettty bonkers if you’re into photography
23:08:04 <cx2[m]> Though*
23:08:18 <cn3m[m]> Twitter is on fire with politics lately
23:08:28 <cx2[m]> I stay away from that shit
23:08:39 <cn3m[m]> good to see people standing up for what they believe in
23:09:26 <cx2[m]> No disagreement there.... but new / social media have been nothing but in your face politics. Round the clock.
23:09:34 <cx2[m]> News*
23:11:06 <cn3m[m]> for me attacks on mail in voting was my line for I no longer want to avoid this stuff
23:11:17 <cn3m[m]> I was were you were totally
23:12:02 <cx2[m]> Attacks on mail-in voting?
23:13:31 <cn3m[m]> you haven't been following the news? the president is suggesting states that voted on this should be punished
23:13:48 <cn3m[m]> officially bully pulpit to steal an election
23:14:41 <cx2[m]> OHHH..... you mean not allowing it.
23:14:41 <cx2[m]> I think there’s an argument to be had there for sure.... But the opposite side is blatantly obvious.  folks have the ability to counterfeit currency.... currency that has some pretty advanced anti-counterfeit features..... Mailing in votes seems like ridiculously easy target
23:14:43 <cn3m[m]> the fascist line has been crossed in America that's the final straw for me
23:15:17 <cn3m[m]> I have had mail in voting rejected so I question that
23:15:24 <cn3m[m]> my signature wasn't quite right so I had to redo it
23:16:15 <cx2[m]> I’d have a really hard time then... my signature changes ALL the time. I have trash handwriting...they would reject every vote hahaha
23:17:14 <cn3m[m]> haha yeah I've actually had to revote twice I almost always vote by mail
23:18:59 <cx2[m]> No doubt there are some cases where it should be allowed. Folks that are traveling abroad, business abroad, those that are handicapped and have difficulty leaving the house etc. But mail in voting as a rule seems pretty sketch
23:19:05 <cx2[m]> Who knows. It’s all sketch to me.
23:19:25 <cn3m[m]> gets more people to vote
23:20:00 <cn3m[m]> it shouldn't be forced, but if a state votes to allow it for public health they shouldn't have their money taken away
23:20:36 <cx2[m]> True.
23:20:47 <cn3m[m]> on the grounds it will cause mass fraud which is purely FUD. No one is going to jail to vote twice. A vote isn't worth that much
23:21:34 <cx2[m]> Eh, dead people have been voting for years, and people do shit everyday that they COULD go to jail for, they just aren’t caught
23:22:37 <cn3m[m]>  @cx2:matrix.org proof beyond 0.005%
23:22:53 <cn3m[m]> I'm genuinely curious
23:23:29 <cn3m[m]> I've never seen a case of a vote audit going that high
23:25:13 <cx2[m]> But it’s not the people voting twice that I think would be the problem. The potential is there for bad actors to take advantage for sure.
23:25:39 <renlord> this is trending towards ##politics
23:25:59 <cn3m[m]> true
23:28:47 <cx2[m]> As far as proof beyond whatever percent... I don’t have it because I really don’t care if I’m being honest. I know that I have been fortunate, so I am doing what I can help help those that aren’t in the same position. That is not to say that I am totally selfless, don’t get me wrong. But as far as politics goes, that’s why I originally said I stay out of it.
23:29:27 <cn3m[m]> oof I just saw a whopper from Reddit
23:29:51 <cn3m[m]> Android and iOS have trackers, but Linux phones don't
23:30:05 <cn3m[m]> that's just wow...
23:31:39 <cx2[m]> <cn3m[m] "Android and iOS have trackers, b"> Duh. This is common knowledge. Ubuntu are all they use in high security super max ultra secret places.
23:32:40 <cn3m[m]> is that sarcasm? I can't tell sorry
23:33:38 <cx2[m]> My keyboard is wet from how much those words were dripping with sarcasm.
23:34:19 <cn3m[m]> okay good just making sure haha
23:35:47 <cx2[m]> Speaking of trackers.... as far as classy shark is concerned, I have successfully eliminated them from the Graphen handsets (except the one I just put GBoard on)...
23:35:47 <cx2[m]> ...but too scared to even attempt ClassyShark on the Calyx handsets 😬
23:36:30 <cn3m[m]> How many pixels do you have?
23:37:20 <cx2[m]> 5... I only use one as my actual phone haha.... I’m not a weirdo
23:37:46 <cn3m[m]> here's what I posted "Exodus Privacy shows none of my apps have trackers. I can also run Linux apps with Termux and my OS has zero telemetry and strong sandboxing even if I did have trackers. My Linux laptop has Fedora telemetry code and Firefox telemetry code on it and no effective sandboxing (only Flatpak)."
23:38:08 <cn3m[m]> honestly GrapheneOS is highly underrated for privacy
23:38:20 <cn3m[m]> the security sure people agree there
23:39:43 <cx2[m]> <cn3m[m] "honestly GrapheneOS is highly un"> I think this is more because folks as TheJollyRoger would put it, “want more toggles and such to ‘futz’ around with.”
23:40:43 <cn3m[m]> LineageOS doesn't practically impact the privacy model of the OS
23:41:21 <cn3m[m]> as an ad tech developer you give me phones to track the iPhone and GrapheneOS phone scare me more than the Lineage ones with Magisk and Xposed
23:42:38 <cx2[m]> <cn3m[m] "as an ad tech developer you give"> What do you mean? I think I’m misreading
23:44:27 <cn3m[m]> I worked in adtech and I would find it much easier to futz with the stupid stuff on Lineage
23:45:07 <cx2[m]> Ok got it... That’s what I thought.
23:45:07 <cx2[m]> Dang, it’s great to have someone like you around the project then!
23:47:01 <cn3m[m]> honestly I thought I knew a lot about breaking stuff
23:47:12 <cn3m[m]> but Daniel boggles me how much he knows
23:47:26 <cn3m[m]> he knows more than me on this stuff
23:48:11 <JTL> Pretty sure he's been working on this stuff for over 5 years at this point
23:48:45 <cn3m[m]> 6 years on this project
23:49:04 <JTL> right
23:49:24 <renlord> on top of all that AL contribution, GRSec, LKML and friends lulz
23:49:29 <cn3m[m]> he has a security mindset
23:49:32 <renlord> and Rust contributions also
23:50:01 <cn3m[m]> he's a security master
23:50:03 <renlord> probably dreams code at night hehe
23:51:22 <cn3m[m]> I can't code that well for a developer who actually had a job doing it
23:51:36 <cn3m[m]> I need to learn that stuff well
23:57:01 <cx2[m]> THATS where i remember seeing that name... cn3m that Nitter link you posted earlier....
23:57:10 <cx2[m]> https://github.com/FiloSottile/age
23:57:24 <cn3m[m]> :)
23:57:48 <cx2[m]> RAGE for me.... but still
23:58:22 <cn3m[m]> I love Pixels so much
23:58:39 <cx2[m]> Same.....clearly
23:59:23 <cn3m[m]> software matters so much
