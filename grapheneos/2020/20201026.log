00:01:18 <HagbardCeline[m]> Is there a place where graphene stores the equivalent of sys logs or dmesg or suchlike?    I'm getting a lot of restarts and I'd like to investigate why.
00:06:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Hagbard Celine](https://matrix.to/#/@queuedvariable:matrix.org) where and how are you getting these restarts?
00:10:55 <HagbardCeline[m]> They seem to occur largely at random, and almost never when I'm using the device.     That also correlates pretty well with the device being plugged in, but I'm not entirely certain.      I come back to the device frequently to a 'pin required after device restart' message.
00:11:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> What's the device this occurred on?
00:11:44 <HagbardCeline[m]> Pixel 3a.
00:12:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay
00:12:26 <HagbardCeline[m]> It also occurs to me it could be updates, but that would really be a lot of updates.
00:12:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Try going to developer options and take a bug report
00:17:15 <lev[m]> > > <@devnull:privacytools.io> Hi. I've a quick question. I previously read that in the new update (I assume the one that just came out) always on display will be fixed / implemented. I just updated my P4XL and I'm unable to find it.
00:17:15 <lev[m]> > Where?
00:17:15 <lev[m]> they are talking about ambient display, which was mentioned in the latest patch notes
00:17:22 <lev[m]> and does work
00:17:58 <lev[m]> settings > display > lock screen > always show date and time
03:28:07 <bfdjcdubfoor> Hey there! Is this the correct channel to seek support? I've read the FAQ and already attempted to solve the issue myself.
03:32:09 <louipc> yes. nice job
04:16:46 <makingaliasesisa> Do i have to be running stock pixel software to install grapheneos? Or can i be running calyxOS and install grapheneOS.
04:22:36 <Linus[m]> You can install from Calyx, just make sure to remove the Calyx custom key first
04:22:49 <makingaliasesisa> Ok thank you
04:24:03 <makingaliasesisa> So it be something like this says. https://grapheneos.org/install#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
04:26:15 <Linus[m]> Yeah exactly
04:26:31 <Linus[m]> Other than that part everything is the same
04:26:45 <makingaliasesisa> Than you. ðŸ™‚
04:26:55 <Linus[m]> I installed from Calyx a couple weeks ago as well
04:27:04 <makingaliasesisa> * Thank you. ðŸ™‚
04:27:12 <Linus[m]> * I installed GrapheneOS from Calyx a couple weeks ago as well
05:48:46 <donovanvt[m]> I'm looking to use VM in grapheneos with separate socks5 or VPN client. Any suggestions? I tried vmos, x8 sandbox etc, nothing works with VPN or proxydroid
05:52:23 <donovanvt[m]> Actually not VMOS, I'm unable to run it at all here. Other chinese VM app, idk name
05:54:57 <makingaliasesisa> So I installed grapheneOS and when I did fastboot erase command and did fastboot flashing lock it gives me an error unable to find any OS to boot
05:55:38 <makingaliasesisa> So I can only run it unlocked sadly rn.
05:58:17 <makingaliasesisa> Also I'm on the pixel 4a.
06:03:35 <Lotta[m]> <makingaliasesisa "Also I'm on the pixel 4a."> :<
06:04:00 <Lotta[m]> <donovanvt[m] "I'm looking to use VM in graphen"> Why not just a separate secondary user?
06:04:29 <Lotta[m]> Literally have a different userspace, storage, apps, settings and even vpn that does not leak even set in multile users?
06:05:11 <Lotta[m]> * Literally have a different userspace, storage, apps (after installing the desired/chosen for the user purpose), settings and even vpn that does not leak even set in multile users?
06:09:28 <clox[m]> Which VPN works the best with grapheneOS?
06:11:10 <bend[m]> I use proton and it works well
06:11:38 <makingaliasesisa> Mullvad also works I believe
06:12:30 <null[m]> I think any VPN on Graphene will work the same as it does on normal Android
06:13:36 <clox[m]> Thank you guys.
06:16:49 <makingaliasesisa> Does anyone have a fix for when the locked bootloader saying "Can't find a valid operating system"
06:17:00 <makingaliasesisa>  * Does anyone have a fix for when the locked bootloader says "Can't find a valid operating system"
06:17:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> [makingaliasesisannoying](https://matrix.to/#/@makingaliasesisannoying:matrix.org) known bug. Flash the grapheneos
06:17:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> * [makingaliasesisannoying](https://matrix.to/#/@makingaliasesisannoying:matrix.org) known bug. Flash the grapheneos OTA
06:17:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then lock
06:17:18 <makingaliasesisa> ok thank you
06:17:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> And fully boot the OS once
06:17:29 <makingaliasesisa> i will try that.
06:18:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Most users with this issue abort the initial boot and that's what causes the bootloader to create this mess
06:19:17 <makingaliasesisa> so i would first boot into the OS then reboot into the bootlaoder and then do the flashing command?
06:19:35 <makingaliasesisa> if i were to do it from scratch
06:42:58 <makingaliasesisa> anupritaisno1: So i unlocked the bootloader and followed the steps from here https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-sideloading and then did the fastboot flashing command and it results in the same thing. Did i have to do the fastboot erase command? Sorry for this ðŸ˜•
06:52:09 <makingaliasesisa> Ok so i tried installing the pixel 4a stock OS on it again and i get the "Can't find a valid operating system" I followed the steps as show here https://grapheneos.org/install and followed  this step https://grapheneos.org/install#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
06:52:15 <makingaliasesisa> so i am confused
06:52:21 <makingaliasesisa> Sorry
06:59:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah you're doing something wrong
07:00:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Either you're interrupting the first OS boot in some way
07:00:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or you've triggered some bootloader bug
07:01:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> [makingaliasesisannoying](https://matrix.to/#/@makingaliasesisannoying:matrix.org) so just do this. Install grapheneos and boot it fully
07:01:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pass the setup wizard and all that
07:01:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then shut it down normally, no hardware shutdown bs
07:01:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then try to lock it
07:02:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> It might also be that whatever you downloaded was modified or corrupted
07:02:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or bad USB cable
07:39:25 <oxlur> Does anyone here have any experience in disabling Hardware features like Bluetooth Wifi GPS?
07:42:24 <makingaliasesisa> anupritaisno1: I got it locked aand booting. Thank you so much :)
07:43:42 <fll[m]> <oxlur "Does anyone here have any experi"> "Disabling hardware" how? Desoldering?
08:37:04 <vavava[m]>  just installed on the 4a; works nice until now :)
08:37:58 <vavava[m]> i just notice that there is a little detail missing (it's just my concern) : we can't change the default font.
08:38:20 <vavava[m]> i'm thinking about rebuilding graphene for this detail ahahahah
08:40:20 <ukn0w3m3[m]> Anyone building grapheneos for other devices
08:40:38 <vavava[m]> grapheneos is only for google pixel
08:41:16 <somenerd[m]> I think it can be built though
08:54:59 <somenerd[m]>  * I think it can be built for other devices though
09:14:11 <AppAraat[m]> Did the latest update remove file access permissions for Vanadium? I can't seem to be able to see them in the permissions settings.
09:32:31 <AppAraat[m]> Or I guess it's called storage access.
09:33:38 <Lotta[m]> <AppAraat[m] "Did the latest update remove fil"> Yeah, it has been "removed"
09:33:49 <Lotta[m]> <AppAraat[m] "Did the latest update remove fil"> It's unnecessary to download and upload files

10:13:32 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: Storage permissions are deprecated
10:13:51 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: apps shouldn't be asking for access to your home directory anymore, it's officially deprecated
10:14:09 <strcat[m]> Vanadium had no use for it and it was removed - not sure what's unclear about that
10:14:30 <strcat[m]> the reason it was still present upstream is for old versions of Android where they use a different approach
10:14:47 <strcat[m]> since they didn't just adopt SAF to ask the user where to save each downloaded file, or a directory to save multiple
10:14:58 <strcat[m]> they used newer APIs for Downloads
10:15:15 <Butthole01> hey guys, i think i may have found a bug (may be an android 11 feature, and if so its stupid). this the right place to report it?
10:15:25 <Butthole01> also, should I check the github first, see if its already an issue?
10:15:48 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: why would we keep having the app request a deprecated permission that's not used by the app?
10:17:42 <donovanvt[m]> <Lotta[m] "Normally not really, as only one"> I think there is the way through ovpn cfg file. Will try
10:19:46 <Butthole01> never mind issue #350 is what i was going to mention
10:19:47 <AppAraat[m]> <strcat[m] "AppAraat: apps shouldn't be aski"> Wasn't aware of this. Curious about how file explorer apps like Ghost Commander will handle it.
10:30:09 <oxlur> someone help me disable hardware components from graphene. like wifi and bluetooth. Either permanently by unloading kernel modules / drivers, or temporarily disabled to be switched on and off through only developer options
10:35:10 <oxlur> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64532247/disable-hardware-features-like-bluetooth-wifi-gps-etc-in-android-10-source-code
10:35:25 <oxlur> Anyone got ideas?
11:04:53 <strcat[m]> disable it via the standard UI
11:05:16 <strcat[m]> if you want to manage a device and disallow users from doing stuff, use a device manager
11:08:03 <oxlur> any device managers in mind? any opensource?
11:08:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <oxlur "someone help me disable hardware"> One possible solution is copy some of our system property code, add a new section in settings and make everything a module. Then use system properties to add and remove modules using on property
11:08:21 <Lotta[m]> <oxlur "any device managers in mind? any"> Make one
11:09:17 <Lotta[m]> Just to have control on how the app works, you control the app that control the user/profile

11:12:31 <strcat[m]> if you want to control what users are allowed to do that's what device managers are for

11:21:11 <dragonfly826[m]> Btw guys, is there a way to add ublock origin to vanadium? And if its possible, is it a good idea? Or would it be more of a setback as opposed to an enhancement?
11:21:53 <strcat[m]> read the issue tracker
11:22:21 <strcat[m]> there's an open issue about content filtering
11:22:31 <strcat[m]> doesn't seem there's interest in advancing it
11:22:38 <strcat[m]> otherwise someone would be working on it
11:22:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> also read the usage guide
11:22:52 <marlow11[m]> I haven't flashed GOS in a couple of years, but I remember the flash-all script not taking so long and providing some output. I'm flashing on new pixel 4a, using updated arch Linux and android-tools package. It's been sitting there for 20 mins seemingly doing nothing. Should I leave it longer?
11:22:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Content filtering can work against you
11:23:17 <strcat[m]> marlow11: no it's not working your OS or hardware (USB port, cable, etc.) is broken
11:23:47 <marlow11[m]> strcat: okay that's what I thought I'll try another cable thanks :-)
11:24:30 <strcat[m]> marlow11: did you install the android-udev package as recommended by our install guide?
11:25:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "otherwise someone would be worki"> Because it can easily be implemented by one of the many FOSS apps that already do this using vpnservice? There's also adblock DNS and custom DNS options like pihole that end up doing the same thing and there are private DNS providers that can be set in settings that do the same thing
11:25:24 <strcat[m]> it's not the same thing
11:25:29 <strcat[m]> please look at the issue filed on the tracker
11:25:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> So you need content hiding too?
11:25:48 <strcat[m]> that's not what I'm talking about
11:25:52 <strcat[m]> please read the issue on the tracker
11:26:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> K
11:26:07 <strcat[m]> DNS filtering is not the same thing
11:26:17 <strcat[m]> either way it's not really much of a privacy feature, it's a usability feature
11:26:27 <marlow11[m]> strcat: nope just ran it as root as I already had shell open to update system. Does that package provide utility other than running as regular user?
11:26:44 <marlow11[m]> Changed cable, worked immediately. Great
11:26:44 <strcat[m]> marlow11: no it's just to run it as a regular user

11:28:36 <marlow11[m]> Did I read that someone is working on getting auditor working for 4a for next security update? (Where is the search function in element :-/)
11:29:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/issues/10
11:29:39 <strcat[m]> read it and discuss there if there is anything to add
11:34:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <marlow11[m] "Did I read that someone is worki"> Yes you did and it's going to be a bit of a rush
11:35:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Somebody did volunteer to maintain it but by the time they get the device
11:35:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> At best there will be just 2-3 days to implement and test it before we ship it out
11:36:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> But yeah 4a has a volunteer who's maintaining it now
11:36:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> It will receive better support over time
11:36:42 <marlow11[m]> Oh wow that's fantastic news
11:37:44 <marlow11[m]> I only got my 4a today. I'll help out however I can when I can get my shit together. Can't thank you guys enough for all your work on GOS
11:37:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway he won't have the device until November so need to wait and see
11:38:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> If he doesn't do it then I'll probably buy the phone myself
11:38:05 <marlow11[m]> Ahh gotcha
11:39:04 <marlow11[m]> After flashing it showed a different menu saying "graphene OS fastboot" that looked slick, then it went back to the standard fastboot menu. Is that normal?
11:46:33 <strcat[m]> yes that's how it goes
11:46:51 <strcat[m]> it uses the recovery fastbootd to flash the main OS images
11:47:17 <strcat[m]> it's to simplify the firmware
11:49:15 <marlow11[m]> Ahh okay. Just surprised me as the other menu looked way nicer now it's gone
11:50:02 <trismous[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "But yeah 4a has a volunteer who'"> I presume this takes a lot of experience and time. New volunteers with little to no knowledge would have to spend few months to get to this kind of level/
11:50:05 <kieni1[m]> Pixel 3a showed "limited connection" in 2 different wlans, but no decrease of speed or connectivity happened. Switching in network details -> privacy to "per-network randomized MAC" and the back solved the problem.

11:50:09 <trismous[m]>  * I presume this takes a lot of experience and time. New volunteers with little to no knowledge would have to spend few months to get to this kind of level, right?
11:51:01 <strcat[m]> doubt there was any problem resolved by that
11:51:13 <strcat[m]> you're just attributing it to that (wrongly) because it had to reconnect
11:51:26 <strcat[m]> some networks are unreliable
11:51:32 <strcat[m]> connectivity checks failing on those is not surprising
11:51:48 <strcat[m]> reconnecting will make it immediately attempt it again, not surprising
12:40:53 <marlow11[m]> Is there a way to copy contacts and call history to a new phone such as save to a file? The backup utility looks as if it backs up everything.
12:47:50 <vavava[m]> Hello guys, do you know where can i push files into grapheneOS in order to give them execute permissions (want to launch frida-server)
12:50:46 <makingaliasesisa> the contacts app should have a backup feature
12:51:23 <makingaliasesisa> marlow11: for contacts at least
12:52:25 <marlow11[m]> I can't find it anywhere
12:53:32 <makingaliasesisa> it is in the setting menu at the bottom
12:54:01 <vavava[m]> erf it seems like we can't change permission of any file in grapheneOS, even in /sdcard
12:54:17 <vavava[m]> there is no possibility to give execute permission to a file in any way ??
12:54:37 <makingaliasesisa> it would be the export option
12:56:17 <strcat[m]> vavava: if you want to run code, install it
12:56:41 <strcat[m]> there is a special tmp directory for adb shell too
12:57:07 <strcat[m]> vavava: data in a profile home directory (legacy path is 'sdcard') is not executable
12:57:22 <strcat[m]> app data for modern API levels apps is also not executable as a program
12:57:50 <makingaliasesisa> marlow11: did you find it
12:59:51 <vavava[m]> strcat: omg my bad i was thinking it's /tmp
12:59:54 <marlow11[m]> makingaliasesisannoying: it's not there. Settings menu is the first place I looked
13:00:02 <vavava[m]> but it's /data/local/tmp
13:00:06 <vavava[m]> Anyway, mb
13:00:06 <makingaliasesisa> the export option?
13:00:38 <makingaliasesisa> it is on mine.
13:01:21 <makingaliasesisa> if there is three dots up the top it could also be in there.
13:01:44 <makingaliasesisa> actual what contact app are you using?
13:01:53 <makingaliasesisa>  * actually what contact app are you using?
13:04:56 <strcat[m]> vavava: there's no /tmp because android doesn't use stuff like world writable directories or shared directories between apps in general
13:05:45 <strcat[m]> /data/local/tmp is a special thing for adb shell
13:08:06 <makingaliasesisa> marlow11: what contact app are you using? the stock one grapheneOS comes with?
13:08:46 <marlow11[m]> makingaliasesisannoying: stock everything on pixel 2
13:09:53 <strcat[m]> it has an export option
13:09:59 <strcat[m]> look further
13:13:08 <vavava[m]> Erf i will have to root it in order to make frida-server works
13:15:49 <strcat[m]> make a userdebug build of GrapheneOS
13:17:44 <vavava[m]> yep that what i was thinking about
13:18:13 <vavava[m]> is there available emulator for the Pixel 4A ?

13:23:21 <makingaliasesisa> the export option should be in this area

13:31:54 <fll[m]> Their contacts sections look very similar
13:34:22 <marlow11[m]> fll: haha yes that's exactly what happened. Honestly I thought the contacts app was the dialler. There you go :-). Thanks?

14:25:19 <makingaliasesisa> lol
14:25:23 <barcode[m]> Anyway the crash seems to come from EGL lib
14:25:26 <Wonderfall[m]> barcode: Use GCam 7.4, newer versions won't work.
14:25:31 <makingaliasesisa>  * I haven't tried gcam ever so this is the most i know about it
14:25:47 <barcode[m]> I use 7.4
14:25:50 <makingaliasesisa> oh yeah that was a thing
14:25:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> <makingaliasesisa "you can delete this is against a"> It's not
14:26:03 <makingaliasesisa> i remember
14:26:19 <istral[m]> Where do you download it from?
14:26:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just thay we don't support it
14:26:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Just that we don't support it
14:26:45 <makingaliasesisa> anupritaisno1: cool i'm not really 100% with the rules
14:27:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> It can stop working at any time
14:27:01 <barcode[m]> And like i sais, the crash is trigger only in Camera mode and Come from EGL
14:27:10 <barcode[m]> Yep and i perfectly understand why
14:27:41 <Wonderfall[m]> <barcode[m] "I use 7.4"> 7.4.201 works fine on 3a, perhaps it's related to the 4a? We should take this to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
14:28:01 <istral[m]> Is "Google Camera" the same as Google Lens?
14:28:16 <istral[m]> Just trying to test it out with gcam
14:28:19 <barcode[m]> It's Gcam
14:28:42 <barcode[m]> Wonderfall you right
14:30:02 <istral[m]> Weird, can't find in aurora store
14:31:28 <picat> google camera isnt lens
14:31:34 <barcode[m]> I download the official ROM, and get it from there
15:33:57 <snowfur[m]> <istral[m] "Weird, can't find in aurora stor"> Download it from apkmirror (I got it from there) also you need an older Version (7.4 or lower currently) and GCamServices installed: https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider/releases
15:34:18 <snowfur[m]> <istral[m] "Is "Google Camera" the same as G"> It isn't
15:35:00 <snowfur[m]> * It isn't Google Camera for Photos and Google Lens is for "recognising" things
16:14:39 <jalb> Hi!, I recently watched a video about ultrasonic beacons to spy us and about GrapheneOS avoiding it with the Sensors permissions. Do you know if blocking sensors to an app block it? Thanks
16:15:14 <jalb> And which sensors can we block to not make GOS fail?
16:19:27 <strcat[m]> Sensors permission blocks access to all sensors not covered by more specific permissions
16:20:36 <strcat[m]> it will prevent using light sensors, accelerometers/gyroscopes (which can do very limited / primitive audio recording) and other sensors like those, so sure it'd stop communicating with apps like that
16:21:02 <jalb> Thanks strcat[m] !
16:21:07 <strcat[m]> compass, temperature, pressure, there are tons of officially supported sensor types (and then devices can add their own custom ones)
16:21:15 <strcat[m]> Sensors covers all that don't have more specific permissions already
16:21:25 <jalb> Auditor needs Sensors permission?
16:21:36 <strcat[m]> (Microphone and Camera are separate, Body Sensors and Activity Recognition are the more specific ones)
16:21:44 <strcat[m]> jalb: no, you're just misunderstanding the Sensors permission
16:21:47 <strcat[m]> it's a toggle for every app
16:21:52 <jalb> ok
16:21:56 <strcat[m]> because there isn't a standard sensors permission
16:22:18 <strcat[m]> so we add a toggle for every app so you can disable the usual default sensors access in Android (which is the same as iOS when it comes to this)
16:22:30 <strcat[m]> note Android does disallow sensors access in the background already
16:23:11 <jalb> Do you know if we need some Sensors permission right now with default and "normal" apps?
16:23:12 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview#only-gather-sensor-data-in-the-foreground
16:23:24 <strcat[m]> jalb: don't know what you're asking
16:23:35 <jalb> The truth is I don't know if I can make GOS fail if I disable some of them
16:23:49 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you're asking
16:23:53 <jalb> When I check the apps listed in the Sensors permission
16:24:02 <jalb> I see a list of them allowed
16:24:11 <jalb> I can disable some of them but I'm not sure
16:24:14 <strcat[m]> I explained above
16:24:42 <strcat[m]> there isn't a standard 'other sensors' permission so GrapheneOS has to assume every app needs it
16:24:50 <jalb> ok
16:25:31 <strcat[m]> we don't have a list of apps in the base OS that do need sensors access if that's what you're asking and I'm not going to start listing out apps for you
16:25:48 <strcat[m]> you're free to look at the code and figure it out or just experiment with it, most apps don't actually use sensors
16:26:01 <jalb> I mean in the default instalation many apps are allowed
16:26:12 <jalb> ok, I understand, thanks!
16:26:13 <strcat[m]> I explained this
16:26:15 <strcat[m]> above
16:26:21 <strcat[m]> every app has a Sensors toggle
16:26:24 <strcat[m]> reason explained above
16:26:29 <jalb> Yes, thx
16:26:32 <jalb> :)
16:28:41 <jalb> Maybe phone and camera?
16:30:15 <somenerd[m]> ?
16:30:42 <jalb> If they need the Sensor permission
16:32:23 <somenerd[m]> I think sensors doesn't disable camera/phone... not sure though
16:32:52 <somenerd[m]> > it will prevent using light sensors, accelerometers/gyroscopes (which can do very limited / primitive audio recording) and other sensors like those, so sure it'd stop communicating with apps like that
16:32:56 <somenerd[m]> here's the quote
16:34:16 <jalb> Yes, I don't know if making your phone near your face is something that needs a sensor or not if it's going by proximity or temperature. I know nothing about it, the same with the camera when you want to make some phonts
16:34:37 <jalb> *photos
16:34:44 <jalb> But I'll try anyway
16:36:47 <jalb> OK, they work well without Sensors permission
16:36:50 <jalb> Thanks!
16:37:00 <somenerd[m]> welcome!
16:37:39 <jalb> :)
16:38:35 <somenerd[m]> :)
16:58:03 <dragonfly826[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Content filtering can work again"> Hello, thank you for your response. Now, please please be patient with me here, i read through the tracker issue, and the comments everyone made on here with regards to my question earlier, and while I'm really trying, i still fail to understand how content filtering can work against me. Could you possibly try to brake it a little bit better? Id be very
16:58:03 <dragonfly826[m]> thankful
17:18:50 <Golgatha> Whenever I use Orbot as a VPN with Vanadium and do a search on whats my IP with DuckDuckGo my real IP is revealed every time. On other browsers when I search the same thing it shows as a different IP. Is this common for Vanadium to leak an IP or did I not change a setting to prevent this.

17:33:38 <somenerd[m]> I believe it makes fingerprinting easier

17:36:13 <somenerd[m]> I believe it makes fingerprinting easier, but I'm not too sure.
17:36:50 <dazinism> onigirisrev: in orbot when VPN function is on tap on the cog at the bottom, where it says tot enabled apps. Are any apps selected? Is vanadium selected?
17:37:15 <dazinism> I tested recently and it worked for me.
17:38:17 <dazinism> dragonfly826: the site can see what content you are blocking, which makes you more unique/more easy to fingerprint
18:17:05 <dragonfly826[m]> Oh i understand that but in my understanding (and please correct me if I'm wrong), with vanadium, the devs wouldn't prioritize fingerprinting -a privacy feature- over security and hardening, right?. Is fingerprinting the only reason why i wouldn't want to get uBlock Origin on vanadium?
18:21:27 <somenerd[m]> iirc, fingerprinting protection is pretty good on Vanadium
18:21:56 <somenerd[m]> I think it blends in with chrome.
18:25:41 <somenerd[m]>  * I think it blends in with chrome very well.
18:32:42 <dazinism> dragonfly826: can't add extensions, like unlock, to vanadium.
18:32:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dragonfly826[m] "Oh i understand that but in my u"> No, there are other security issues
18:33:01 <dazinism> But if you could extensions are a security concern
18:33:44 <dazinism> With the improvements in browser security extensions have become a notable weakness and vector for browser conpromise
18:37:54 <dazinism> Relying on an extension developer for security (who may or may not have good understanding of security issues) vs. the chromium security team
18:42:56 <dragonfly826[m]> Okay thank you everyone
18:44:48 <dragonfly826[m]> Any chance you guys could give me an example of a security issue that could serve as an attack vector?

19:07:58 <aldous_leekie[m]> Hello, i have a question, on my pixel 3a with grapheneOS on Android 11, i change slitty my password but forgot it. More I'm trying to put my pin password and its false, and more the timeout is high. But if i restart my phone, then the timeout desepear and im able to type my pin, so my question is, is this only a illusion and it will not accept my pin even if my password is good or not ?

19:10:43 <louipc_> each time you edit the message in matrix it spams the whole thing to IRC people by the way
19:11:02 <aldous_leekie[m]> oups sorry i didn't know
19:11:05 <louipc_> but I think you just forgot your pin
19:16:05 <aldous_leekie[m]> I mean yeah hahahah indeed i forgot my pin but it's not about that, it's about the behavior when someone forgot the pin & co.
19:16:18 <aldous_leekie[m]> Does restarting the phone REALLY bypass the timeout or not ?
19:17:10 <Golgatha> <dazinism "onigirisrev: in orbot when VPN f"> Doh that's what it was user error on my part. I thought had my browsers all selected. Thanks
19:17:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> [aldous_leekie](https://matrix.to/#/@aldous_leekie:matrix.org) you might have found a bug
19:19:17 <aldous_leekie[m]> oh shit ðŸ¥¸ðŸ˜Ž
19:19:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well I'm checking rn
19:19:52 <aldous_leekie[m]>  hahah its very easy to reproduce, so someone can try by putting a false pin/password and have a timeout and then restart the phone to see if its work
19:20:02 <aldous_leekie[m]> yeaaah amazing
19:20:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
19:20:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> It works as intended and correctly throttles
19:21:58 <aldous_leekie[m]> What happen to you ?
19:22:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just exceed more than 10 times
19:22:56 <aldous_leekie[m]> Could you see the timeout when you restart the phone ? Or you couldn't see the timeout but was still not able to enter even with the good password because of the 'invisible timeout'
19:23:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> See what happens
19:23:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> I could reproduce the hardware throttling with just 4 bad attempts
19:23:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> So it does work
19:28:38 <aldous_leekie[m]> But but i'm sorry if i'm not explaning properly or if i didn't understand you correctly but after what you that did, did you tried to restart the phone to check if the timeout was still there ?
19:33:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
19:35:56 <aldous_leekie[m]> And so what happen ? hahahha
19:36:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Works as intended
19:48:06 <aldous_leekie[m]> Which mean ? You could still see the timeout or not after the restart ?
20:17:29 <anthony_> On OsmA+ maps application, I get the message "unable to start text to speech engine" I'd like to hear the directions. So far I've failed to solve this. Has anyone had the same?
20:19:49 <dazinism> anthony_ You need to either download the recorded voice in osmand download maps
20:20:33 <dazinism> Or download a tts app
20:20:51 <dazinism> RHVoice - a free and open source speech synthesize (TTS engine with extended languages support (incl. Russian)) - https://f-droid.org/app/com.github.olga_yakovleva.rhvoice.android
20:21:34 <anthony_> Hi, I did download RHVoice, but I still keep getting same message.
20:22:38 <anthony_> I've set it up with English voice, the lot
20:23:58 <anthony_> I've installed "Alan" and get the message "This voice is installed and working", so all seems fine. When I start Osmand, I still get the annoying message about failing to start the TTS engine! I cannot see where I've gone wrong.
20:29:31 <anthony_> Is there anything I need to do extra? Every time I try to start a route, I do get a notification showing the directions, but no speech is heard and I get the message "Cannot start Text to speech engine". Why can't it start this? Am I missing something? Is there a setting somewhere? I hunted for ages to no avail.
20:30:06 <strcat[m]> did you configure it as the TTS engine?
20:31:10 <anthony_> Mmmm....Where is that done strcat?
20:33:07 <anthony_> Yes, it is. RHVoice is the only entry in the "Preferred engine" settings. Radio button for RHVoice selected
20:34:14 <anthony_> Though, speech rate and pitch is greyed out, and also is the "PLAY"
21:17:35 <telum[m]1> <anthony_ "Is there anything I need to do e"> Same. Had no luck with other TTS engines either.
21:20:35 <anthony_> Thanks telum - at least I know it's not only me!
21:21:01 <anthony_> Shame though, I really need voice directions on satnav
21:21:57 <anthony_> Maybe it's a bug that needs raising?
21:41:43 <telum[m]1> Alright, you got me curious, so I looked at it again. I found one setup I've gotten working.
21:41:43 <telum[m]1> I only found three TTS apps in F-Droid without anti features:  Filite, Voice Notify, and TTS Util. Voice notify is somewhat buggy, but works.
21:41:43 <telum[m]1> I set it to go over the notification channel rather than media in phone settings. In OSMand, you go to directions, and click the settings there. Instead of TTS English, go down to the one that just says "English" at the bottom. Not sure why other options weren't working, but hopefully that gets you by.
22:06:11 <anthony_> thanks telum!
22:11:10 <mmcblk0[m]> PouÅ¾Ã­vateÄ¾ nethemba (@nethemba) tweetol: Signal doesn't support sending encrypted messages via SMS channel anymore. So it is not very usable if you don't have a data connection. Silence does.
22:11:10 <mmcblk0[m]> Silence | Need privacy? https://t.co/Jlft2ICsPs https://twitter.com/nethemba/status/1320729409104584704?s=20
22:12:30 <telum[m]1> Sure thing anthony_  Filite has the best UI, and crashes least so if you can get away with just English, that may be the one for you. The key seems to be that not all of the OSMand options work.
