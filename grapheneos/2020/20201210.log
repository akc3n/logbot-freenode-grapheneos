01:51:58 <mistazaki[m]> this app use for what?
02:28:54 <CyberAgentOftheM> Hi
02:28:58 <CyberAgentOftheM> Meet me in off topic, Neo
02:30:22 <fred`> would be nice to be able to toggle 'private dns' per wifi/network, instead of globally
02:32:23 <CyberAgentOftheM> If you want private DNS, just use a VPN
02:33:32 <fred`> how?
02:34:34 <CyberAgentOftheM> How do use a VPN Fred?
02:34:46 <CyberAgentOftheM> Download a trusted VPN .APK, such as ProtonVPN from F-Droid Appstore.
02:34:48 <louipc> google it
02:35:22 <louipc> fdroid isnt so great. avoid
02:35:36 <CyberAgentOftheM> Why?
02:35:38 <CyberAgentOftheM> Explain that
02:35:42 <CyberAgentOftheM> Why isnt fdroid good?
02:35:44 <CyberAgentOftheM> Exactly
02:35:58 <CyberAgentOftheM> also, duckduckgo is more private than google, probably
02:42:10 <TheJollyRoger> To anyone that's collateral damage: I apologize in advance, for now this will just have to be done
02:42:33 <fred`> HADOUKEN
02:43:48 <rny> yikes
02:44:04 <rny> technically, could put the registered users flag
02:44:21 <louipc> well you just blocked the subdomain, not ip range
02:44:55 <rny> #bitcoin routinely does that
02:45:00 <rny> when there are rampant ban evaders
02:45:38 <rny> +r flag on #grapheneos, if necessary
02:47:33 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense, that's a good idea.
02:48:00 <TheJollyRoger> Er... the Matrix users though, will that cut them off?
02:48:37 <rny> oh, right.
02:48:50 <rny> #bitcoin pretty much banned all matrix users
02:48:53 <rny> lol
02:49:38 <rny> yep, small channel now LOL
02:49:46 <rny> less users than here
02:50:21 <fred`> bitcoin just isnt that popular
02:52:12 <copenhagen_bram[> I hope it gets more popular
02:52:36 <rny> pls discuss in #grapheneos-offtopic
02:52:40 <rny> or #bitcoin
02:53:02 <fred`> hey - you started it!
02:53:17 <alex-resist> What's going on, another intruder?
02:53:40 <rny> alex-resist: just ban evasion
02:58:10 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta get that dumb Matrix app fixed up again sometime. Another day though.
02:58:11 <alex-resist> This is getting really cyberpunk if we're facing digital invaders here
02:58:51 <TheJollyRoger> alex-resist: hang on a sec, let me tape a bunch of LEDs to a wetsuit or something, then we'll get Cyberpunk!
02:59:20 <alex-resist> I mean some of them are literally coming from "the matrix"
02:59:43 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
03:00:02 <alex-resist> Downside is their cyberdecks suck until they're coming here
03:00:54 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, maybe I need to make a phone case with a sliding microphone :P.
03:02:19 <alex-resist> Just attach a mechanical keyboard to your Pixel and you might actually be there
03:04:59 <TheJollyRoger> Bwahahahaha well, I do have one spare here somewhere...
03:10:29 <alex-resist> For the full cyberpunk experience, we will need convergence though. A mechanical keyboard and a head visor attached to a Pixel
03:10:39 <alex-resist> But seriously, that will be it
03:11:59 <alex-resist> *visor display or whatever it's called :)
03:12:05 <TheJollyRoger> Gonna have to make some GrapheneOS VR goggles then, haha.
03:12:23 <TheJollyRoger> Ultimate touch of the future: gotta include little glowing blue lines along it, hee hee hee
03:13:08 <alex-resist> And then the thrilling experience of PDF vieder
03:13:10 <alex-resist> viewer
03:13:40 <alex-resist> "Zoom in... enhance... zoom in... enhance..." - "sorry, it doesn't do that, I'm afraid"
03:15:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaahahahaa XD
03:17:56 <fred`> contact lenses with displays
03:18:20 <alex-resist> TheJollyRoger: I hope you know this one: https://archive.org/details/TheRealCyberpunkFakeBook you will laugh your ass off. Many things will also apply to being a pirate
03:18:28 <fred`> in case you like to read (oldsql) books: suarez - daemon
03:18:31 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahahahahaa oh boy X3.
03:19:34 <alex-resist> Truth is that the original (fake) cyberpunks literally dreamt of a device which we can now have - a Pixel with GrapheneoS
03:19:40 <alex-resist> We're living the dream
03:19:56 <fred`> it need to feels better
03:20:04 <fred`> *to feel
03:20:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's kind of funny, how like... at this point, Star Trek's own devices actually feel kinda dated.
03:20:54 <TheJollyRoger> When I had a flip phone I used to pretend I was on the Enterprise scanning something. Now, that looks like something from many years ago.
03:21:12 <alex-resist> Yeah, I mean it has to go beyond remote controls :P
03:22:13 <louipc> watchu talkin' bout
03:22:30 <alex-resist> The Real Cyberpunk Fakebook
03:22:49 <alex-resist> Which clearly is on topic, in case there's any doubt.
03:25:04 <somenerd[m]> I think the roadmap is really cool
03:29:46 <habbihabbiya3[m]> any development of graphene for pixel 5?
03:32:20 <TheJollyRoger> Hello habbihabbiya3[m], no, it's not on the roadmap at this moment, we need another maintainer for it.
03:33:14 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS has a policy of "do it right, or don't do it at all." To ensure that the developer team is not stretched too thin, a good rule of thumb is, for every device that has its own kernel and SoC and drivers that we want to support, we're going to need one more person dedicated full time to it.
03:33:47 <TheJollyRoger> Since it's a huge amount of work to support the device with quality and attentiveness that can not just be comparable to, but actually exceed the security properties of the vendor operating system.
03:40:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> What's the EOL date for the 4a?
03:40:48 <cyborgninjaneer[> 3 ends late 2021 iirc
03:40:49 <alex-resist> August 2023
03:41:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> Ah.
03:56:10 <gensu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Heh, no, that wasn't me. The nam"> How about TheJollyRoger Avlis NWN?
03:56:33 <TheJollyRoger> gensu[m]: Er, what...?
04:01:26 <gensu[m]> Ah an old game. On another note have many of you guys ripped out mics in your devices or too much work?
04:02:00 <louipc> nah
04:02:06 <alex-resist> On older phones and laptops it can be fun, on modern phones it's a pain in the ass and mostly superfluous
04:05:18 <gensu[m]> Superfluous because of GOS or just in general?
04:07:37 <alex-resist> Because it's a lot of effort for not much gain. If GOS is compromised to the point that someone can listen to your mic and use your camera, you're screwed anyway
04:08:00 <alex-resist> On older phones, it's not much effort. It's a fun exercise
04:12:57 <gensu[m]> I was def hesitant to try ripping apart my new 4a to go microphone hunting.
04:13:48 <louipc> might zap something
04:21:04 <treesa24[m]> i got graphene os working on my pixel 4a and it's so beautifu :-)
04:21:18 <treesa24[m]> the lack of bloatware is so satisfying
04:23:41 <Lia[m]> Upstream VPN fix works
04:24:15 <Lia[m]> Tried logging out, then logging in, block connections without VPN is not unsery
04:25:07 <Thatcher[m]> treesa24 it's a great feeling to be bloatware-free!
04:28:08 <joehandcockandja> Can anyone recommend a free and open source VPN?
04:29:15 <Thatcher[m]> No VPN is free, unless it's Orbot
04:29:40 <alex-resist> Well, RiseUp VPN is
04:29:53 <joehandcockandja> Free as in freedom bruv
04:29:58 <joehandcockandja> I'm happy to pay lmao
04:30:24 <Thatcher[m]> I didn't know RiseUp had a vpn
04:30:44 <alex-resist> There's even an app for it in F-Droid, everything preconfigured. Just install it and you're good to go
04:31:16 <alex-resist> Whether a VPN fits your threat model is a different question
04:31:39 <joehandcockandja> I just want a free as in freedom one
04:32:15 <joehandcockandja> I don't have a threat model except I don't want my ISP to see what I'm torrenting, not that they even care
04:32:27 <Thatcher[m]> RiseUp would be your best bet
04:32:54 <joehandcockandja> I don't trust monetarily free VPNs
04:33:42 <Thatcher[m]> I don't trust VPN's.
04:33:59 <joehandcockandja> Do you trust me
04:34:05 <Thatcher[m]> Yes
04:34:16 <joehandcockandja> Aw uWu
04:42:11 <arpysco[m]> don't you need a riseup account to use their service?
05:16:30 <brenneke[m]> <joehandcockandja "Can anyone recommend a free and "> Windscribe has free.
05:25:03 <Volkoz[m]> protonvpn
05:26:38 <treesa24[m]> is there a recommended alternative to youtube to use on graphene ? i've tried a few and all of them are giving me error messages/not playing videos
05:26:57 <Volkoz[m]> NewPipe should work.
05:27:25 <Volkoz[m]> no api or account for it
05:28:38 <treesa24[m]> i tried newpipe but it says error when i search for videos
05:28:55 <treesa24[m]> it did that on my last phone too i think
05:29:42 <Volkoz[m]> i think you have to get the latest version from their github, instead of f-droid, cuz the ones on their are out of date
05:29:57 <treesa24[m]> ohhh i see
05:30:02 <treesa24[m]> thanku
05:30:41 <Volkoz[m]> you'll have to fully uninstall newpipe 1st, then you can install the one from github
05:31:12 <treesa24[m]> gotcha
05:39:43 <arpysco[m]> you can also add the newpipe repo to f-droid but this is OT
05:47:59 <cyborgninjaneer[> Newpipe has its own repo now?
05:50:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> Ah, wonderful. Found it. Added it.

06:50:35 <LauraPortrias1> Hello
06:50:36 <Dylanger[m]> 👍
06:51:14 <LauraPortrias1> is that Graphene os or stock?
06:52:11 <LauraPortrias1> Hey so is it possible
06:52:17 <LauraPortrias1> To have a Web install
06:52:38 <LauraPortrias1> basically the graphene os website hosts all the files needed to flash onto the phone
07:06:40 <TheJollyRoger> Hi LauraP12, at this moment we don't have web flashing with an electron app available at this moment, you'll have to install using fastboot.
07:06:54 <LauraP12> Thanks
07:07:52 <TheJollyRoger> If you're not familiar with this I can try and help you through it although it's getting really late at the moment and I need to be off. If you're still having problems tomorrow, I can help you through it though.
07:08:48 <LauraP12> Yeah I'll be back tomorrow
07:09:44 <Lia[m]> <LauraPortrias1 "basically the graphene os websit"> Plan in the future (WebUSB installation), but there is none as of now
07:31:52 <Lia[m]> <Dylanger[m] "Screenshot_20201210-164220~2.png"> It looks like stock at first glance
07:32:15 <Dylanger[m]> Heh, nah she's Graphene alright

09:25:27 <heracliusmagnus[> Hi All! I took the plunge and bought a Pixel 4a, and gave away my trusty Samsung A5 2017 with LOS to a friend as an intro to degoogled Android.
09:25:27 <heracliusmagnus[> This was my first experience using ADB to install a ROM, and I managed to make it work after some hiccups. I am super pleased after a week of use, including the OTA update.
09:25:27 <heracliusmagnus[> Thanks for all of your hard work! Since I have no technical knowledge I will support financially.
09:27:54 <heracliusmagnus[> I'm wondering if there is any support for USB peripherals like a keyboard or microphone? I haven't had any luck using my USB C dock, which I've used on my A5 in the past.

10:40:22 <christian-h> Does graphenos implement the exposure notification framework?
10:40:43 <christian-h> * Does grapheneOS implement the exposure notification framework?
10:42:06 <nscnt> christian-h: No. It's a Play Services feature.
10:42:14 <Dylanger[m]> Nah, that's implemented in microG
10:45:15 <christian-h> I thought google implemented it in stock android by now? Did these patches not make it into grapheneOS?
10:56:28 <nscnt> Stock Android has Play Services. GrapheneOS is based on AOSP which does not have Play Services. Thus GrapheneOS does not have the Exposure Notifications API (which is only a Google API).
11:03:43 <dar_gomml[m]> https://codeberg.org/corona-contact-tracing-germany/cwa-android this app e.g. implements the necessary code inside the appmitself.

14:48:48 <naribia> comparing the signing procedure from aosp and graphene, why does graphene create an additional "networkstack" key?
15:12:53 <strcat[m]> naribia: because it's one of the required keys, you're looking at out-of-date / incomplete documentation
15:12:59 <strcat[m]> naribia: in fact, AOSP requires a dozen more keys without our changes
15:13:19 <strcat[m]> our build instructions don't have complete signing instructions for AOSP, only GrapheneOS
15:13:47 <naribia> I mean this is the offical docs right? https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/sign_builds
15:14:02 <strcat[m]> it's not up-to-date or complete in this regard
15:14:14 <naribia> thats odd
15:14:17 <strcat[m]> it's teaching you how to do those things not giving you complete instructions on signing everything
15:14:25 <naribia> i see
15:14:30 <strcat[m]> naribia: why? it's a guide to teach you how to do it, not something you can copy-paste to make a production build
15:14:38 <strcat[m]> it's incomplete and not updated to cover every key you need
15:14:50 <naribia> okay I see
15:14:59 <strcat[m]> naribia: you would have to generate 2 keys (apk key and avb key) for every APEX component
15:15:00 <naribia> I'm just trying to learn how to sign my own aosp builds
15:15:08 <strcat[m]> naribia: and you need additional keys that they don't mention there
15:15:19 <strcat[m]> you can see from the output of the signing process that you aren't signing everything without providing more keys
15:15:35 <strcat[m]> it shows which keys are being used, and you can see you're missing dozens of keys for AOSP if you only generated the ones GrapheneOS tells you
15:15:57 <strcat[m]> the AOSP guide teaches you how to do it, you have to extend that to signing everything by generating all the required keys and setting them via CLI options
15:16:08 <naribia> why does grapheneos use only those 5?
15:17:10 <strcat[m]> we don't have a use for signing OsuLogin and ServiceWifiResources with separate keys
15:17:40 <strcat[m]> the regular unprivileged releasekey signing works fine for them as it does for most other things
15:17:48 <strcat[m]> the reason they sign them with different keys is because a different team handles updating them, for them
15:18:01 <strcat[m]> naribia: APEX is covered in our documentation, read that
15:18:11 <naribia> alright I shall, thanks
15:18:11 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#enabling-updatable-apex-components
15:18:14 <strcat[m]> big warning in bold there
15:18:35 <strcat[m]> we have no use for out-of-band APEX updates
15:19:07 <strcat[m]> they're updated as part of AOSP, we don't have a use for building them separately as APEX modules to ship separately when we've already updated them earlier as part of an OS update
15:19:39 <strcat[m]> we aren't interested in supporting devices with only updates to a few components rather than the whole OS
15:19:46 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense for GrapheneOS at all
15:19:59 <naribia> yeah I see
15:20:09 <naribia> so why can't just a single key be used for all of it?
15:20:12 <strcat[m]> and we don't yet have a way to ship automatic updates for them even if we wanted to use them (but we don't)
15:20:20 <strcat[m]> we prefer reducing complexity and attack surface by disabling APEX components
15:20:25 <strcat[m]> naribia: keys have meaning
15:20:36 <strcat[m]> naribia: recommend learning about the Android security model in terms of keys and signature permissions, etc.
15:20:54 <naribia> ok
15:20:58 <strcat[m]> that is the reason there is more than the releasekey
15:21:19 <strcat[m]> APEX components have their own keys because the whole point is that they're treated as separate components with out-of-band updates
15:21:43 <strcat[m]> each one needs 2 keys, one for the package (apk container), one for the internal filesystem for proper verified boot
15:21:55 <strcat[m]> naribia: this is essentially offtopic though, you're talking about building AOSP rather than GrapheneOS
15:22:07 <strcat[m]> unless there's some reason you're doing it as part of GrapheneOS work
15:22:37 <naribia> right
15:22:40 <naribia> thanks for the help anyway
15:22:53 <naribia> just reading about all this
15:55:59 <MadCamel> I don't see anything in the issue tracker but I could be blind. Did the most recent update break the alarm clock again? Mine did not go off this morning. No missed alarm notificaiton as well. Just nothing.
16:11:32 <brenneke[m]> Works for me on 4a latest.
16:12:55 <emsyna[m]> strcat:  might be a dumb question, but can I link my 2 devices (sunfish and sargo) on the same attestation account ?
16:13:08 <emsyna[m]> or do I need to make one account for each ?
16:15:11 <strcat[m]> same account works
16:15:15 <strcat[m]> you can have any number of devices on 1 account
16:15:28 <strcat[m]> the UI just isn't great yet
16:15:40 <strcat[m]> it will list them in the order they're registered
16:16:05 <strcat[m]> renlord has a pending PR that's not quite complete improving the attestation history log
16:16:08 <strcat[m]> more work needed after that
16:16:19 <emsyna[m]> hmm
16:16:38 <emsyna[m]> interesting, i thought you couldn't
16:16:56 <strcat[m]> it has sections for each paired device
16:17:03 <strcat[m]> definitely works
16:17:14 <strcat[m]> my account has 10 devices
16:17:19 <emsyna[m]> but i think it's more reasonable (for my usecase, given i'll use sargo for help/testing project) to separate each device
16:17:40 <strcat[m]> I don't see much reason to split it
16:17:47 <strcat[m]> they can't interfere with each other
16:18:07 <strcat[m]> the only time there's actually authentication with the account directly is for the 1st attestation (the pairing)
16:18:16 <strcat[m]> and then after that it's based on the pairing
16:18:28 <strcat[m]> you can rotate the subscription key to prevent a new pairing based on the old one
16:18:48 <emsyna[m]> that's what i was going to ask
16:18:59 <strcat[m]> 1st pairing it uses subscribe key (the QR code on the page) to connect a fresh pairing to the account
16:19:14 <strcat[m]> after that point it's just using the strong verification based on the pairing
16:19:24 <strcat[m]> it figures out which device it's for based on the hardware-backed key fingerprint
16:19:37 <strcat[m]> and since it's already verifying the signature as part of verifying it, it doesn't need anything else
16:20:08 <strcat[m]> also part of why it's hard to actually associated a failed attestation with a device - so the alerts are based on not receiving a valid one
16:20:35 <strcat[m]> started working on implementing logging of failures but it'll only be able to do that if the basics all work (signature verification passes) to associate it with the proper device
16:20:48 <strcat[m]> anyway if the device was compromised they could block sending attestations
16:20:54 <strcat[m]> so the point of it is to give alerts when it stops receiving valid ones
16:21:52 <emsyna[m]> so if I understood correctly ; first device > remote verify with QR > setup mail & save > F5
16:22:01 <emsyna[m]> second one > remote verify with QR > F5 ?
16:24:14 <strcat[m]> yes
16:24:25 <strcat[m]> setting up mail is optional
16:24:50 <strcat[m]> and can do it at any point, or remove it at any point
16:26:46 <emsyna[m]> well if i didn't put in one day, i would've never know it was failing to deliver verifications (attestation version, i don't remember which)
16:27:04 <emsyna[m]> was caused with third party store (aurora or fdroid)
16:27:10 <cyborgninjaneer[> So any persistent exploit would result in a failed attestation, yes?
16:27:11 <emsyna[m]> either way, thanks for asking my questions
16:27:21 <emsyna[m]> always very complete and detailed
16:27:23 <emsyna[m]> you should write a book haha
16:28:12 <dmctrl[m]> Anyone's phone rebooting every few hours after the update? (Pixel 4 XL). I haven't made any updates to the settings since then
16:28:45 <dmctrl[m]> Tap to wake seems to be working inconsistently as well for me
16:29:28 <arpysco[m]> my 4a is fine
16:29:43 <dmctrl[m]> If it's just me, then I'll try a clean install
16:31:00 <emsyna[m]> oh one last question : why does some default vanadium settings are labelled as "blocked" but "allowed" when you wanna check it ?
16:31:06 <Lia[m]> <emsyna[m] "you should write a book haha"> Coding for GrapheneOS would be priority though, and on a tangential note, is linking the account to secondary users of the same phone for attestaion useful?
16:31:35 <emsyna[m]> i wish i could help with code but i barely know how to JS
16:31:47 <emsyna[m]> and regarding secondary user, i don't use it, i only use default one
16:38:28 <Lia[m]> <emsyna[m] "oh one last question : why does "> It also considers the revoked or accepted permission in Vanadium itself
16:38:37 <Lia[m]> For some of the site settings
16:39:29 <M3zytfk8[m]> Does Among Us instantly crash/not open for anyone else?
16:39:34 <emsyna[m]> hmm i see
16:39:38 <Lia[m]> <M3zytfk8[m] "Does Among Us instantly crash/no"> Yes.
16:39:50 <emsyna[m]> just thought it was odd
16:40:20 <Lia[m]> Known issue on some unity apps
16:40:41 <Lia[m]> Ask @anupritaisno1:m.apex.to for more details about it
16:42:22 <jlwtformer> I just got the Pixel 4a 5G, what work is required from me to help maintain?
16:42:23 <Lia[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201018#c5500316
16:42:50 <M3zytfk8[m]> <Lia[m] "Known issue on some unity apps "> Anyway to fix it crashing? I would like to play with my friends
16:43:42 <somenerd[m]> I believe it was a memory corruption bug
16:43:48 <joehandcockandja> <jlwtformer "I just got the Pixel 4a 5G, what"> Port it to the 4a 5G
16:43:49 <somenerd[m]> so it's the dev's fault
16:44:19 * Lia[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/DlALdsRSSIpDpmxGWvdvdbET/message.txt >
16:44:35 <jlwtformer> Fair enough. Will look into it later this weekend.
16:45:36 <Lia[m]> If you are willing to give up <a href=https://grapheneos.org/features> GrapheneOS privacy and security enhancements</a>, sure
16:47:21 <Lia[m]> Apologies, the messages here in this server is delayed
16:47:39 <Flatline> Hello, i made a tiny f*ckup and accidentally tried to install the pixel 3XL firmware on my 3a and now i am stuck in recovery, if someone could help a dude out, would be appreciated
16:48:49 <Lia[m]> Reboot to fastboot
16:49:04 <Flatline> I am in fastboot, what now?
16:49:04 <Lia[m]> (Or bootloader, rather)
16:49:23 <Flatline>  ./
16:49:26 <Flatline> whoops
16:49:51 <Lia[m]> Download the correct image and flash it, assuming you flashed (not sideloaded) the wrong image
16:50:04 <Flatline> i just did it with the flashall.sh
16:50:10 <Flatline> not sure what it exactly did
16:51:27 <Lia[m]> If you can still see the bootloader interface, you can just reflash with 3a (sargo) image
16:51:50 <Flatline> it says Fastboot mode, what do i do now? I got the correct image
16:52:59 <Lia[m]> Setup the $PATH/$env variable as of grapheneos.org/install instructions
16:53:09 <Flatline> still set in my current terminal
16:54:13 <Lia[m]> Then go on and follow the instruction on the part after the images has been downloaded
16:54:25 <Flatline> aite lemme check
16:56:01 <Flatline> it's just waiting for the device
16:56:20 <Flatline> am i supposed to push start in the bootloader?
16:58:01 <Lia[m]> Uhh no?
16:58:03 <Lia[m]> Is the device connected?
16:58:15 <Flatline> The device is physically connected but adb is not picking it up
16:59:23 <Flatline> Should i unplug and replug it, or do i need to initialize any process or something?
16:59:37 <Lia[m]> Try setting the $PATH/$env on new terminal/shell
16:59:57 <Lia[m]> then try `fastboot devices`
17:01:31 <Flatline> you mean "export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"" and then fastboot devices right?
17:02:09 <Lia[m]> Yeah, try unplugging, replugging
17:02:39 <Lia[m]> Yes
17:03:22 <Flatline> fastboot devices doesn't list it. I changed usb ports from the front panel to the back to mitigate errors but i don't think that shoul do anything negative
17:03:55 <Flatline> just to be clear, i am supposed to be in fastboot mode not in recovery or rescue mode right?
17:04:25 <Lia[m]> Did something happen earlier when you did flash-all.sh?
17:04:38 <Flatline> i can dump the terminal output if you want

17:05:17 <Flatline> ..... well there it is
17:05:24 <Lia[m]> <Lia[m] "Did something happen earlier whe"> Like, did it try to flash and not: `-waiting for device`?
17:05:47 <emsyna[m]> "Device product is 'sargo'.Update requires 'crosshatch'"
17:05:55 <Flatline> yes i know, i had the wrong image
17:05:58 <emsyna[m]> you're using the wrong image
17:06:10 <Flatline> and no, first try went clean
17:06:34 <Flatline> except for the part where i had the wrong image
17:06:36 <emsyna[m]> doesn't flashing another image other than the actual device hardbrick ?
17:06:49 <Flatline> if it hardbricked i wouldn't be in fastboot mode
17:06:53 <Lia[m]> <emsyna[m] ""Device product is 'sargo'.Updat"> that was the issue
17:07:00 <Lia[m]> And can't reflash apparently
17:07:32 <Lia[m]> <emsyna[m] "doesn't flashing another image o"> What slot are you on now?
17:07:44 <emsyna[m]> strcat
17:07:44 <Flatline> i am pretty sure i just need to kick of the flash process from the phone again. i just need to know how
17:07:53 <Lia[m]> <Flatline "..... well there it is"> what slot are you on now?
17:08:10 <Flatline> you mean usb slot?
17:08:55 <Lia[m]> Reflashing doesn't seem to resolve this
17:09:07 <Flatline> it doesn't communicate with the phone, that's all
17:09:23 <Lia[m]> Guess at the moment, try to reboot to recovery and do a factory reset
17:09:37 <Flatline> recovery, not rescue . got it
17:09:56 <arpysco[m]> shouldn't it say either slot a or b in fastboot mode?
17:10:04 <Flatline> no command
17:10:07 <Flatline> :v
17:10:29 <Flatline> slot b
17:10:32 <arpysco[m]> I mean when you enter into fastboot via hardware keys
17:10:34 <Flatline> i am back in fastboot
17:10:47 <Flatline> i am most definitly in slot b
17:12:38 <Lia[m]> Ah, well, on recovery, should have pressed power up then up button when it says "no command" when rebooting to recovery
17:12:51 <Flatline> i can just do that again hold on
17:14:55 <Flatline> pressing power and up from no command just loops back into recovery screen which goes back to no command
17:15:45 <Flatline> did the same thing with power down and now i have the google symbol
17:16:06 <Flatline> and a small looping progress bar
17:16:50 <M3zytfk8[m]> Lia Thanks for your help before, I understand why Among Us doesn't run and there's nothing I can do to fix it seems
17:17:12 <Flatline> it's probably going to take a few minutes to recover, right?
17:18:21 <Lia[m]> Uhhh, what? You just rebooted
17:18:34 <Lia[m]> Like hold the power button, then press up button
17:18:44 <Lia[m]> When it said "no command found"
17:19:07 <Lia[m]> <Lia[m] "Uhhh, what? You just rebooted "> To stock OS
17:19:42 <Flatline> It just shows the google symbol and this tiny progress bar, not sure what it's even doing
17:20:47 <Flatline> should i go back and do the power + up thingy in no command again?
17:21:15 <M3zytfk8[m]> Stock OS and Graphene OS are both installed?
17:21:48 <Flatline> I don't know what's still left on it graphene certainly isn't installed since it was a wrong image to begin with
17:22:35 <Lia[m]> Nah
17:22:45 <Lia[m]> GrapheneOS failed to install due to wrong image
17:22:59 <Lia[m]> So it boots on stock instead on the reserve slot
17:23:20 <Flatline> which doesn't boot
17:23:32 <Lia[m]> @freenode_Flatline:matrix.org yeah
17:24:26 <Lia[m]> Oh, doesn't boot. Guess rebooting to recovery, when it said no command, hold the power button, then press the volume up button to show the options
17:27:37 <Flatline> now i got it
17:27:39 <Flatline> got the menu
17:28:38 <Lia[m]> https://www.bestusefultips.com/how-to-enter-recovery-mode-on-pixel-3a-and-3a-xl/
17:28:49 <Flatline> i am there, what do i do now?
17:30:48 <anupritaisno1[m4> Hi
17:31:07 <anupritaisno1[m4> My homeserver has issues so here I am with a new account
17:31:52 <Flatline> wipe data/ factory reset?
17:32:44 <Lia[m]> Yeah
17:32:56 <anupritaisno1[m4> ??????
17:33:08 <Flatline> and then?
17:33:26 <Flatline> i mean it said "can't send spi message: Try again" over and over again but it ran through
17:34:46 <Lia[m]> <anupritaisno1[m4 "??????"> Hmmm? Yeah, I'm answering based on logbot, ptio has been sluggish recently on receiving messages in this room
17:35:34 <Lia[m]> <anupritaisno1[m4 "??????"> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201210
17:35:52 <anupritaisno1[m4> I'll have a look later
17:36:10 <anupritaisno1[m4> Basically for more than a day I didn't receive any messages
17:36:13 <Lia[m]> Unsure what else is to advise on that person who flashed blueline image on sargo
17:36:25 <anupritaisno1[m4> So I'll need to talk with strcat first
17:36:33 <anupritaisno1[m4> And find out what I missed
17:36:34 <Flatline> can't i just mount from recovery and brute flash the new image ?
17:37:07 <Flatline> or do something from fastboot?
17:37:08 <emsyna[m]> yeah I left privacytools because of these issues for cyberia club, much better
17:37:18 <Lia[m]> Guess what can be done after doing factory reset is to try following grapheneos.org/install again
17:37:42 <Flatline> Not sure if it boots into the factory reset
17:37:45 <Flatline> i can certainly try
17:37:48 <Lia[m]> reboot bootloader
17:38:05 <anupritaisno1[m4> Lia: you are getting the order wrong most likely
17:38:17 <anupritaisno1[m4> You have to wipe before you flash
17:38:22 <Flatline> i am back in fastboot after rebooting bootloader
17:38:23 <anupritaisno1[m4> Never after
17:38:26 <brenneke[m]> <strcat[m] "the UI just isn't great yet"> Is there any way Device name could be listed to make it easier when multiple same model devices used?
17:39:03 <anupritaisno1[m4> Wiping after will boot you back to stock
17:39:18 <Lia[m]> <anupritaisno1[m4 "You have to wipe before you flas"> Oh... But the wrong image is already flashed, and trying to flash again doesn't do anything
17:39:42 <anupritaisno1[m4> Lia: well you should not be improvising anyway
17:39:43 <Flatline> anupritaisno1[m4 i flashed the wrong image and now i try to flash the correct image, but i am in fastboot, trying to boot back into stock before the wipe failed
17:40:41 <Lia[m]> Figures. Welp, it did kinda boot on stock, but loading for a very long tme
17:41:03 <Flatline> There has to be a way to flash the other image when i am already in fastboot
17:41:14 <anupritaisno1[m4> Lia: would you like some remote support?
17:43:33 <Lia[m]> Not really for me, but for @freenode_Flatline:matrix.org
17:44:29 <Lia[m]> @freenode_Flatline:matrix.org curious if have you tried fastboot devices again (after setting up $PATH)?
17:44:35 <anupritaisno1[m4> Also how do I delete my old account?
17:45:26 <Flatline> Lia[m] $PATH was never unset, but the device doesn't get registered by adb
17:45:58 <anupritaisno1[m4> I guess I'll delete through my workstation
17:46:16 <Lia[m]> <anupritaisno1[m4 "Also how do I delete my old acco"> assuming you can login there, it's on settings, general, deactivate my account
17:51:34 <Lia[m]> Does it still output: `-waiting for devices-`?
17:52:49 <Flatline> trying to get back into fastboot because it constantly goes back to recovery
17:53:42 <Lia[m]> If it does, try doing it on windows
17:53:44 <Flatline> and yes it is still waiting for devices
17:53:46 <Lia[m]> (The flashing process)
17:54:24 <arpysco[m]> fastboot devices works though? or no
17:54:37 <Flatline> i can go into fastboot but adb deosn't list my device
17:54:48 <Flatline> HOLD THJE FUCK UP
17:54:54 <Flatline> It just booted into stock
17:55:35 <arpysco[m]> why are you trying to adb? I don't recall that being part of the installation
17:55:46 <Flatline> adb lists the devices
17:55:55 <Flatline> or at least it can do that
17:56:25 <arpysco[m]> fastboot also can check for devices
17:56:25 <Flatline> but i think i can go about it the regular way when i am in stock
17:56:35 <arpysco[m]> with fastboot devices
17:56:38 <Flatline> fastboot didn't register the device either, i did both
17:57:02 <arpysco[m]> on linux?
17:57:05 <Flatline> yes
17:57:43 <Flatline> i will just let it do it's thing now, and start the process anew from the stock OS which i couldn't boot in from before
17:58:05 <arpysco[m]> but before you made the mistake with the first flash, it worked?
17:58:27 <Flatline> first flashed worked from the side of my PC i just accidentally had the wrong image
18:04:14 <arpysco[m]> are you using the same usb port as when fastboot could detect your phone in the beginning?
18:05:03 <Flatline> no i used the frontpanel, now i am at theback
18:06:13 <arpysco[m]> you could try the port that worked before then
18:06:50 <Flatline> whaddaya know it actually seemed to be the port
18:06:55 <Flatline> sheesh
18:07:07 <arpysco[m]> nice
18:07:23 <Flatline> let me try all the steps again
18:07:29 <arpysco[m]> try flashing again but with the right image this time 😉
18:07:43 <Flatline> the device is found
18:09:50 <Flatline> it actually does stuff
18:10:10 <arpysco[m]> nice
18:11:04 <Flatline> sidenote: I switched usb ports in a panic because some forum said frontpanels are known for bad implementation
18:11:25 <arpysco[m]> yeah the gos website
18:11:28 <arpysco[m]> lol
18:11:44 <arpysco[m]> but hey if it works it works
18:11:51 <Flatline> it seems to have run through
18:12:21 <Flatline> should i lock the bootloader now?
18:13:04 <arpysco[m]> if everything went well, should be fine to lock the bootloader
18:13:48 <Flatline> BOOOOOYAAAAH
18:13:52 <Flatline> GrpaheneOS is ON
18:14:03 <arpysco[m]> nice!
18:14:19 <Flatline> Lia[m] thanks for your patience with me, warm greetings from germany
18:14:37 <Flatline> The old image from google is wiped by the script right?
18:18:58 <Flatline> I am giddy like a child on christmas eve. This is so nice
18:21:06 <Flatline> When next payday drops i will ensure to give a donation to the Graphene team
18:21:13 <Flatline> have a good evening everyone
18:21:35 <arpysco[m]> cya man
18:22:45 <r0tt0r[m]> anupritaisno1 may i ask something in pm?
18:24:27 <antranigv> hey all, is pixel2 support out?
18:25:19 <antranigv> I realized I'm getting twitter notifications on GrapheneOS updates but I see nothing on my Pixel 2 :D
18:25:48 <arpysco[m]> pixel 2 is kill
18:25:55 <arpysco[m]> time to upgrade
18:26:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hello antranigv, yes, the Pixel 2 is end of life. Upstream has stopped maintaining it, so it's now in the process of being removed from the source tree. The images listed on the website are there for archival purposes only.
18:27:50 <antranigv> too bad, the OS was the only reason I was booting it. well not to worry, I got a Sailfish phone anyway.
18:28:15 <antranigv> in all cases, thanks to this project <3 hopefully will donate when I get payed, it kept my phone alive for 2 years <3
18:32:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
18:32:45 <TheJollyRoger> Definitely appreciate the donation, donations keep this project going!
18:39:40 <warturkey[m]>  I was wondering with the rumors of Google making devices with its own silicon, would future pixel receive a longer support life
18:40:08 <whatisthematrix[> Will donate next year for that tax refund.
18:40:50 <TheJollyRoger> whatisthematrix[: Awesome, much appreciated!
18:41:13 <TheJollyRoger> warturkey[m]: I heard about Google wanting to make their own chips to run Mainline on as well! If they do that will be very good news, I think.
18:42:01 <TheJollyRoger> Best case scenario, it will mean they won't have to keep shovelling big bucks into Qualcomm's greedy gob and Qualcomm holding support for the chip hostage ("pay up, or we leave you with an insecure device!")
18:47:06 <warturkey[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Best case scenario, it will mean"> Understood, thanks cap'n
18:49:59 <TheJollyRoger> Heh heh, well... don't take my word for it! I'm just the greeter here, I'm not an expert nor am I a developer :P.
18:50:10 <TheJollyRoger> So what will be will be.
18:54:44 <cyborgninjaneer[> Google could also start implementing hardware or low level tracking measures.
18:56:07 <TheJollyRoger> Ok but why would they need to do that? They already are the supplier for the operating system, and we're a tiny, tiny fraction of a percent of users who'll even tap on that "unlock bootloader" toggle.
18:56:56 <TheJollyRoger> There's also the issue that such features add complexity and attack surface and would be a great gaping vulnerability, and essentially be going against everything their security team has been trying to do.
18:57:30 <cyborgninjaneer[> Hopefully you're right - there's no reason they should need to do it that way.
18:57:59 <cyborgninjaneer[> I don't think Google is quite that insidious.
18:59:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Keep in mind... they also have to pay Qualcomm *extra* to get a bootloader that has a writable slot for an avb_custom_key. So they're actually going out of their way to give us nicer hardware than other OEMs.
19:01:06 <TheJollyRoger> They've been priding themselves on being *the* reference implementation of Android. I don't think the Pixels make them that much money directly, but where they do make a lot of money, is in having OEMs pay them big bucks to license Android and be a part of the Android ecosystem.
19:01:40 <TheJollyRoger> So if the reference implementation of Android turns out bad? This is going to be a direct blow to what makes them their money.
19:03:36 <Platypus[m]> On pixel 4a after last update my gcam stopped working. I was using it with lukas pieper gcam services provider app. Did this happen to anybody else?
19:03:37 <TheJollyRoger> Especially since Apple has been doing their best to try to snatch Google's lunch out from in front of them with the cheaper and smaller iPhone SEs.
19:13:10 <cyborgninjaneer[> For testing purposes, I've disabled sensor permission for every app and system app on my device. I will let you know if I notice anything odd.
19:13:33 <cyborgninjaneer[> If nothing acts up, consider having the permission off by default for pre-installed apps.
19:15:39 <Flatline> Didn't think i would be back so soon, but aurora store doesn't seem to supply an anonymous login, does anyone know any alternatives?
19:16:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> It *shouldn't* matter but it adds depth to the privacy the OS offers, so in theory that would be a good change.
19:18:09 <cyborgninjaneer[> First odd thing I noticed. Carrier default app showed up in the "Phone" permission manager after denying it sensor permission. I don't remember seeing it there before
19:19:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> After denying phone permission, it disappeared entirely from the window instead of appearing under "denied" in the phone category.
19:20:04 <cyborgninjaneer[> What is the purpose of CarrierDefaultApp? Maybe it has a legitimate need for either phone or sensors.
19:20:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> No problems with phone calls though, so far.
19:20:58 <Platypus[m]> <Flatline "Didn't think i would be back so "> Seems like i cannot login anonymously to aurora too. Maybe they have some problems.
19:21:20 <Flatline> Pretty sure they nuked the implemented token yet again
19:21:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> They have intermittent issues with creating accounts for anonymous login
19:21:34 <Flatline> thinking about getting a throwaway gmail account and using that as a shield
19:21:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's getting harder to make random Google accounts in general
19:24:28 <Flatline> i am considering just whipping one up myself and just letting it die
19:26:16 <Flatline> aaaaand you need a phone number
19:33:50 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yep.
19:34:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> Try getting a free texting app from apkpure and using that to make a gmail account
19:35:12 <digiscales[m]> <Platypus[m] "On pixel 4a after last update my"> Thanks so much the lukas camera services made earlier version work now!
19:35:13 <rinni> Platypus[m]: Yes, it's known: https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider/discussions/16
19:38:31 <cyborgninjaneer[> Are there any KNOWN system apps that use the gyros or other sensors?
19:41:23 <Platypus[m]> <rinni "Platypus: Yes, it's known: https"> Thank you
19:44:39 <cyborgninjaneer[> Screen rotation works fine. I don't see any immediate loss of functionality. Did a reboot. Still good. Initial results look good for denying sensors to everything in the permission manager. I'll let you know if I notice anything acting up.
19:46:18 <joehandcockandja> I feel like it would largely effect exercise apps that rely on sensors to track your bodily movements
19:46:35 <nscnt> Flatline: Just change the token dispenser.
19:47:56 <Flatline> you got one that's working?
19:48:14 <nscnt> Yes it works for me
19:48:25 <Flatline> oh hold on auroraoss:8080 seems to be working as it is
19:48:46 <nscnt> We have #grapheneos-offtopic
19:49:00 <Flatline> whoops, sorry
19:49:06 <Flatline> still thanks for the input
19:49:21 <nscnt> c:
19:50:31 <TheJollyRoger> joehandcockandja: yeah, I've had a similar experience; if you have Super Tux Kart, and deny it sensors permission, you can't steer with the phone because STK uses the tilt sensor of your phone as a steering wheel.
21:05:15 <donatello> Hi all I’m trying to figure out if I should get the pixel 4a or 4a 5g
21:05:33 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy donatello, if you plan to run GrapheneOS, you should get the vanilla 4a.
21:05:50 <strcat> until the 4a 5G / 5 are supported at least
21:05:57 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
21:06:02 <strcat> not guaranteed that they will be supported
21:06:16 <strcat> requires developers to step up as device maintainers to develop/maintain support for it over the long term
21:06:20 <AlanWalker18921> Hey guys Im about to Intall Graphene OS on my Google Pixel 4a
21:06:28 <AlanWalker18921> I have the Pixel Firmware fully up to date
21:06:38 <donatello> What do you mean by vanilla 4a
21:06:40 <AlanWalker18921> and OE< unlocking is enabled
21:06:43 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy AlanWalker18921, yarr, welcome to the ship!
21:06:44 <AlanWalker18921> Vanilla, unlocked
21:06:47 <AlanWalker18921> Ahoy matey
21:06:49 <TheJollyRoger> donatello: just the 4a, no 5G.
21:06:57 <donatello> Ahh ok
21:07:06 <AlanWalker18921> I got a new Google Pixel 4A Unlocked from BestBuy, USa
21:07:09 <donatello> I think they’re all unlocked in canada
21:07:13 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about the confusion! Usually when I say "vanilla" I use it as a way to say "plain" without a negative connotation.
21:07:16 <AlanWalker18921> I put a SimpleMobile SIM in, unlimited data LTE =)
21:07:39 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: yarr! Let us know how the installation goes! You should be able to use your SIM with GrapheneOS.
21:07:42 <donatello> No worries
21:08:03 <donatello> I just bought an iPhone 12 too lol
21:08:25 <donatello> Then read Edward Snowden’s book. Now I’ve gone full tinfoil hat
21:08:37 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha oh boy :P.
21:08:55 <AlanWalker18921> Watch the SnowDen Netflix documentary
21:08:57 <donatello> ill be back later...thanks for the help
21:09:04 <TheJollyRoger> If you guys find GrapheneOS useful, be sure to donate!
21:09:07 <AlanWalker18921> Israeili good
21:09:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, anytime!
21:10:14 <AlanWalker18921> How do I force delete a folder in Linux
21:10:30 <TheJollyRoger> "rm -rf"?
21:12:59 <AlanWalker18921> Great it worked
21:13:04 <AlanWalker18921> Im at the Unlocking the bootloader stage
21:13:13 <AlanWalker18921> At what point do I inssert the USB C Cable into my phone
21:14:38 <TheJollyRoger> Just a sec.
21:15:11 <AlanWalker18921> Awaiting, thanks
21:15:48 <AlanWalker18921> Ok i just did this: turning it on by holding both the Volume Down and Power buttons.
21:15:53 <AlanWalker18921> Now I see 'fastboot mode'
21:15:54 <AlanWalker18921> On my Pixel
21:16:08 <AlanWalker18921> Now, I plug in the USB C cable, and run the "fastboot flashing unlock" mode , right?
21:17:08 <mynick2> https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/precursor
21:17:20 <mynick2> check it out ^^

21:19:57 <emsyna[m]> signify-openbsd

21:22:57 <AlanWalker18921> " Illegal number: debian" ?
21:24:02 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: sorry about that, I had to step off the computer.
21:24:11 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: what version of fastboot do you have and what's your host?
21:24:19 <TheJollyRoger> (by "host" I mean, what operating system is your computer running?)
21:25:07 <TheJollyRoger> I presume you're running debian?
21:25:17 <AlanWalker18921> Trisquel OS
21:25:20 <AlanWalker18921> Trisquel 9
21:25:22 <AlanWalker18921> Trisquel 8
21:25:27 <AlanWalker18921> Based upon ubuntu/debian
21:25:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, hold it right there.
21:26:20 <AlanWalker18921> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
21:26:34 <TheJollyRoger> Be careful using different operating systems for installation; we don't support those so you're largely going to be on your own past this point. I'm not saying it won't work, but it'll be hard to troubleshoot.
21:26:53 <AlanWalker18921> "sudo ./flash-all.shsudo: unable to resolve host klarissa./flash-all.sh: 22: [: Illegal number: debianfastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html"
21:27:00 <AlanWalker18921> Im using the latest version, and its saying my verion is too old
21:27:07 <AlanWalker18921> verson
21:27:10 <TheJollyRoger> Can you run for me:
21:27:12 <AlanWalker18921> version
21:27:16 <TheJollyRoger> `which fastboot` and see what you get?
21:27:38 <AlanWalker18921> "/usr/bin/fastboot"
21:27:54 <TheJollyRoger> and what does `fastboot --version` return?
21:28:04 <TheJollyRoger> Because this gives me an idea of what's going on.
21:28:07 <AlanWalker18921> fastboot version debian
21:28:13 <TheJollyRoger> I think I have a suspici-- yeah.
21:28:26 <TheJollyRoger> You have a nonstandard version of fastboot installed on your computer and that's what's in your path.
21:28:41 <AlanWalker18921> I have downloaded the latest version
21:28:45 <AlanWalker18921> onto my desktop
21:28:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, but the computer's not using it.
21:28:56 <AlanWalker18921> right
21:29:05 <AlanWalker18921> How do I update my laptop to use the latest verison, located on my desktop
21:29:16 <TheJollyRoger> We could try prepending the location of where you've downloaded it to to your command path, but first for safety I would recommend removing the OS' version of fastboot.
21:29:24 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise you could find out what a corrupted/unbootable OS looks like.
21:30:05 <TheJollyRoger> The safety check was specifically added because the fastboot versions included with many downstream operating systems is out of date, incorrectly versioned, and doesn't support autodetection. As a result these can cause corrupted installations.
21:30:09 <AlanWalker18921> Alright, how do I do so
21:30:39 <AlanWalker18921> Alright,how do I install the latest verison of fastboot to my OS
21:30:48 <AlanWalker18921> I have fastboot downloaded as folder onto my laptop desktop
21:31:18 <TheJollyRoger> You won't need to install fastboot itself, but merely run it from where you've downloaded it. First, to remove the bad version of fastboot... let me see... if Trisequel is Ubuntu minus the blobs, you may be able to remove it with `sudo apt remove fastboot` or `sudo apt remove android-tools` but I forget what it's named.
21:31:53 <TheJollyRoger> Let me check what the package name is.
21:31:54 <AlanWalker18921> sudo apt remove fastboot worked
21:32:14 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Can you try `fastboot --version` now and see if it returns "command not found"?
21:32:19 <TheJollyRoger> If it returns "command not found" we're looking good.
21:32:34 <TheJollyRoger> Since that's what we want.
21:32:35 <AlanWalker18921> fastboot --versionbash: /usr/bin/fastboot: No such file or directory
21:32:46 <TheJollyRoger> Fantastic.
21:33:04 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, now, where'd you download and unpack the latest fastboot to?
21:33:07 <AlanWalker18921> My Pixel is currently in the unlocked state
21:33:09 <AlanWalker18921> desktop
21:33:24 <AlanWalker18921> This command worked "fastboot flashing unlock"
21:33:27 <AlanWalker18921> Now my pixel is unlocked
21:33:31 <AlanWalker18921> I did that like 10 minutes ago
21:33:45 <AlanWalker18921> Fastboot latest version is on my desktop
21:34:08 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, so, just to make sure we're on the same page, if you run `$HOME/Desktop/platform-tools/fastboot --version`  in the terminal, it returns 30.0.5.something?
21:34:24 <TheJollyRoger> (Remember, I'm flying blind, so I have to ask these questions.)
21:35:14 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: yes, I understand older fastboot versions will still unlock the phones successfully. However, older fastboot versions can also leave you with an unbootable phone, this is why we have that safety check and do versioning detection.
21:35:14 <AlanWalker18921> My platform tools folder doesnt have a fastboot folder inside
21:35:22 <AlanWalker18921> yes
21:35:26 <TheJollyRoger> Can you tell me the output of that command?
21:35:29 <TheJollyRoger> Again, I'm flying blind.
21:35:35 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not looking over your shoulder.
21:35:38 <AlanWalker18921> $HOME/Desktop/platform-tools/fastboot --versionbash: /root/Desktop/platform-tools/fastboot: No such file or directory
21:36:00 <AlanWalker18921> Again, the platform-tools folder doesnt contant a fastboot folder inside.
21:37:03 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, looks like you're running it as the root user, so it's detecting a different $HOME directory as well, so fastboot should be located at:
21:37:19 <TheJollyRoger> `/home/[your-name]/Desktop/fastboot` ?
21:37:45 <TheJollyRoger> Could you run `/home/[your-name]/Desktop/fastboot --version` for me and see if it returns the correct answer, then?
21:37:47 <r0tt0r[m]> platform-tools^
21:37:50 <AlanWalker18921> I dont even have a fastboot folder
21:37:57 <AlanWalker18921> yes
21:38:06 <r0tt0r[m]> fastboot is the application
21:38:15 <AlanWalker18921> "/home/adam/Desktop/fastboot --versionbash: /home/adam/Desktop/fastboot: No such file or directory"
21:38:23 <AlanWalker18921> yes I know, my platform tools folder, doesnt contain fastboot anywhere
21:38:39 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, then you've not downloaded fastboot correctly.
21:38:45 <TheJollyRoger> Go and do that now, or I can walk you through it.
21:38:49 <AlanWalker18921> Where is the official fastboot lattest version URL
21:39:02 <r0tt0r[m]> cd /home/adam/Desktop/android-tools
21:39:06 <r0tt0r[m]> ls -l
21:39:16 <AlanWalker18921> I mean from the internet
21:39:19 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: I can walk you through it, but you've got to stay with me on this, because again, I'm flying blind and can't see your screen.
21:39:20 <AlanWalker18921> Where do I download Fastboot
21:39:25 <AlanWalker18921> Right
21:39:26 <AlanWalker18921> Im ready
21:39:30 <AlanWalker18921> Where do I download the fastboot
21:39:55 <TheJollyRoger> First, we're going to prepare:
21:40:00 <TheJollyRoger> I want you to enter Step one:
21:40:10 <TheJollyRoger> cd ~
21:40:17 <TheJollyRoger> Enter that command in.
21:40:31 <AlanWalker18921> Alright next
21:41:06 <TheJollyRoger> curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip
21:41:14 <TheJollyRoger> Enter that into the terminal.
21:41:20 <TheJollyRoger> Hit return and let it download.
21:41:49 <TheJollyRoger> That's step two.
21:42:09 <AlanWalker18921> done
21:42:45 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Step three, we're going to verify that it downloaded correctly. I want you to run:
21:42:58 <TheJollyRoger> openssl dgst -sha256 platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip
21:43:13 <AlanWalker18921> SHA256(platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip)= d6d72d006c03bd55d49b6cef9f00295db02f0a31da10e121427e1f4cb43e7cb9
21:43:17 <TheJollyRoger> It's going to pause for a moment (depending on how fast your computer is) and then it'll spit out something that looks like random gibberish.
21:43:29 <AlanWalker18921> Its the cryptographic checksunm
21:43:30 <AlanWalker18921> sum
21:44:03 <TheJollyRoger> Alright: Does it match what you see here under "to download, verify and extract the standalone platform tools on linux" https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools for the first box of what looks like code?
21:44:28 <TheJollyRoger> To me, it looks like d6d72d006c03bd55d49b6cef9f00295db02f0a31da10e121427e1f4cb43e7cb9
21:44:34 <AlanWalker18921> Yeah thats the checksum
21:44:37 <AlanWalker18921> Mine matches
21:44:39 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
21:44:48 <TheJollyRoger> Step Three, we're going to extract the archive.
21:45:00 <TheJollyRoger> unzip platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip
21:45:10 <AlanWalker18921> done
21:45:22 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Now we're going to add this to your command path.
21:45:25 <TheJollyRoger> Step Four:
21:45:36 <TheJollyRoger> export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
21:45:46 <AlanWalker18921> Next =)
21:45:55 <TheJollyRoger> This is only going to work for this one command terminal so *don't* close it or we will have to go through this all over again.
21:46:02 <AlanWalker18921> Alright
21:46:06 <TheJollyRoger> alright, now's the test.
21:46:10 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version
21:46:12 <AlanWalker18921> I probably need to CD into the sunfish GOS folder?
21:46:16 <TheJollyRoger> Not yet.
21:46:22 <AlanWalker18921> fastboot --versionfastboot version 30.0.5-6877874Installed as /root/platform-tools/fastboot
21:46:30 <AlanWalker18921> Excellent =)
21:46:32 <TheJollyRoger> Don't get ahead of me, if you get ahead of me, I can't help you and I WILL be flying blind.
21:46:33 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
21:46:47 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, now... I don't know if Trisequel has signify.
21:46:59 <AlanWalker18921> Yes
21:47:06 <TheJollyRoger> It does have signify-openbsd?
21:47:12 <AlanWalker18921> yes
21:47:51 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. I know you've downloaded the images already, but because I don't know where they are on your drive, we'll just download them to our working directory so I'm on the same page as you
21:47:57 <AlanWalker18921> Desktop
21:48:00 <TheJollyRoger> apt install signify-openbsd
21:48:14 <TheJollyRoger> Again, I'd need to get a directory listing of the files there, otherwise I can't see.
21:48:27 <TheJollyRoger> You're also in your root account, so that will direct to a different user.
21:48:31 <TheJollyRoger> So, for now:
21:48:39 <AlanWalker18921> I have the Sunfish and sig on desktop
21:49:11 <AlanWalker18921> I used signify to verify the signature of the SIG but I havent verified the sunfish installation itself
21:49:19 <AlanWalker18921> .sig = verified
21:49:26 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, do for me the following:
21:49:34 <TheJollyRoger> ls /home/adam/Desktop/*.zip
21:49:49 <TheJollyRoger> What do you see?
21:50:06 <AlanWalker18921> "/home/adam/Desktop/platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip/home/adam/Desktop/sunfish-factory-2020.12.08.08.zip"
21:50:20 <TheJollyRoger> If you've already gotten a "verified" when you ran signify, she's good.
21:50:20 <AlanWalker18921> I also have the .sig downlaoded onto desktop also
21:50:31 <AlanWalker18921> That was just verifying the .sig file
21:50:38 <AlanWalker18921> Which is seperate form the sunfish main OS file
21:50:54 <AlanWalker18921> So ive verified the .sig file, but the main actual OS files, I havent verified
21:51:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, the .sig file contains the information needed to validate the .zip. If you got "verified" it's already verified the .zip.
21:51:06 <AlanWalker18921> There 2 seperate fies
21:51:07 <AlanWalker18921> files
21:51:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yep.
21:51:10 <AlanWalker18921> Great!
21:51:12 <TheJollyRoger> You're good.
21:51:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, now, next step...
21:51:29 <AlanWalker18921> cd into sunfish ?
21:51:37 <TheJollyRoger> Don't get ahead of me.
21:51:46 <TheJollyRoger> cd /home/adam/Desktop/
21:51:48 <TheJollyRoger> And then run
21:51:52 <AlanWalker18921> "sunfish-factory-2020.12.08.08"
21:52:02 <TheJollyRoger> unzip sunfish-factory-2020.12.08.08.zip
21:52:11 <TheJollyRoger> Again, we need to unzip the zipfile first.
21:52:26 <AlanWalker18921> Ok its as a folder now
21:52:34 <AlanWalker18921> The folder has a Lock icon around it
21:52:36 <TheJollyRoger> ok. cd into sunfish-factory-yaddayadda.
21:52:38 <AlanWalker18921> but I can open the folder
21:53:01 <TheJollyRoger> One last check.
21:53:02 <AlanWalker18921> Ok *hacker voice* im in
21:53:05 <TheJollyRoger> ls .
21:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> Run that.
21:53:25 <AlanWalker18921> "avb_pkmd.binbootloader-sunfish-s5-0.3-6835615.imgflash-all.batflash-all.shflash-base.shimage-sunfish-2020.12.08.08.zipradio-sunfish-g7150-00023-201008-b-6891498.img"
21:53:42 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Plug in your phone.
21:53:53 <TheJollyRoger> Switch it on to Fastboot if it isn't already. You said it's unlocked?
21:54:14 <AlanWalker18921> yes its on fastboot, and I unlocked it
21:54:19 <AlanWalker18921> Device state: unlocked
21:54:39 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Make sure that cable is in nice and snug on both ends and the phone is placed in a position where it won't fall.
21:55:01 <AlanWalker18921> Ok shes ready
21:55:07 <TheJollyRoger> Before I tell you the next command, it's imperative that you don't disturb the phone until it's finished.
21:55:12 <AlanWalker18921> Right
21:55:12 <TheJollyRoger> Got that?
21:55:15 <AlanWalker18921> yes
21:55:24 <TheJollyRoger> ./flash-all.sh
21:55:26 <TheJollyRoger> Run that.
21:55:29 <AlanWalker18921> sudo?
21:55:50 <TheJollyRoger> Provided you haven't switched away from the current terminal, you're already in a root shell, so sudo would be pointless.
21:56:11 <AlanWalker18921> fastboot not found; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html and add it to the shell PATH
21:56:18 <TheJollyRoger> You switched away from the shell.
21:56:24 <TheJollyRoger> Please go back and revisit what I've typed.
21:56:32 <AlanWalker18921> export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
21:56:33 <AlanWalker18921> ?
21:56:38 <TheJollyRoger> Start again.
21:56:50 <TheJollyRoger> I told you not to switch away from that terminal window.
21:57:42 <AlanWalker18921> Ok I did everything
21:57:46 <AlanWalker18921> And it still cant find fastboot
21:58:05 <AlanWalker18921> My platform tools folder doesnt contain a fastboot folder at all
21:59:58 <TheJollyRoger> Please revisit Step 1 of what I told you to do, or follow the guide here: https://grapheneos.org/install
22:00:09 <TheJollyRoger> You switched away from the terminal window that we had the command path set up on.
22:00:12 <TheJollyRoger> I told you not to.
22:00:27 <AlanWalker18921> I re did the steps
22:00:31 <AlanWalker18921> Please notice this
22:00:40 <AlanWalker18921> My platform tools folder doesnt have any fastboot folder inside it
22:00:45 <AlanWalker18921> So i dont think I have fastboot
22:01:02 <TheJollyRoger> please run:
22:01:05 <AlanWalker18921> fastboot --versionfastboot version 30.0.5-6877874Installed as /home/adam/Desktop/platform-tools/fastboot

22:02:40 <AlanWalker18921> Can you just help me install this
22:02:58 <AlanWalker18921> Ive followed the instructions
22:02:58 <TheJollyRoger> I can't if you keep trying to get ahead of me and not following my instructions.
22:03:06 <AlanWalker18921> I did follow the instructions
22:03:13 <AlanWalker18921> I showed you the version output

22:07:46 <AlanWalker18921> Please just tell me
22:09:41 <TheJollyRoger> Dude, I can't go on pretending you're not the person I banned earlier.
22:10:03 <TheJollyRoger> The best way for you to install the operating system is to follow the official installation guide, without skipping steps. Unfortunately, I tried to help you, and you've insisted on adlibbing or doing things your own way.
22:10:08 <TheJollyRoger> Therefore, I cannot help you.
22:10:22 <TheJollyRoger> I'm sorry.
22:10:24 <AlanWalker18921> "fastboot --versionfastboot version 30.0.5-6877874Installed as /home/adam/Desktop/platform-tools/fastboot"
22:10:40 <TheJollyRoger> run it from that shell.
22:10:53 <TheJollyRoger> You're switching between terminal sessions/windows.

22:11:51 <AlanWalker18921> its working
22:12:23 <AlanWalker18921> All I did was talk about Coreboot, that shouldnt justify a ban in a computer security offtopic webchat
22:12:36 <AlanWalker18921> Graphene OS Fastboot!
22:12:49 <TheJollyRoger> no, you were violating rule 2D and refused to stop when asked.
22:13:20 <AlanWalker18921> Alright, well, life goes on
22:13:32 <anguishedone[m]> What Date will Graphene OS stop support for Pixel 3a?
22:13:38 <AlanWalker18921> Im following rules now mate =)
22:13:40 <anguishedone[m]> I  know there was a chart but I can't seem to find it a year later
22:14:04 <AlanWalker18921> Graphene OS fastboot in showing on the Pixel Screen
22:14:13 <AlanWalker18921> And my terminal is loading files onto the pixel still
22:14:14 <TheJollyRoger> Hi anguishedone[m], GrapheneOS plans to stop supporting the 3a when the security fixes stop coming from upstream.
22:14:54 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: Google pledges a full three years from when the device first appears on the Google Store.
22:15:17 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi anguishedone, GrapheneOS plan"> If I remember correctly, I could have sworn it said October 2021 on the Graphene OS webpage.
22:15:28 <anguishedone[m]> But that'd be great if it's longer
22:15:38 <AlanWalker18921> ITS ALIVE!!!
22:16:12 <AlanWalker18921> "Disabling OEM unlocking" stage now =)
22:16:15 <AlanWalker18921> Im officially anonymous =)
22:16:37 <Thatcher[m]> Aye carambah
22:16:57 <AlanWalker18921> Alright I've locked my bootloader again
22:17:02 <AlanWalker18921> And Graphene OS is showing on my Pixel!
22:17:08 <AlanWalker18921> Can I unplug the USB C cable now?
22:17:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
22:17:24 <AlanWalker18921> Thanks a bundle friend
22:17:33 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: I think - don't quote me on this, but I think that the 3a will be supported until the middle of 2022.
22:17:54 <alex-resist> it's may 2022 for the 3a
22:17:55 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anguishedone: I think - don't qu"> Yeah that sounds right as it came out in May 7, 2019; 19 months ago
22:18:20 <anguishedone[m]> Is there any security benefit to upgrade before then?
22:18:22 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: Well, you can thank us by sending a donation to the project at https://grapheneos.org/donate.
22:18:39 <AlanWalker18921> Yes Once I get some BTC I'll donate
22:18:42 <AlanWalker18921> For certian
22:18:54 <AlanWalker18921> How can i verify the OS is legit with the Auditor app
22:19:00 <AlanWalker18921> I only have my graphene OS phone
22:19:02 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: probably not? I think the 4a and 4 will have *slightly* newer SoCs that will have more recent kernels, but that may be about it.
22:19:11 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: please follow the instructions on attestation.app.
22:20:10 <TheJollyRoger> There is a tutorial there.
22:20:16 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anguishedone: probably not? I th"> I  am glad I can hold off on updating for awhile longer then; Thank you for your help =).
22:20:47 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: anytime! I think the 4a and 4, 3 and 3a families all use the same security chip, although the kernels are different between the bunch.
22:20:56 <anguishedone[m]> Oh right, do any of you know if/where we could find more detailed schematics for the Pixel line of phones?
22:21:07 <AlanWalker18921> Every time I boot my phone, I get a screen saying 'You phone is loading another OS'
22:21:15 <AlanWalker18921> Then I wait, and graphene Os starts
22:21:17 <AlanWalker18921> Is that normal
22:21:23 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: that's normal and expected.
22:21:29 <Thatcher[m]> <AlanWalker18921 "Every time I boot my phone, I ge"> That's normal
22:21:31 <anguishedone[m]> I was hoping to see if I could remove the mics, cameras and antenna cables from my pixel 3a without having to solder
22:21:57 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: heh, excision of components from the phone is something of a fad/meme among privacy enthusiasts.
22:23:02 <AlanWalker18921> When i tap to check for updates, nothing seems to happen
22:23:23 <TheJollyRoger> It's a good way for people to show off and look like Privacy Jedi, but without a clear threat model there are no real security gains from it.
22:23:29 <AlanWalker18921> Can I set my phone to auto-update
22:23:29 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anguishedone: heh, excision of c"> Is it excessive or truly unhelpful? I assumed I could do the aformentioned changes and perhaps keep the functionality in the form of external accessories
22:23:33 <anguishedone[m]> Modularity and what not
22:23:36 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: that's because there's no available updates at this time. GrapheneOS will automatically update.
22:24:23 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: it's truly unhelpful. If your phone is truly that compromised, then why are you using it? What's to stop it from exfiltrating the conversations you have when you have your mics plugged in?
22:24:52 <AlanWalker18921> this is awesome, Graphene OS is the coolest
22:24:54 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, if we assume the device is attacker-controlled, then what's to stop it from reversing the polarity on the speakers?
22:25:02 <TheJollyRoger> and using those as (crude) microphones?
22:25:20 <AlanWalker18921> Person Of Interest TV series flashback
22:25:39 <alex-resist> Even the gyroscope can be used to record some information in the auditory range
22:25:59 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anguishedone: it's truly unhelpf"> I don't believe my phone is compromised per se, I just want to remove any possibility of having someone passively surveil me when connected online; Perhaps removing the mic is not needed if I am also wanting to remove the Cellular, Wifi & Bluetooth capabilities as well though.
22:26:15 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: then honestly, what's the point of having a phone...?
22:26:42 <AlanWalker18921> Putting tape on the microphones blocked most audio for me
22:26:57 <AlanWalker18921> I put tape on my microphones and called 2 resturants, none of them could even hear me, let alone understand me
22:27:07 <TheJollyRoger> AlanWalker18921: Now that you've got your operating system installed, you ought to go.
22:27:16 <AlanWalker18921> You could also use liquid cement or superglue to plug up the microphone holes
22:27:21 <TheJollyRoger> Again, I don't take kindly to ban evaders.
22:27:25 <AlanWalker18921> Alright, Thanks again guys
22:27:28 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anguishedone: then honestly, wha"> I don't even use it as a phone anymore honestly; I canceled my cell plan back at the end of July, so my only uses are limited to watching videos through newpipe & Droid development
22:27:38 <AlanWalker18921> I ask for forgiveness as I'd like to be apart of this cool community =)
22:27:44 <TheJollyRoger> I tell you what.
22:27:49 <TheJollyRoger> Come back in seven days. We'll talk then.
22:27:55 <AlanWalker18921> And I promise not to break any rules
22:27:58 <AlanWalker18921> Its like Jesus
22:28:00 <AlanWalker18921> Thanks friend =)
22:28:07 <TheJollyRoger> Seven days.
22:28:10 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck.
22:28:53 <strcat> lol...
22:29:43 <Thatcher[m]> You guys sure do have a lot of patience
22:29:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe. I try!
22:30:11 <alex-resist> Pretty sure that person will be back and ask how to root GrapheneOS or something
22:30:47 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I'll handle it. Or maybe someone else will. Dunno.
22:31:53 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
22:32:04 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anguishedone: then honestly, wha"> However, in my ideal I could plug in an external microphone if I wanted to call someone/get calls; Similarly, I have an Ethernet Adapter that I confirmed works with my Pixel 3a, and assuming it could get internet on my phone even after removal of the Wifi & Cellular Antennas, then I could still retain the utility as a phone whilst having the freedom  to kill such
22:32:04 <anguishedone[m]> functionality at the hardware level when not in use.
22:32:13 <anguishedone[m]> I hope that explains my goal better
22:32:48 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: I getcha, I'd actually thought about doing something similar as well, since I too can't deny that I do like to have the actual, physical assurance the mics and antennas aren't plugged in.
22:32:57 <anguishedone[m]> That being said, I got a quote from some shop in Washington State for $150-$200 to air gap my pixel 3a
22:33:28 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anguishedone: I getcha, I'd actu"> Exactly, it's modular =)
22:33:35 <anguishedone[m]> I am glad I joined this chat
22:33:40 <TheJollyRoger> But... I don't think I'm willing to cut up an expensive phone for it. I don't know if you can physically remove the radio from the phone without actually causing some problems, but if you find it works, actually, please let us know.
22:34:09 <TheJollyRoger> Since it would answer a few questions I'd had about how deeply integrated everything is on the chip.
22:34:25 <alex-resist> It might be easier to build a GrapheneOS version without the baseband firmware
22:34:43 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "But... I don't think I'm willing"> I will for sure; Although to ensure everything of relevance has been addressed by the shop, would you happen to know of more detailed documentation on pixel 3a internals?
22:34:46 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. For that unfortunately, I can't help, my knowledge doesn't go that deep.
22:34:57 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: I sure would.
22:36:23 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anguishedone: I sure would."> That's great, because I could only find basic external diagrams from google and while the teardown videos were useful, it didn't go into as much detail as they could have.
22:37:44 <TheJollyRoger> I'd really like to one day get detail dimensions for the 3a and 3 and 4 and 4a and XL variants, I would one day like to design a GrapheneOS branded phone case.
22:38:06 <Thatcher[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I'd really like to one day get d"> I'd buy that
22:38:51 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo!
22:39:16 * anguishedone[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/uyrHAfyPjTFLChZmaIVDPSsE/message.txt >
22:39:37 <anguishedone[m]> And as you pointed out @thej
22:40:03 <TheJollyRoger> I'm currently thinking the first generation cases I would design would be something like a simple rubber one-piece case, with the Graphene branding. But I think later on, I would like to try to get a little fancier.
22:40:07 <TheJollyRoger> Who knows!
22:40:17 <anguishedone[m]>  * And as you pointed out @thejollyroger there's the chance of breaking the phone in the process of removal/disabling the parts
22:40:44 <TheJollyRoger> anguishedone[m]: yeah, definitely. You have to be extremely careful - the backing of the screen is thinner than a wafer cookie, and it's about as durable.
22:40:58 <TheJollyRoger> So you can stove it in with your finger if you're not careful!
22:41:17 <TheJollyRoger> If that happens the screen is *wrecked* forever.
22:41:37 <anguishedone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anguishedone: yeah, definitely. "> So I have heard, that alone gave me enough reason to find a 3rd party to do this for me.
22:42:07 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense!
22:42:21 <anguishedone[m]> I am hoping to have this be a one off thing, the main thing holding me back from pushing forward is figuring out where the Gyrometer/accelometer modules are in the damn thing
22:42:40 <TheJollyRoger> Ooh. Yeah, I uh... I dunno anything about that, unfortunately.
22:42:56 <anguishedone[m]> My understanding is they could function as a shitty microphone if someone were to do shit to it
22:43:00 <anguishedone[m]> Reconfigure or something
22:43:31 <anguishedone[m]> But then again, if the internet capabilities are completely removed, perhaps there's no risks from leaving them dormant.
22:44:15 <anguishedone[m]>  * But then again, if the internet capabilities are completely removed, perhaps there's no risks from leaving them dormant. The GPS capabilities are my main concern with those modules in particular
22:44:30 <Thatcher[m]> <anguishedone[m] "But then again, if the internet "> Unless there's a hidden band in the phone that connects to secret government towers
22:44:48 <anguishedone[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Unless there's a hidden band in "> *takes off sunglasses*
22:44:52 <anguishedone[m]> I am sure you're joking
22:44:53 <Thatcher[m]> Haha
22:44:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe X3.
22:45:46 <anguishedone[m]> TFW I just wanted a peaceful life
22:46:26 <Thatcher[m]> I'm actually okay if my camera or mic gets hacked. I just don't want them to post my candid nudes on the internet.
22:46:38 <organicpumpkin[m> <TheJollyRoger "Ooh. Yeah, I uh... I dunno anyth"> I don't get it. This guy seems to be another Adam. Why help? Apologies if I am wrong, but I thought this is a problem you are facing?
22:49:17 <TheJollyRoger> organicpumpkin[m: well, he's listening, and he's not spreading conspiracy theories/disregarding when I try to help. I don't mind a bit of idle chit chat at all.
22:50:42 <TheJollyRoger> Besiiiiiides. I've seen what happens when moderators get paranoid, it's not pretty. I'd prefer not to go down that path of kickbanning first and not asking questions, ya know?
22:52:00 <organicpumpkin[m> I can empathize with that. I respect the patience you have :)
22:52:02 <anguishedone[m]> I don't really care for Conspiracy theories, but the fact remains that regardless of one's interest in Politics, Politicians have an unhealthy interest in your life; Wish it didn't have to be this way, that we could all let our guards down and not have to ever worry about conflict, external threats, but that's just not the world we live in.
22:52:07 <TheJollyRoger> ^_^
22:53:14 <anguishedone[m]> Better to educate one's self to prepare for whatever life throws at you, I doubt I am the only one here who cam to learn about GrapheneOS and other similar topics
22:53:27 <anguishedone[m]>  * Better to educate one's self to prepare for whatever life throws at you, I doubt I am the only one here who cam to learn about GrapheneOS and other similar topics based on that reasoning
23:32:47 <r0tt0r[m]> <anguishedone[m] "I don't really care for Conspira"> i wonder if its the politicians or the corporations and institutions that put money in a politians pocket have that interest
23:33:46 <r0tt0r[m]> and moreover the reason what for all these messages and infos are used for
23:34:59 <r0tt0r[m]> profiling of humanity?possible enemies of secret agendas?
23:47:09 <emsyna[m]> OT please
