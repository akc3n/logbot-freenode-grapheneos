00:08:30 <BlackWinnerYoshi> > <@dquark:matrix.org> Hi Team,
00:08:30 <BlackWinnerYoshi> > Is it possible to recover deleted SMS/MMS from GrapheneOS. I accidentally deleted a very important MMS.
00:08:30 <BlackWinnerYoshi> I don't know if it's possible, so from now on, you should probably use an app for backing up messages, like this one: https://f-droid.org/packages/re.indigo.epistolaire - keep in mind that I haven't tried this app, so you need to do your own research about this or other similar ones.
00:11:22 <brockin042[m]> Lots of talk of search engines. I'm surprised nobody uses swisscows.com.
00:13:20 <dq[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "> <@dquark:matrix.org> Hi Team,"> Thanks for the link to this app. I was doing research and found some instructions to use root & debug, but O think this is not easy with GrapheneOS. I will just backup the messages from today. Thanks
00:48:13 <BalooRJ> brockin042: There is also Gigablast, Wiby.org, Mojeek, Peteyvid as well
01:35:41 <brockin042[m]> Yes, plenty of alt search engines. For privacy, I think Searx is the best.
01:43:10 <renlord> do they work? i've personally tried searx and the results are subpar
05:04:09 <hultan[m]> When I click on System/System Update Settings/Check for updates nothing happens, is that normal?
05:08:40 <renlord> hultan[m]: yes
06:52:00 <sixBit[m]> Thoughts on using pixel buds? Do they work / is it a good idea?
06:53:39 <robocat[m]> <sixBit[m] "Thoughts on using pixel buds? Do"> Use headphones
06:53:55 <robocat[m]> But big over ear ones
06:54:13 <sixBit[m]> I'm aware of other headphone types
06:54:22 <sixBit[m]> Wasnt the question though
06:55:05 <robocat[m]> <sixBit[m] "Wasnt the question though"> Yes it was "is it a good idea"
06:55:20 <robocat[m]> And i said no headphones in my experience are better
06:58:28 <thematten[m]> Hmm, I've enabled Blokada, it worked for a while, but now Vanadium suddenly started protesting with "Your internet access is blocked" - I can see requests being done to some domains consisting of random letters ("bbnecusi", "rffwvvilzjeq", ... - seems a lot like what ungoogled-chromium does in source with google URLs) and some to "*.googleapis.com" and "accounts.google.com"
06:59:46 <thematten[m]> They only seems to appear directly after I try to load something in browser
07:14:05 <erhcetua[m]> use private DNS
07:15:51 <thematten[m]> erhcetua As in, DNS setting in Blokada? Or option in OS Settings?
07:16:15 <theultron[m]> <erhcetua[m] "use private DNS"> Do you need Private DNS if your browser supports DOH like Bromite? I just do browsing in it.
07:18:36 <theultron[m]> <thematten[m] "erhcetua As in, DNS setting in B"> He meant DNS Setting in OS.
07:19:38 <thematten[m]> <theultron[m] "He meant DNS Setting in OS."> I actually had to disable it to make Blokada work at all
07:20:22 <theultron[m]> <thematten[m] "I actually had to disable it to "> Blokada works as a VPN?
07:21:00 <thematten[m]> <theultron[m] "Blokada works as a VPN?"> Yes
07:24:21 <theultron[m]> You can use Private DNS without Blokada. Use something like NextDNS in Private DNS if you want finer control over ad-blocking.
07:24:49 <theultron[m]> Another option is to use Netguard in VPN Mode together with Nebulo for DoH.
07:26:08 <M[Redacted][m]1> Doesn't Netguard leak everytime after reboot?
07:26:20 <theultron[m]> <M[Redacted][m]1 "Doesn't Netguard leak everytime "> It does.
07:28:22 <theultron[m]> Graphene's default firewall / AOSP default firewall is fine and prevents such leaks.
07:30:14 <theultron[m]> I used to put a startup script disabling wifi data on boot when I was rooted. It prevent all such leaks.
07:57:55 <trismous[m]> <sixBit[m] "Thoughts on using pixel buds? Do"> Good idea in terms of security, convinience or what?
07:59:43 <sixBit[m]> <trismous[m] "Good idea in terms of security, "> First of all I was wondering if they work. Secondly if data is being sent to google which more falls into privacy. Security wise I'm unsure how that's related to headphones.
08:02:02 <trismous[m]> They should work (not a first hand experience tho) and if they don't have an app you need for them to function (iirc they don't have) it shouldn't be able to send data to Google. IMO it would be pointless, they would more likely gather data through Play Music.
08:05:38 <sixBit[m]> Right, thats what I thought too. Thanks for the info!
08:06:12 <trismous[m]> For example Buds+ can be used (afaik) without an app, but it provides aditional options for the buds.
08:07:38 <trismous[m]> <sixBit[m] "Right, thats what I thought too."> No problem. To be clear about the question do they work or not: iirc people have suggested you can use them, but I don't have a Pixel with GOS to test it.
08:08:23 <sixBit[m]> <trismous[m] "No problem. To be clear about th"> Yep, all good. I'll test it out.
12:36:29 <marlow11[m]> Does anyone know if there is some size limit in gallery for number of images in an album? I have a folder with around 10,000 photos yet no matter what I do the gallery app only shows the folder as having 5913 images, and it seems it will not display any more
12:47:56 <textmate[m]> <marlow11[m] "Does anyone know if there is som"> That is very weird
14:13:30 <theultron[m]> <marlow11[m] "Does anyone know if there is som"> Try another gallery app? Simple Gallery?
14:15:16 <theultron[m]> Avoid. GrapheneOS does not endorse any such seller.
14:15:42 <theultron[m]> It's not difficult to install GrapheneOS yourself.
14:17:16 <virgin_eagle[m]> Hi
14:17:45 <marlow11[m]> theultron: I'll give it a go. Thanks
14:17:52 <virgin_eagle[m]> Seems like Orbot works very bad with GOS.... Is there any way to solve it?
14:18:26 <theultron[m]> What sort of problem you face with Orbot?
14:18:56 <virgin_eagle[m]> It just:
14:18:56 <virgin_eagle[m]> Orbot is starting
14:19:08 <virgin_eagle[m]> Not connecting very often
14:19:41 <virgin_eagle[m]> Connected to control port and halts
14:20:16 <theultron[m]> Are you on the latest GOS? Previous version had some issues with Orbot.
14:20:34 <virgin_eagle[m]> Yep
14:20:42 <virgin_eagle[m]> Thr latest
14:24:04 <textmate[m]> <darkharbingeroftheabyss[m] "How good of a deal is a Google p"> no good
14:24:09 <textmate[m]> pixel 2 is too old already
14:24:53 <theultron[m]> Official Support for Pixel 2 is ending in October 2020.
14:26:43 <theultron[m]> > <@virgin_eagle:privacytools.io> It just:
14:26:43 <theultron[m]> > Orbot is starting
14:26:43 <theultron[m]> I think many here uses Orbot. Should wait for them to chime in or you can open a issue here provided you are sure this is a issue with GOS and not orbot. https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
14:31:30 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <darkharbingeroftheabyss[m] "How good of a deal is a Google p"> Better off with Pixel 3a for support for now.
14:33:20 <theultron[m]> <darkharbingeroftheabyss[m] " Also is telegram a good alterna"> You will get better reply in the off-topic group. #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
14:34:16 <rafff[m]> Hace been looking at what pixel to buy. I am interested in good battery life, good camera and XL screen size. Can't decide since in wiki pixel4 is not fully supported yet, but I am not sure what is not working/missing in comparison to pixel 3xl. Maybe someone can briefly explain it to me.
14:35:28 <marlow11[m]> virgin_eagle: I use orbot all the time. It connects quickly and has been perfectly stable for me.
14:35:41 <marlow11[m]> I was using it today without issues
14:37:12 <theultron[m]> <rafff[m] "Hace been looking at what pixel "> Pixel 4 is properly supported.
14:37:34 <marlow11[m]> theultron: simple gallery works fine. Must be some limitation in stock gallery. Weird. Simple gallery seems better anyway. Thanks for chiming in :-)
14:41:40 <Adam71> Hello.
14:41:57 <marlow11[m]> It's a shame about pixel 2 support. Mine still works perfectly fine. I'd rather not buy a new phone yet as this one will just become another piece of e-waste. Oh well :-/
14:46:30 <theultron[m]> <marlow11[m] "It's a shame about pixel 2 suppo"> I am not sure till when Pixel 2 will be supported by GOS. Google is providing you with Android 11 and may give some updates even post official support end. But no idea till when GOS will support the device. Developer can only tell us about it. strcat
14:47:41 <theultron[m]> But Pixel 2 is a solid device. You have other options too like CalyxOS, Rattlesnake & DivestOS if Graphene no longer support you.
14:47:59 <marlow11[m]> Nah I like graphene
14:48:15 <marlow11[m]> Was using copperhead before that went tits up
14:48:44 <marlow11[m]> Don't expect extended support in this situation, is just the way it is
14:49:02 <marlow11[m]> Hoping have the time and skillset to help out with the project eventually
14:51:02 <marlow11[m]> And yeah pixel is the best phone I've ever had. 6p before this was just as solid
14:51:09 <marlow11[m]> Nexus
15:07:11 <nickcalyx[m]> Yeah nexus 6p was the nicest build quality
15:07:32 <nickcalyx[m]> Huawei is impressive
15:09:31 <theultron[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Huawei is impressive"> Who makes the Pixels?
15:09:56 <nickcalyx[m]> The latest ones are foxconn
15:10:05 <theultron[m]> Google changed a lot of partners in Nexus series. Samsung, LG & Huawei.
15:17:36 <I3^RELATIVISM> probably was trying to learn from all of them
15:17:58 <I3^RELATIVISM> and then they speak of copyright breach like they are angels
15:32:06 <brockin042[m]> nickcalyx: nexus 6p was great. Mine still looks new. Unfortunately, mine eventually had the infinite bootloop that Google refused to fix.
15:40:13 <nickcalyx[m]> Mine still works
15:45:11 <theultron[m]> Who makes decent hardware now? Is it Samsung? I have heard good things about their build quality. HTC used to make decent devices when they used to make phones.
15:45:36 <theultron[m]> Some Xiaomi phones are decent too.
15:48:00 <I3^RELATIVISM> the future is unix phones theultron  like pinephone librem5 necune jola etc
15:48:23 <I3^RELATIVISM> probably fairphone willmigrate to unix has well
15:48:57 <I3^RELATIVISM> and Im talking about pureUNIX not a frankenstein UNIX like android

16:15:35 <thematten[m]> strcat: Not sure if it was asked before, but website mentions possibility of developing custom HW in companion to SW - is there some (very) rough estimate of required timespan for something like this?
16:15:55 <strcat[m]> there isn't a timeline
16:16:02 <strcat[m]> there isn't a timeline for any features either

16:37:48 <axelp> Hello, I am having some issues with service compatibility, I am swapping between 2 different SIM cards, they are registered with different carriers and I am getting only limited functionality with each, specifically with regards to SMS. I am using latest stable GrapheneOS on Pixel 2
16:43:48 <jneplokh> Which carrier?
16:43:51 <jneplokh>  * Which carriers?
16:45:43 <axelp> Mint (T-Mobile MVNO) and U.S. Cellular
16:48:23 <axelp> Odd thing is I had decent data with Mint for over a year, I needed service in a area that is new to me and got the US Cellular SIM.. it works for calls but not SMS, also now I seem to have lost reliable data on the Mint SIM
16:49:34 <axelp> are there network settings somewhere that are configured automatically ?
16:53:08 <axelp> Lastly, If I am able to get each SIM working fully, could I store separate network settings in 2 individual user profiles ?
16:54:28 <axelp> THanks for any help, I need to get up and running soon as my work is starting to suffer from this .. I am close to purchasing a separate phone to solve the issue :/
17:07:49 <palone[m]> <theultron[m] "Who makes decent hardware now? I"> I personally would advise at judging products on an individual basis instead of judging the whole company.
17:08:28 <palone[m]> I personally love my s9 but I hear people with the J series being absolutely disappointed for the price
17:08:57 <palone[m]> Aka overpriced when compared to other phones in that range
17:09:01 <IxquickOG[m]> Samsung Hardware design is on point for the flagships
17:09:09 <IxquickOG[m]> I think the budget designs are best avoided
17:09:17 <palone[m]> And some phones are just bad whereas others might be great
17:10:40 <palone[m]> <strcat[m] "Android is Linux"> Android is Android. It uses Linux, but it's so incredibly different from your standard Linux desktop os that I feel these should be distinguished
17:11:52 <palone[m]> <IxquickOG[m] "I think the budget designs are b"> That's exactly what I've been hearing too
17:12:53 <sandelinos[m]> <theultron[m] "But Pixel 2 is a solid device. Y"> I've never heard of DivestOS before. Is there anywhere outside of their site I can read more about it?
17:12:57 <palone[m]> But with how the smartphone market in particular is moving so incredibly fast, this statement might be completely wrong in a couple of months
17:40:01 <axelp> So I do see that US Cellular is CDMA, which is not supported by GrapheneOS, the SIM does work for voice calls in my Pixel 2 running GrapheneOS.. SMS does not.
17:53:39 <strcat[m]> palone: Linux is a kernel, a Linux server is a lot different from a Linux desktop too
17:53:41 <strcat[m]> and an embedded device is a lot different
17:54:44 <strcat[m]> if you say Linux only to refer to a specific desktop OS stack (systemd, udev, freedesktop, X11 or Wayland, etc.) that's pretty weird - you don't say Linux to refer to Linux on embedded devices, servers, etc?
17:54:49 <strcat[m]> don't understand sorry
17:55:06 <strcat[m]> and Linux isn't Unix, it's not descended from it like the BSDs (it's a clone) and treats it as a guidebook rather than rules that need to be followed
17:55:22 <strcat[m]> it's Unix-like and not in a way that's a full or compliant implementation
17:56:33 <palone[m]> <strcat[m] "if you say Linux only to refer t"> Android is Android. Debian is debian etc
17:56:43 <palone[m]> That's what i meant I guess
17:57:03 <strcat[m]> and they are all Linux distributions because they use the Linux kernel
17:59:19 <palone[m]> <strcat[m] "and they are all Linux distribut"> Desktop Linux is regarded by many as technically semi-secure. It's main security measure is trust in the repo maintainers. From a practical standpoint that's pretty decent actually.
17:59:37 <palone[m]> That also means that Linux is more open for tinkering
18:00:10 <palone[m]> Android development is hell compared to desktop. Dealing with the manifest.xml is something you just don't need to do on desktop
18:01:05 <palone[m]> But you're right, Android runs Linux. That doesn't mean that say debian and Android are the same Security wise
18:01:08 <palone[m]> I hope i make sense
18:01:24 <palone[m]> I'm trying to show that you both have a point here
18:01:34 <palone[m]> It depends on how you look at things

20:40:05 <gofigga[m]> grapheneos.org has an faq answering future device support
21:27:26 <sandelinos[m]> Devices need to be meeting the standards of the project in order to be considered as potential targets. In addition to support for installing other operating systems, standard hardware-based security features like the hardware-backed keystores, verified boot, attestation and various hardware-based exploit mitigations need to be available. Devices also need to have decent integration of IOMMUs for isolating components
21:27:26 <sandelinos[m]> such as the GPU, radios (NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular), media decode / encode, image processor, etc., because if the hardware / firmware support is missing or broken, there's not much that the OS can do to provide an alternative.
21:28:09 <sandelinos[m]> I'm pretty sure the librem 5 doesn't meet these standards and if that is the case then never.
21:28:50 <sandelinos[m]> * This is from the GrapheneOS FAQ ☝.I'm pretty sure the librem 5 doesn't meet these standards and if that is the case then never.
21:44:09 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <sandelinos[m] "I'm pretty sure the librem 5 doe"> Librem 5 is (mostly) a pure Linux OS, anyway
