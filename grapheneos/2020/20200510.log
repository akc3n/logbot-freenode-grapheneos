00:01:05 <renlord> lol keybase
00:01:42 <renlord> they sold their souls to people who give 0 shits about privacy and security
00:01:47 <terminat0r> renlord: why do you hate keybase?
00:02:41 <renlord> and they do really weird things when you try to install into linux
00:02:54 <renlord> insecure weird things
00:03:29 <renlord> everything they do and services they provide is contrary to the values they preech
00:04:37 <terminat0r> I only just recently found out about them... I'm not a user, just interested in what's out there.
00:05:12 <renlord> what about it is interesting to you?
00:05:15 <renlord> key management?
00:05:43 <renlord> pretty much all modern recommendations ask to avoid pgp/gpg
00:06:29 <renlord> nobody even does the web of trust properly
00:06:46 <renlord> even if it was done properly, nobody bothers to rotate keys and keep their master key properly
00:06:52 <terminat0r> yeah... I was intrigued with public pgp key sharing
00:07:30 <renlord> so an adversary can just keep spamming keybase to share new faked public key
00:07:51 <renlord> keybase is a giant bullseye if you trust it as a reliable keyserver
00:08:03 <renlord> so many things can go wrong inbetween
00:08:22 <JTL> renlord: I also think it's funny they have their own crypto system for their IM client that doesn't realate to PGP
00:08:25 <renlord> they probably have the upside that nobody really takes pgp signed stuff seriously
00:08:41 <renlord> so the threat model isnt as scary.
00:09:21 <renlord> but supposedly if pgp signed stuff was taken seriously, a service like keybase would be untenable.
00:09:51 <renlord> JTL: they just do so many weird things
00:10:06 <TheJollyRoger> Now that SHA1 is broken, you're essentially trusting each contact in your keyring to not forge other keys for you, if I recall right.
00:10:06 <JTL> Agreed
00:10:20 <renlord> like when you install it as a service on linux, they do some weird shit bind mount that requires sudo previleges to provide the keybase encrypted FS service.
00:10:43 <renlord> and 90% of the time it doesnt even work properly
00:11:12 <JTL> blah
00:18:06 <terminat0r> just read through this article to educate myself on PGP issues, thought I'd share back https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/13/whats-matter-with-pgp/
00:20:11 <renlord> there's only 1 thing i dont like about ^
00:20:26 <renlord> he blames a shit mail client on pgp.
00:20:32 <renlord> besides that, i agree with everything
04:06:26 <zxwayland> i think president trump will catch corona virus
04:17:53 <BallMonokuma[m]> how is this related to graphine os in any way, shape, or form?
04:18:30 <JTL> It isn't
04:33:43 <brenneke[m]> <zxwayland "i think president trump will cat"> Prediction noted, will send you the prize when we are are liberated!
04:37:52 <brenneke[m]> <BallMonokuma[m] "how is this related to graphine "> It is actually.....follows the same liberation theme.

07:32:50 <renlord[m]> I don't see weird shit from Gmail.
07:32:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Just their spam filtering
07:33:17 <renlord[m]> That's also not true. Their spam filtering is very consistent with sane configurations
07:33:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> They put so much of mine, and people I reads' stuff in Spam, and I haven't even done any marketing campaigns yet. Stopped believing it was because it was a new domain after two years
07:33:25 <renlord[m]> You probably had a broken MTA

15:02:16 <skwisgaar[m]> Yeah already using, but wanted to disable WebRTC and can't find why to do. So someone suggested Bromite
15:02:16 <skwisgaar[m]> Not sure what your motives are, but WebRTC leaks on a VPN are not a problem on graphene. strcat has talked about this recently in the chat. Since the OS implements the VPN so the browser can't leak anything.

16:52:32 <c3po[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "c3po: traditionally, yes, this i"> It's an issue in all systems if you want to hide your ip, or instead browse without javascript. If you use a Vpn maybe it's  to hide your real ip or identity, so you're exposed and who you really are.
16:55:34 <skwisgaar[m]> From Daniel:
16:55:34 <skwisgaar[m]> > brenneke: you are talking about WebRTC being used to leak the real IP when using a VPN

17:26:54 <voiceover> Hi all :) As my nick suggests I wonder how I can get VoWifi working with GOS?
17:29:45 <voiceover> I read the Faq and it mentions carrier specific apps but in my country they just use the OS's integrated On or Off setting, no need for any apps... Since I dont see it in Call settings nor General settings Im guessing there's no integration of that feature yet? I have poor coverage here and id like to have LTE-only +VoWifi so that I can disable
17:29:46 <voiceover> 2&3G cellular....
17:30:20 <voiceover> Thanks for any tips!
17:41:07 <cx2[m]> I don't know if this helps at all,
17:43:16 <cx2[m]> I don't use VoWiFi, but I don't really know of a contact that I haven't been able to get switched over to an app like Signal / Wickr / Wire.
17:43:16 <cx2[m]> IMHO using carrier provided VoWiFi gives up a LOT of the ground that you gained by switching to GrapheneOS
17:46:02 <c3po[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "c3po: you can search his message"> I mean that Vpn can be used for many reasons. I don' t use it in android. But if I'd use it it vould be useless in some circunstances. But if you visit a website with your vpn enabled then they receive the ip of the vpn, not yours. But if you enable webrtc they could know (if they want) what's your real ip behind the Vpn. Some other leaks happen when your Vpn service won't
17:46:03 <c3po[m]> offer you a Dns tunnel inside the Vpn or another protection like a socks5 server working only inside the Vpn. So, you could use it in some browsers.
17:47:03 <c3po[m]> It doesn't mean real security or real privacy, maybe it's what he meant, but what I tell you is true.
17:48:38 <flabbergasted> I don't get my real IP shown with webrtc enabled, it shows the external and internal IP on the VPN server however.
17:49:08 <joshman[m]> No VPN makes you anonymous. Use Tor. It's better. However, not Best
17:49:51 <flabbergasted> I don't use a VPN to be anonymous, only to encrypt all traffic coming into the country as the meta data is logged for 6 months by the government.
17:50:35 <joshman[m]> Yeah. So do I
17:54:10 <c3po[m]> <flabbergasted "I don't get my real IP shown wit"> Do you use your own Vpn server?. I mean if you use the Vpn service of some company.
17:54:27 <c3po[m]> <joshman[m] "No VPN makes you anonymous. Use "> Agreed
17:56:43 <c3po[m]> <flabbergasted "I don't use a VPN to be anonymou"> Or maybe to visit other services in different countries that are not allowed out of that country.
17:57:56 <c3po[m]> You can also use it if your Isp is doing something weird with you, but you change your trust from the Isp to the Vpn company.
18:22:48 <flabbergasted> Yeah true. I self host my VPN, but companies like mull ad gets my full support as well.
18:23:00 <flabbergasted> Mullvad*
18:34:19 <cx2[m]> <c3po[m] "Agreed"> soooo what is the best?

22:29:35 <strcat[m]> valldrac fixed the upstream Bluetooth A2DP audio bug
22:29:42 <strcat[m]> so that will be fixed in the next release
22:29:49 <cyborgninjaneer[> Awesome!!
22:29:55 <strcat[m]> they were accidentally relying on address order for the sort order of a vector
22:30:07 <strcat[m]> so due to hardened_malloc randomization, it would usually break
22:30:13 <strcat[m]> it was still buggy for the standard allocator ofc
22:30:17 <cyborgninjaneer[> ...
22:30:21 <strcat[m]> just wasn't breaking in practice
22:30:30 <strcat[m]> it's a vector of 3 items and the code would break if the expected item was not first
22:30:46 <strcat[m]> so with hardened_malloc it has a 2/3 chance to fail since it has a 2/3 chance to be in 2nd or 3rd slot
22:30:49 <strcat[m]> since the addresses are randomizes
22:30:52 <strcat[m]> randomized*
22:31:11 <cyborgninjaneer[> Well that definitely needed to be fixed. Stupid design at the best of times.
22:31:18 <strcat[m]> the reason it probably works most of the time with the standard allocator is likely that the size of these types is fairly unique and nothing else is in that size class bucket? shrug
22:31:33 <strcat[m]> so these are the only 3 things allocated in a run jemalloc makes for the size class
22:31:39 <strcat[m]> so they're always in the same order
22:31:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> So it just HAPPENED to work
22:31:48 <strcat[m]> yes
22:31:51 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of these bugs
22:31:52 <cyborgninjaneer[> Wow
22:32:01 <strcat[m]> it's also quite difficult to find the cause and resolve them
22:32:02 <strcat[m]> valldrac did really good work
22:32:22 <strcat[m]> someone already narrowed down that SLOT_RANDOMIZE was triggering it
22:32:33 <strcat[m]> but still need to figure out what's actually happening
22:32:51 <strcat[m]> that first step of reverting groups of changes and then figuring out which among those causes something is useful though
22:32:53 <cyborgninjaneer[> Excellent work, @freenode_valldrac:matrix.org
22:33:09 <strcat[m]> cause it's useful going into it to know that it's triggered by hardened_malloc and in particular somehow SLOT_RANDOMIZE
22:33:23 <strcat[m]> I was confused at how SLOT_RANDOMIZE could possibly break something
22:33:31 <strcat[m]> since I would have expected it to break fairly often without it
22:33:51 <strcat[m]> but somehow they wrote code relying on malloc address order being a < b < c for allocating a b c
22:33:52 <strcat[m]> and it manages to mostly work
22:33:54 <strcat[m]> with jemalloc
22:49:50 <valldrac> Thanks!

23:41:55 <BrokenCog> so, after compiling the Vanadium browser, how does one include it in the OS images for flashing to the device?
23:42:28 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: it's included by default
23:42:45 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#browser-and-webview
23:42:49 <strcat[m]> > The apks needs to be copied from out/Default/apks/release/*.apk into the Android source tree at external/vanadium/prebuilt/arm64/ with arm64 substituted with the correct value for other architectures (arm, x86, x86_64).
23:43:43 <BrokenCog> I did that.
23:43:57 <BrokenCog> after flash-all, vanadium isn't on the deviec.
23:44:31 <strcat[m]> it's included by default though
23:44:42 <strcat[m]> you would have had to remove it / change something for it not to be there
23:45:38 <BrokenCog> yet it isn't on the device.
23:46:25 <BrokenCog> after this: m brillo_update_payload, zip'ing the various img files, and flashing with flash-all, there is no Vanadium on the divec.
23:47:03 <BrokenCog> because in the build istructions, it comes later.  so, after finishing the compile of the browser, something must be done to include it in the images to flash.
23:49:03 <renlord> nice work valldrac
23:49:17 <renlord> and also the other users who helped investigate
23:49:24 <flabbergasted> indeed
23:51:41 <BrokenCog> so, nobody knows how to include the Vanadium browser in the images to flash to the device?
23:54:05 <JTL> BrokenCog: Only issue I can remember with including Vanadium with the image was caused by my own doing, forgot to migrate private repoistory to Trichrome when the project changed
23:54:55 <BrokenCog> I haven't changed anything.
23:55:17 <JTL> Ah okay
23:55:48 <JTL> Did you copy it over properly?
23:56:09 <BrokenCog> copy from where to where?
23:56:13 <JTL> (during the build process)
23:56:24 <JTL> > The apks needs to be copied from out/Default/apks/release/*.apk into the Android source tree at external/vanadium/prebuilt/arm64/ with arm64 substituted with the correct value for other architectures (arm, x86, x86_64).
23:56:29 <BrokenCog> yes.
23:56:33 <JTL> Hmm
23:57:14 <BrokenCog> notice that step of building Vanadium in the instructions is after completing the build of the AOSP tree?
23:57:27 <BrokenCog> something is needed to 'update' the compiled OS images.
23:57:50 <JTL> Er no
23:58:27 <JTL> Building from scratch should work fine
23:59:45 <k-sloth[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org):  and @others thank you for working hard and making this such a awesome OS.
