00:22:34 <adeus[m]> Why does the camera app crash if you do not give it microphone permission ?
00:27:01 <louipc> for videos?
00:27:23 <ninjahmeh> a logcat will help with things like that i woiuld imagine
00:27:25 <louipc> i guess it shouldnt crash tho. just not have any audio
00:27:42 <louipc> maybe give u a popup that says no audio
00:28:54 <ninjahmeh> in any case knowing your device, and os version along with a logcat of the crashing a few times on pastebin will likely help to find the issue
00:34:46 <adeus[m]> <ninjahmeh "in any case knowing your device,"> Pixel 3. Latest GrapheneOS update. Stock install.
00:35:11 <adeus[m]> Other question is why can’t I change app permissions “run foreground service, run at startup” etc.
00:35:30 <ninjahmeh> do you know how to run a logcat from your device using adb to a txt file on your computer?
00:39:17 <adeus[m]> <ninjahmeh "do you know how to run a logcat "> No. But the error camera app crashes denied mic is reproducible on Pixel 3, Pixel 3XL and Pixel 3a
00:43:23 <ninjahmeh> you on linux?
00:56:02 <ninjahmeh> if so, open terminal, and run these
00:56:02 <ninjahmeh> mkdir ~/logfiles
00:56:02 <ninjahmeh> cd ~/logfiles
00:57:54 <ninjahmeh> next on your phone in the dev options of system settings set debugging on usb on, and ensure you allow debuging from your linux box by plugging in the usb and tap allow on the screen of your phone when you connect
00:58:10 <ninjahmeh> reboot the device
00:58:43 <ninjahmeh>  use it to crash the camera a few times in a row
00:59:36 <ninjahmeh> then in the terminal run
00:59:36 <ninjahmeh> adb logcat -d > camera_perm_crash.txt
01:03:30 <ninjahmeh> i think that should then print a txt file of your device logs into that directory with that filename, you can then load that up on pastebin or somewhere (redact any sensitive info if any) and then you can share the logs here so someone with better understanding could get an idea of where the crash stems
01:04:20 <ninjahmeh> in my experience in the past crashes like that tend to be an issue with HAL specially after android source upgrade ports
01:04:42 <ninjahmeh> i could be quite wrong but logs always help
01:10:44 <adeus[m]> <ninjahmeh "in my experience in the past cra"> Thank you
01:10:54 <adeus[m]> I have saved this I will try and do when homeZ
01:11:07 <ninjahmeh> no worries
01:12:50 <ninjahmeh> iv been slowly trying to get my macbook setup to run builds myself and start to relearn what i need to try and be of use here, i know the maintenance side of this sort of work is a pain in the arse and seems like that is something that would be useful to this project
01:14:18 <ninjahmeh> sadly my knowledge has dwindled having spent a long time away from this kind of thing after zombi rom guys i used to play with all got busier lives
03:12:08 <adeus[m]> Can someone give me the link to the CalyxOS F-Droid repo?
03:18:55 <adeus[m]> <adeus[m] "Can someone give me the link to "> Never mind I got it looks like they no longer publish signal
03:49:10 <strcat[m]> adeus: run foreground service, run at startup, etc. are not really 'permissions' it's just an implementation detail, you're looking at developer information
03:49:16 <strcat[m]> there is a toggle for controlling background access in the app info page
03:49:23 <strcat[m]> those "permissions" do not do what you think
03:50:37 <adeus[m]> <strcat[m] "adeus: run foreground service, r"> Thank you
04:49:55 <strcat[m]> adeus: those low-level 'permissions' are a way for the app to let the OS know it uses something, they aren't for users
04:50:10 <strcat[m]> adeus: so for example those run in background, etc. ones are controlled by the toggle in app info, it's not considered a permission at a high level
04:50:18 <strcat[m]> it's only an implementation detail that it works that way
04:50:33 <strcat[m]> most of those low-level 'permissions' just give an app the ability to request something from the user, etc.
04:51:08 <strcat[m]> like the unknown apps install one, which only allows requesting the ability to install apps (and even when granted, it requires user consent EACH time)
04:51:20 <strcat[m]> those are for static analysis of what capabilities apps can gain
04:51:35 <strcat[m]> so you can see does this app have the ability to ask the user to install apps?
04:51:49 <strcat[m]> it's not a permission for the user to see / review / toggle
04:52:11 <strcat[m]> F-Droid is doing the wrong thing by making them user-facing, and you shouldn't looking at them in the advanced dev info and drawing conclusions if you don't understand the purpose of them
04:53:41 <strcat[m]> and similarly does this app have the ability to run for a long time in the background? but if it does you have a toggle for that in app info - it's not considered a permission because permissions are for access to sensitive information
04:54:10 <strcat[m]> and also the toggle in app info does more than that
04:54:18 <strcat[m]> it has an impact even if the app doesn't have that
04:54:28 <strcat[m]> so you should really just go with the high level toggle that actually makes sense
04:54:40 <strcat[m]> instead of trying to understand obscure things for developers
04:54:53 <strcat[m]> which are largely misleading and not designed to be user-facing
04:55:21 <strcat[m]> so for example if you think that not having that 'run in background' means it can't run in the background, you're wrong, and that's why you shouldn't even be looking at those
04:55:38 <strcat[m]> not what it means
05:37:55 <Iusearchbtw[m]> <strcat[m] "F-Droid is doing the wrong thing"> Fdroid does a lot of wrong things. What's new?
05:59:37 <Ultron[m]> <strcat[m] "F-Droid is doing the wrong thing"> That's not an F-Droid problem. I mean users can make whatever interpretation they want of any given thing.
06:01:46 <strcat[m]> Ultron: these things are explicitly not meant to be exposed in the UI
06:02:00 <strcat[m]> they are low-level, highly misleading, and not part of the user-facing permission model
06:02:04 <strcat[m]> they do not control access to sensitive data
06:02:33 <strcat[m]> and there are other ways of exposing control over those things like just requiring user consent every single time, and the user to select things
06:02:41 <strcat[m]> and separate toggles in app info like the background access one
06:03:11 <strcat[m]> Ultron: F-Droid is doing the wrong thing, it's not supposed to be mixing these things up and displaying them together, and it's not supposed to be displaying the low-level ones without explicitly toggling on low-level information display
06:03:15 <strcat[m]> it's doing it wrong
06:03:21 <strcat[m]> it's not a user issue, it's an issue with F-Droid
06:04:05 <strcat[m]> it hasn't adapted to modern API levels and the modern permission model where apps have to request permissions and there are toggles
06:04:25 <strcat[m]> also now in Android 11 you can allow a permission temporarily for the current app session too, instead of having to manually turn it off after
06:04:34 <strcat[m]> those low-level ones are a totally different thing
06:20:25 <Lia[m]> Still wondering if it's useless to grant one-time storage permission
06:21:54 <strcat[m]> seems pretty useless + storage permission is deprecated/obsolete and not available to apps targeting Android 11
06:22:14 <strcat[m]> not entirely useless but a lot less useful than for the other stuff
06:22:30 <strcat[m]> Lia: also I don't think it necessarily offers it for all permissions, just ones where it makes sense
06:22:34 <strcat[m]> we'll see how it works
06:30:50 <Lia[m]> Still stoked for it. Question, is porting a git patch from a Monochrome browser, let's say Bromite, should that be regenerated with other patches? (Probably off-topic, but I'll just ask an overview)
06:31:07 <Lia[m]>  * Still stoked for it. Question, is porting a git patch from a Monochrome browser, let's say Bromite to Trichrome-based broswers, should that be regenerated with other patches? (Probably off-topic, but I'll just ask an overview)
06:40:06 <Lia[m]> Deleted for off-topic reason (in matrix side)
06:44:53 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/milestone/2
06:44:59 <strcat[m]> here's what is left to do for Android 11 port of GrapheneOS
06:45:03 <strcat[m]> more help wanted
07:48:23 <ninjahmeh> @adeus[m] did you get anywhere taking some logs of the camera crashing in the end
07:50:14 <ninjahmeh> also @strcat[m] is there any side channels for graphene dev focused chatter, or do you just discuss anything related here
07:50:47 <louipc> theres #grapheneos-offtopic
07:51:09 <louipc> theres #grapheneos-dev
07:53:21 <ninjahmeh> <3 great thanks loui i figured there likely was
07:53:28 <strcat[m]> we're using a matrix room for the Android 11 migration
07:53:54 <strcat[m]> using a public channel doesn't work well
07:54:03 <strcat[m]> if people are involved in the migration they can be invited there
07:55:17 <Iusearchbtw[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): ah yes I know a guy who's eager to help with migration
07:55:20 <Iusearchbtw[m]> I'll send him an invite
07:59:45 <ninjahmeh> no that was my thoughts often times it leads to conversations getting somewhat confused. I've been in the process of finding the best way to have my music production macbook setup with a second drive and linux with as few issues as possible so i can begin to try and help, i am not at a high level for development knowledge wise, but once iv got a building environment going im looking to join somewhere like the more
07:59:45 <ninjahmeh> focused channels and maybe hookup with some people who can help refresh my android porting brain cells
08:01:03 <ninjahmeh> at the moment though got a load of deadlines looming for getting information ready and sent out to my emp;loyer over a tribunal court hearing i am taking them to which i have never had to do and is getting beyond stressful/annoiying also
08:01:07 <strcat[m]> building on a laptop particularly one that's not geared for performance won't be a good experience
08:01:19 <strcat[m]> incremental builds will still be reasonable but still, not a good experience
08:01:33 <strcat[m]> building the linux kernel with CFI/LTO alone is really demanding
08:01:35 <ninjahmeh> to be fair this model is actually pretty decent
08:01:57 <strcat[m]> 32GB memory is pretty much bare minimum now for building the kernel
08:02:06 <Iusearchbtw[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): no
08:02:08 <ninjahmeh> hmm
08:02:28 <Iusearchbtw[m]> It goes to 38 on mine
08:02:35 <ninjahmeh> xD
08:02:35 <strcat[m]> yeah but you can have swap
08:02:44 <strcat[m]> swapfile or swap partition either way
08:02:45 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Can't xD
08:02:56 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Shitty Kingston 128G ssd
08:03:37 <Iusearchbtw[m]> But yeah you can if you have the storage
08:03:43 <ninjahmeh> yeah i mean it taking a while isnt an issue and this iv putt a 1tb Samsung ssd in the original optical bay so things like that arent too concerning
08:04:42 <ninjahmeh> im on a macbook 9,1 which while it is a bit of a misnomer to call it a laptop when under high workloads its basically a boiling hot peice of plastic and metal
08:05:25 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Why is it always samsung when it comes to ssd
08:05:28 <strcat[m]> ninjahmeh: I don't think it's going to be a good experience is all
08:05:40 <ninjahmeh> they hav a monopoly on silicon
08:05:42 <dazinism> adeus: for backups check out https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
08:06:02 <strcat[m]> I need to get a much better workstation myself
08:06:20 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Mail one to me jk
08:06:23 <strcat[m]> 32GB memory is what I'd call bare minimum to be productive now, 64GB is more than enough
08:06:38 <strcat[m]> need a fast, modern CPU with good single threaded performance for quick incremental builds
08:06:39 <louipc> dang
08:06:40 <ninjahmeh> @strcat[m] quite possible, i mean for the most part i am looking more into trying to help with getting things ported
08:06:57 <strcat[m]> and a ton of cores to make clean builds fast and incremental builds where a lot has to be rebuilt
08:07:00 <strcat[m]> which isn't uncommon
08:07:11 <ninjahmeh> yeah for sure
08:07:22 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Will 6 do the trick?
08:07:25 <strcat[m]> ninjahmeh: it's just it's going to take a ridiculous amount of time for your initial build, you may have OOM problems especially with building the Linux kernel with CFI/LTO
08:07:38 * ninjahmeh looks at the flies in his wallet as he checks it
08:08:02 <ninjahmeh> wish i was able to say its all good ill just get some more WAM
08:08:03 <ninjahmeh> sadly
08:08:06 <ninjahmeh> lol
08:08:08 <strcat[m]> Linux kernel build takes 32GB memory + some swap
08:08:36 <strcat[m]> Chromium and AOSP peak at less memory (when not using a large number of build jobs at least - which you wouldn't be without a ton of cores)
08:08:43 <strcat[m]> but you'll take so long to build
08:08:51 <strcat[m]> and then you can be productive for some things doing incremental builds
08:09:05 <strcat[m]> but as soon as something needs a lot to be rebuilt, which happens, there goes the rest of your day
08:09:21 <strcat[m]> so depends what you're working on
08:09:40 <strcat[m]> some things you can work on and always have quick incremental builds, 30s to a minute each or whatever
08:09:54 <strcat[m]> other things are going to need to rebuild a ton of stuff
08:10:08 <strcat[m]> and single threaded performance makes a huge difference for incremental builds
08:10:09 <Iusearchbtw[m]> [ninjahmeh](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_ninjahmeh:matrix.org): dare you to replace just one overlay
08:10:15 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Then wait 2h as a result
08:10:18 <strcat[m]> builds where you're doing a lot more
08:10:23 <strcat[m]> really need MANY cores
08:10:27 <strcat[m]> it scales really well to many cores
08:10:36 <ninjahmeh> Iusearchbtw[m]:  lol
08:10:39 <strcat[m]> 64 cores will cut build time of a lot in half vs. 32 cores
08:10:57 <ninjahmeh> yeah
08:11:03 <Iusearchbtw[m]> 64 cores you kidding
08:11:04 <strcat[m]> so if you're building 4 cores that are quite old vs. someone building on 32 cores that are 40% faster each
08:11:07 <strcat[m]> there's going to be a big diff in productivity
08:11:16 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no that's what I'm getting, either 32 or 64 core ryzen
08:11:23 <strcat[m]> for my new build
08:11:24 <strcat[m]> 128GB+ of memory this time around
08:11:36 <strcat[m]> I want to actually be able to work on Chromium stuff productively
08:11:48 <strcat[m]> Chromium takes longer to build than AOSP
08:11:52 <strcat[m]> working on Vanadium is a huge pain atm
08:12:07 <strcat[m]> I only have a 10 core CPU from 2016 atm, just haven't invested the time in making a new build since then
08:12:10 <strcat[m]> it's just a pain
08:13:42 <ninjahmeh> yeah like i say, being up shit creek with my work place who im on the line to go to court with in march and that meaning im not working
08:13:51 <ninjahmeh> i just dont have the means atm,
08:14:26 <ninjahmeh> once iv got a few things out of the way and means to save some wedge i will likely buy a new cpu and extra ram for my actual main rig
08:15:00 <ninjahmeh> which is really just built for gaming, but has the compatability for some pretty good gear
08:16:46 <ninjahmeh> i mean if i upgraded to a large pcie nvme drive on there thats one good thing as i have a small one from when they were first really released as my system drive
08:17:38 <Lia[m]> <strcat[m] "building on a laptop particularl"> Chromium takes days to build on laptops, but less RAM peaks
08:17:48 <Lia[m]> On low-end
08:18:08 <ninjahmeh> but never really needed more than 16GB mem for decent gaming quality and the cpu is just an i5 with high OC capability, at some stage i would like to get a strong cpu with good cores too
08:19:27 <ninjahmeh> maybe ill try going back to university xD that pretty much paid for me current rig and i could excuse it all because i was doing computer networking, so its like fine to spend 2-3 grand on a computer when its for "work" lol
08:22:12 <ninjahmeh> yeah a quick look shows i can still chuck a pretty strong cpu in the 1151 socket i have so at some point something like that will get bought, its just a shit time for money for basically most people i know right now
08:23:18 <dazinism> adeus: Signal blocks backups, but has its own backup mechanism. I found you have to grant signal a surprising number of permissions when you install it to get it to import a backup
08:24:31 <dazinism> Also I'm not sure that it automatically brings the number over?? Maybe you have to register via SMS again?? I can check that...
08:25:23 <ninjahmeh> hmmm seems still the highest amount of cores i would be looking at would be 16 with HT
08:27:36 <dazinism> Yeah, looks like you probably have to verify the number again via sms when you restore a signal backup
08:29:50 <dazinism> Just checked on a phone I set up a couple of months back and restored a signal backup, and I see the verification SMS from signal
08:54:54 <Ultron[m]> Wow guys! Can finally see the use cases of more ram and cpu cores.
08:55:15 <Ultron[m]> Can you do incremental builds for AOSP?
08:56:03 <Ultron[m]> I am just getting my hands dirty today making my first build. LineageOS repo sync going on.
08:56:37 <Ultron[m]> If there is a thing like incremental build then I assume it will save time rebuilding.
08:56:39 <strcat[m]> of course I was just talking about incremental builds taking 30 seconds
08:56:45 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote above
08:57:04 <strcat[m]> if you make a change that only requires rebuilding a small component then of course that's fast
08:57:15 <strcat[m]> if you make a large scope change then the incremental builds are not going to save you
08:57:28 <strcat[m]> if you change some core library header or change compiler options, or the build system, it has to rebuild nearly everything anyway
08:58:04 <strcat[m]> and incremental builds don't help at all when doing release builds or the final testing to make absolutely sure something works
08:58:20 <Ultron[m]> Got it. Thanks! I was under the impression that a basic change like changing the webview will rebuild from scratch. So was writing down everything carefully.
08:58:28 <strcat[m]> you need 32GB+ of memory simply to build the linux kernel with LTO/CFI
08:58:42 <strcat[m]> Ultron: no that's not the case, not sure where you got that impression
08:58:45 <strcat[m]> it NEVER rebuilds from 'scratch' unless you wipe out/
08:59:07 <strcat[m]> it only rebuilds what has changed but if you change core things then of course it has to rebuild a lot based on those
08:59:48 <strcat[m]> still need a powerful workstation to quickly rebuild whatever you have changed
09:00:06 <Ultron[m]> Ah okay. Some relief. I have 16 GB RAM, 4c/8t (i7 6700k - Skype) and 1TB SSD. Do you think it's feasible for building lineageos? I don't plan to build chromium.
09:00:28 <strcat[m]> the channel is about GrapheneOS
09:00:37 <Ultron[m]> Yes. Sorry.
09:01:01 <Iusearchbtw[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): BTW why do you keep tagging ultron?
09:01:24 <strcat[m]> because he's sending messages?
09:01:41 <Iusearchbtw[m]> What
09:01:49 <Iusearchbtw[m]> How come I don't see any
09:01:56 <strcat[m]> maybe you blocked them
09:02:57 <strcat[m]> I don't block people since then I can't see their messages
09:03:13 <strcat[m]> On Twitter them blocking you stops you from seeing their messages when logged in so that's a bit different, might as well mutually block them
09:03:25 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Nah don't want to see his anyway
09:03:30 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Guess I do have reason to after being publicly doxxed and threatened by him
09:03:42 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Just going to continue ignore the idiot
09:04:06 <Ultron[m]> What? Threatened?
09:04:21 <strcat[m]> 16GB is not enough memory to comfortable build Linux with LTO/CFI or to work on Chromium / AOSP comfortably / productively
09:04:36 <strcat[m]> 16GB is bare minimum to build AOSP and Chromium with very few jobs thanks to ThinLTO
09:04:49 <strcat[m]> Linux kernel? you would need 32GB+ of swap to build it with only 16GB memory
09:05:01 <strcat[m]> to build Linux with CFI/LTO with no swap you need 48GB of memory pretty much
09:05:03 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Can do it in 8gb
09:05:13 <strcat[m]> probably really sketchy with 8
09:05:14 <Iusearchbtw[m]> But it'll take 2 days for a full build
09:05:21 <strcat[m]> 16 is what I consider bare minimum
09:05:32 <strcat[m]> because otherwise you'll be swapping a ridiculous amount
09:05:33 <Lia[m]> Did Chromium in 4 in 5 days before
09:05:40 <Iusearchbtw[m]> I've done it in the past
09:05:42 <Lia[m]>  * Did Chromium in 4GB RAM in 5 days before
09:05:56 <Iusearchbtw[m]> With a lot of swap
09:06:01 <strcat[m]> 48GB is what I would recommend for Linux kernel development with CFI+LTO
09:06:11 <Ultron[m]> I will upgrade to 32 GB for now. If I go 32 gb then I need to sell my current sticks as have dual channel 8x2 right now.
09:06:15 <M0xC0ncord[m]> strcat: I've been following the mailing list for kernel hardening and there's a lot of work on upstreaming LTO and CFI support. How long do you expect that to take?
09:06:18 <M0xC0ncord[m]>  * strcat: I've been following the mailing list for kernel hardening and there's a lot of work on upstreaming LTO and CFI support. How long would you expect that to take?
09:06:20 <strcat[m]> 64GB for building Chromium / AOSP with a huge number of jobs on many cores (don't need nearly that much if you have only 6 cores or w/e)
09:06:20 <Ultron[m]>  * I will upgrade to 32 GB for now. If I go above 32 gb then I need to sell my current sticks as have dual channel 8x2 right now.
09:06:31 <Iusearchbtw[m]> God damn why does the number keep increasing
09:06:38 <strcat[m]> I have 64GB in my workstation from 2016
09:06:57 <strcat[m]> 4x 16GB DDR4 sticks
09:07:04 <Iusearchbtw[m]> Stop don't want to hear more
09:07:05 <strcat[m]> quad channel RAM with this CPU
09:07:12 <strcat[m]> it wasn't expensive
09:07:15 <strcat[m]> the RAM I mean
09:07:24 <strcat[m]> the CPU and SSD were expensive
09:07:24 <Iusearchbtw[m]> What
09:07:32 <Iusearchbtw[m]> How the hell is 64G of ddr4 ram not expensive
09:07:42 <strcat[m]> it was like $300 in 2016 for 4x 64GB of DDR4
09:07:54 <strcat[m]> er I mean
09:07:56 <Ultron[m]> I didn't really thought that I will ever need more than 16GB. My use case was not exceeding that. Now I can see how 16gb can be limited for building or using multiple vms simultaneously .
09:07:58 <strcat[m]>  * it was like $300 in 2016 for 4x 16GB of DDR4
09:08:10 <Iusearchbtw[m]> That is pretty expensive
09:08:13 <strcat[m]> Ultron: building scales to any # of cores
09:08:30 <strcat[m]> so if you've got 4 cores then yeah 16GB is probably enough, but not if you're doing other stuff like web browsing
09:08:40 <strcat[m]> if it's a pure build machine with 4 cores, then yeah 16GB is probably fine
09:08:43 <inrdrna[m]> anupritaisno1: frequency can change the price by a lot
09:08:46 <Ultron[m]> <strcat[m] "Ultron: building scales to any #"> Wished gaming and other things scaled linearly.
09:08:48 <strcat[m]> used for other stuff? probably want 32GB
09:09:07 <strcat[m]> many cores? then you start needing more and more and you want 64GB for say 32 core build + using it for other stuff at same time
09:09:19 <strcat[m]> also if you have extra RAM then you can get everything for builds in cache
09:09:57 <Ultron[m]> I see. Since I won't build frequently (just monthly once when new asb come) - I guess it will be fine for now.
09:09:57 <strcat[m]> so 128GB lets you have it all in cache for incremental builds, 256GB everything that's used (toolchains, all sources, all outputs) in cache with 64+ cores all doing a job at the same time
09:10:05 <strcat[m]> so yeah more memory + huge number of cores helps a lot
09:10:13 <Ultron[m]> or can make a ramdisk out of it. :)
09:10:21 <Lia[m]> (No wonder donations are very needed...)
09:10:36 <strcat[m]> productivity building linux, chromium, aosp, etc.
09:10:41 <strcat[m]> is often heavily limited by build times
09:10:53 <Lia[m]> (Hard barrier to enter to have productive machine for contribution)
09:10:58 <strcat[m]> not all builds can work well with incremental builds
09:11:06 <strcat[m]> lets say I am narrowing down a bug to the change that uncovers it
09:11:12 <strcat[m]> so I revert half the bionic commits
09:11:18 <strcat[m]> well I basically have to rebuild 80%+ of the code now anyway
09:11:21 <strcat[m]> so it's almost a clean build
09:11:39 <strcat[m]> at that point might as well rm -rf out anyway just to help with being absolutely sure I'm testing what I think I am and nothing has gone wrong
09:11:54 <strcat[m]> also often end up just testing production, signed builds for simplicity
09:12:12 <strcat[m]> because I need 1 of each device running production + signed official builds
09:12:22 <strcat[m]> so unless I have a 2nd of the device
09:12:32 <strcat[m]> I don't have one that's unlocked and running test key signed dev builds
09:12:46 <strcat[m]> and I'm not going to buy 2 of every supported device to have one for dev builds
09:12:58 <strcat[m]> even aside from the money issue it's a huge pain to keep them all charged and remember which is which
09:13:00 <strcat[m]> find one I need
09:14:21 <Ultron[m]> Are there any plans to monetize GrapheneOS in the future?
09:15:11 <strcat[m]> no
09:15:17 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/
09:15:25 <strcat[m]> it's not a company and won't be one
09:15:33 <strcat[m]> it will continue to work with companies
09:15:37 <strcat[m]> but GrapheneOS is not one and won't be one
09:45:38 <Ultron[m]> Nice to know that. I hope GrapheneOS scale to a much bigger platform. There are many use cases for government itself. I hope some government enforce using of pixels with gos. I have seen government officials, military, etc using crap chinese phones. GrapheneOS is a perfect fit for them.

13:58:08 <derpy> having a hell of a time trying to copy WhatsApp directory back onto my new GOS device... I mounted with simple-mtpfs and I tried copying it with rsync & other apps... I get a lot of "invalid argument" output in the copy process
13:58:24 <alex-resist> Hey, I noticed something odd. On the computer (Debian, Firefox ESR) https://grapheneos.org/releases#sargo-stable shows sargo-factory-2020.09.11.14.zip. On the phone (Tor Browser, no JavaScript) the same link shows sargo-factory-2020.03.03.22.zip. How is that possible?
13:58:27 <derpy> used sudo for all copy & mount processes because otherwise it doesn't work
14:00:50 <alex-resist> Apparently, without JS it shows the 2020.08.x version, with JS enabled it shows 2020.09.x
14:23:28 <derpy> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/dy5r1b/restore_whatsapp_backup_fails/ claiming I need to change permissions on the app... I wonder which permissions they're referring to
14:25:27 <jpds> derpy: Storage?
14:25:57 <derpy> ya will try that and reinstall and see if it asks to restore
14:26:08 <derpy> whatsapp is such a steaming pile... I promise I would ditch it if I could
14:32:21 <NorbertTretkows4> alex-resist: The page shows the 2020.09.11.14 release for me, but when reloading the page, for a short while I see the 2020.08.03.22 release.
14:32:40 <alex-resist> Could you try the same thing with JS deactivated?
14:32:58 <alex-resist> Then it is "stuck" with the 2020.08.03.22 release
14:34:27 <NorbertTretkows4> Yes, with JS disabled, it stays at the 2020.08.03.22 release.
14:35:19 <derpy> what do you guys use to copy files from your computer? I'm suing simple-mtpfs - and I'm getting lots of "invalid argument" errors on copying files (which is surprisingly slow)
14:36:15 <NorbertTretkows4> derpy: I am old, hence I just use Nautilus, the GNOME Filemanager...
14:36:34 <derpy> ya but the mounting of the device is the issue, shouldn't matter what file manager
14:36:57 <derpy> however, copying make ROX-filer go crazy, and rsync is also having the same errors
14:37:02 <NorbertTretkows4> That's some magic happening in the background, it just works for me :)
14:37:30 <derpy> rsync: [receiver] mkstemp "/media/Pixel/WhatsApp/Databases/.msgstore-2020-09-10.1.db.crypt12.xPclD" failed:Invalid argument (22)
14:37:48 <Hugh[m]> I just use adb from the cli, seems more reliable than trying to mount. Admittedly the ux is not quite as straightforward
14:37:49 <derpy> (I did run rsync and mount as sudo, of course)
14:38:23 <derpy> Hugh[m] oh so how would you copy files to it using adb?
14:38:56 <derpy> I wasn't because I saw this post by Daniel saying now to: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/go6q0o/transferring_files_between_grapheneos_and_computer/
14:38:57 <Hugh[m]> Are we saying computer to phone, I may have missed some of the conversation context
14:39:08 <derpy> correct, computer -> phone
14:39:22 <derpy> previously copied the database files from phone -> computer successfully
14:40:23 <Hugh[m]> I hadn't seen that comment and obviously if you are concerned about the threat posed by usb debugging it is not the best
14:40:56 <Hugh[m]> But I am reasonably confident that my pc is secure and I turn usb debugging back off after I copy what I need
14:41:05 <derpy> not concerned, just trying to copy files, which is taking me hours in 2020 0_0
14:49:16 <Hugh[m]> You could try enabling developer options then, plugging to pc by usb and then run something like `adb push /path/to/file/to/copy /destination/folder`
14:49:33 <Hugh[m]> there should be plenty of info online about using `adb push` commands
14:49:45 <Hugh[m]> you'll the tools installed on your pc
14:49:51 <Hugh[m]>  * you'll need the tools installed on your pc
14:50:05 <Hugh[m]> You can also disable dev options once done if you want to
14:50:38 <Hugh[m]> How many files are we talking about? Or is it just really big files
14:51:49 <derpy> like 3 gigs
14:51:54 <derpy> rrr now aurora store is broken
14:52:03 <derpy> had to uninstall / reinstall whatsapp a few times
14:52:06 <derpy> and it won't work anymore
14:52:13 <derpy> I guess I'll try uninstalling aurora store itself
14:52:20 <derpy> clearing its cache didnt fix it
14:53:31 <derpy> ok that worked :)
14:56:39 <derpy> great... "we are unable to restore any of your message history backups" and I have to wait a day to try again
14:57:33 <derpy> too difficult for a software engineer 0_0

22:18:19 <engulf[m]> Ohh, cd one up
22:18:57 <engulf[m]> To your "Desktop" folder

22:21:30 <bypassbob[m]> Driving me crazy this haha

22:24:02 <bypassbob[m]> Is this command essential? Can I not just skip this and do flash?
22:24:10 <engulf[m]> Ok this no longer makes sense to me, maybe someone with more familiar with Windows should take over?
22:25:40 <engulf[m]> You would have to make changes to the flashing script otherwise
22:28:55 <engulf[m]>  * Otherwise you would have to make changes to the flashing script
22:53:20 <bypassbob[m]> I’ve managed to unlock the bootloader
22:53:52 <bypassbob[m]> I’ve copied the image files to the same directory and opened flash-all nothing’s happening
22:58:43 <bypassbob[m]> Don’t it had to edit the flash-all script
22:58:52 <bypassbob[m]> * Done it had to edit the flash-all script

23:05:25 <bypassbob[m]> Done. Thank god.
23:06:14 <picadex[m]> congrats!
23:07:07 <bypassbob[m]> <picadex[m] "congrats!"> Thanks I thought I spent £400 today for nothing. That’s was a head ache. 😂

23:07:16 <bypassbob[m]> Thanks I thought I spent £400 today for nothing. That was a head ache. 😂
23:07:31 <picadex[m]> xd, soon hoping to just dump google aswell
23:07:58 <picadex[m]> is that the 3a xl?
23:08:39 <bypassbob[m]> No 4 XL
23:08:48 <picadex[m]> ahh
23:09:21 <picadex[m]> waiting for the 4a to be supported, might just get the 3a xl though
23:10:39 <picadex[m]> might even go for the 4 xl if i see a nice price
23:11:19 <bypassbob[m]> I’ve been looking for about a week they seem to go fast at reasonable prices
23:19:11 <lev[m]> that's not a bad price, though it is kinda annoying the 4/4xl was in production for under a year
23:19:31 <lev[m]> though the 5 (and 4a 5G) is coming out in two weeks?
23:28:08 <bypassbob[m]> When do you think the new graphene os for the 5 will be available
23:30:11 <CaptainPicard[m]> bypassbob: Depends when people step up to work on it. The dev is busy enough as is and it will need its own maintainer when it comes out.
23:31:11 <cn3m[m]> there are devs and testers, but maintainers aren't common even for devices already supported
23:31:48 <IanB[m]> <bypassbob[m] "When do you think the new graphe"> And when in pixel 4a?
23:32:11 <cn3m[m]> when there are maintainers
23:33:03 <cn3m[m]> there is the expectation you buy a device to run GrapheneOS
23:34:23 <cn3m[m]> This is a community run project and the focus is on the OS
23:34:33 <cn3m[m]> ideally every compatible device would be supported
23:34:38 <cn3m[m]> like the A2 was a candidate
23:34:42 <cn3m[m]> but no one was interested
23:34:44 <cn3m[m]> so it never happened
23:40:03 <bypassbob[m]> A2?
23:41:39 <CaptainPicard[m]> XiaoMi A2
23:45:09 <bypassbob[m]> Ok do you know of any instant email apps on the graphene? There’s one called instaddr on iOS it allows you to create a custom email address instantly
23:45:36 <bypassbob[m]> * Ok do you know of any instant email apps on the f-droid on graphene? There’s one called instaddr on iOS it allows you to create a custom email address instantly
23:48:35 <lickidyspl1t[m]> If u can get an  invite to ctemplar 👍
23:49:07 <lickidyspl1t[m]> If not tutanota is OK I think, besides the ddos attacks
23:54:09 <bypassbob[m]> Ctemplar looks good
