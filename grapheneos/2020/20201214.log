04:39:06 <joehandcockandja> Does the private DNS option override the IP DNS I manually set for my WiFi connection
05:09:04 <madd_hatter[m]> <joehandcockandja "Does the private DNS option over"> Yes but it does not override a vpn or if an app uses its own dns like how some browsers use thier own DoH etc
05:11:01 <madd_hatter[m]> <dakotah[m] "That is crazy"> Mine are the same way.  Much tighter than past phones and other connectors.

05:44:30 <mikf[m]> Hey everyone, trying to install on a pixel 4a. I get to flash-all on win10 and it says "Powershell is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. And then it says fastboot is too old and to update, but it i think its just the script seeing that it failed
05:47:41 <mikf[m]> Also, i am using powershell and have the latest fastboot (30.0.5)
05:48:46 <madd_hatter[m]>  Yes but do you also have an older version for fastboot installed  also?
05:49:36 <mikf[m]> I don't believe so, how would i check. The path variable is pointing to the one that i am using
05:51:29 <madd_hatter[m]> Sorry I read just the last part of your post.  Are you saying your not able to open powershell?
05:55:27 <mikf[m]> I am able to open powershell. When i run the flash-all script, it fails, and the first thing it says is "'PowerShell' is not recognized as an ..." (continue line from post. The next line says fastboot too old; please download...   so i am assuming that it isn't able to obtain the fastboot version and then stops the program and says it failed, spitting out the fastboot line
06:01:40 <mikf[m]> Haven't found any other files that indicate an earlier version of fastboot
06:09:15 <mikf[m]> The one thing i could think of is that i am not setting the path variable correctly, but i think i am: $env:Path...$env:C:\Users\user name"
06:09:57 <madd_hatter[m]> That sounds like something got screwed up in your path environment variable.  All I can think of for not seeing powershell.
06:09:57 <madd_hatter[m]> You could run this to try and reset path
06:09:57 <madd_hatter[m]> %SYSTEMROOT%System32\Windows\PowerShell\v1.0\
06:10:50 <madd_hatter[m]> <mikf[m] "The one thing i could think of i"> True but unless you really messed up powershell should have been found
06:13:51 <madd_hatter[m]> You do understand the path you set per the GOS instructions is temp.  If you closed and repoened its gone.  You have to reset.
06:16:41 <mikf[m]> Yeah, i know i have to set it again if i close it. Could it be a problem if is c\windows\system32\windowspowershell\v1.0? Would that make a difference from what you said?
06:18:29 <madd_hatter[m]> Crap no yours is correct.  I got \ happy there and put one too many.
06:19:03 <mikf[m]> I tried yours and it threw an error
06:20:05 <madd_hatter[m]> Yep it should of.  Sorry about that.  I am on my phone.  Let me open my Win 10 laptop.
06:21:16 <mikf[m]> After putting in the system root path its now saying that "where" is not recognized as an internal...
06:26:40 <madd_hatter[m]> What!?!  That is screwy.
06:26:40 <madd_hatter[m]> Lets start over.  Close it up and reopen powershell
06:27:07 <mikf[m]> Open
06:27:29 <madd_hatter[m]> Run the
06:27:29 <madd_hatter[m]> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
06:28:04 <madd_hatter[m]> Then try running
06:28:04 <mikf[m]> Done
06:28:04 <madd_hatter[m]>  fastboot --version
06:28:33 <mikf[m]> 30.0.5-6877874
06:29:11 <madd_hatter[m]> Ok I am doing this step in step on my pc.
06:29:20 <madd_hatter[m]> I have the same good
06:30:06 <mikf[m]> On the install page it says \fastboot, but on mine it says \fastboot.exe, i'm assuming this is bc it was done on linux?
06:30:43 <mikf[m]> /fastboot*
06:32:26 <madd_hatter[m]> The install page has windows instructions for each step.  Not sure what part you are looking at.
06:32:56 <mikf[m]> Under sample output from fastboot --version
06:33:29 <mikf[m]> Same line as: Installed as: /home/username..

06:40:02 <mikf[m]> Please don't lol
06:42:15 <madd_hatter[m]> You already have the image downloaded with curl and have extracted them?
06:42:59 <mikf[m]> Command line curl wasn't working, but i downloaded and extracted them into the path
06:42:59 <madd_hatter[m]> tar xvf Graphene-image.zip
06:44:07 <madd_hatter[m]> So you are now in the unzipped directory of the image?

06:47:24 <mikf[m]> Lol
06:47:37 <madd_hatter[m]> Cant gelieve I did that
06:48:18 <mikf[m]> Still says powershell isn't recognized as a command or anything
06:49:11 <mikf[m]> Does capitalization matter in a bat file?
06:49:14 <madd_hatter[m]> What the hell?
06:49:43 <madd_hatter[m]> Shouldnt but might as well see
06:50:24 <mikf[m]> Didn't make a difference
06:50:33 <madd_hatter[m]> Maybe try opening PS as admin but that should not effect that error
06:50:43 <mikf[m]> Will try
06:51:40 <madd_hatter[m]> Where r all the smart people ?
06:51:40 <madd_hatter[m]> I dont use windows much anymore.  I am 99% on qubes os linux bsd android
06:51:41 <mikf[m]> As admin, fastboot version isn't working
06:51:58 <madd_hatter[m]> Set path again?
06:52:10 <mikf[m]> Yep, right before it
06:52:42 <madd_hatter[m]> I feel like Im being punked but I know its wishful thinking.
06:53:14 <madd_hatter[m]> What if you try it from cmd
06:53:17 <Volkoz[m]> your entire system (phone and computer) both fully up to date, including fastboot and adb right?
06:53:27 <mikf[m]> Yes
06:53:35 <mikf[m]> Ran updates on both today
06:53:45 <mikf[m]> Wait, in admin the path is different
06:53:49 <mikf[m]> Hold on
06:53:52 <madd_hatter[m]> He even did a version and it matches mine current
06:54:20 <madd_hatter[m]> Thats true
06:55:48 <madd_hatter[m]> I could deal with the fastboot issue and work that but not recognizing PS error after confirming is wierd
06:56:50 <mikf[m]> There's a space in the username, and when i try to cd its thinking i'm giving it a command, let me try a different user folder
06:57:39 <madd_hatter[m]> Yes that will happen.  Shit I shoukd have thought about it.
07:00:24 <mikf[m]> Its now saying Public doesn't exist, i'm just going to make a new user and start over give me ten
07:00:40 <madd_hatter[m]> Thats what you get for not using a - or  _ going all Windows oh the good 8.3 days. ðŸ˜ƒ
07:01:29 <madd_hatter[m]> I think its a good idea and just rerun thru the whole instruction set step by step
07:01:50 <madd_hatter[m]> Post back with an update either way
07:07:11 <mikf[m]> The settings page to add a user keeps crashing, might be a while

07:37:52 <Thatcher[m]> What are "Sensors" in Graphene?
07:38:53 <somenerd[m]> Sensors are miscellaneous sensors, ones not covered by existing permissions
07:39:09 <somenerd[m]> the accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.
07:39:24 <Thatcher[m]> Ah, i see
07:40:03 <Thatcher[m]> I guess I'll leave those alone then.
07:40:29 <somenerd[m]> you may want to disable them for certain apps that may not need them
07:41:57 <Thatcher[m]> I disabled the sensors for all my user downloaded apps. It's the system apps I was curious about. I think the safest thing is for me to not mess with them.
07:43:23 <Lia[m]> Usually yes, as they are trusted apps anyways, but turning them off doesn't break anything
07:43:29 <Lia[m]> Unless you use camera and cannot detect orientation occasionally
07:53:23 <Lia[m]> <Lia[m] "Usually yes, as they are trusted"> So far
08:29:56 <ultracard[m]> hello, could anyone tell me how to sideload an OTA update on graphene OS?
08:30:05 <ultracard[m]> i booted into recovery mode and andered adb
08:30:11 <ultracard[m]> but no list of devices was attached
08:31:33 <ultracard[m]>  * i booted into recovery mode and entered adb devices
08:35:53 <ultracard[m]> I now entered rescue mode
08:36:02 <ultracard[m]> and when entering adb devices I get
08:36:14 <ultracard[m]> List of devices attached
08:36:14 <ultracard[m]> 09261JEC201467	rescue
08:36:44 <ultracard[m]> but when i do "adb sideload ota.zip"
08:36:46 <ultracard[m]> i ged
08:37:00 <ultracard[m]> adb: sideload connection failed: closed
08:37:00 <ultracard[m]> adb: trying pre-KitKat sideload method...
08:37:00 <ultracard[m]> adb: pre-KitKat sideload connection failed: closed
08:37:12 <ultracard[m]>  * i get
08:41:04 <oldman_newuser> just curious what version of adb you are using
08:41:20 <oldman_newuser>  adb --versionAndroid Debug Bridge version 1.0.41Version 30.0.5-6877874
08:41:56 <ultracard[m]> Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
08:41:56 <ultracard[m]> Version 30.0.4-6686687
08:41:56 <ultracard[m]> Installed as /home/anonymous/Downloads/LineageOS17_1/platform-tools/adb
08:42:08 <nscnt> ultracard[m]: If you sideload via adb, you need to select the option in recovery mode, I think. Have you done this?
08:43:34 <ultracard[m]> oooooops
08:43:35 <ultracard[m]> sorry
08:43:41 <ultracard[m]> yeah, just saw that on your faq page
08:43:46 <ultracard[m]> gonna try now
08:44:06 <ultracard[m]> ooooooh yesssssss
08:44:08 <ultracard[m]> it works
08:44:22 <ultracard[m]> now i just wish that the update applies without problems
08:47:03 <nscnt> Ah, well... I haven't found the information myself on the website after a quick search ^^
08:47:33 <nscnt> Got it now
08:53:04 <digiscales[m]> Hi had a problem last night plugged in phone after beta update and shows as ACER device in windows couldn't access files
08:53:09 <digiscales[m]> Is this a windows driver issue?
08:53:29 <digiscales[m]> Or perhaps GOS related?
08:54:16 <digiscales[m]> I recently ran driver booster but excluded pixel3xl drivers and reinstalled Google USB drivers
08:54:54 <digiscales[m]> That showed all drivers up to date next time I ran driver booster so I didn't allow driver booster to change drivers for phone as I thought that night cause issue
09:06:21 <nscnt> digiscales[m]: I doubt it's a GrapheneOS issue. I wouldn't run such tools (like clean up tools, etc.), but that's just my 2 cents
09:08:23 <digiscales[m]> Like I said I didn't change and USB drivers only Intel e.t.c. system drivers which actually needed updates as MS limit them to older versions
09:09:03 <digiscales[m]> And=Any (above typo)
09:10:35 <ultracard[m]> tried sideloading the update
09:10:38 <nscnt> In my early experience with computers, I know tools like these can break your system easily
09:10:52 <ultracard[m]> but now i am actually stuck in a bootloop
09:11:02 <ultracard[m]> keeps rebooting
09:15:34 <ultracard[m]> @strcat
09:16:07 <ultracard[m]>  * @strcat you said that if applying the update fails, i should try wiping the data partition
09:16:13 <ultracard[m]> how do i do that?
09:52:32 <dazinism> ultracard: think when you are in recovery need to hold power then press volume up. Not done it, but think thats how to.
10:14:58 <theinstallationw> Hey guys, my gf still has a pixel 2XL but we just found out it's flagged as obsolete. The website says that extended support will be available. Would this still be considered secure?
10:33:33 <nscnt> theinstallationw: No, it can't be considered secure anymore due to the lack of important security updates. It is recommended to move to a supported device like the Pixel 4a
10:38:53 <nscnt> theinstallationw: Relevant thread: https://nitter.net/GrapheneOS/status/1336641069522575362
10:42:34 <Pratyush[m]> theinstallationwizard  in short no just because it didn't meet the security requirements of graphene os (namely verdor update). If you have one you can use it still more secure then stock or any coustm rom just be aware of exploit that can hard you in any way (keep a eye on news).
10:42:34 <Pratyush[m]> As of now i also have same device and i use it watch newpipe and other similar stuff but i don't use it for what graphene is known for.
10:42:34 <Pratyush[m]> Graphene official said that's the end of this device support. So you should look for other options like getting a new device or you can use it for few more months just be aware of it's support was been ended.
11:19:52 <ultracard[m]> ok, I went into recovery and used "factory reset" to wipe my data partition. after that grapheneOS booted without any issues. i am now restoring my data from a seedvault backup
11:20:34 <ultracard[m]> strcat: but you were saying that i shouldn't continue using this phone, right? because if I do the same thing could happen again and again
11:30:16 <dazinism> ultracard: if I was in your position I'd carry on using it. Just make sure I did regular backups of important stuff off device (maybe do seedvault backups to nextcloud so backups happen regularly?)
11:31:20 <dazinism> If it starts misbehaving again I'd reconsider.
11:33:17 <ultracard[m]> ok, thanks
11:33:24 <ultracard[m]> seedvault backup restored succesfully
11:33:35 <ultracard[m]> I now have most of my important data back
11:33:46 <ultracard[m]> from now on i'll do a seedvault backup at least weelky
11:33:50 <ultracard[m]> weeky
11:34:12 <ultracard[m]> btw: is anyone in this chat involved in the development of seedvault?
11:34:20 <ultracard[m]> if so: Thank you so much
11:34:24 <ultracard[m]> !!!!!!!
11:34:34 <ultracard[m]> seedvault just saved me
11:34:41 <ultracard[m]> otherwise i would be prett
11:34:53 <ultracard[m]>  * otherwise i would be pretty f*cked up right now
11:35:40 <ultracard[m]> if i could, I would hug you right now
11:35:42 <ultracard[m]> so happy
11:38:02 <dazinism> ultracard: yeah seedvault is great
11:38:55 <dazinism> I've got a USBC hub with a usb flash so that my phone backs up while it charges
11:39:22 <dakotah[m]> oooo
11:40:47 <dazinism> Theres a load about backups in the Graphene community wiki
11:40:50 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
11:41:39 <dazinism> I just updated it yesterday to reflect recent additions to seedvault
11:42:03 <ultracard[m]> <dazinism "https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/gra"> nice
11:42:04 <ultracard[m]> thanks
11:42:43 <dazinism> ultracard: with nextcloud and/or syncthing you could set things up so your files are constantly getting automatically backed up somewhere
11:43:14 <dazinism> Minimise the amount you'd loose if it happens again
11:47:25 <dazinism> Could do password vault (but not key file), signal backups (signal dumps out regular backups into the filesystem once you've done it once, can get an app to grab them when it happens) etc.
11:47:48 <ultracard[m]> yeah that would be nice
11:47:58 <ultracard[m]> luckily i back up my signal backup file every weeg
11:48:00 <ultracard[m]> week
11:48:10 <ultracard[m]> because i simply cannot lose my chats
11:48:26 <ultracard[m]> but nextcloud would of course be more convenient
11:48:43 <ultracard[m]> but as i don't have enough experience with that currenty, i won't use it yet
11:48:53 <ultracard[m]> i first need to understand how to configure it securely
11:49:06 <ultracard[m]> as long as i don't i will only backup to a usb stick
11:49:17 <dazinism> As they are encrypted don't the security of the place the backups are going isnt so important.
11:49:22 <ultracard[m]> the only way i can currently be sure no hacker will get my data
11:49:39 <ultracard[m]> <dazinism "As they are encrypted don't the "> yeah, i'm aware fo that
11:49:42 <ultracard[m]> of that
11:49:46 <dazinism> Sorry... that reply was bad timing
11:49:46 <ultracard[m]> but the rest isn't
11:49:58 <ultracard[m]> np
11:50:13 <dazinism> Nextcloud doesnt encrypt
11:50:23 <ultracard[m]> the value of an automated nexcloud would be for me that I can automatically back up my entire home folder
11:50:34 <ultracard[m]> seedvault backups already work on a usb stick
11:51:06 <ultracard[m]> but they don't backup internal storage (which i find weird, wouldn't it be possible to simply throw files from internal storage into the encrypted seedvault container?)
11:51:16 <dazinism> Seedvault will support backing up files soon.... but I get that you want something now
11:51:31 <ultracard[m]> <dazinism "Nextcloud doesnt encrypt "> yeah, that's the thing
11:51:43 <ultracard[m]> <dazinism "Seedvault will support backing u"> sweet
11:51:48 <ultracard[m]> looking forward to that
11:51:53 <ultracard[m]> that'll be a game changer
11:52:11 <dazinism> Nextcloud can encrypt files, just I think the feature has issues still
11:52:33 <dazinism> Its been available for some time now. I don't follow closely
11:53:10 <somenerd[m]> > Seedvault will support backing up files soon.... but I get that you want something now
11:53:10 <somenerd[m]> that sounds cool
11:53:10 <dazinism> Also I've not looked closely at the implementation
11:53:17 <somenerd[m]> > Nextcloud can encrypt files, just I think the feature has issues still
11:53:17 <somenerd[m]> it can?
11:53:22 <dazinism> Nextcloud often has 'issues'
11:53:43 <somenerd[m]> maybe client side encrypt?
11:54:28 <dazinism> somenerd: think its maybe server side, but I'm not at all sure.
11:54:49 <somenerd[m]> server side doesn't sound too good
12:00:00 <dazinism> syncthing is likely best option for security- if you sync with another android phone and strictly limit apps that can access storage there. Its been some time since I've used it though.
12:03:16 <somenerd[m]> seedvault for cloud storage would be quite nice
12:18:28 <Thatcher[m]> I have a question about app sandboxing in AOSP. Pardon my lack of knowledge, but I came to Graphene thinking that all apps were sandboxed from each other by default. I just learned that I was wrong! Now I'm reading that users are creating a new user profile for each app they want sandboxed.
12:18:28 <Thatcher[m]> How do I assign already-installed apps to a specific profile?
12:22:19 <jpds> All apps are sandboxed by default on Android
13:05:46 <dazinism> ayaen_t: yeah looks like you need at least 16gb RAM as detailed on the website.
13:05:47 <dazinism> Some discussion https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201027#c5609017
13:52:24 <nscnt> Thatcher[m]: No, you misunderstood. Apps are always sandboxed. Still, apps are able to communicate with each other through intents. This is a needed functionality to give the expected user experience while having different apps for different pourposes. If you don't want an app to be able to do this, you need to put this app in another profile. (That's only one of many use cases to use different
13:52:25 <nscnt> user profiles)
13:53:36 <nscnt> You can't 'assign' an already-installed app to another profile. Profiles are completely isolated from each other. Each has it's own space for storage, etc.
13:54:33 <nscnt> You need to install the app again in the other profile. Keep in mind that it needs to be the same app version or higher. Downgrades are not permitted and the installation would fail
13:57:25 <nscnt> APKs get shared on the system (which is the reason why you can't install a lower version in another profile)
16:00:39 <Captain_Christma> Howdy, anyone know if any usb c hubs work with graphene?
16:00:57 <Captain_Christma> I have one connect to a 4a but nothing is getting detected
16:01:18 <Captain_Christma> maybe a settings option issue?
16:02:08 <nscnt> Captain_Christma: Have you changed the USB Preferences for e.g. File Transfer? It's denied by default.
16:03:06 <Captain_Christma> no all the options are greyed ou
16:03:10 <Captain_Christma> out**
16:05:09 <niky> hello, hope all of yall  are doing well
16:05:20 <nscnt> Seems like it doesn't recognize that it's connected to another device. That's on you to figure out where the problem lies
16:05:45 <niky> im new to GOS and id like to know which permissions should i not tamper with..
16:06:09 <niky> like can i turn off sensor permission for all apps ?
16:06:25 <nscnt> niky: Just keep in mind that denying permission may break apps. Otherwise it doesn't matter.
16:06:54 <niky> and in special permission > usage access , which system apps can i deny that permission?
16:06:56 <nscnt> niky: Especially Sensor permissions, because apps can't ask for it. That's why it's allowed by default
16:07:48 <niky> can you give one example of an app that needs sensors?
16:09:09 <jpds> niky: osmand+
16:10:09 <nscnt> niky: Re: Usage access. Honestly, I didn't know about this. There is no app displayed for me anyway
16:10:21 <niky> jpds i meant deafault apps or system apps using sensors
16:12:11 <nscnt> If a system app wouldn't need a permission to function, it would be pretty much denied from the beginning. Limit your fiddling to user apps
16:14:53 <nscnt> Don't try to change something of the system. GrapheneOS has good defaults
16:15:52 <nscnt> Especially if you don't actually know what you're doing
16:16:35 <niky> like my doubt is why would a system apps like bluetooth need Usage Access?
16:17:22 <niky> so i thought before i toggle something, I'll ask you guys..
16:19:04 <nscnt> Do you know what Usage Access is?
16:20:28 <nscnt> niky: As I said, just don't change system stuff
16:21:14 <niky> okay cool
16:21:27 <niky> thanks :)
16:22:02 <niky> should setup any ad blocker or so ?
16:22:39 <niky> ive installed gos but now what should be the nest steps ?
16:22:44 <nscnt> niky: Have a read:

16:25:34 <nscnt> niky: As a side note: We have #grapheneos-offtopic in case you want to talk about stuff not directly related with GrapheneOS
16:28:23 <niky> okay ill go there for my apps suggestions
16:28:29 <niky> see yaa
16:43:10 <Captain_Christma> hmm Im trying different usb c hubs but nnone of them are working with my 4a
16:43:31 <Captain_Christma> Maybe the hubs i chose are not compatible
16:43:52 <Captain_Christma> hadcompatibility issues with other phones before
16:45:03 <Captain_Christma> can anyone recomend a hub that worked for them?
21:10:34 <bprintz44> Pixel 5 Support: Is that in the gameplan?
21:46:10 <alex-resist> Hello everyone, is it possible to find out if a GrapheneOS phone has been used with a SIM card lately, say over the last 3-4 weeks? Are there any logs in that regard?
21:58:35 <qubits> Hi everyone i need asistance with loading grapheneos on google pixel 4a
22:03:18 <TheJollyRoger> qubits: please follow the official instructions at https://grapheneos.org/install . The instructions there detail, in precise order, the exact commands you will need to take in order to complete the installation.
22:06:50 <setupKM> hi everyone
22:07:21 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy.
22:08:22 <setupKM> first time here for me. Trying to install graphenOS on my PIXEL 3 but I'm stuck in fastboot mode with "error setup KM"
22:08:39 <setupKM> any ideas ?
22:08:52 <TheJollyRoger> Not at the moment. Haven't seen "error setup KM" before.
22:09:00 <TheJollyRoger> Did you follow the official instructions or a third-party guide or video?
22:09:26 <setupKM> yes, i followed thi https://grapheneos.org/install#install
22:10:06 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. I'm not sure what could cause "Setup KM" to appear, hopefully someone more knowledgeable than I may be able to help you out.
22:11:16 <alex-resist> Possible answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/ij0kxx/does_anyone_know_how_to_get_out_of_fast_boot_mode/
22:11:36 <alex-resist> "Go to the Google images site for phones factory images find your phone model and download the latest factory image to flash and then flash that factory image on your phone The error is KM which is the kernel memory so there's something that corrupted in your in your phone you could try running a reset but if it won't if it keeps going back to fast boot it can't get past the bootloader so it's that's when it's loading the first kerne
22:11:38 <alex-resist> l so you recommend reflashing it and trying again"
22:11:44 <setupKM> yes, same issue
22:11:45 <alex-resist> It's the only result on the entire web that somewhat makes sense
22:12:29 <alex-resist> Ofc I cannot vouch for it, but it might be a starting point
22:12:49 <setupKM> yes, really stange. I update my phone just before installing graphene
22:13:06 <alex-resist> Did you wait until the update finished?
22:13:17 <alex-resist> Or did you perhaps shut it down too soon?
22:13:22 <setupKM> yes, of course
22:13:58 <setupKM> the update was finished then I power off the device
22:14:06 <alex-resist> Is fastboot still responsive? E.g. can you run "fastboot devices"?
22:14:40 <setupKM> yes, "fastboot devices" still working
22:15:01 <alex-resist> Okay, perhaps you can unlock it again, reinstall stock and see if that fixes the issue
22:17:05 <qubits> Is ti possible to disable sms and calls and bluetooth on grapheneos
22:17:33 <alex-resist> qubits: airplane mode is not sufficient?
22:18:22 <qubits> No i really want to disable it. i want to install it for my employes , they only will be using some work apps nothing more
22:19:31 <alex-resist> qubits: no idea, perhaps that is not possible. Although personally I'd also like to have a GrapheneOS image without modem firmware (i.e. some form of "hard airplane mode")
22:21:50 <TheJollyRoger> For my old device that I now use as an mp3 player I just set it into Airplane Mode and hid the tile.
22:22:46 <strcat[m]> device manager
22:22:47 <strcat[m]> fully supported on GrapheneOS
22:23:05 <r0tt0r[m]> <setupKM "the update was finished then I p"> did you reboot after update once or directly went to fastboot?
22:24:00 <qubits> Is there perhaps any developer that could adjust these settings for me
22:24:05 <alex-resist> r0tt0r setupKM is now waren
22:24:12 <qubits> Of course he will be paid for his services
22:25:03 <r0tt0r[m]> <qubits "Of course he will be paid for hi"> as strcat said, device manager works like kind of policies for device settings
22:25:57 <alex-resist> Is there any starting point on how to use the device manager? I know literally nothing about it
22:27:07 <qubits> I prefer costum development then a third party application on wich i will depend
22:27:29 <strcat[m]> qubits: you need to use a device manager
22:27:40 <strcat[m]> we're not going to maintain a custom variant of the OS for 1 specific person
22:27:41 <alex-resist> This? https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin?hl=en
22:28:23 <strcat[m]> do you have $120k / year to pay a full time developer to develop changes to the OS and maintain releases for you, including securing local build infrastructure, signing keys, a releases server, an attestation server, etc?
22:28:38 <strcat[m]> use a device manager, that's the supported API to do it
22:28:50 <strcat[m]> we could potentially make a GrapheneOS device manager that's open source and meets our standards
22:28:55 <strcat[m]> but for now, you need to use an existing one
22:29:27 <strcat[m]> maintaining an alternate version of the OS is not a one time thing and is not really a good idea
22:34:25 <qubits> Okay it would be nice if there is some mdm solution specific for grapheneos to manage these settings remote
22:41:35 <jpds> qubits: Couldn't you just use graphene phones without sim cards?
22:42:11 <qubits> strcat 120K sounds interesting, i would like to know more specific details about it
22:42:59 <qubits> What will i exacly get in the package
22:44:18 <strcat[m]> whatever the developer you hire has time to do? shrug
22:46:07 <qubits> Actually i would need only one time single version with my requirments
22:46:58 <jpds> You won't, as there's always security fixes and new features to integrate
22:48:57 <qubits> I will not use new features only security fixes that can match existing version. It could be developed on that way, that i still can use the security fixes
22:50:51 <qubits> Or actually some grapheneos mdm solution would be enough for me.
22:51:32 <r0tt0r[m]> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin
22:51:52 <qubits> If there si any developer that is interested we can discus it
22:55:52 <qubits> r00t0r thats exacly that i need
22:59:03 <qubits> that is a lot cheaper solution :)
23:01:02 <mrxx_0[m]> <qubits "Hi everyone i need asistance wit"> What was that about ?
23:01:47 <dazinism> alex-resist: you could have a look at mobile data usage in the settings to see if any data was used via a SIM. Guess could of had a SIM in the phone but mobile data disabled
23:02:37 <qubits> mrxx i still need some simple guideness
23:03:44 <mrxx_0[m]> <qubits "mrxx i still need some simple gu"> About loading GrapheneOS ?
23:04:19 <Dylanger[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "https://developer.android.com/gu"> afaik Google have moved a lot of the MDM stuff into GMS

23:05:04 <mrxx_0[m]> qubits official instructions are here : https://grapheneos.org/install
23:05:19 <dazinism> The other network related logs are related to device manager stuff. Don't distinguish between connections on WiFi or SIM though.
23:05:21 <dazinism> https://developer.android.com/work/dpc/logging
23:05:26 <mrxx_0[m]> Follow each step, it's a piece of cake
23:06:31 <steppingonyou[m]> theres a lot more to it than that
23:06:46 <steppingonyou[m]> mdm has a lot of components
23:06:53 <steppingonyou[m]> its not a piece of cake
23:07:30 <steppingonyou[m]> its a macaroon made over a camp
23:07:32 <steppingonyou[m]>  fire
23:07:43 <steppingonyou[m]> with plastic forks
23:07:57 <louipc> ouch
23:08:08 <steppingonyou[m]> its hard to get right
23:08:11 <steppingonyou[m]> ie
23:19:51 <Dylanger[m]> <dazinism "https://developer.android.com/wo"> Do these APIs even exist in AOSP?
23:21:57 <steppingonyou[m]> yes
23:22:56 <Dylanger[m]> https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/services/devicepolicy/java/com/android/server/devicepolicy/DevicePolicyManagerService.java;l=14635?q=setNetworkLoggingEnabled&ss=android%2Fplatform%2Fsuperproject
23:22:57 <Dylanger[m]> huh it is too
23:23:38 <r0tt0r[m]> <dazinism "alex-resist: you could have a lo"> i thought whwn no sim card was ever inserted excwpt in last 4 weeks certain system apps will create data/cache which they wouldnt when no sim was ever in
23:23:52 <r0tt0r[m]> * i thought when no sim card was ever inserted excwpt in last 4 weeks certain system apps will create data/cache which they wouldnt when no sim was ever in
23:26:28 <dazinism> Dylanger: think all these are?
23:26:28 <dazinism> https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager
23:27:01 <Dylanger[m]> That's surprising, I remember reading somewhere Google was moving all of that into GMS
23:28:00 <dazinism> I could be wrong. But eg. the user profile logout function comes from there, so imagine stuff is built into aosp
23:28:33 <dazinism> *is mentioned there
23:29:57 <Dylanger[m]> imo Google are going to start clawing this stuff into GMS
23:31:02 <dazinism> Dylanger: theres also security logs
23:31:05 <dazinism> https://developer.android.com/work/dpc/security?hl=ru#monitor_enterprise_process_logs_and_remote_bug_reports
23:46:12 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: they aren't
23:46:29 <strcat[m]> GMS is for Google services, this isn't, it's what the Google device manager uses to implement their device manager
23:46:37 <strcat[m]> and there are a lot of other device managers
23:47:28 <strcat[m]> give an example of something they have moved to Play services
23:48:41 <Dylanger[m]> * imo Google are going to start clawing this stuff into a closed source blob/lib
23:53:19 <madaidan[m]> Is it feasible to compile the GrapheneOS kernel on the phone itself? Since the kernel is a minimal build, it shouldn't take too long to compile. If so, could this be implemented as part of the update process as to give each user unique kernel symbols?
23:58:44 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it would take too long due to LTO and the devices don't have enough memory for it really
23:58:52 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: the kernel takes ~36GB to link or whatever
23:59:11 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: and it makes it harder to have mitigations for keeping stuff read-only since it has to only apply after it's done
23:59:18 <strcat[m]> it's harder to do proper verified boot
