00:00:15 <r0tt0r[m]> like fe. i have to use whatsapp due friends group but i only want whatsapp connecting through running vpn. in case i stop the vpn whatsapp would connect directly through wifi
00:00:43 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: covered by https://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support
00:01:04 <strcat[m]> enable always-on VPN + block connections not going through the VPN
00:01:21 <strcat[m]> and then use the VPN's own configuration to have certain apps bypass it that you want to bypass it
00:01:49 <r0tt0r[m]> ye thats what im doing currently
00:01:51 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> strcat: With all respect, that you don't want to share anything about your personal life.
00:01:51 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> May I ask what kind of education you got? Are you autodidact in all this knowledge about IT-security or have you read something like Computer Science?
00:02:06 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: but, as explained above, you are likely going to have leaks if you try to do this kind of thing
00:02:11 <strcat[m]> instead of having a VPN for the profile as a whole
00:02:29 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: I do not recommend using a VPN on a case-by-case basis, the recommendation is to use it for the whole profile
00:02:53 <Remu[m]> <strcat[m] "and then use the VPN's own confi"> For some reason, it does not do that on vpn like mullvad, when block connections not going through the vpn (aka split tunneling), which is a good way to block direct network access (but is redundant when you can just deny network permission)
00:02:53 <strcat[m]> otherwise you're responsible for reviewing code, manifests, etc. and making sure you aren't opening up leaks
00:03:38 <strcat[m]> for example if you permit DownloadManager to bypass the VPN, then of course apps with INTERNET can bypass the VPN via DownloadManager
00:03:58 <strcat[m]> but the same thing applies to third party apps providing APIs to other apps that they can use for internet access

06:58:02 <Reimu[m]> <adeus[m] "Which camera app people are reco"> None
06:58:41 <TheJollyRoger> adeus[m]: you can try OpenCamera if you like. If you have Pixel Visual Core, turn on the Camera2 API, it will give you very good results compared to software-only HDR.
07:00:07 <TheJollyRoger> The software-only HDR often has its colours come out oversaturated and sometimes its lines are a little bit blurry. This often doesn't look so bad when you're viewing it on a tiny 6" screen, but it will make a big difference when you view it on a large monitor later.
07:03:29 <Reimu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "adeus: you can try OpenCamera if"> It has not been updated for months, and still uses legacy storage access. It works and is enough for what it can do, but it's far cry from being recommended (at least on android 11 privacy/security standards)
07:04:32 <Reimu[m]> Maybe give it a year and some good alternatives to gcam will appear with updated APIs, gcam is still not a good choice due to needing a debug apk for it to work, along with it exposing an unnecessary attack surface
07:05:43 <Reimu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The software-only HDR often has "> For camera quality, I agree.
07:06:13 <TheJollyRoger> Reimu[m]: ah, crud, so I see. >_<.

15:39:57 <Reimu[m]> Still up to the user discretion whether to use that link or not, as the original gcam works anyways with gcamprovider debug apk

16:08:37 <alzxjm[m]> I really like taking great photos, so I use Google Camera most days.
16:09:32 <Reimu[m]> No problem with it, better off knowing the tradeoff and risks

20:32:21 <TheJollyRoger> ultracard[m]: oh yeah. You asked about the Titan security chip a bit back, did you? I've got a bit of a moment now to discuss it.
20:34:35 <TheJollyRoger> Indeed, the Titan chip can bolster the security of a short pincode, if you decide to set a short pin code, by enforcing a timeout between attempts at guessing the pincode. After 50 attempts, the Titan will start doubling the timeout to a maximum of 1 day at 150 attempts (which will take roughly 2 weeks) so to completely exhaust the keyspace of a 4-digit pincode will take roughly 650 years. If
20:34:36 <TheJollyRoger> you choose to make a longer passphrase, GrapheneOS will also allow that.
20:39:52 <TheJollyRoger> It does many other things, not just disk encryption, but this is one of the big draws.
20:40:25 <TheJollyRoger> Google realized that not many people will enter EFF diceware passphrases onto their phones, this is their way of protecting users who have an expectation of security on their phones with a 4-digit unlock code.
21:00:59 <renex> about vanadium, is there a way to have it delete cookies and other info like that when one quits the app?
21:01:20 <TheJollyRoger> You can launch in Incognito, that's probably the easiest way to do it.
21:02:22 <renex> no quit (and delete cookies) option like firefox has?
21:03:19 <TheJollyRoger> I don't see one.
21:04:07 <TheJollyRoger> There is a context menu for Vanadium though, you can simply  choose "Launch Incognito" every time and get into that habit.
21:04:28 <TheJollyRoger> **There is a tap-and-hold context menu
21:05:18 <TheJollyRoger> You can definitely submit the option in as a pull request to the Vanadium patch set though, if you can patch it in.
21:06:44 <renex> sorry, haven't done any coding for android, it would likely take quite a while
21:08:58 <TheJollyRoger> Neither have I, I'd like to someday though!
21:10:54 <TheJollyRoger> One thing to aspire to!
21:11:05 <strcat[m]> Reimu: a modded Google Camera won't have a valid signature matching the SELinux profile so it won't be able to access the DSP and Visual/Neural Core
21:11:19 <strcat[m]> so it would be software only
21:12:56 <renex> another question about vanadium, how does one keep it up to date?
21:14:22 <strcat[m]> updating the OS
21:16:07 <renex> ah, so it's bundled into the OS
21:32:06 <strcat[m]> renex: anything that comes with the OS is updated with the OS
21:32:40 <strcat[m]> it is possible to install out-of-band updates to certain apps
21:33:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I go and load Auditor whenever precompiled builds are available.
21:33:38 <TheJollyRoger> Since they're already installed into the OS and their certificates are pinned they're going to be verified when I load them.
21:33:45 <strcat[m]> the OS consists largely of apps and APEX components
21:33:49 <strcat[m]> both of which support out-of-band updates
21:34:13 <strcat[m]> we disable out-of-band APEX updates since they have the same release cycle as the OS and it makes no sense to use them for GrapheneOS (or any sane OS, really)
21:34:31 <strcat[m]> don't really accomplish anything for the stock OS on Pixels
21:34:43 <strcat[m]> they exist for devices not receiving proper updates
21:35:06 <strcat[m]> same applies to a lot of the app components, although for the stock OS they bundle a lot of apps with their own release cycles
21:35:13 <strcat[m]> we don't
21:36:01 <strcat[m]> there are 3 apps where out-of-band updates make sense for GrapheneOS: Auditor, PDF Viewer, Vanadium
21:36:14 <strcat[m]> so those apps are signed with their own keys used for the out-of-band releases too
