00:00:35 <secretsecrets[m]> strcat: So until they add that to protonmail I can't receive notifs?
00:00:36 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: have you been using GrapheneOS since before it was called GrapheneOS, i.e. Android Hardening? before the only stable Android Hardening release
00:00:56 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: they don't have an implementation of push notifications other than pushing them via Google's cloud service
00:01:00 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't have Play services
00:01:09 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: it would take a developer a day to implement this
00:01:25 <strcat[m]> most email clients are bad
00:01:26 <bbqcore[m]> strcat: yes
00:01:51 <secretsecrets[m]> strcat: R.I.P notifs
00:01:56 <bbqcore[m]> Ok I see now
00:02:09 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: use a different email client to access it via IMAP assuming it lets you do that
00:02:26 <modp2[m]> Are these any known issues with Bluetooth in the last release? My earphones stopped working since last update
00:02:55 <strcat[m]> secretsecrets: for example FairEmail supports IMAP IDLE (push) so if the provider supports IMAP IDLE it will provide efficient push notifications
00:02:57 <strcat[m]> without needing FCM
00:03:29 <bbqcore[m]> strcat: will restoring via seedvault back up help in this case?
00:03:48 <secretsecrets[m]> strcat: I'll try it out
00:04:08 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: you can reject the factory reset until it rolls back to the previous OS version if you haven't already
00:04:21 <bbqcore[m]> yes I have
00:04:32 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: you will have to accept wiping in order to actually upgrade because we couldn't keep support for the legacy filesystem format from pre-Android Hardening stable release
00:04:49 <strcat[m]> we tried to port it but the code has been totally overhauled and we just couldn't get it working without a huge effort
00:05:20 <strcat[m]> so I assume it's a Pixel 2 with GrapheneOS since the early Android Hardening snapshots
00:05:20 <bbqcore[m]> so can I restore my install with Seedvault?
00:05:24 <bbqcore[m]> or do I have to start fresh
00:05:32 <bbqcore[m]> no Pixel 3
00:05:52 <strcat[m]> ah right forget we supported Pixel 3 then
00:06:12 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: you can restore your app data / OS settings with Seedvault
00:06:20 <strcat[m]> note Seedvault doesn't back up your home directory
00:06:24 <strcat[m]> and currently only backs up the main profile
00:06:40 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: and some apps disable backups, such as Signal, which provides an encrypted backup implementation itself
00:07:07 <strcat[m]> bbqcore: Seedvault will get a lot but many apps disable backups for some reason *shrug*
00:07:13 <strcat[m]> I know it's hassle
00:07:18 <strcat[m]>  * I know it's a hassle
00:07:46 <strcat[m]> they pretty much totally rewrote the fscrypt userspace code and it wasn't clear how to do the compatibility workaround we were doing before
00:07:55 <strcat[m]> the issue is we switched to 32 byte padding for file names early on
00:08:22 <strcat[m]> we came up with a way to fall back to the old padding length if 32 didn't match the settings
00:08:29 <strcat[m]> just really unclear how to fit that back into it
00:08:53 <strcat[m]> they have a proper versioning system now but this predated that - so it has the same versioning regardless of this
00:09:04 <strcat[m]> (versioning was just introduced in Android 11)
00:11:22 <bbqcore[m]> PITA
00:11:28 <bbqcore[m]> really puts me off upgrading
00:14:42 <strcat[m]> well it dates back to it being a pre-release before the Android Hardening initial stable release
00:15:05 <strcat[m]> we didn't have everything we needed ready in those snapshots
00:15:31 <strcat[m]> the 1st tagged release (the Android Hardening release listed on the site) has the 32 byte padding change
00:15:51 <strcat[m]> so it would have had to be a snapshot from before that
00:15:59 <signalarch[m]> If in my bootloader the Device state says locked does that mean I have a carrier locked device?
00:16:04 <strcat[m]> no
00:16:20 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install
00:16:45 <strcat[m]> part of installing is unlocking, and then after flashing you lock it again for security (very important since it's what enables verified boot and various other hardware security features)
00:17:40 <signalarch[m]> Okay. I cant get it unlocked so I was just wondering
00:18:19 <strcat[m]> signalarch: did you enable OEM unlocking in the OS/
00:18:22 <strcat[m]> you need to do that 1st
00:18:33 <strcat[m]>  * signalarch: did you enable OEM unlocking in the OS?
00:19:31 <signalarch[m]> Yeah and usb debug
00:21:19 <aeonsolution[m]> signalarch: i can help you with this, assuming you did unlock OEM, go back to the install page, and find the fastboot command for unlocking the bootloader
00:21:39 <strcat[m]> signalarch: if you were able to toggle on OEM unlocking in the OS
00:21:42 <strcat[m]> then it's unlockable
00:21:54 <aeonsolution[m]> ^
00:22:12 <strcat[m]> Verizon devices simply have a carrier id flashed onto them which the OS reads and then disables the OEM unlocking toggle in the OS
00:22:20 <strcat[m]> there aren't really differences beyond that
00:22:32 <strcat[m]> just a carrier id value which changes a few behaviors like that
00:23:16 <strcat[m]> a Verizon Pixel still has the same unlocking system at a firmware/hardware level
00:23:29 <strcat[m]> the GUI for toggling it is just disabled - that's it
00:25:56 <signalarch[m]> I have oem unlock on. Fasboot flashing unlock does nothing when im in the bootloader
00:26:22 <strcat[m]> signalarch: sounds like an issue with your fastboot install / OS / usb cable
00:26:24 <strcat[m]> your phone is fine
00:26:35 <strcat[m]> signalarch: run 'fastboot devices' to see if the device is detected
00:26:44 <strcat[m]> or another fastboot command like `fastboot getvar all`
00:26:53 <strcat[m]>  * signalarch: run `fastboot devices` to see if the device is detected
00:30:23 <signalarch[m]> Fastboot devices gives no permission (user in plugdev roup ....
00:30:40 <signalarch[m]> Ive tried some things to fix ot but nothing works
00:30:54 <aeonsolution[m]> what os are you using
00:31:12 <signalarch[m]> Ubuntu 20.04
00:31:17 <aeonsolution[m]> mavic321: were you able to flash GrapheneOS afterall?
00:31:36 <aeonsolution[m]> signalarch: add the `sudo` command before fastboot
00:32:33 <signalarch[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "signalarch: add the `sudo` comma"> That gives ?????? Fastboot
00:33:03 <aeonsolution[m]> its a permissions issue on Ubuntu since it doesn't have android-udev tools
00:33:14 <aeonsolution[m]> dont even worry about not understanding that
00:34:41 <signalarch[m]> So what can I do to get around it
00:34:56 <aeonsolution[m]> setup udev rules https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules
00:36:04 <aeonsolution[m]> on Ubuntu just run `sudo fastboot flashing unlock`
00:36:45 <aeonsolution[m]> if you want to setup udev rules, you will have to figure that out independently, outside of the scope here
00:40:54 <signalarch[m]> The command didn't work but I followed the link and that did. Thanks!
00:53:50 <signalarch[m]> Just to clarify, even if I lock the bootloader after graphene instalation, it should still warn about loading an alternate OS?
00:55:48 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
00:59:00 <hypergenesis[m]> Hi, will GrapheneOS support Pixel 5?
01:01:08 <alzxjm[m]1> hypergenesis: only if someone volunteers to be a device maintainer for the P5
01:01:09 <aeonsolution[m]> hypergenesis: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
01:01:22 <hypergenesis[m]> Thanks
01:02:48 <aeonsolution[m]> hypergenesis: consider donating https://grapheneos.org/donate to support the project's longevity
01:19:54 <ruddo[m]> Just wondering if there is a way to change the boot warning to nothing except if someone tampers with your phone.  It's annoying to see onscreen, delays boot for no reason, and I remember when I was at google that the design doc had good intentions but it was clear that the idea was to warn people not to use non-Google OSes.
01:21:37 <ruddo[m]> <webb[m] "Is anyone else dealing with bad "> This happened to me after boot into Android 11 and mang it was HORRIBLE.  But it seems to have normalized now.  Back to usual.
01:24:03 <aeonsolution[m]> <ruddo[m] "Just wondering if there is a way"> im pretty sure its flashed onto the SOC
01:24:30 <aeonsolution[m]> let me see if i can find the info on the log
01:40:15 <aeonsolution[m]> ruddo: ran out of time, but i sure the info is somewhere there in the logs if you are interested in finding it
01:40:19 <aeonsolution[m]> no more than a month ago

19:59:06 <alzxjm[m]1> allahswt: It will likely have superior performance as it is a flagship phone. Cold launches of apps might take a bit longer on the 3a due to exec spawning.
19:59:39 <alzxjm[m]1> It does not have the Pixel Visual Core so you won't have access to HDR+ with apps such as Open Camera.
19:59:41 <alzxjm[m]1> (that is, the 3a does not have PVC)
20:02:00 <allahswt_> hey sorry i think i hit something by accident
20:02:57 <allahswt_> so theres no downside to pixel 3 other than slightly worse battery life?
20:06:18 <strcat[m]> allahswt_: I don't think the battery life on a Pixel 3 is necessarily worse
20:06:31 <strcat[m]> our current recommendation is a Pixel 4 anyway
20:06:43 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
20:06:49 <strcat[m]> > The recommended devices with the best hardware, firmware and software security along with the longest future support time are the Pixel 4 and 4 XL. Once it's supported, the Pixel 4a will also be recommended.
20:07:13 <anupritaisno1[m4> Pixel 4 has had the best battery for me
20:07:17 <allahswt_> pixel 3's are on sale at my local store right now for real cheap
20:07:39 <strcat[m]> just keep in mind you'll want to replace it before EOL
20:07:58 <allahswt_> eol?
20:08:24 <strcat[m]> just keep in mind you'll want to replace it when it's end-of-life
20:08:49 <allahswt_> like when graphene stops updating it right?
20:23:05 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "our current recommendation is a "> are there things that make the pixel 4 more secure then the pixel 3?
20:24:16 <strcat[m]> yes
20:25:01 <blacklight447[m]> Such as? (Being curious here)
20:26:35 <blacklight447[m]> strcat
20:27:02 <strcat[m]> more kernel hardening
20:27:18 <strcat[m]> newer SoC with stronger security
20:27:19 <anupritaisno1[m4> Really?
20:27:31 <anupritaisno1[m4> (Haven't checked other devices)
20:28:14 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "more kernel hardening"> Because the kernel is more recent, i assume?
20:28:28 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: no, not really
20:28:39 <strcat[m]> because they implemented additional hardening
20:28:42 <anupritaisno1[m4> blacklight447: off the top of my head memory initialization stuff is a plus
20:28:59 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: that's there for older devices in GrapheneOS
20:29:01 <anupritaisno1[m4> We literally have same memory initialization stuff as mainline rn
20:29:03 <blacklight447[m]> Im currently hoping to rock my 3a till the pixel 6 comes out with ( hopefully ) MTE
20:30:43 <blacklight447[m]> To which im also hoping it will have a fingerprint scanner again, im not a fan of facial biometrics
20:38:24 <ham5urg> Can I activate the video-out of the Pixel4? Google deactivated it by removing the kernel driver but can GrapheneOS reactivate it?
20:41:42 <blacklight447[m]> <ham5urg "Can I activate the video-out of "> Too my knowledge, they don't even have the hardware capable of sending hdmi out
20:41:54 <blacklight447[m]> The whole port doesn't support it
20:42:40 <ham5urg> blacklight447[m] - https://www.slashgear.com/pixel-4-usb-c-video-output-exists-but-is-disabled-in-source-code-03598259/
20:42:58 <ham5urg> Is this site wrong?
20:44:12 <strcat[m]> ham5urg: enabling the kernel support doesn't mean it's going to magically do something if there isn't support for it elsewhere
20:44:48 <strcat[m]> there is SoC support, that doesn't mean there is hardware support for it or that there is software support outside the kernel
20:44:59 <strcat[m]> you're free to work on it
20:45:05 <ham5urg> I see, I was just hoping for it...
20:45:35 <strcat[m]> we work on privacy and security features, we're not going to be exploring extra hardware capabilities that could be enabled, if you're interested in working on that you're welcome to
20:45:58 <anupritaisno1[m4> ham5urg: remind me in 2 months
20:45:58 <strcat[m]> it's unlikely that it can be simply toggled on and we're not going to add code for it, but who knows, someone would have to look into it
20:46:22 <anupritaisno1[m4> I'll take a look for a while when I'm doing the forced 90hz patches for my personal use
20:47:00 <strcat[m]> also we do not have a 'desktop mode', we don't have a free form window mode launcher or anything like that
20:47:20 <ham5urg> I will come back with this in some weeks.
20:47:21 <strcat[m]> it's not something supported out-of-the-box in AOSP
20:47:36 <ham5urg> Maybe I can get more informations about it.
20:48:01 <ham5urg> I know, GOS does not need this video-out, but it would be a nice to have for the users.
20:49:20 <anupritaisno1[m4> ham5urg
20:49:28 <anupritaisno1[m4> Please take this to offtopic chat
20:49:34 <ham5urg> Yes
20:52:41 <alzxjm[m]1> anupritaisno1: Yeah did you fix this for Pixel 4 XL? Screen no longer flickers on A11!
20:53:14 <anupritaisno1[m4> <alzxjm[m]1 "anupritaisno1: Yeah did you fix "> Google fixed a lot of stuff
20:53:31 <anupritaisno1[m4> My screen doesn't have this weird green gradient on R anymore
20:54:13 <alzxjm[m]1> Yeah. Mine gets a bit greenish at low brightness but the flickering that was there at low brightness is now gone. Mild green tint is way better than flickering.
21:01:42 <mrxx_0[m]> <strcat[m] "also we do not have a 'desktop m"> What's the "free form window mode launcher" ?
21:04:40 <DerpiKarpfen> Was the media player changed recently?
21:15:00 <strcat[m]> DerpiKarpfen: what specifically are you asking about
21:16:44 <DerpiKarpfen> Well you know when you minimize, for example, vlc and you have a song playing, you get a the media player next to your notifications. I was wondering whether it was changed. It seems less persistant and disappears a lot
21:17:13 <DerpiKarpfen> Also its completly broken with newpipe, not displaying the forward backward pause or any other button
21:19:19 <boys_I_have_a_bi> https://twitter.com/CopperheadOS/status/1309575210417508352
21:19:33 <boys_I_have_a_bi> We lost boys :(  it's over... "Pixel 4a (sunfish) booting on CopperheadOS. "
21:19:46 <boys_I_have_a_bi> *loads my gun* it was nice knowing u guys :(
21:21:05 <boys_I_have_a_bi> BREAKING NEWS: Virgin dead in basement with message written in blood on the walls: android code sync took too long...
21:22:40 <boys_I_have_a_bi> anupritaisno1[m4 I have a pixel 4a :]
21:22:45 <boys_I_have_a_bi> Sorry I meant to PM
21:23:03 <jpds> DerpiKarpfen: Interestingly, newpipe isn't in the new "media control" section
21:25:01 <DerpiKarpfen> Also I get a message just containing "null" whenever I click on any text field and my keyboard opens up, be it aosp keyboard or anysoftkeyboard
21:25:31 <boys_I_have_a_bi> DerpiKarpfen Dude I am getting that on a stock (aka Google) rom for android 11 pixel 4a
21:25:45 <DerpiKarpfen> Damn
21:26:03 <louipc> whats over
21:26:10 <boys_I_have_a_bi> Definitely sounds like an upstream issue 100%.
21:26:56 <boys_I_have_a_bi> louipc oh, I was just joking that GrapheneOS is done for cause copperheados booted 4a before us. But, just a joke :P
21:27:00 <DerpiKarpfen> the media control panel being busted and the null message are quite annoying and hindering my main uses for my phone
21:27:37 <boys_I_have_a_bi> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/69916905?hl=en
21:27:44 <boys_I_have_a_bi> HAS TO DO WITH AUTOFILL KEYBOARDS
21:27:58 <DerpiKarpfen> HECK
21:27:58 <boys_I_have_a_bi> I am using Firefox lockwise, maybe you are too?
21:28:03 <DerpiKarpfen> I use lockwise
21:28:12 <boys_I_have_a_bi> Damn hahahah so it's a lockwise issue
21:28:18 <DerpiKarpfen> Fuck
21:28:27 <DerpiKarpfen> I don't wanna get rid of lockwise
21:28:36 <boys_I_have_a_bi> Wait, looks like it's for all autofills: Just to add on, this issue affects all autofill password managers in Android 11.  You don't need to actually uninstall the app, you only need to deselect the app as your phones autofill service in settings.
21:28:44 <louipc> hmm i see
21:29:05 <DerpiKarpfen> What about the media control panel though?
21:29:23 <boys_I_have_a_bi> Can't help with that, sorry >.>
21:29:38 <DerpiKarpfen> Damn
21:29:54 <DerpiKarpfen> But yeah, disabling lockwise fixed the null message
21:30:28 <boys_I_have_a_bi> Nice, thanks for testing.
21:37:37 <strcat[m]> there are already people who built GrapheneOS for the Pixel 4a, there's nothing worth noting about that
21:38:06 <strcat[m]> we only post official announcements on the GrapheneOS Twitter account
21:38:50 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "there are already people who bui"> Yeah, having something boot locked isnt that big of an achievement
21:39:01 <blacklight447[m]> It can be completely broken in every other aspect
21:39:07 <strcat[m]> if you look at the sources you can see we have source-level Pixel 4a support in-progress
21:39:28 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: well it works fine... but it doesn't have the device-specific hardening ported and is using the stock kernel
21:39:34 <strcat[m]> the standard AOSP / stock kernel
21:39:45 <DerpiKarpfen> Also I found the bug on the newpipe github, a fix was merged 3 days ago https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/4031
21:39:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1 is working on getting the kernel port done
21:39:55 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "if you look at the sources you c"> The fact that i can read your code and not copperhead makes me trust you
21:40:02 <strcat[m]> DerpiKarpfen: yes, we're aware NewPipe didn't do their Android 11 port properly
21:40:13 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: they're just using the work AOSP alliance did anyway, they didn't do that work, they crib off us
21:40:23 <strcat[m]> they take credit for my work and others work since the beginning
21:40:23 <blacklight447[m]>  Have always worked like an open book, while copperhead plays a dirty game of hide and seek with their code
21:40:26 <DerpiKarpfen> Thats nice to know
21:40:28 <strcat[m]> including CalyxOS
21:40:51 <strcat[m]> they have contributed nothing to any of the projects they're cribbing off
21:41:02 <strcat[m]> and they go out of their way to cause as much harm as they can to the people they take the code from
21:41:29 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: you can simply build AOSP for it with android-prepare-vendor, and they didn't play any role in doing that
21:42:06 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: since Copperhead doesn't develop privacy/security hardening but rather just makes branded builds of AOSP with my legacy changes and a fork of my Updater with tracking/DRM, what would they even do?
21:42:10 <strcat[m]> they are just using others work
21:42:30 <strcat[m]> anyone can boot AOSP + android-prepare-vendor with a custom boot animation and wallpaper
21:43:01 <strcat[m]> AOSP Alliance (i.e. CalyxOS, dan-v, us) did the work
21:44:02 <strcat[m]> DerpiKarpfen: I think the issue is NewPipe started targeting API 30+ before finishing porting to it
21:44:11 <louipc> blacklight447[m]:i think u can read their code if u sign the NDA or something
21:44:22 <strcat[m]> if they approve you to see it
21:44:26 <louipc> would be nice to compare the 2 codebases
21:44:30 <strcat[m]> and if that's really the code they use
21:44:41 <strcat[m]> louipc: it's just a poorly done fork of my legacy code
21:44:56 <strcat[m]> and they take bug fixes and our android-prepare-vendor support work, etc.
21:45:05 <louipc> isnt there some gpl requirements there?
21:45:15 <louipc> if you purchase
21:45:19 <strcat[m]> they don't follow the licensing for my legacy code
21:45:31 <strcat[m]> we're filing a lawsuit against them
21:45:46 <louipc> ok
21:46:21 <strcat[m]> louipc: the kernel is GPL
21:46:34 <louipc> guess a motivated customer could persue them too
21:46:45 <louipc> kinda rare tho
21:46:48 <strcat[m]> my changes to other repositories that they forked were under a non-commercial usage license in the code they forked
21:47:14 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is permissively licensed but there is a caveat for them, their license violations invalidate their ability to use my future code under certain licenses like the GPL too
21:50:29 <strcat[m]> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html
21:50:36 <strcat[m]> see section 4
21:50:46 <strcat[m]> > 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in

21:51:10 <strcat[m]> if you violate GPLv2, your license is terminated and has to be explicitly restored
21:51:39 <louipc> ouch
21:53:33 <strcat[m]> anyway not much we can do about apps that implemented broken Android 11 support and enabled it
21:53:48 <strcat[m]> rather than waiting until Android 11 was actually released and getting it stable first
21:57:04 <strcat[m]> similarly not much we can do about F-Droid using v1 signatures even for API 30+ apps where it's disallowed, and then not rebuilding them with v2 signatures promptly
21:57:21 <strcat[m]> this is getting fixed when apps are updated since they aren't using v1 signatures anymore but they aren't rebuilding all the broken apps
21:58:10 <strcat[m]> it's pretty apparent that they don't care much about users having the apps disabled and their data inaccessible - we may have to start strongly recommending against F-Droid due to problems like this and lack of interest from upstream in addressing it
21:58:31 <strcat[m]> 4 years to adopt a security fix, which they've finally adopted only once it became mandatory
21:59:00 <strcat[m]> totally unnecessary little disaster they created for users on Android 11 (not specific in any way to GrapheneOS, the problem is F-Droid's broken app builds)
21:59:27 <strcat[m]> also, those apps from either the developer themselves or the Play Store work fine - it is not a problem with the apps themselves, just F-Droid's broken builds of them
22:00:32 <louipc> yea its been a bit too long for fdroid to get its act together
22:02:24 <strcat[m]> they made a list of apps with v1 signatures and API 30
22:02:34 <strcat[m]> they could have just triggered rebuilds of all of them ASAP to fix the problem
22:02:35 <strcat[m]> they didn't
22:02:50 <strcat[m]> instead they're requiring app developers to request a rebuild - doesn't make much sense
22:03:04 <strcat[m]> so, until the app developers ask F-Droid to rebuild it or make a new release, it will be broken
22:03:23 <strcat[m]> it would be nice if the people working on F-Droid actually used F-Droid on an up-to-date device
22:03:30 <louipc> why not just use the builds from the devs themselves tho.. thats the question
22:04:00 <strcat[m]> right now, F-Droid fills a gap but it's not going to be a long-term solution
22:04:43 <strcat[m]> at the very least it needs a fork by a project with a focus on usability, robustness and security
22:04:51 <strcat[m]> more likely, making something better and simpler
22:05:00 <strcat[m]> instead of starting from a legacy codebase
22:07:58 <jpds> They're 10 years old today
22:28:41 <Erraverunt> Nice to know the info about newpipe bug, so propably same thing happening with vinyl because I have the same problem with that also
23:10:42 <steveie55[m]> Hi everyone. Ever since my phone updated to the latest stable Android 11 release, I've been having delayed SMS notifications. I've tested to send myself an SMS from another phone, it says delivered but my phone doesn't notify me. After a random amount of time, I receive a notification but when I check the message details, it does say the correct time it got on my phone, not the notification time. So that means it
23:10:42 <steveie55[m]> does get to my phone. I've searched online a lot but mostly suggest battery optimization to which I've tried the messages app is a system app and so I can't modify its battery optimization settings. I don't have such an issue with Signal for example. Sorry that's long but I wanted to include as much details as I could.
23:23:00 <strcat[m]> battery optimization wouldn't be relevant
23:23:22 <strcat[m]> steveie55: do you receive the message immediately and only the notifications are sometimes late?
23:25:31 <steveie55[m]> <strcat[m] "steveie55: do you receive the me"> Yes, exactly that. Also, if I happen to unlock my phone, I'll get all notifications without having to wait a random time. Note: unlock, not just wake the phone
