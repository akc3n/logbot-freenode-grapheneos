00:00:01 <strcat[m]> too bad it's not useful
00:01:14 <nscnt> Sadly it is a major inconvencience for some people. Elderly people may have problems breathing even without a mask (that's why they often pull it under the nose) and if you've bad asthma, you should definitely not wear one.
00:01:21 <strcat[m]> that's not true
00:01:37 <strcat[m]> masks don't cause people to have problems breathing and there aren't any common conditions making wearing masks an issue
00:01:43 <strcat[m]> and they aren't a major inconvenience at all
00:02:18 <strcat[m]> coronavirus is a nice test of societies ability to cope with misinformation and people's willingness to not act selfishly
00:02:29 <strcat[m]>  * coronavirus is a nice test of a society's ability to cope with misinformation and people's willingness to not act selfishly
00:02:47 <strcat[m]> in places where everyone just wore masks around others coronavirus is not a major issue
00:03:07 <strcat[m]> especially in places like hong kong and taiwan where it was taken seriously from early on and they made sure to have enough medical grade masks for everyone
00:03:15 <strcat[m]> and then since they had so much less spread
00:03:30 <strcat[m]> they were able to do really good investigation-based contact-tracing, etc.
00:03:34 <strcat[m]> to contain little outbreaks
00:03:56 <strcat[m]> the app doesn't really accomplish anything unless 90% of people use it and then they figure out how to do something meaningful with that
00:04:00 <neonfuz2> in asia it's completely common to wear a mask when you're sick
00:04:16 <strcat[m]> it's really important that both the sick person and non-sick people are wearing them
00:04:23 <neonfuz2> I'm pretty used to it because I used to snowboard with a bandana because it was very cold
00:04:30 <strcat[m]> lets say the sick person wearing a mask reduces spread by 80%
00:04:40 <strcat[m]> and uninfected people wearing it reduces spread chance by 50%
00:04:42 <strcat[m]> you combine those
00:04:43 <neonfuz2> just takes a little getting used to, it's not the most comfortable at first to have your breath all up in your face
00:05:01 <strcat[m]> it's really not a major inconvenience though
00:05:07 <neonfuz2> better than in other people's faces. Just from wearing a mask you should realize how much moisture your breath lets out
00:05:14 <neonfuz2> a bandana will get wet eventually
00:06:11 <strcat[m]> the contact tracing API made by apple/google has 1 purpose
00:06:32 <strcat[m]> it's a privacy preserving alternative to the invasive things governments wanted to do
00:06:44 <strcat[m]> and it stopped that from becoming mandatory, etc.
00:06:52 <strcat[m]> but it is not useful beyond that
00:07:56 <strcat[m]> the main things are just that everyone (infected and non-infected) wears a mask, ideally medical grade ones (which required ramping up production and getting them to people like taiwan, etc.)
00:08:06 <strcat[m]> avoiding / reducing proximity to others
00:08:19 <strcat[m]> and especially indoors
00:08:22 <strcat[m]> and especially without masks
00:08:33 <strcat[m]> redcat: I just don't make up bullshit without being informed
00:08:36 <strcat[m]> like a lot of people here do
00:09:15 <strcat[m]> like living in an imaginary world where that exposure notification api works differently than it actually does
00:09:24 <strcat[m]> O
00:09:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> redcat: honestly it's better than what governments did
00:10:05 <strcat[m]> it implements a way of notifying people who came in proximity based on bluetooth signal strength in a privacy-preserving way (via encryption)
00:10:26 <strcat[m]> it's just that in order for that to be useful the studies that led to making this determined that 80%+ of people would need to use it
00:10:36 <strcat[m]> and it'd need to be fit into a really good contact tracing program
00:10:42 <strcat[m]> it's not a substitute for it
00:10:48 <strcat[m]> and once you have wide scale infections
00:10:50 <strcat[m]> it's not an option
00:11:25 <strcat[m]> it's only capable of being useful in places that already dealt with this properly or put in enormous effort to reach that point now that they fucked up
00:11:29 <strcat[m]> and even then
00:11:32 <strcat[m]> it's questionable
00:11:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just don't go outside guys
00:12:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't have a cause-effect study on using masks alone
00:12:33 <strcat[m]> contact tracing approach also requires people to respect quarantine
00:12:44 <strcat[m]> they get informed they are exposed and have to quarantine for 14+ days
00:12:52 <strcat[m]> do you think americans are going to do that when an app informs them they MAY have been exposed
00:13:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Many countries also had strict lockdowns and there's countries where people already used to keep their distance
00:13:11 <strcat[m]> and no it is not a way of informing people they need to wear a mask - everyone needs to wear a mask as the baseline
00:13:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "do you think americans are going"> Well 'murricans
00:14:20 <strcat[m]> redcat: it's not 'dystopian spyware'
00:14:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway masks...
00:14:27 <strcat[m]> but it's a Play Services feature and won't be on GrapheneOS
00:14:35 <strcat[m]> especially since it's a misguided idea
00:14:48 <strcat[m]> although it's not Apple or Google who thought it was useful
00:14:53 <travankor_> I wonder if contact tracing will go away post-Covid?
00:14:55 <strcat[m]> they implemented it because they were expected to do something
00:15:22 <strcat[m]> it doesn't give them any data
00:15:36 <strcat[m]> read the spec
00:15:46 <strcat[m]> or look at what it does
00:20:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> redcat: just roam around in a P100 mask
00:23:32 <renlord> p100 would be a plastic bag?
00:23:37 <renlord> :/
00:23:43 <neonfuz2> lol my family just removed a bunch of asbestos from our house so we have p100 masks
00:24:04 <renlord> filtering out 100% of air particulates is a plastic bag
00:24:55 <neonfuz2> > P100 respirators are effective at blocking 99.97 percent of oil-based particulates when properly worn
00:25:06 <renlord> what a misleading naming convention
00:25:14 <renlord> should be p99.97!
00:25:15 <neonfuz2> lol
00:28:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord "p100 would be a plastic bag?"> N95 means 95% efficiency and not resistant to oil, single shift usage
00:30:11 <renlord> why not just carry own air supply
00:30:39 <renlord> go out with a scuba tank
00:31:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord: how do you know I do that?
00:31:47 * renlord applauds anupritaisno1[m]
00:32:06 <renlord> you should be given a responsible citizen's award
00:34:14 <neonfuz2> this is some great graphene os discussion going on
00:34:31 <renlord> it is consistent with the project goals of achieving safety
00:35:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord: maybe we should just each migrate to an undiscovered island
00:35:53 <travankor_> renlord keeping it real
00:35:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> No corona going to be in that
00:36:02 <renlord> that'd be quite challenging in the age of satelite imaging
00:36:26 <neonfuz2> an underground undiscovered island
00:36:36 <renlord> atlantis?
00:36:41 <renlord> its underwater.
00:36:47 <renlord> just need more scuba tanks

01:07:31 <renlord> you need a good mask to protect yourself against contagion
01:08:04 <renlord> you just need a barrier to decrease the likelihood of your contagion
01:08:06 <mrmanpants[m]> true
01:08:26 <renlord> from a public health perspective, its good for everyone to just wear a barrier
01:08:45 <renlord> not sure why they dont explain it that way

01:09:14 <renlord> fkin retarded really
01:10:10 <mrmanpants[m]> welcome to people

01:32:01 <outsider[m]1> <renlord "if they did, the spin doctors pr"> relying on shitty cotton masks is more of a hazard than anything
01:32:39 <outsider[m]1> and believing that this is anything more than a power grab at this point would determine that you have an iq of 80 or lower
01:36:06 <renlord> outsider[m]1: i explained above.
01:36:38 <renlord> outsider[m]1: unsubstantiated conspiracies not welcome here
01:38:07 <mxnorvak[m]> <mrmanpants[m] "there was an article a month ago"> Yeah I'm not debating that i agree, everyone should wear a mask of some kind
01:39:23 <renlord> while not necessarily effective at protecting yourself against contagion, a cloth mask is effective at limiting your spread of contagion.
01:40:17 <renlord> sure, some people might think, "if it does not directly benefit me, i'm just not gonna do it".
01:40:58 <renlord> but spinning it as being a "hazard" is a lie and undermines public health initiatives.
01:41:01 <outsider[m]1> <renlord "while not necessarily effective "> but this is far from a contagion, just a gross usurpation of individual liberty. fear mongering with bad data and false attribution. that is not conspiracy, that is fact
01:41:37 <renlord> outsider[m]1: your insisuation of "fear mongering with bad data and false attribution" is a lie.
01:41:46 <outsider[m]1> <renlord "but spinning it as being a "haza"> have you seen how people handle hygiene with the masks? many go several days without washing, people hold them in hand, people put them on surfaces etc
01:42:14 <outsider[m]1> <renlord "outsider: your insisuation of "f"> "youre wrong because reasons"
01:43:43 <outsider[m]1> I've said my peace. just quit buying the mainstream's garbage. It's always fear with them. Fear is always used as a limiter to freedom
01:44:09 <renlord> outsider[m]1: not sure why you bring freedom into the discussion when mask usage has nothing to do with freedom
01:44:27 <renlord> i just see a bunch of strawman arguments being tossed around to argue against mask usage
01:44:41 <outsider[m]1> <renlord "outsider: not sure why you bring"> compliance to fear mongering has everything to do with freedom
01:45:04 <renlord> you suggest that people that wear mask do so out of fear
01:45:24 <renlord> when there is a good majority that do it out of precaution
01:45:44 <renlord> and practice proper use protocols
01:45:49 <outsider[m]1> collectivists just want the world to be a perfect safe utopian bubble

01:50:18 <sheruleeya[m]> Somehow a sweeping generalization, considering GrapheneOS exists
01:51:57 <jneplokh> Like Renlord said, look through the logs. There are an unending amount of conversations about the Desktop security model
01:52:36 <sheruleeya[m]> Yeah, will do. Just quoting this for someone more knowledgable to refute it on reddit
01:54:45 <renlord> has been refuted many times and the same questions/suggestions just keeps popping back up
01:54:51 <renlord> for no good apparent reason
01:54:57 <renlord> at this point, just gonna assume its trolls
01:55:15 <renlord> there's been no breakthru in desktop security afaik.
02:00:14 <sheruleeya[m]> Alright, my apologies.
02:00:14 <sheruleeya[m]> Just a little bit concerned on that person who was misinformed
02:03:31 <jneplokh> Unfortunately many are misinformed
02:05:47 <sheruleeya[m]> truly
02:09:04 <strcat[m]> sheruleeya: it's completely inaccurate / wrong
02:09:05 <strcat[m]> it's backwards

02:09:25 <strcat[m]>  * what do you expect from random uninformed morons on reddit though
02:09:28 <strcat[m]> why get your info there?
02:11:20 <strcat[m]> getting your information from anonymous social media posts / comments
02:11:24 <strcat[m]> is not a way to get informed
02:11:29 <sheruleeya[m]> I don't really, I stopped reading reddit since then. Just found this while browsing
02:11:36 <strcat[m]> reddit is as bad as facebook
02:12:12 <sheruleeya[m]> Just checking some stuff on how it (r/privacytoolsio) improved, but not really that much
02:12:23 <strcat[m]> that person is just making up a bunch of bullshit / misinformation
02:12:36 <strcat[m]> and people fall for it because they wrote it up in a long comment that looks like it's an expert opinion
02:12:41 <strcat[m]> but it's some random clueless person
02:12:49 <strcat[m]> repeating stuff they've heard from other clueless people
02:12:53 <strcat[m]> that's how reddit works
02:13:02 <strcat[m]> we really don't need to go through this again and again
02:13:19 <sheruleeya[m]> ok

02:15:59 <strcat[m]> anyway you can see there
02:16:09 <strcat[m]> a nice example of someone giving terrible advice and pushing misinformation
02:16:15 <strcat[m]> and they harmed someone's privacy / security substantially
02:16:21 <strcat[m]> by leading them into doing the opposite of what they should be doing
02:17:42 <sheruleeya[m]> Yeah, also with a bunch of fallacies in it.
02:19:53 <sheruleeya[m]> Quite convenient that it got deleted. Won't share stuffs from there again here
02:26:03 <sheruleeya[m]> Also, my apologies for the inconvenience.
02:42:45 <outsider[m]1> From a tapping perspective, Id still say phones are easier targets. a gutted, airgapped thinkpad can go a long way. harder to identify people in that regard. Plus packet filtering is much easier on computers, can block all inbound traffic and itll still be functional. The second you want wireless gone, pull the adapter. Anti-forensics is easier to script, logs are easier to view, disk encryption is longer etc
02:44:33 <outsider[m]1> But not everyone models like I do. Some would say machine downtime isnt a security feature, and anti-forensics is unnecessary bc it already assumes compromise/confiscation.
02:45:06 <strcat[m]> outsider: compare apples to apples
02:45:11 <strcat[m]> and then it's clear that you have it completely backwards
02:45:19 <strcat[m]> BTW I'm just going to ban people for spreading misinformation here

02:48:21 <strcat[m]> and don't expect an explanation
02:48:33 <AdventureCommuni> a problem with matrix is it seems really easy to make accounts, whereas discord they bomb you with captchas and give that "new to discord" thing

02:59:29 <strcat[m]> it has been really bad lately

03:03:53 <renlord> stay on topic, got it.

03:04:58 <strcat[m]> it doesn't belong here for one thing
03:05:38 <strcat[m]> so starting now when I go through the scrollback expect bans for posting anything I think is misinformation and off-topic
03:06:13 <strcat[m]> if I think someone is lowering the quality of the channel they're banned
03:06:25 <strcat[m]> no more warnings / corrections

06:04:43 <greenmoon[m]> Oh isnt the 'preferred network' an aosp feature? I used multiples phone and they add that feature
06:04:57 <greenmoon[m]> https://techattach.com/how-to-set-the-preferred-type-of-network-on-android-phone/
06:20:02 <greenmoon[m]> Oh I see now, its the phone providers ROMs, OEM ROMs and customs ROMs which provide more settings for it, not aosp.
06:33:45 <mrmanpants[m]> Not sure if the devs are in here, but I just started using GrapheneOS and i'm loving it.  thank you  :)

07:10:22 <firefightingphys> > so starting now when I go through the scrollback expect bans for posting anything I think is misinformation and off-topic
07:10:22 <firefightingphys> Can you state the rules regarding "off-topic" in a pinned/recurring post or in the channel description? Maybe we could link or create a spin-off channel on overall cyber security. Obviously, ban anyone spreading misinformation.
07:11:41 <AdventureCommuni> there are already so many rooms about that kind of stuff though
07:21:52 <firefightingphys> Sure, we could just guide new members to these rooms. Do you have suggestions?
07:28:58 <renlord> as the earlier statements, not our job to handholl
07:29:00 <renlord> *handhold
07:29:11 <renlord> individuals should do their own research
07:50:33 <firefightingphys> IMHO we could at least make the rules clearer. Additionally, it would help reduce the off-topic talk.
07:56:49 <renlord> the rules were quite clear from the get-go, just that we didnt enforce it.
08:01:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord: *holds hands*
08:02:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Does anyone have any smart watch"> Yes there will be as many smartwatch services are GMS dependent

08:05:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> The problem is quite clear btw

08:10:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Here's the attempted fix
08:12:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically the lockdown setting used to check if both always on and VPN lockdown were enabled
08:13:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Valldrac tried changing it so that the setting only depends on itself and made the default value true
08:13:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Essentially removing the always on VPN dependency

08:15:02 <nowbody[m]> Hello, is anybody here into SS7 & Perimeter research?
08:15:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wait a sec wtf
08:15:57 <nowbody[m]> I have a very unkommon low-level network problem - can not send any SMS ( but can receive)
08:16:29 <nowbody[m]> And all my receiving calls are immediately downgraded to 2G or 3G
08:16:39 <nowbody[m]> Normally I am on 4G
08:16:42 <renlord> nowbody[m]: use LTE-only
08:16:51 <nowbody[m]> But for call always below that
08:17:05 <renlord> call your cellphone provider (shrugs)
08:17:25 <nowbody[m]> I have done LTE only
08:17:46 <nowbody[m]> But with LTE only Cal's does not get throw
08:17:59 <nowbody[m]> And I can not call anybody
08:18:12 <renlord> can you rephrase what you just said
08:18:57 <nowbody[m]> Yes
08:19:15 <nowbody[m]> I can call people and receive calls only on 3G
08:19:50 <nowbody[m]> If I call somebody my network downgrades to 2 G or 3 G instant
08:20:02 <nowbody[m]> The same if I receive a call
08:20:23 <nowbody[m]> If I use LTE only I cannot receive any calls at all

08:23:10 <nowbody[m]> I don't even know what MVNO Is
08:23:26 <renlord> does your cellphone provider own their celltowers?
08:23:47 <renlord> anyways, its not really ontopic here
08:23:55 <renlord> long story short, your cellphone provider is shit
08:23:58 <renlord> find a better one

08:39:53 <q22> Hi there. Any chance to hide the carrier name? At least on the lock screen?
08:59:33 <jalb> Hello, have anyone here tried to use GOS with ethernet and proxy?, is it possible?. Thanks
09:00:10 <jalb> And how to configure it because I can't see an ethernet option in the Network settings
09:03:32 <jalb> I see it's possible searching for it, but I don't know if it's valid connecting through a proxy in my job and what OTG ethernet adapter is compatible with GOS
09:08:41 <sheruleeya[m]> <jalb "Hello, have anyone here tried to"> Ethernet I have tested and it works out of the box.
09:09:11 <sheruleeya[m]> Just plug the ethernet to the ethernet to C adaptor, then plug the C to phone.
09:09:17 <jalb> sheruleeya[m], I read that it only connects and nothing more, so isn't iti possible to configure a proxy to work in my job?
09:09:30 <jalb> Or no options?
09:09:45 <jalb> Maybe a VPN... IDN
09:09:55 <sheruleeya[m]> Can't speak for that, never used proxy on ethernet. VPN definitely works though

09:13:47 <jalb> sheruleeya[m], then I only need to find an app supporting the connectiong through a proxy and done :)
09:14:13 <jalb> Have you tried to look for a new setting in Network or..?
09:14:25 <jalb> When you connected through ethernet
09:14:31 <sheruleeya[m]> Nothing, just plugging it and it works.
09:14:51 <jalb> sheruleeya[m], anyway please when you do it check if some new setting is there
09:14:52 <sheruleeya[m]> Plug, connect to VPN, and profit
09:15:12 <jalb> sheruleeya[m], I must see if OpenVPN for Android app supports proxies or not
09:15:21 <jalb> Or another app
09:16:13 <jalb> Great news for me sheruleeya[m] thank you for your answers
09:18:00 <sheruleeya[m]> Nothing pops up on Network settings if you connect the ethernet.
09:19:05 <jalb> sheruleeya[m], ok
09:19:35 <jalb> sheruleeya[m], what about battery consuming?...
09:21:11 <jalb> I don't know if Wireguard app supports proxy, I'll check it
09:26:01 <sheruleeya[m]> <jalb "sheruleeya, what about battery c"> Well, it does consume bit more battery
09:27:53 <jalb> ok, I found it here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082K62S48/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=ugreenus-20&linkId=2a58fb092e7a21df9c99049364398ce9&language=en_US
09:28:48 <jalb> Not expensive :)
09:28:59 <jalb> Maybe it's yours
09:40:43 <sixBit[m]> Does anybody know an app in which I can corp and share and image without having to save it first?

Since then all apps seem to be connecting properly again. Weird but though I would let ya know. Thanks for help yesterday
11:41:58 <dazinism> pikey: no problem. Wireguard is much better. I'd be inclined to use the Wireguard app rather than PIAs. Not that I've really got much experience messing with VPNs

12:58:24 <userman23[m]> sheruleeya: wouldn't that be a lot of user profiles?  Don't profiles affect performance, and take up additional space?
13:05:38 <sheruleeya[m]> <userman23[m] "sheruleeya: wouldn't that be a l"> Depends. I don't put that much files to other user profiles. Only my main profile and secondary one produces files, and also backed up frequently in flash drives
13:06:42 <nscnt> userman23[m]: Maybe you should think about your app usage in general? Just a thought. c:
13:07:57 <sheruleeya[m]> Reboot frequently? Only three profiles are active when you open them anyways
13:08:21 <sheruleeya[m]> * Reboot frequently (especially when a profile is used online)? Only three profiles are active when you open them anyways
13:09:48 <sheruleeya[m]> I don't use that resource-heavy stuffs anyways.
13:11:12 <sheruleeya[m]> <nscnt "userman23: Maybe you should thin"> Yeah. If only block connection without VPN on 3a works well, it may reduce some profiles to use.
13:11:18 <sheruleeya[m]> I meant on between profiles.
13:11:25 <nscnt> If you have the need to put every app in its own user profile, there's something fundamentally... uhm... not optimal (?). Maybe you're using too many apps that you don't actually need and are completely against your values for privacy and is a time waster too?
13:12:45 <sheruleeya[m]> <nscnt "If you have the need to put ever"> Depends. I did say before that I had once 10 profiles. Mostly offline though, and had network permissions blocked.
13:13:45 <sheruleeya[m]> Or rather, majority of them.
13:13:46 <sheruleeya[m]> For work, for personal, for hobbies, for last-resort videoconferencing, for studying, and for some closed source apps to test and use due to lack of options.
13:14:36 <nscnt> Yea, sure. No blaming from my side or anything. I just think that a lot of "problems" start very early and may be tackled from the root for the better.
13:15:37 <nscnt> No specific person I'm talking to or app I'm talking about.
13:16:01 <sheruleeya[m]> Sadly, same IP address and the ISP kinda ruin this setup though. For I can't afford to use VPN on more than one profile, I had to limit what they can see.

13:26:20 <kakobrekla> hi, im having trouble reverting back to stock android on pixel 3a. do i need to download the OS images from google to do that? the instruction on website are not helping me.
13:27:34 <alzxjm[m]1> kakobrekla: https://developers.google.com/android/images
13:27:55 <alzxjm[m]1> Download the build relevant to your phone, confirm the checksum (`$ sha256sum`), unzip, and flash.
13:28:05 <sheruleeya[m]> Not to advertise or anything, but you may want to consider CalyxOS
13:28:31 <kakobrekla> alzxjm[m]1 how do i specify the iso filename? flash-all.sh doesnt take any parameters?
13:28:42 <sheruleeya[m]> * Not to advertise or anything, but you may want to consider CalyxOS, if you need some apps dependent on GSF/GMS (they had MicroG) for that
13:28:52 <alzxjm[m]1> Per https://grapheneos.org/install#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os, make sure to run `fastboot erase avb_custom_key` after flashing the stock OS and before locking
13:32:22 <sheruleeya[m]> <kakobrekla "alzxjm how do i specify the iso "> flash-all.sh is specific to GrapheneOS factory image afaik
13:33:27 <sheruleeya[m]> * flash-all.sh is specific to GrapheneOS factory image afaik, I mean the file withn the GOS zip
13:33:35 <kakobrekla> "Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process described above. "
13:34:28 <sheruleeya[m]> Yeah, the process is the same, nevermind what I've said earlier. Just don't use GOS' flash-all on the stock OS
13:34:51 <kakobrekla> what 'flash-all' should i use then
13:34:51 <alzxjm[m]1> `cd` into the directory after you unzip it and run the `flash-all.sh` script by running `$ flash-all.sh`
13:35:05 <kakobrekla> ah they provide own script
13:35:40 <alzxjm[m]1> Did you download the factory image from the website? (not the OTA)
13:35:44 <alzxjm[m]1> What phone do you have?
13:35:53 <kakobrekla> download just finished now. p3a
13:36:19 <kakobrekla> ok i see! they provided flash-all script as well.
13:36:31 <alzxjm[m]1> Yeah once you unzip the image it will have a flash-all.sh script
13:36:38 <alzxjm[m]1> Process is very similar to flashing GrapheneOS.
13:37:13 <kakobrekla> running now
13:37:35 <kakobrekla> i was not expecting to find flash-all there so that threw me off

13:51:54 <kakobrekla> for my primary phone i think it could work well.
13:53:42 <alzxjm[m]1> sheruleeya: I'm going through the process of removing as much Google bloat and disabling everything to the extent it is capable. I'll be left with just Google Fi, Google Play Services, Google Play Store, and hopefully that's it.
13:55:10 <sheruleeya[m]> Yeah. If that's what you need, go on. That's the best one can get on Stock OS.
13:56:41 <sheruleeya[m]> * Yeah. If that's what you need, go on. That's the best one can get on Stock OS (I mean in terms of privacy, disabling stuffs is the best one can do)

15:53:54 <jfbourdeau2> I just read the thread about Shelter and profile.  I am new to Android and new to GOS.  I was using Shelter to use apps like FaceBook, Whatsapp in WORK Profile , so they don't access my DATA, (contacts etc) ,and it seems to work as the CONTACT  icon, with a lock on it, is the one accessiblle from those APPS.  SO my goal was to not allow those apps or badly coded apps to access my phone call log, contacts, pictures etc...  So yes Shelter does help.
15:53:55 <jfbourdeau2> BUt if I use a different profile for Whatsapp,FaceBook and any dangerous apps, I will have to swtich from one profile to the other continously... And When I'm in my main profile,I would not get notifications of apps installed in the other pr ofile.... So is Shelter the only " non perfect way" for me, to better restrict suchs apps to not access everything in my personal profile (my last month experience seems to prove it does it well).  tks !!!
15:53:55 <jfbourdeau2> noobie question but experienced technology personn (I'm 52 )
15:55:27 <ruddo[m]> Shelter is adequate for stuff like WhatsApp.
15:58:41 <jfbourdeau2> ok tks ruddo[m]  !
16:00:53 <jfbourdeau2> VPN client question : I installed the nordVPN client, works well.  But would most of you trust openvpn client from F-Droid ?  If yes I will uninstall NordVPN that works fine ( I set it up to never use internet unless VPN is no / kill switch / auto-connect, on MObile and WifI
16:04:37 <dazinism> jfbourdeau2: think the openvpn client is mentioned/suggested on the GrapheneOS website, which would mean its a reasonable choice
16:05:54 <jfbourdeau2> tks dazinism  I read the site and FAQ to no get RTFM  answers LOL and I must have missed it, tks you so much... NordVPN client interface was cool " BUT " I am trying, to limit like all of you, what I install and from where.  Will give it a try tks
16:06:17 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you can get it from a verifiable source outside of F-Droid that might be better due to F-Droid's unfortunate use of weak signatures.
16:08:10 <dazinism> sheruleeya: if you check chromium its the same as vanadium. The extra site settings are added in Bromite
16:09:00 <dazinism> I'm sure they'd be appreciated in Vanadium. Someone needs to do the work
16:09:47 <dazinism> (I imagine Chrome also doesnt have these, the same as Vanadium and Chromium)
16:11:25 <sheruleeya[m]> Thanks. At least I knew it wasn't a bug, but enhancement report then
16:11:49 <sheruleeya[m]> Props to the Bromite developer(s) though
16:12:04 <dazinism> jfbourdeau2: https://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support
16:12:29 <jfbourdeau2> tks
16:13:49 <sheruleeya[m]> Sorry about that though. Didn't meant that as a complaint of lack of features or anything, thought it was on base chromium that wasn't there on Vanadium
16:14:30 <sheruleeya[m]> * Sorry about that though. Didn't meant that as a complaint of lack of features or anything, thought it was functional on Chromium that wasn't there on Vanadium
16:19:36 <bonerdose[m]> Sorry but I can't find my original question, what's the best smartwatch to use with grapheme, and are there any that allow you to locate your phone by alarm like the apple smart watche does?
16:24:01 <dazinism> bonerdose: do a search in this room for 'watch' you had a few answers.. although I've not heard of many with direct experience.
16:24:17 <jfbourdeau1> tks dazinism    OpenVPN client works well with NodVPN Open config file. simple... Have a nice day
16:24:37 <dazinism> No probs, you too
16:26:57 <dazinism> jfbourdeau2: ruddo think that the concerns anupritaisno1 has about shelter make it seriously worth looking at using Island instead.
16:27:30 <dazinism> If using a separate user profile will not work for you
16:27:56 <dazinism> I think Island has network permission, but that can be blocked
16:28:46 <dazinism> Half think I remember hearing that Island may also be somewhat abandoned. Needs investigation.

16:41:48 <sheruleeya[m]> Reflash/reformat/reinstall after backup?
16:42:39 <sheruleeya[m]> * (Nah, don't read the edit history, it was just as a suggestion)
16:45:28 <mrmanpants[m]> I've heard on 'mobile devices' when WiFi is on SSID's are shared and therefor location can be revealed, is that true?  and if so, does Graphene prevent this?
16:45:59 <dazinism> anonymouserobot: may be interesting to try auditor. See how it reports before you reflash
16:46:39 <dazinism> Sounds like you either have hit an unusual bug, or you're device has been compromised.
16:47:33 <anonymouserobot[> never used auditor before, how can i easily proceed given i dont have a nearby friend that has graphene
16:47:44 <dazinism> Looks like Island is still getting support from its developer. Also someone has forked it (with the devs blessing)
16:48:06 <dazinism> Stripped out the analytics so that it can be released on fdroid
16:48:09 <dazinism> https://gitlab.com/secure-system/Insular
16:49:17 <dazinism> Although with network permission switched off none of the analytics could report back
16:51:24 <dazinism> Safest/most secure is not to use the work profile function like this, but user profiles
16:51:56 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
16:52:37 <dazinism> I'll have to update that page with info about situation with Shelter, Island and Insular
16:53:40 <dazinism> Talking about user profiles, has anyone found a nice way to move data between profiles?
16:54:03 <dazinism> Currently usb storage is possibly simplest/safest.
16:54:42 <dazinism> Been looking for a nice app that could do it using networking, but keep everything on device
16:55:09 <dazinism> Not found anything great yet
16:56:42 <dazinism> I've been using EDS Lite for encrypting a container on the usb stick
16:57:14 <alzxjm[m]1> Is there any way to use a Work profile (say if I want to isolate certain apps like iRobot or whatever that don't need to interact with anything else on the phone) other than using Shelter? It seems Shelter is not recommended here.
16:58:14 <dazinism> anonymouserobot: goto attestation.app - best to use an email account not set up on the phone
16:59:02 <dazinism> Enable remote verification in Auditor
16:59:20 <hiya> I ran classy shark on all fdroid apps and 5 came with 1 tracker. But it says. "ACRA and188org.acra."  not google not facebook. Is this ok?
16:59:31 <hiya> Out of 20 I downloaded
16:59:35 <hiya> Is it safe?
17:05:42 <anonymouserobot[> dazinism: thanks I just did that, how can  i verify the device hasn't been compromised/spot anything unusual
17:16:09 <dazinism> anonymouserobot What does it say on the site after you set up the pairing?
17:16:51 <dazinism> Particularly about accessibility settings & device manager
17:17:52 <dazinism> Maybe take a photo of the screen and share here
17:19:42 <dazinism> hiya: thats an analytic service for developers. Nothing too sinister.  Apps could have similar, or worse, without showing they had any trackers there.

17:21:08 <dazinism> anonymouserobot: all looks reasonable
17:21:40 <dazinism> The problem stays after you restart
17:23:55 <anonymouserobot[> yep, after restarts and updates
17:23:56 <jalb> dazinism: I use the usb OTG to change files between users
17:24:03 <jalb> With a pendrive
17:26:38 <dazinism> ?
17:27:12 <jalb> dazinism: I think you asked how to share files between profiles or users before?
17:27:32 <jalb> I can't read old messages now
17:31:02 <anonymouserobot[> dazinism: do you think I'll need to reflash then? if I can't enable adb will I be able to backup in any meaningful way other than storage?
17:35:04 <dazinism> anonymouserobot: Theres the built in backup service
17:35:48 <dazinism> Think it would also be nice if you could get a bug report and email it to the dev team
17:36:07 <dazinism> Either with logcat via adb
17:37:38 <dazinism> Or with the bug report function under developer options
17:38:02 <dazinism> Never heard of anyone having a problem like that
17:39:27 <dazinism> Ah yeah.... no developer options... weird
17:40:22 <dazinism> Try using the backup function settings>system>backup
17:40:23 <anonymouserobot[> yeah i think it might be impossible to get logs for the devs cause no debugging and no way to enable it
17:41:28 <jfbourdeau2> DNS question : I am new to GOS, I was using NordVPN and now use openvpn android client, works well.  What are most of your are doing so your DNS queries are not tracked, logged ? is it some setting a change in AndroidOpen VPN or in my Cellulaire Network and WiFI setting ?

17:47:28 <sheruleeya[m]> FYI though, Pixel 3a would be only supported for only 3 years due to this:
17:47:28 <sheruleeya[m]> In a statement regarding the matter, a Google spokesperson told Android Police that the Google Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL will no longer be available on the Google Store, and the devices will only be available through a few third-party retailers till stocks last. The spokesperson revealed that the “Google Store has sold through its inventory and completed sales of Pixel 3a. For people who are still interested in
17:47:28 <sheruleeya[m]> buying Pixel 3a, the product is available from some partners while supplies last.”
17:48:09 <sheruleeya[m]> was hoping it would get extended for at least 6 months but welp
17:49:24 <jalb> sheruleeya[m]: do you know when the support ends?
17:49:30 <jalb> Pixel 3a
17:52:13 <cdesai> May 2022 per Google
17:52:44 <jalb> cdesai: thanks
17:52:44 <jfbourdeau2> DNS question : in GOS FAQ they tell us  to put 1.1.1.1 (CLoudFlare) if we want to force the use of CLoudflare instead of my WiFi or Cellular Network DNS' but in the Private DNS config box, we can only enter a FQDN.  I must have missed something but how to force using 1.1.1.1 ( I am new to ANDROID).  I am using  ANDROID OPENVPN client from F-Droid.
17:52:51 <jalb> 2 years then
17:53:05 <cdesai> jfbourdeau2: one.one.one.one will work as a FQDN for 1.1.1.1
17:53:27 <sheruleeya[m]> <cdesai "May 2022 per Google"> Yeah, the other condition won't apply, since the last google 3a was sold before the additional 18 months security update conditoon
17:53:41 <sheruleeya[m]> * Yeah, the other condition won't apply, since the last google 3a was sold before the additional 18 months security update condition
17:53:55 <sheruleeya[m]> <jalb "2 years then"> 22 months left to be exact
17:54:08 <jfbourdeau2> cdesai,  tks  when I ented that, the SAVE button becomes greyed out / not available... Weird
17:54:18 <jalb> sheruleeya[m]: lol yes
17:54:38 <jalb> Well, it's enough though I bought it 1 month ago...
17:54:44 <jfbourdeau2> if I enter a FQDN something,something.com then I can save   but not an IP (numerical)
17:55:28 <sheruleeya[m]> * Yeah, the other condition (last phone sold on Googles tore) won't apply (or override), since the last google 3a was sold before the additional 18 months security update condition
17:57:00 <jalb> jfbourdeau2: it only accepts letters, not IPs
17:58:05 <sheruleeya[m]> It is indeed letters, something like `dns.adguard.com`
17:58:33 <jfbourdeau2> ok tks  I did a reverse lookup and I've got it
17:58:34 <jfbourdeau2> yoda@busen-desktop:~$ host one.one.one.one
17:58:34 <jfbourdeau2> one.one.one.one has address 1.1.1.1

17:58:57 <dazinism> anonymouserobot: so weird. I'm on the same device and showing the same verified boot fingerprint.
17:59:29 <cdesai> 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com should also as an alternate
17:59:31 <dazinism> Auditor is also reporting its your main user account
17:59:50 <jfbourdeau2> ok tks cdesai  and jalb
18:00:51 <dazinism> Very strange a reboot doesnt fix it..
18:00:56 <dazinism> Got another idea
18:01:37 <jalb> jfbourdeau2: in a VPN is important that your VPN service uses its own DNS server inside the VPN
18:02:00 <jalb> You can check it in browserleaks.com or ipleak.net
18:02:12 <jfbourdeau2> tks that is what I was looking for  tks !
18:02:57 <jalb> jfbourdeau2: Mullvad for example uses it
18:03:15 <jalb> And you'll see Mullvad DNS there
18:03:30 <jalb> The server Mullvad uses I mean
18:04:11 <dazinism> anonymouserobot: try installing material files from Fdroid

18:10:46 <dazinism> anonymouserobot: some, usually more security focused apps, have built in backup functions. To put data in storage
18:11:11 <dazinism> Eg. OTP apps, signal, conversations
