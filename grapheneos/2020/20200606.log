00:30:08 <TheJollyRoger> cn3m[m]: I can help you a little bit!
00:31:12 <TheJollyRoger> aeonsolution[m]'s showed me most of the process, and I recorded as much as I could, and wrote it down...
01:13:36 <twitx[m]> And pretty interesting that you can crash a phone with a background (I've found it some months ago) (and yes this happens on every Android device)
01:14:02 <twitx[m]> * And its pretty interesting that you can crash a phone with a background (I've found it some months ago) (and yes this happens on every Android device)
01:15:28 <strcat[m]> it causes an exception in the system ui process
01:15:35 <strcat[m]> it doesn't 'crash a phone'
01:15:50 <strcat[m]> they didn't handle the case of non-SRGB colorspace
01:27:50 <strcat[m]> there is a trivial patch for that issue for the next release, no one bothered to submit one though
01:27:58 <strcat[m]> not a security issue so not going to do an early release for it
01:39:53 <aeonsolution[m]> hey cn3m, what can i do help you with?
01:41:25 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] hey cn3m, what can i help you with?
01:43:09 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "hey cn3m, what can i do help you"> I was going to try getting a GrapheneOS build going. TheJollyRoger sent me the guide you two were making and he's sending me an image. Just want to be prepared to help the community
01:43:10 <cn3m[m]> Thanks
01:46:22 <aeonsolution[m]> Oh nice! I think the lowest barrier of entry for people wanting to jump into development imo is to use Ubuntu. Manjaro, I realized with working with TheJollyRoger isn't troubleshooting friendly.
01:46:51 * TheJollyRoger winces.
01:46:59 <TheJollyRoger> Ack!
01:47:38 <aeonsolution[m]> Jolly's instructions on Arch are really good too, but I personally wouldn't push people to jump to Arch if they aren't familiar with Linux.
01:48:16 <cn3m[m]> I have Debian. Wouldn't that be more stable?
01:48:38 <aeonsolution[m]> Debian is perfect.
01:48:54 <aeonsolution[m]> I meant so if others came to you asking for advice.
01:49:03 <TheJollyRoger> Debian Buster works I think!
01:50:20 <BalooRJ> GrapheneOS pushed me to Debian because I had to build
01:50:28 <BalooRJ> a year and a half later or so I'm on debian full time over Windows
01:51:35 <aeonsolution[m]> cn3m: for your reference https://source.android.com/setup/build/initializing#setting-up-a-linux-build-environment
01:52:43 <cn3m[m]> Debian is amazing if you hate security
01:52:51 <cn3m[m]> Which I don't care for a mostly offline device
01:57:59 <aeonsolution[m]> cn3m: please hit me up if you have or get build questions, i'll help you out
01:58:24 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe I should make another document for doing debian...? :P.
01:58:34 <TheJollyRoger> Since it looks like Debian has their own names for the packages.
01:59:03 <aeonsolution[m]> maybe later! we got a lot of work to do shipmate.
01:59:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, okay!
01:59:33 <TheJollyRoger> Gettin' back to it!
02:04:27 <aeonsolution[m]> overheadscallop: are you free to work on the Pixel 4 stuff right now?

04:18:30 <radixed9[m]> That is something I never thought I would see

04:49:45 <travankor_> getting temple-os vibes
06:28:02 <IxquickOG[m]> <travankor_ "getting temple-os vibes"> PBUH
06:59:56 <radixed9[m]> Windows 10X looks very interesting with the Win32 apps being isolated in open big sandbox. I wonder if it would support multiple Win32 sandboxes
07:30:55 <paintedman[m]> strcat: maybe I was wrong about WiFi. I've just installed CalyxOS build qq2a.200501.001.b2 and it works well.
07:31:26 <paintedman[m]> I guess, I should start from scratch and check everything step by step
07:38:39 <skratchnsniff[m]> Is calyxos graphene based?
07:39:24 <paintedman[m]> yes
07:41:51 <skratchnsniff[m]> Thanks
07:45:41 <skratchnsniff[m]> Trying to convert people who must have latest phones every 3 months.
07:45:57 <skratchnsniff[m]> Maybe I can buy their old ones cheap ha
07:47:12 <cn3m[m]> <skratchnsniff[m] "Is calyxos graphene based?"> No it's not. They are both based on AOSP
07:47:57 <skratchnsniff[m]> OK. So it is not as hardened? as grapheme?
07:48:10 <skratchnsniff[m]> But maybe better than stock?
07:53:43 <paintedman[m]> <cn3m[m] "No it's not. They are both based"> oh, sorry, I thought it's grapheneos-based
07:53:45 <cn3m[m]> <skratchnsniff[m] "OK. So it is not as hardened? as"> It's less secure than Stock
07:54:48 <cn3m[m]> It added F-Droid as a Privileged Extension and uses Signature Spoofing. Otherwise it's basically stock
07:55:08 <skratchnsniff[m]> Thanks again.
07:55:09 <cn3m[m]> * It added F-Droid as a Privileged Extension and uses microG(and sig spoofing). Otherwise it's basically stock
07:55:48 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS is a good simple to use out of the box experience that is based on secure hardware and a secure base(AOSP). It's a great project
07:57:34 <cn3m[m]> It relies on Google servers and even in rarer cases even optional proprietary Google code for some services. However, it is generally more private than Stock and has a more privacy focused default setup.
07:57:54 <cn3m[m]> That's all microG though
07:58:01 <skratchnsniff[m]> That is why I was asking as it seemed maybe a good gateway OS on the way to the harder graphene stuff.
07:58:29 <skratchnsniff[m]> HKers
07:58:47 <cn3m[m]> If you want security and privacy GrapheneOS is the best way to do that right now. You would have to install more apps on your own however.
07:59:33 <skratchnsniff[m]> I use graphene on my phones but just saw the calyx mentioned here and was curious.
08:00:30 <skratchnsniff[m]> I knew of their VPN service but not the phone OS.
08:00:58 <cn3m[m]> I'd recommend an iPhone for friends and family. There's a survey where only 2% of privacy conscious users are using degoogled phones. It's hard especially for the not tech savvy
08:01:17 <skratchnsniff[m]> OK.
08:02:07 <skratchnsniff[m]> They are concerned about iPhones coz of the Apple servers in China etc.
08:02:23 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS makes a lot of sense for a one purpose phone or a transition to GrapheneOS. That's my current take having used and promoted both
08:02:39 <skratchnsniff[m]> Ok
08:02:44 <skratchnsniff[m]> Thanks.
08:03:36 <cn3m[m]> <skratchnsniff[m] "They are concerned about iPhones"> That was reverted ad they switched hosting partners to Google.
08:03:37 <cn3m[m]> Iirc
08:03:46 <cn3m[m]> Very recent change
08:04:27 <skratchnsniff[m]> Orly? Ok
08:04:51 <cn3m[m]> If Google hacking Apple is in your threat model you probably shouldn't be on the internet
08:05:00 <skratchnsniff[m]> Haha
08:06:06 <skratchnsniff[m]> I think more worried about China gov.
08:06:17 <cn3m[m]> If I understand correctly the previous host for iCloud started the switch over the China. I think that was a reason in moving over to Google, but I am a little fuzzy on the details. They did switch over to Google though so it should be all good
08:07:53 <cn3m[m]> <skratchnsniff[m] "I think more worried about China"> Yeah people worrying about the US government more even if they live in the US government is very ironic. US companies have full legal ability to report data requests figures in their transparency reports of which Google and Apple both have.
08:08:14 <cn3m[m]> China is much more likely to sell your data to highest bidder imo
08:08:36 <cn3m[m]> The US can't use illegally collected data in court anyway. It's not like you're going to get framed.
08:09:51 <mxnorvak[m]> No
08:10:05 <mxnorvak[m]> It's AOSP based
08:10:25 <mxnorvak[m]> But shares some code with GrapheneOS
08:10:37 <skratchnsniff[m]> Cheers
08:11:17 <cn3m[m]> I don't like the US government violating the 4th amendment (and on some cases the 2nd amendment as crypto is still legally a munitions iirc). Most of my issues with it are ideological and the suppressive nature of it
08:11:18 <mxnorvak[m]> Shit what a lag
08:11:20 <cn3m[m]> People won't think freely from paranoia
08:11:51 <skratchnsniff[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "Shit what a lag"> Same here but better late than never ha

08:51:36 <adamso[m]> Hi, what's the best way to exchange files between two user profiles? is there any shared folder between them?
08:52:36 <furofuro_01[m]> <adamso[m] "Hi, what's the best way to excha"> Through PC only though... Unless you use some cloud services
08:53:16 <furofuro_01[m]> (That is in general. I am not sure what hardening features GrapheneOS has made on User Profiles)
08:54:09 <adamso[m]> furofuro_01: I thought there is an easier way. Thank you.
08:55:26 <mxnorvak[m]> <adamso[m] "Hi, what's the best way to excha"> You could also use a flash drive via OTG
08:56:53 <furofuro_01[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "You could also use a flash drive"> Oh yeah, that also works too
08:57:54 <jalb66> I've never tested to connect a usb pendrive to my Pixel 3a, has anyone already did it?

09:00:39 <jalb66> Or nothing?
09:02:21 <dazinism> Just plug it in
09:04:41 <jalb66> I dit it with a Samsung pendriive and it tells me to format it, it's in fat32 format...
09:06:37 <jalb66> Does it work with 64 GB or 128 GB pendrives?
09:06:56 <jalb66> Ah ok, with another pendrive it works,. thanks 🙂
09:08:30 <adamso[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "You could also use a flash drive"> Awesome man, that's much easier. Thanks
09:20:26 <mxnorvak[m]> <adamso[m] "Awesome man, that's much easier."> No problem :)

15:03:56 <strcat[m]> paintedman: it would be helpful to get the kernel changes landed so it can be built
15:04:03 <strcat[m]> and then it will be easier for others to contribute to resolving wifi issues
15:04:17 <strcat[m]> paintedman: I expect the kernel wifi issues would be resolved by properly configuring it
15:04:38 <strcat[m]> building it in-tree doesn't result in the same configuration as out-of-tree without setting it up properly
15:04:40 <strcat[m]> look at the crosshatch changes for qcacld
15:04:54 <strcat[m]> paintedman: the userspace issues may be hardening work uncovering bugs

19:02:10 <TheJollyRoger> stupidmonkey[m]: quick sanity check: do you have your udev rules set?
19:03:02 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't, the command sequence to set the udev rules is:
19:03:53 <TheJollyRoger> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/master/51-android.rules && sudo mv 51-android.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ && sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
19:04:34 <TheJollyRoger> That should download the proper udev rules for Android from upstream, move them into your rules directory and tell udev to load the new rules.

19:50:12 <strcat[m]> it just fell behind for the time being
19:50:32 <strcat[m]> those apps basically only get updated yearly when a new major version of AOSP comes out
19:50:36 <strcat[m]> other than security fixes
21:23:34 <xabi[m]> <stupidmonkey[m] "I am having some trouble with in"> It could also be an old version of fastboot
21:23:58 <nickcalyx[m]> could be a bad usb cable too
21:24:13 <nickcalyx[m]> try another usb port, and/or try switching out the cable for another
21:45:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Interesting, after I look at the Pixel 4 sample data, the key at the bottom seems to have the same certificate. I'm going to see what happens when I check the XL.
21:53:20 <TheJollyRoger> Going to do one more as a control to make sure I'm not getting a false result.
21:57:04 <cn3m[m]> TheJollyRoger: thank you for your hard work
21:57:20 <TheJollyRoger> Aaaah, don't thank me yet, I haven't produced any results yet >_<.
21:58:14 <cn3m[m]> TheJollyRoger: you help everyone it's great

21:59:27 <aeonsolution[m]> *grabs popcorn
22:01:14 <newpixlman> got a new pixel 3 'unlocked' from amazon, but i can't seem to get it to un-grey out the 'OEM unlocking' option
22:01:44 <newpixlman> it's got an internet connect (can browse websites)
22:01:59 <aeonsolution[m]> was it from a third part seller or from google?
22:02:15 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] was it from a third party seller or from google?
22:02:31 <newpixlman> i thought it was google, but checked again and it looks like third party
22:03:19 <nickcalyx[m]> the thing is, those sellers don't even know what bootloader unlocking is.  when they say unlocked they mean carrier locking
22:03:34 <aeonsolution[m]> you can try adding a sim card to see if it gives you the unlock option if not you may need to contact the carrier who has it locked
22:03:49 <aeonsolution[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "the thing is, those sellers don'"> seconded
22:04:01 <newpixlman> is there a way to tell what carrier might have it locked?
22:04:37 <aeonsolution[m]> someone had mentioned something about the IMEI
22:05:42 <nickcalyx[m]> there's no way to get it unlocked
22:05:54 <aeonsolution[m]> *without the carrier's help
22:05:57 <nickcalyx[m]> If you cant figure it on your own
22:06:20 <aeonsolution[m]> and they may or may not be helpful
22:06:22 <nickcalyx[m]> you'll never find someone at Verizon who knows what bootloader locking is
22:06:44 <newpixlman> fuck, it's verizon
22:06:46 <aeonsolution[m]> maybe if they contact customer support and create a support ticket?
22:06:51 <newpixlman> i'll just return the phone
22:06:56 <nickcalyx[m]> The law says they have to allow carrier unlocking
22:07:11 <TheJollyRoger> newpixlman: does the IMEI number begin in 99?
22:07:22 <nickcalyx[m]> I mean try,the other suggestions, put a Sim card in, restart it
22:07:51 <newpixlman> it came with a sim, i'm rebooting now
22:07:59 <newpixlman> sim is verizon
22:08:03 <aeonsolution[m]> try replacing the sim with your own
22:08:08 <aeonsolution[m]> and rebooting it
22:08:50 <aeonsolution[m]> if its a verizon sim, it wont allow you to unlock without going through them first
22:08:51 <aeonsolution[m]> and by them i mean their customer support line
22:09:21 <nickcalyx[m]> The Verizon Sim suggests its a Verizon model that you cant unlock
22:12:53 <newpixlman> trying a t-mobile sim
22:13:26 <newpixlman> with a factory reset
22:13:53 <aeonsolution[m]> try the reboot first
22:13:59 <aeonsolution[m]> no factory reset yet
22:15:00 <newpixlman> i did, still grey
22:15:15 <aeonsolution[m]> are you on wifi
22:15:27 <newpixlman> tried on and off wifi
22:15:44 <aeonsolution[m]> ok try the factory reset now
22:16:00 <newpixlman> tried that as well  :(
22:16:09 <aeonsolution[m]> keep in mind that some carriers have restrictions on when the phone can be unlocked. so if the phone was recently purchased from carrier say yesterday and they resold it to you
22:16:42 <newpixlman> i'll just return it, i wanted one from google anyhow, though thats what i got
22:16:52 <newpixlman> thanks for your help fellas
22:16:58 <aeonsolution[m]> it may not qualify for an unlock until their arbitrarily chosen amount of days has passed
22:17:04 <aeonsolution[m]> np
22:23:18 <TheJollyRoger> Okay, looks like I have no clue what I'm doing >_
22:23:20 <TheJollyRoger> _<.

22:24:46 <aeonsolution[m]> i got nothing, i'm wrestling with a Java syntax highlighter right now
22:24:54 <TheJollyRoger> Ack. X(
22:25:07 <aeonsolution[m]> it works when it wants too
22:25:13 <VincentWantsToBa> TheJollyRoger: Ahoy cap!
22:25:21 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
22:32:04 <newpixlman> best place to get an OEM unlocked pixel3?  store.google.com?
22:34:12 <aeonsolution[m]> anywhere that gives you an unlocked pixel for a good price
22:34:28 <aeonsolution[m]> best buy and amazon sometimes have promos
22:34:44 <aeonsolution[m]> google as far as i've seen doesnt have promos
22:35:26 <aeonsolution[m]> walmart also has promos sometimes
22:50:00 <nickcalyx[m]> what happens is at the end of a model's life, there end up being unsold verizon ones.. and verizon doesn't want them because demand dies down because now everyone wants the pixel 4 .. so they dump them on the gray market for cheap
22:50:41 <nickcalyx[m]> google did have a promo the other day they were selling pixel 3a for like 279 on store.google.com but it seems to have ended
22:50:52 <nickcalyx[m]> but even from them you might get a verizon model
22:50:59 <nickcalyx[m]> if that's what they have left
22:51:44 <newpixlman> is there an easy way i can tell at the store if it's unlocked?
22:52:01 <newpixlman> or is the best way to try to enable the OEM unlocking setting?
22:52:01 <nickcalyx[m]> try to unlock it
22:52:34 <newpixlman> ok
22:52:57 <newpixlman> thanks
22:55:57 <cx2[m]> nickcalyx: Thanks for the reply earlier. Was working and didn’t see it.
22:55:57 <cx2[m]> Not Signed into microG. Given that, what advantages/disadvantages are there for turning on device registration? I don’t use apps that require a google account, just a small few that rely on GMS (i think)
22:57:42 <nickcalyx[m]> I'm not sure if there are any advantages then
22:58:16 <nickcalyx[m]> disadvantages are that you are adding to your dossier in google's data mining operation
22:59:32 <nickcalyx[m]> device registration just means you create a unique device identifier but if it's not connected to your google account or email then I guess they still use it in their big data experiments but its not personally identifiable
22:59:40 <cx2[m]> That’s what I figured. So it’s a feature for apps that require google signin.
22:59:40 <cx2[m]> MicroG does complain that it needs access to: Phone Calls, Contacts, Storage.....Root /s
23:00:34 <nickcalyx[m]> the part where you can set up a google account is where it attaches your activities to you
23:00:45 <nickcalyx[m]> if you have apps that then make use of it
23:01:44 <nickcalyx[m]> but you can't use google cloud messaging without device registration
23:02:30 <cx2[m]> Ohhhhhh...got it.
23:03:30 <nickcalyx[m]> you can use google apps that are not tied to an account without an issue.. like google maps for instance.  but if you try to use an app that requires a google account, like hangouts or google drive then you'll need to give microg a google account
23:05:21 <cx2[m]> Too easy. Well I only had two apps that “needed” cloud messaging.... deleted one. The other is a banking app... wondering if “cloud messaging” is required for a banking app?
23:06:23 <cx2[m]> Sure doesn’t.... works just fine
23:06:40 <nickcalyx[m]> probably not?  unless it somehow needs to push messages to you when you get a deposit or something
23:07:17 <nickcalyx[m]> there are apps that won't work without the maps api and without push messaging, like uber and lyft
23:07:38 <nickcalyx[m]> you can still use them through their web interface, but you won't see the little car coming to you on the map in real time

23:25:18 <newpixlman> trying to decide if i actually *need* a 128gb pixel, any idea about how large the offline maps are (for USA)?
23:25:37 <newpixlman> thats the only app i can think of that might take up a ton of space
23:28:02 <cx2[m]> <newpixlman "trying to decide if i actually *"> OSM?
23:29:31 <newpixlman> anything really, i don't know if they generally take many gigs of space or not
23:29:39 * dazinism uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200607-002734.png (212KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ljfofLHoRxpolOSiMGyONMYN >
23:30:27 <newpixlman> oh thank you, is that OSM?
23:30:55 <dazinism> Yeah OSMand
23:31:27 <newpixlman> are those sizes total or just for california?
23:31:45 <cx2[m]> I guess it doesn’t matter... OsnAnd is 100mb +.... I would think US maps would be around the same.... either way, if you’re not filling your phone with music, photos, or games. I think you could get away with less.
23:31:45 <cx2[m]> I have the 128, and probably don’t need all of the space but still use it.
23:31:45 <cx2[m]> I think if it like hiking. If I bring a backpack that can fit 15lb.... I’m putting 15lb in it and will be fine. If I bring one that can fit 40lb..... welll, my back is going to hurt, but I’m filling it, and will also be fine
23:31:49 <dazinism> Just California
23:32:48 <newpixlman> oh wow, ok.  so all of US is like 50gig.  thats what i was worried about  :)
23:33:04 <cx2[m]> <dazinism "Just California"> Yeah you can cut out most of that.... I mean SD is the only place you’d need to go in California anyway :-)
23:38:28 <dazinism> newpixlman: not all states are equal
23:41:48 <dazinism> newpixlman : eg. Idaho is 85mb
23:42:27 <newpixlman> total?
23:43:32 <cx2[m]> newpixlman: Yeah California is by far the largest...I clicked through a handful of them just now. Naturally the more dense or trafficked the state is, the larger the download
23:43:32 <cx2[m]> That said, the next largest one to California that I found was New York at like 260mb
23:43:47 <cx2[m]> Almost every other state is around 100mb or less
23:44:45 <dazinism> <newpixlman "total?"> For the standard map
23:45:39 <newpixlman> ahh, ok
23:46:18 <newpixlman> i might be fine with a 64gig then.  i don't take pictures nor store video, just 20gig of music
23:57:38 <nikoleos[m]> hi, is the http://g.co/ABH warning normal on pixel 3a after flashing graphene os for first time and rebooting
23:58:18 <nikoleos[m]>  * hi, is the http://g.co/ABH warning normal on pixel 3a after flashing graphene os for first time and rebooting  and it seems to get stuck on google boot screen
23:58:27 <nickcalyx[m]> Yes
23:58:37 <TheJollyRoger> Hi nikoleos[m], yes, the yellow screen "Your device is loading a different operating system" is completely normal for GrapheneOS and it's expected behaviour; it means that the Verified Boot is on and enforcing,
23:58:43 <nickcalyx[m]> The warning is normal
23:58:52 <TheJollyRoger> but that you're not loading the Google operating system, you're loading a different one signed by a key that doesn't belong to google.
23:59:01 <nikoleos[m]> ok
23:59:11 <TheJollyRoger> This is a /good thing/.
23:59:44 <nikoleos[m]> and the first boot may be long ? i  on Google screen for many minutes
23:59:44 <TheJollyRoger> Only if that warning turns orange and you get an ominous "Software integrity not guaranteed!" that you have to worry. (the orange screen indicates an unlocked bootloader, which means that the verified boot has been disabled.)
