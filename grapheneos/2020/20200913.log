00:04:41 <bson989[m]> Just received my first update on GOS. Is there somewhere I can read exactly what was updated. Thanks
00:23:17 <cn3m[m]> bson989: the official site
00:24:36 <arouzing[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
00:24:36 <arouzing[m]> Change logs are towards bottom
00:58:01 <retry0x[m]> Vanadium doesn't support u2f?
02:41:19 <nickcalyx[m]> <engulf[m] "Changing IMEI is illegal in many"> > > <@lickidyspl1t:matrix.org> Is there a way to force change imei on graphene?
03:37:53 <strcat[m]> @retry0x:matrix.org: the library Chromium uses for it is part of Play services so it's not available on GrapheneOS
03:37:56 <strcat[m]> we need someone to reimplement it
03:38:55 <retry0x[m]> Wow fuck google
03:38:57 <retry0x[m]> Ok
03:39:04 <strcat[m]> lev: updates are only activated after being fully finished and verified
03:39:30 <strcat[m]> lev: the power can cut out at any point (ripping out the battery for example) and it's still safe
03:40:28 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't actually get locked in as the new OS until it successfully boots
03:40:30 <strcat[m]> if it does the update, verifies it and then marks it active (switching over to it as the active OS to boot)
03:40:31 <strcat[m]> and then it fails to boot N times
03:40:34 <strcat[m]> it will just roll back to the old version
03:41:10 <strcat[m]> it's only once it actually makes it to late userspace boot phase of the new version that it locks it in and disables rolling back to the old OS version (the old OS version is technically still there until the next update starts being installed but it's inactive with rollback disabled)
03:46:13 <lev[m]> oh awesome, that's smart, and very comforting to know
03:46:30 <adsasd> Hi,first time building aosp here.I am trying to follow the build instructions, but getting this message:As it says: "You likely want to use the most recent stable tag, not the development branch"So I move on and just do: ```mkdir grapheneos-aosp_sargocd grapheneos-aosp_sargorepo init -u https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest.git -b

03:46:42 <lev[m]> dazinism: hmm cool, I will investigate this further, that sounds like a decent solution
03:54:58 <aeonsolution[m]> adsasd you aren't building vanilla AOSP, you are building GrapheneOS. It looks like you didn't download all the dependencies.
03:55:56 <aeonsolution[m]> did you run the commands on separate lines or split them?
03:56:32 <aeonsolution[m]> `mkdir grapheneos-aosp_sargocd grapheneos-aosp_sargorepo init -u https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest.git -b`
03:56:36 <aeonsolution[m]> this is wrong
03:57:12 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: they left already
03:57:51 <aeonsolution[m]> oh wow, didn't notice lol love talking to myself i guess
04:05:23 <arouzing[m]> rip
04:09:55 <f3mK9xxXMgmXb5Hd> aeonsolution[m] hey, thanks for answering my question. Yes i split them or use && for these separate commands. But, someone told me that even the TAG_NAME used "aosp_sargo" doesn't exist
04:10:35 <f3mK9xxXMgmXb5Hd> aeonsolution[m] how do I download the source for building to Google Pixel 3a?
04:17:47 <inthewaves[m]> f3mK9xxXMgmXb5Hd: the tags look like QQ3A.200805.001.2020.09.11.14, and you can find them at https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.11.14 where it lists the tags for each release and device
04:18:44 <adeus[m]> Anyway you can leverage power of android device policies and enforce device restrictions without requiring services of a MDM? Like, just manually generate a profile and load onto the targeted device ?
04:21:42 <aeonsolution[m]> f3mK9xxXMgmXb5Hd: go to the pixel 3a section and get the tag from the release page like inthewaves suggested
04:22:00 <aeonsolution[m]> if you want to do a development build, use 10
04:22:11 <f3mK9xxXMgmXb5Hd> thx
04:22:38 <aeonsolution[m]> f3mK9xxXMgmXb5Hd: you use aosp_sargo on the choosecombo section
04:23:03 <f3mK9xxXMgmXb5Hd> check
04:59:52 <porcupine> Hi everyone! Have grapheneOS installed, and am using opencamera, camera2 api. I keep getting "Serious Camera Error" every time I attempt to take a picture at a higher frames per second. Does anyone have any advice for what to try?
05:00:39 <porcupine> (Also, the "Please read our rules" link seems dead on my end)
05:04:47 <aeonsolution[m]> porcupine: theres two links, here is the one for the logs, i added the camera search for you https://freenode.logbot.info/?ch=grapheneos&q=camera
05:04:51 <aeonsolution[m]> gl
05:08:33 <strcat[m]> porcupine: there are unfortunately serious upstream bugs in the camera drivers which are often uncovered by GrapheneOS hardening features
05:08:54 <strcat[m]> we expect Android 11 to greatly improve the situation due to upstream hardening which should have uncovered some of the same problems
05:09:46 <strcat[m]> as one example zero-based initialization is now adopted upstream and they have a security-aware allocator which they've hopefully used for that code
05:10:16 <strcat[m]> hardened_malloc goes much further with much stronger security properties but it's nice that the baseline is now a security-aware allocator with some overlap with the optional hardened_malloc features
05:10:26 <strcat[m]> it'll make it less disruptive
05:17:00 <porcupine> Thank you guys for the information. Will wait out until Android 11 and see if that fixes the issue
05:38:42 <Jimmehh[m]> does anyone know what the "adaptive" color profile does exactly on the pixel phones?
06:26:03 <Partyush[m]> Hello, when will we get android 11 version of Graphene os ?
06:35:34 <Jimmehh[m]> nevermind my question about the "adaptive" color profile. ambient eq seems to be what i was looking for
06:35:39 <Jimmehh[m]> sucks he 4a doesn't have it
06:35:43 <Jimmehh[m]> maybe the 5a will get it

06:45:14 <Partyush[m]> I know how to make android apps but never touched a rom like this one any help i can do ?
07:23:03 <aeonsolution[m]> Partyush: you can setup the development branch as step 0 https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch, once you finish that send me a message and we can try to see how you can help out
07:23:17 <aeonsolution[m]> change the 11s to 10 for now
07:23:31 <aeonsolution[m]>  * change the 11s to 10s for now

15:01:05 <snowkeld[m]> I've been using GrapheneOS on 3a xl for a few months. The Bluetooth lags and crashes to the point that it is unusable. Is this a known issue?
15:06:24 <NorbertTretkows4> <snowkeld[m] "I've been using GrapheneOS on 3a"> Bluetooth works without any issues on my Pixel 3.
15:07:16 <Autopsy[m]> <snowkeld[m] "I've been using GrapheneOS on 3a"> Search the logs and on GitHub? I haven't heard of it, though.
15:25:20 <djee737ejdd[m]> Anyone else having problems with timers since last update?
15:36:06 <Partyush[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "Partyush: you can setup the deve"> Yeah it's done
16:13:13 <snowkeld[m]> <NorbertTretkows4 "Bluetooth works without any issu"> pixel 3a xl
16:13:45 <snowkeld[m]> were not tested with stock image they shipped with unfortunately
16:27:11 <Autopsy[m]> snowkeld only thing I could recommend is a reinstall of GrapheneOS after flashing the latest Google release. Shouldn't matter, but I had memory leak issues with WiFi a couple of months ago on the 4XL and that fixed it.
16:27:50 <snowkeld[m]> ouch. reinstall would suck
16:28:23 <NorbertTretkows4> snowkeld: You can make a backup using Seedvault.
16:28:38 <Autopsy[m]> If you have seedvault to back up your apps and stuff, it'll be fine.
17:50:06 <arouzing[m]> I know and use fdroid for foss apps, currently use aptiod for non foss apps. If there is a better alternative let me know!
17:51:01 <Partyush[m]> <arouzing[m] "I know and use fdroid for foss a"> I guess aroura store
17:58:24 <arouzing[m]> Just downloaded it! Much nicer then aptoid.
17:59:16 <Partyush[m]> Huurreeey :enjoy
17:59:34 <Ultron[m]> <arouzing[m] "Just downloaded it! Much nicer t"> It's just a front end to download apps from Google Play without using the actual Google Play app. Aptoid cannot be trusted imo.
18:01:45 <arouzing[m]> I did not trust aptoid to begin with just did not know any other option.
18:03:16 <arouzing[m]> Thanks again!

18:13:57 <M8383n550n[m]> Does anyone knows when GOS will approx realize firmware/support for Pixel4a? I am thinking to get a new Pixel4a and hope to don't buy it for nothing. Thank you.
18:17:05 <Ultron[m]> It should get supported eventually. Developer of CalyxOS said today that they are close with Pixel 4a support. Graphene should follow provided some body volunteer to be the device maintainer. If not then you can use CalyxOS when it's ready.
18:17:25 <Autopsy[m]> <M8383n550n[m] "Does anyone knows when GOS will "> Search the logs. But basically, when it's ready.
18:17:26 <LinusSexTips[m]> has anyone had the error "Can't find valid operating system. the device will not start."?
18:17:26 <LinusSexTips[m]> I got it after relocking the bootloader
18:18:08 <LinusSexTips[m]> I cant unlock it again anymore :(
18:18:12 <Autopsy[m]> Was just gonna say that ^
18:18:46 <Autopsy[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "has anyone had the error "Can't "> Did you follow a guide or a video?
18:18:57 <Autopsy[m]> The guide*
18:19:40 <Autopsy[m]> Video, as you've just stated in CalyxOS room.
18:20:01 <LinusSexTips[m]> yeah, but I used the commands from the official website
18:20:21 <Autopsy[m]> Still shite. Henry tried his best but he has caused so many problems.
18:20:32 <LinusSexTips[m]> yeah I heard haha
18:21:05 <Autopsy[m]> Anyways, best thing you can do is use flash.android.com and see if that lets you update to the latest stock.
18:22:54 <Autopsy[m]> Another thing
18:23:19 <Autopsy[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "yeah I heard haha"> After relocking the bootloader. I assume you closed your terminal / PowerShell?
18:23:40 <LinusSexTips[m]> yes
18:24:03 <Autopsy[m]> If so, set up your environment path again, using platform-tools, and then try to unlock the bootloader again.
18:24:17 <Autopsy[m]> That's probably what's causing your issue
18:26:35 <LinusSexTips[m]> I will try
18:27:07 <LinusSexTips[m]> though adb devices isnt even picking up my phone right now

21:01:34 <aeonsolution[m]> <stdcerr "Hi All, I have a question: I hav"> Hey everyone in the channel. It is very important for us to all clarify that GrapheneOS does not actually remove Google proprietary software from AOSP because AOSP does not include Google apps and services to begin with. Using the phrase De-google is very misleading and we as a community should do better to describe GrapheneOS.
21:03:36 <aeonsolution[m]> As a fall back, there is nothing wrong with saying "GrapheneOS is an open source privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app compatibility." https://grapheneos.org/
21:05:25 <cn3m[m]> yes, there is nothing to degoogle from GrapheneOS since there is no google service in the first place to remove
21:07:48 <aeonsolution[m]> exactly ðŸ’¯
21:12:17 <Autopsy[m]> Although, to OP's defense, they did say that they want to degoogle their phone *with* GrapheneOS, so removing stock. But I totally agree with your connotations!

21:17:31 <aeonsolution[m]> <Autopsy[m] "Although, to OP's defense, they "> Yeah, I thought about that too but this is where we can jump in to clarify that GrapheneOS doesn't remove G apps and services. It builds the OS without them. So technically they are flashing an OS that doesn't include them.
21:18:51 <aeonsolution[m]> They aren't flashing an OS that removes them if that makes sense and the distinction is important because its what people use to describe GOS incorrectly.
21:19:10 <aeonsolution[m]> I hate the semantics of it, but people dont follow up on it.
21:19:33 <Autopsy[m]> Yeah. It's more about the services that they offer, rather than AOSP
21:19:43 <aeonsolution[m]> exactly
21:19:46 <Autopsy[m]> No Google, no AOSP. Well, at least currently
21:25:45 <cn3m[m]> <bypassbob[m] "Is the pixel 4 the best phone at"> yeah it probably will be for quite a while it might be faster than the Pixel 5 even
21:25:49 <cn3m[m]> it also has the IR array
21:25:53 <cn3m[m]> which is really cool
21:27:09 <louipc> stdcerr: https://plexus.techlore.tech/applications/google-maps
21:27:18 <louipc> google maps wont work
21:28:58 <bypassbob[m]> <cn3m[m] "it also has the IR array "> Is that the facial recognition? To be honest I think 2FA is the way forward but I donâ€™t like the idea of having the phone store my face on it
21:29:53 <cn3m[m]> <bypassbob[m] "Is that the facial recognition? "> it is a fuzzed mathmatical representation stored in the Titan M
21:29:59 <cn3m[m]> it is definitely safe
21:30:12 <cn3m[m]> kills the shoulder surfing vector or CCTV
21:30:19 <cn3m[m]> times out after 48 hours
21:35:51 <faxing[m]> Or does it even make a difference which one?
21:36:22 <bypassbob[m]> What times out? The image deletes itself?
21:44:20 <Autopsy[m]> <louipc "google maps wont work"> Well, that's funny, because it works for me.
21:46:33 <bypassbob[m]> The encros had a remote wipe feature that would be pretty cool in the form of an open source app
21:53:33 <bypassbob[m]> Also a code you could type in lock screen that was customisable that would wipe too
21:54:41 <faxing[m]> <Autopsy[m] "Either one is fine. It is up to "> Alright, thanks
22:36:34 <louipc> hmm interesting
22:54:29 <VincentLeRoux[m]> <cn3m[m] "yeah it probably will be for qui"> What about the battery? Does it lasts longer than 3a?
23:02:22 <dazinism> Think the 3aXL has  better battery life than any of the other supported devices. Then I think the 3a. The XL versions have bigger batteries so should outperform their smaller counterparts.
23:13:53 <bypassbob[m]> So would you recommend an XL over standard size? Iâ€™m getting a 4 next few days
23:21:10 <ThomCat[m]> The 4 XL has a much larger battery (3700mAh vs 2800)
23:46:55 <bypassbob[m]> <ThomCat[m] "The 4 XL has a much larger batte"> No brainier then
23:47:49 <ThomCat[m]> Yep.  I have the 4 XL, and honestly if you can hold out for a $a XL it might be worth it to consider.  I really really miss having a fingerprint sensor
23:47:56 <cn3m[m]> yeah Pixel 4 battery is bad
23:48:04 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4 XL is the sweet spot
23:48:12 <cn3m[m]> decent battery, great performance, best security
23:48:15 <cn3m[m]> longest support
23:48:16 <ThomCat[m]> COVID has shown just how insipidly stupid it is to get rid of a fingerprint sensor
23:48:27 <ThomCat[m]>  * Yep.  I have the 4 XL, and honestly if you can hold out for a 4a XL it might be worth it to consider.  I really really miss having a fingerprint sensor
23:48:33 <cn3m[m]> <ThomCat[m] "COVID has shown just how insipid"> Facial Recognition is a lot more secure
23:49:02 <ThomCat[m]> That's something I didn't consider
23:50:12 <JTL> Another problem with facial scanning is it's a high frequency LED near the infrared spectrum
23:50:18 <JTL> Can be issue with epilepsy or other medical conditions
23:50:22 <cn3m[m]> Fingerprints for example work while you are sleeping and generally are easier to fake. Facial recognition on devices with a good IR array(pretty much just iPhones and Pixel 4) are the ideal way to go
23:51:00 <faxing[m]> Does all of the Face Unlock and the gesture above the phone stuff work on the 4 on Grapene?
23:51:12 <JTL> Didn't the first iteration of Pixel 4's face unlock not have awareness detection? :P
23:51:30 <ThomCat[m]> Yep.
23:51:31 <cn3m[m]> <JTL "Didn't the first iteration of Pi"> correct it required an update
23:51:39 <JTL> lol fail
23:51:47 <cn3m[m]> <faxing[m] "Does all of the Face Unlock and "> not the gestures iirc, but the Face Unlock yes
23:51:58 <JTL> Personally I think 2FA for any form of biometrics is a good future goal
23:52:11 <cn3m[m]> <JTL "lol fail"> yes, but now there is no real shortcoming compared to say an iPhone(at least if you use GrapheneOS)
23:52:17 <JTL> right
23:52:36 <cn3m[m]> it is still rather questionable on stock for locally security when you don't have restricted USB
23:52:42 <cn3m[m]> which GrapheneOS and iOS would
23:53:05 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4 has generational improvements for security as well
23:57:09 <bypassbob[m]> <JTL "Personally I think 2FA for any f"> I agree. Also a button combination with the encro phones if you pressed just the power once it would start a fake android os. If you clicked the power 3 times then held on 3rd it would start up the real os
23:58:59 <cn3m[m]> the better way would probably be a profile can be more resistant forensics in some cases
23:59:14 <cn3m[m]> there is a GrapheneOS issue for that iirc on GitHub
