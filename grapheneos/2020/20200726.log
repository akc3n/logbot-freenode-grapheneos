Incidentally, my partner's friend has an Alexa (I know...) and they placed the phone near the speaker whilst on video call with me. So, I said "Alexa, turn the volume to 11."

03:45:03 <ille_[m]> Hi everyone! I’m on the verge on completely dropping iOS and iPhone in exchange for a Google Pixel 3a w GrapheneOS as I’ve been way more privacy and security conscious over the last month but I’m not sure if I should hold off until a Pixel 4a release or if I should get the Pixel 4 right now for long term support
03:45:24 <ille_[m]> Would like to hear some recommendations if possible 😊
03:54:07 <nickcalyx[m]> Nobody really knows when the 4a will be out for sure
03:54:42 <nickcalyx[m]> So I vote to go for it
03:55:07 <jknsec[m]> ille_ If money is not too much of an issue get the 4 instead of waiting
03:56:11 <nickcalyx[m]> I wonder if the 4a will have a headphone jack and fingerprint reader though
04:16:11 <wreck[m]> I'm trying to convince my wife to just switch to iPhone so I can have her 3a lol
04:16:17 <ille_[m]> Like most other tech manufacturers I have a bad feeling it’s probably not going to have either since they want to phase them out for face biometrics
04:16:41 <ille_[m]> and wireless audio
04:17:04 <travankor_> the 4 has flickering issues because it’s stuck at 90hz
04:17:17 <travankor_> for graphene
04:18:22 <travankor_> it’s only noticeable at low brightness
04:19:19 <nightjar[m]> <ille_[m] "Would like to hear some recommen"> Keep in mind that the 4a will probably not have Graphene support until a little while after its release in the case that it is released soon.
04:19:33 <ille_[m]> Is there an estimated time frame for support for the pixel 3a? I don’t want to grab one and have its support dropped in the next year
04:20:09 <ille_[m]> Might have to adjust to the speed difference too coming from an iPhone XS Max 😖
04:20:24 <nightjar[m]> It should be supported until May 2022 since it was released in May 2019 and has at least three years of guaranteed support
04:46:54 <ille_[m]> <faxing[m] "though if graphene dies or somet"> Is there any difference between the two? And is there a risk of graphene dying?
04:50:16 <nightjar[m]> <ille_[m] "Might have to adjust to the spee"> One thing you can do as a "speed improvement" to compensate is go into Android's Developer Settings and change the Window animation, Transition animation, and Animator duration scales down to 0.5x instead of the default 1x. It of course does not actually improve performance and I don't know if it has any negative security implications, but it certainly makes your UI
04:50:16 <nightjar[m]> experience a lot faster.
05:22:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> faxing: this is a reminder that glassrom exists
05:24:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> <nightjar[m] "One thing you can do as a "speed"> Glassrom does the exact opposite
05:25:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Here's why
05:25:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Animations must not be quickened for speed
05:25:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Animations are like loading screens
05:26:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> They must be actually pleasing to look at. If you thought loading screens were placeholders for loading you'd be wrong
05:27:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Loading screens are made elaborate and beautiful on purpose to build up anticipation and excitement
05:27:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you feel your phone is not quick you should make the animation longer
05:28:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Shorter animations will reveal more lag
05:45:44 <nightjar[m]> I'll have to try out turning the animations scales up in that case. I used to have them on 1x originally and I turned them to 0.5x not long after I received my phone. I was more pleased with the latter, especially since I use gesture navigation instead of two-button. Mainly I thought that switching between windows, opening and closing menus and drawers, and rapidly using the features of gesture navigation was faster
05:45:44 <nightjar[m]> and the most optimal experience I could get for how I wanted to use my phone. Nevertheless, I will try out turning up the scales for a while. Do you turn up all three scales equally? Maybe one can make windows switching snappy while still getting smoother loading screens elsewhere by adjusting them unequally.
05:49:29 <nightjar[m]> Just set all three to 2x and I'm starting to see what you mean.
05:50:17 <nightjar[m]> It's very different
06:00:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <nightjar[m] "I'll have to try out turning the"> Glassrom sets them to 1, 1.5 is recommended. I usually try to make the transition itself look smooth
06:05:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> I learned this from a Japanese chat app
06:05:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> The slower the system was the more elaborate the app made the animations
06:05:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Until it almost felt like it wasn't lagging
06:13:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google's other decision is also a disaster. They boost the CPU on every touch just to pass a latency test
06:13:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Boosting the CPU this way almost always triggers throttling and will cause a brief moment where the animation starts lagging
06:13:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember that the more you favor latency the less you're favoring performance
06:17:35 <nightjar[m]> Thank you for the insight. After testing out 2x I am beginning to see its virtues. I just set all three scales to 1.5x and I intend on using these settings for at least a couple of weeks more as a trial run.
06:19:18 <nightjar[m]> It actually seems like a stress-reducer
06:20:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well the CPU stuff can't be fixed that easily
06:20:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google likes to make huge changes to those parts
06:21:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> nightjar: this is the result I'd like to achieve on pixel 4

06:23:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> On the oneplus 7 pro tapping your screen won't boost the CPU. Boosting is entirely load based and even then it won't go to max unless you really push it
06:23:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> This however is a good thing. The op7pro sustains performance for far longer as it isn't heating up and achieves a 14 hour continuous use battery cycle at 90hz all the time
06:24:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'd be great if I can reproduce this on pixel 4 but simply copying my old work isn't possible
06:26:17 <nightjar[m]> I would imagine battery life would be better if the CPU was not boosted upon every user input

06:43:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> I usually just try to get some performance and battery out for fun
06:43:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need to focus on getting LTS merged in rn
06:45:59 <nightjar[m]> So even with the CPU performance remaining indifferent to touching the screen and the battery life consequently being higher, the experience is noticeably less laggy overall from the user's perspective?

15:44:43 <dazinism> hasnoname: yes through OS updates
15:45:49 <dazinism> If there is a important chromium security update GrapheneOS will get an OS update as soon as possible to provide that
15:47:43 <dazinism> Its a goal for GrapheneOS to have its own app store so app updates can be supplied without needing to build and test the whole operating system
15:48:15 <dazinism> The plan is to base that on the seamless (OS) update system
15:49:00 <dazinism> Apparently wouldnt be a whole load of work to get something basic and secure up and running
15:49:59 <g65434-2[m]> yeah but its kinda forcing apps to people

20:00:42 <Nikos[m]> <cn3m[m] "TPM is totally fine and good. Wi"> Even if this is true now, I doubt it ll stay that way for long. Here s a good example of what backdoors we ll have in the future
20:00:46 <cn3m[m]> where you can upload your keys for safe keeping
20:00:47 <cn3m[m]> which is goof ro most people
20:00:58 <cn3m[m]> the problem is encryption is too high a risk for most people
20:01:16 <cn3m[m]>  * which is good for most people
20:01:25 <hypokeimenon[m]> People, this is off topic
20:01:26 <cn3m[m]> the choice is good
20:01:36 <cn3m[m]> they are spreading misinfo
20:01:38 <anonhat[m]> Wow. You really are just an apologist for proprietary systems.
20:01:49 <cn3m[m]> FSF forces companies to essentially backdoor their systems
20:01:56 <cn3m[m]> that is not acceptable
20:02:30 <cn3m[m]> The Librem 5 and PinePhone have some firmware that is not updateable that should be
20:02:31 <anonhat[m]> Go take your M$ propaganda somewhere else.
20:03:22 <cn3m[m]> that is a terrible argument
20:03:57 <anonhat[m]> Grapheneos is open source for a reason. Transparency is inherently beneficial to trust, and intentionally included flaws in security have no excuse.
20:06:07 <anonhat[m]> For any software company to program a default of copying your crypto keys to their systems indefinitely is absurd. What Microsoft and Apple have done with their disk encryption is unacceptable.
20:07:01 <EssentialChaos[m> Bitlocker asks you where to save the recovery key
20:09:15 <anonhat[m]> But if you link a Microsoft account to your FDE Windows 10 system, your account password is your primary form of bitlocker authentication. And Microsoft has it at all times. It's also very difficult to remove a Microsoft account once it is paired with Windows 10.
20:10:10 <EssentialChaos[m> If you have a TPM, then your primary form of authentication is the key stored in there
20:11:41 <EssentialChaos[m> And, if you don't, Bitlocker asks for a password. Doesn't really make sense to tie an MS account to authentication, since one PC can be used by different people.
20:12:34 <EssentialChaos[m> > And, if you don't, Bitlocker asks for a password. Doesn't really make sense to tie an MS account to authentication, since one PC can be used by different people.
20:12:34 <EssentialChaos[m> Actually Bitlocker refused to do anything on an old laptop, which doesn't have a TPM, untill I manually allowed that in the group policy
20:12:43 <anonhat[m]> And what good does that do? It doesn't stop someone with physical access to your PC from gaining access. TPM does very little to enhance disk encryption.
20:13:20 <EssentialChaos[m> <anonhat[m] "And what good does that do? It d"> It does stop, they can't just boot a live Linux distro and access your files
20:13:51 <anonhat[m]> TPM only works when strong boot authentication is required, such as entering a truly secret key.
20:14:09 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "It does stop, they can't just bo"> And if they boot into the OS, they'd need a password for the user account
20:14:58 <anonhat[m]> If MS has they password, and they are compromised, you wouldn't need a live Linux system. Don't you understand?
20:15:09 <LinusSexTips[m]> Daniel doesn't like desktop talk >:(
20:15:11 <anonhat[m]> * If MS has the password, and they are compromised, you wouldn't need a live Linux system. Don't you understand?
20:15:36 <EssentialChaos[m> <anonhat[m] "If MS has they password, and the"> But MS doesn't have physical access to the device
20:15:45 <EssentialChaos[m> <LinusSexTips[m] "Daniel doesn't like desktop talk"> Yes, we should move this to offtopic
20:16:23 <alex-resist> I think we have the eternal discussion again. Anti-corporate Free Software views vs. (industrial) cybersecurity views. There is no solution that will please everyone
20:16:30 <anonhat[m]> But an attacker could both compromise the servers and gain physical access. It's less secure than not having a linked account.
20:17:23 <anonhat[m]> I wish I could connect to off-topic 😟
20:18:06 <overheadscallop[> anonhat: try this? https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
20:19:17 <anonhat[m]> It says not yet implemented in RiotX.
20:20:03 <overheadscallop[> Isn't the latest version the Element app? They said they're not going to work on RiotX any more
20:20:06 <EssentialChaos[m> <anonhat[m] "It says not yet implemented in R"> Change to Element
20:20:26 <EssentialChaos[m> Yes, Element is based on RiotX code
20:20:30 <anonhat[m]> I'm using element.
20:21:15 <overheadscallop[> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Try the link on the desktop/web app, it works there.
20:30:32 <anonhat[m]> I used the desktop app to connect. Now it works on my phone, even though I couldn't join the room on my phone for some reason.
20:38:50 <altoslos[m]> anonhat: Thanks for the good points :)
