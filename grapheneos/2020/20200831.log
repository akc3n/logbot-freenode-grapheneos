00:02:57 <overlycomplicate> dukedom_k: thank you! I'll give that a read!
00:29:09 <aeonsolution[m]> overlycomplicated: in short, the Pixel family line is the most supported with hardware, firmware, and software updates. Other android devices, especially those shipped from carriers are inherently less secure because they do put the same effort Google does to support their devices. Not to mention, carriers break the security model in android to put their software on a device you buy directly from them. AOSP is
00:29:09 <aeonsolution[m]> open source, and GrapheneOS add security and privacy features on top of that. The pixel phones have best security hardware of all android phones in the market but would be rendered useless if firmware updates were not pushed to patch known vulnerabilities.

00:31:21 <aeonsolution[m]> i would also ask you to do a little more research on the GrapheneOS by visiting the website-which it looks like you are already doing-and read all the documentation you can to get a better idea of how GOS secures your phone
00:32:11 <aeonsolution[m]> if that isnt enough, then feel free to jump into the projects Github and audit the code yourself, its open source for everyone to see and build for themselves
00:33:48 <simplefluorine[m> Anyone have any issues with screen flickering at low dimmer settings?  On a 4XL
00:34:12 <aeonsolution[m]> simplefluorine: its an upstream issue, there is a solution in the logs
00:34:18 <aeonsolution[m]> search flicker
00:34:29 <aeonsolution[m]> it should come up, sorry about that; i know its annoying
00:34:46 <simplefluorine[m> Ah no worries. Will do thanks!
00:36:02 <aeonsolution[m]> if you dont find it, send me a message and ill help you out
00:42:24 <simplefluorine[m> Ya found it. Looks it was classified as a hardware issue and closed.

00:46:27 <parazen616[m]> Is it possible to discuss a very interesting project I just found?
00:46:27 <parazen616[m]> I remember a discussion in here that was all about privacy  encrypted messengers privacy focused browser vpn services Tor..
00:46:27 <parazen616[m]> The project I found combines all of that together. They still have a far way to go on their roadmap. I was just playing around with the already released applications but they work very smoothly.. Nice interfaces etc
00:47:27 <parazen616[m]> https://docs.loki.network/
00:53:28 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: I was able to build and test Vanadium 85.0.4183.81. No problems reported.
00:58:39 <overlycomplicate> aeonsolution: Thats exactly what im going to do. Im working on a waterblock for my PC at the moment but I will be reading that later tonight. I immensely appreciate your help and description.
00:58:40 <overlycomplicate> On a different but related note, how does the security of graphene compare to lineage? What is the most inconvenient part of graphene that lineage is superior, if any?
00:59:59 <aeonsolution[m]> lineage doesn't aim to be a security and privacy focused project. it aims to be available on as many devices as possible. it also ships with userdebug builds the last time i checked.
01:00:11 <aeonsolution[m]> which breaks Android's security model
01:00:12 <overlycomplicate> aeonsolution: also, the compatibility and usability as well
01:00:35 <aeonsolution[m]> <overlycomplicate "aeonsolution: also, the compatib"> that is for you to check out! lol
01:01:47 <aeonsolution[m]> but i can answer more specific questions, that's very broad
01:02:16 <overlycomplicate> But isn't lineage supposed to be somewhat focused on security and privacy? One of the guys I listen to in an OSINT podcast that is extremely experienced in the field said that either lineage or graphene is a far superior choice as opposed to the stock rom that comes on the factory devices.
01:02:57 <overlycomplicate> His name is Michael Bazzell, fwiw.
01:03:37 <aeonsolution[m]> this is a complicated topic, can you make lineage more secure that stock Android? i believe you can, but is it more secure than stock Android. it is not.
01:04:06 <aeonsolution[m]> not out of the box at least
01:05:15 <aeonsolution[m]> https://source.android.com/setup/build/building
01:05:36 <overlycomplicate> I mean I wouldnt keep it stock right out of the box, I would use apps to harden the security further obviously. But I definitely was at least under the resumption it was more privacy oriented than samsung firmware, haha.
01:06:20 <overlycomplicate> Presumption* my apologies.
01:07:29 <aeonsolution[m]> its completely understandable. its really easy to gloss over those details by accident because you know that information. it just puts others that dont know that distinction at risk
01:09:38 <overlycomplicate> Well, that and I admit that I haven't researched as much as I should have. It has mostly been knowledge I've gotten from security professionals in related field, the xda forums, and YouTube videos. The documentation I have not read too much on myself, so that very well be the reason my assumption was incorrect, lol.
01:11:20 <overlycomplicate> Between work and school; which takes up an unbelievable amount of time, getting the chance to review the source code and developer notes is a rare occasion I have a chance to take advantage of.
01:14:03 <aeonsolution[m]> the learning never stops
01:18:45 <overlycomplicate> aeonsolution: That is for absolute certain. Ive been working with computer for almost a decade, and i feel like I barely know anything at all. Technology advances at such a rapid rate. Moores law feels like its every 3-6 months instead of 2 years. Its impossible to keep up with it all.
01:19:01 <overlycomplicate> Computers*
01:19:38 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, i feel you
01:21:48 <Vappy[m]> Yeah so
01:21:55 <Vappy[m]> I went through all of my apps one by one
01:22:08 <Vappy[m]> And by far, only snap requires Google services
01:22:34 <Vappy[m]> Which means if I make the switch to grapheneOS, I wouldnt miss much
01:23:00 <overlycomplicate>  aeonsolution So one last question about graphene: Since stock graphene doesn't support microg or anything related to Google, is it strictly apk installation of apps non-reliant on Google services?
01:24:24 <aeonsolution[m]> <overlycomplicate " aeonsolution So one last questi"> that is correct. if it works on android without google play services, itll work on GrapheneOS
01:24:37 <dominusart[m]> I am in market for new phone. I was planning on Pixel 3 but Pixel 4 is now the recommended phone on project's website. What would you people recommend? I am asking because Pixel 4 was kind of a flop as a device.
01:25:19 <renlord> dominusart[m]: do you care about taking photos?
01:25:23 <renlord> if no, 4a instead
01:25:54 <retry0x[m]>  @simplefluorine:matrix.org I'm on p4xl with the same issues. Not sure if it's my phone or the OS
01:26:03 <dominusart[m]> I am pretty sure it will take better photos than my current S4 anyway.
01:26:22 <renlord> dominusart[m]: i think you've already made up your mind ;)
01:26:37 <renlord> another satisfied customer, NEXT!
01:26:48 <dominusart[m]> Yeah, just asking to make sure.
01:29:07 <overlycomplicate> aeonsolution: Awesome. Thanks!
01:29:07 <overlycomplicate> renlord: So if you do care about taking photos, which one should I go with, the 3 or 4? I'd get the xl in either version if that matters.
01:29:20 <renlord> always the latest
01:30:00 <renlord> you want to maximise the number of supported years of hardware support
01:31:51 <dominusart[m]> Which is about 2 years anyway, unfortunately.
01:33:34 <renlord> 2+1
01:34:03 <overlycomplicate> Is anyone here using a pixel 4xl running graphene? If so, how do you like it, both the phone and how well it runs?
01:37:27 <simplefluorine[m> <overlycomplicate "Is anyone here using a pixel 4xl"> Yeah its great. Coming from a OnePlus 7 pro and like it alot
01:38:14 <dominusart[m]> <renlord "if no, 4a instead"> Hmm, I think I will go with the regular 4, because I can't really get Pixels in my country and 4 and 4XL are the only ones I can get my hands on here.
01:38:57 <overlycomplicate> simplefluorine: Awesome! Now I've also heard that you have to make sure you get the factory unlocked version for it to work, a carrier version isn't going to work. Is that true?
01:39:29 <simplefluorine[m> Correct
01:42:35 <overlycomplicate> Okay, thats what I was thinking. Ebay from a trusted, high rated seller would probably be my best bet for getting one at a reasonable price, you think?
01:42:44 <renlord> best to buy directly from google store
01:43:23 <dominusart[m]> Something like "trusted seller" on ebay even exists anymore?
01:45:50 <overlycomplicate> dominusart: Yes. They have hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of positive feedback, and have been on ebay for 15-20+ years. Plus, eBay has gotten WAYYYYYY better as far as you not getting stuck with junk like it was in the old days. You have 30 days to return an item, regardless of the "no returns" banner the seller may have on their page. Ebay honors it too, surprisingly they do a really good job with it.
01:46:16 <simplefluorine[m> Honestly just ordered from amazon myself
01:46:58 <dominusart[m]> huh, good to hear they are trying to make platform more secure nowdays.
02:00:05 <overlycomplicate> I dont know if any of you guys have ever heard of a mic block, but its something that you can plug in your aux port and it blocks any sound coming into the phone (to prevent listening in from a malicious party). Now, i know that most phones have done away with that, but my question is: is it possible to do that with a type C port since thats where we plug in wired headphones now with phones that do not have the
02:00:05 <overlycomplicate> 3.5 aux port
02:00:17 * overlycomplicate uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200830-213749_Fennec F-Droid.jpg (84KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/SXOugDRCNcFNBVXSbmfcJdgx/Screenshot_20200830-213749_Fennec F-Droid.jpg >
02:00:23 <overlycomplicate> They look like this.
02:04:06 <overlycomplicate> I cant find a type c version, which leads me to believe its not possible to do because they surely wouldve created on if it did work. But why would it not work for type c ports but it will work for 3.5mm jacks?
02:04:51 <overlycomplicate> They're both used for headphone connections, so I'm not sure why it doesn't work.
03:55:28 <brockin042[m]> EBay has been shipping everything with fed ex for free.
04:21:07 <jneplokh> overlycomplicated: I don't really see the point since if someone really did want to listen they would just switch the mic input...
04:22:27 <Paradox991> With the pixel 4 XL lacking the visual core and having the nerual core instead does it still support hardware HDR+ processing?
04:26:27 <JTL> jneplokh: Yeah. Not sure how easy it is do with Qualcomm audio chipsets but it's been done with Realtek audio chipsets on PCs in the past
04:26:36 <JTL> (i.e bypassing these mic-block "protections")

12:31:45 <ham5urg> Is there any tablet I can compile GrapheneOS for?
12:33:34 <Autopsy[m]> <ham5urg "Is there any tablet I can compil"> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
12:34:15 <ham5urg> I know this page but I hoped for nut supported but working devices.
12:34:27 <Autopsy[m]> Many other devices are supported by GrapheneOS at a source level, and it can be built for them without modifications to the existing GrapheneOS source tree. Device support repositories for the Android Open Source Project can simply be dropped into the source tree, with at most minor modifications within them to support GrapheneOS. In most cases, substantial work beyond that will be needed to bring the support up to the
12:34:28 <Autopsy[m]> same standards. For most devices, the hardware and firmware will prevent providing a reasonably secure device, regardless of the work put into device support.
12:36:28 <ham5urg> ". For most devices, the hardware and firmware will prevent providing a reasonably secure device" There is no device quite equal to the Pixels with tablet-form-factor?
12:37:05 <Autopsy[m]> <ham5urg "". For most devices, the hardwar"> Afraid not. Unless Google release a Pixel tablet
12:38:40 <Autopsy[m]> Pixel Slate looks alright and it uses the Titan C chip, but I don't think Android is able to be on it.
12:39:59 <Autopsy[m]> So from a security standpoint, the next best tablet would be an iPad
12:40:26 <Autopsy[m]> But for privacy equal to GrapheneOS,  that's debatable.
13:20:41 <trismous[m]> And from standpoint of usability Android tablets aren't very good. Apps usually aren't well optimized for them.
13:24:15 <djee737ejdd[m]> Any way to add Qwant as standard search engine in Chromium? Vanadium / Bromite.

23:27:40 <Boxapt> after running flash-all.bat, my pixel 3a now says it can't find an os. the only option on the phone is to press the power button to power off except when i do press/hold it, nothing happens?
23:27:58 <Boxapt> and the device isn't showing in cmd when i type adb devices
23:47:01 <Boxapt> running 'adb reboot bootloader' in cmd returns 'no devices/emulators found'
