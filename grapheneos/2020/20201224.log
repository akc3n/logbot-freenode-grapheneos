00:03:21 <greentaco> OK, it's still going but it's taking longer than the first times i've tried.
00:03:36 <greentaco> It was the USB port that I was using
00:03:52 <Cann0n> Hey
00:04:13 <greentaco> thanks I did it, thanks guys
00:04:22 <Cann0n> greentaco: installing new?
00:04:22 <strcat[m]> now you can lock
00:04:24 <strcat[m]> and should all be good
00:04:35 <greentaco> awesome yes.
00:04:37 <strcat[m]> greentaco: broken USB cables / ports are the most common issue
00:04:58 <strcat[m]> added some more information on that to prerequisites
00:05:01 <greentaco> yeah, I have four usb ports the One plus cable did infact work I was using a bad port.
00:05:17 <greentaco> old computer for this
00:05:53 <Cann0n> Im new too. Dont be shocked if some apps you used to use dont work anymore. Luckily most things have a website you can use instead. I only had 2 apps I used to use not work. Lyft and Ring
00:06:53 <Cann0n> Other than that, there's better alternatives. I called the Black and Red suggestions on setup and been tweaking it non-stop since Saturday. I finally got the phone I exactly wanted
00:07:10 <greentaco> yeah now the tweaking part for me.
00:08:52 <Cann0n> thats the best part. I love GrapheneOS
00:28:01 <Guest944> Hi, i wanna know if its possible to recover deleted data from my pixel with grapheneos? I know this is possible with android but wonder if it can be done with grapheneos also?
00:29:01 <strcat[m]> depends on how you deleted it and how you're attempting to recover it
00:29:27 <strcat[m]> if you delete a profile, none of the data stored in them can be recovered, due to wiping what's required to obtain the per-profile encryption key
00:29:55 <strcat[m]> the same thing applies to an app deleting a keystore key they used to encrypt data
00:30:06 <Guest944> And if i have only 1 profile and delete file the normal way
00:30:36 <strcat[m]> if you want reliable deletion within a profile without deleting the profile, the data needs to be encrypted with a keystore key that you delete
00:31:01 <Guest944> If i use signal for example, and delete the signal app, is the keystore key also deleted?
00:31:09 <strcat[m]> yes
00:31:21 <strcat[m]> signal encrypts the database with a keystore key, so for Signal, that reliably deletes the whole Signal database
00:31:26 <strcat[m]>  * Signal encrypts the database with a keystore key, so for Signal, that reliably deletes the whole Signal database
00:31:29 <strcat[m]> most apps don't do that
00:31:48 <Guest944> And if i wipe my phone, if that the same and data cannot be recovered?
00:31:52 <strcat[m]> Signal would ideally use a StrongBox key rather than traditional TEE keystore key though
00:32:11 <strcat[m]> Guest944: yes, that reliably prevents recovering the encryption keys
00:32:33 <strcat[m]> for all profiles and for the device encryption keys used to encrypt non-sensitive data outside of profiles
00:32:58 <strcat[m]> Guest944: deleting profiles (or wiping the device as a whole) is reliable, as is deleting data by wiping the hardware keystore keys used to encrypt it
00:33:16 <Guest944> Okey, so if i recieve a picture thru signal for example, deleting only the picture from the map is not enough
00:33:29 <strcat[m]> deleting files in general does not reliably prevent recovering that data (for someone with root access and the encryption keys)
00:34:02 <strcat[m]> Guest944: Signal only uses a single keystore key so you can reliably delete the database as a whole, you can't *reliably* delete data without doing that
00:35:15 <Guest944> Oke , so the safest way is to use a second profile and deleting the profile.
00:35:23 <strcat[m]> Guest944: you can delete it, sure, and we changed SQLite to use secure deletion by default (i.e. wipe the data) but that doesn't absolutely prevent recovery
00:35:40 <strcat[m]> Guest944: or uninstall Signal, or clear the app data for it
00:35:47 <strcat[m]> either of those reliably deletes the keystore key
00:36:03 <Guest944> Okey i understand, thanx for the explaiation
00:36:11 <strcat[m]> (but again, ideally, they'd use the StrongBox keystore, not a TEE keystore)
00:36:17 <strcat[m]>  * (but again, ideally, they'd use the StrongBox keystore, not the TEE keystore)
00:36:34 <Guest944> And signal used TEE at this moment?
00:37:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> Why do they use the TEE keystore?
00:37:23 <strcat[m]> wiping the device, deleting the profile or deleting a StrongBox keystore key (any of these is pretty much guaranteed to work) > deleting a TEE keystore key > wiping the data > deleting stuff
00:37:32 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenonüñ§‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà: it's the older API, you have to explicitly support using the newer one
00:38:10 <Guest944> How do i only delete TEE keystore keys in geaphene?
00:38:13 <strcat[m]> you have to call .setIsStrongBoxBacked(true)
00:38:26 <strcat[m]> Guest944: keystore keys are made by apps via the keystore API
00:38:42 <strcat[m]> when you clear app data or uninstall the app, it deletes their keys, or they can do it on a case-by-case basis themselves
00:38:48 <strcat[m]> Signal uses a TEE keystore key to encrypt their database
00:39:12 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore#HardwareSecurityModule
00:39:21 <strcat[m]> they could add .setIsStrongBoxBacked(true), catch error when not supported and do it without it
00:39:40 <strcat[m]> it's simple to use, same API (just doesn't support as much algorithm bloat)
00:40:10 <analtenderloin[m> Why is it that when I use network level firewalls like in Calyx and Lineage apps without internet don't crash but if I use the permission based firewall in graphene apps will oftentimes crash on launch
00:40:28 <strcat[m]> first of all, those network level things don't work
00:40:45 <qubits> strcat  what do you think about thi statement from Threema
00:40:52 <qubits> Threema includes its own app-specific encryption based on AES-256 to protect stored messages, media and your ID's private key. The key used for this encryption is generated randomly the first time you start Threema, and can optionally be protected by setting a Master Key Passphrase in the settings, which we highly recommend. Without a passphrase, the encryption will only add obscurity due to the way hardware encryption is handled on Android
00:40:52 <qubits> . If you set a Master Key Passphrase, you will have to enter it after every restart of the device (and after the system has terminated the app due to low memory).
00:40:54 <strcat[m]> they don't block network access via IPC APIs and mostly don't prevent all ways of using the network directly either
00:41:46 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: so, one reason is that they're not actually preventing it, the other is they're not forbidding doing it just breaking the connections
00:42:59 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: GrapheneOS takes away the permission to use either direct or indirect network access - of any kind
00:44:20 <analtenderloin[m> The internet permission is actually in AOSP right?  Its just not visible to the user?
00:44:24 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: those features elsewhere just reject connections via one form of direct network access - the apps can still access the network via APIs requiring INTERNET access and can still use localhost to communicate to other apps including across profiles, etc.
00:44:33 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: yes, we make it into a runtime toggle
00:44:42 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: so apps already know to declare if they need it
00:45:01 <strcat[m]> although they don't have code to handle it as a dynamic permission, so some assume they always have it
00:45:23 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: apps often don't have proper error handling, only error handling for errors they have seen, not all errors that can occur
00:45:53 <analtenderloin[m> Why would AOSP include an internet permission if its granted by default always on stock?
00:46:33 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: because it's a good thing for apps to protect themselves by declaring what they actually need and not having access to things they don't need
00:46:51 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: there are a bunch of low-level "normal" permissions for non-sensitive things
00:47:01 <strcat[m]> the "dangerous" permissions are the ones that are user-facing (allow access to sensitive data)
00:47:10 <strcat[m]> we change INTERNET from "normal" to "dangerous"
00:47:30 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense to do it for the other "normal" permissions - most also just allow an app to request something, not actually to do something
00:47:46 <Guest944> Is there an app as good as signal that uses strongbox instead of tee keystore?
00:47:49 <strcat[m]> for example there's one to allow apps to request a battery optimization exception, one to allow apps to request to toggle Wi-Fi, etc.
00:48:04 <strcat[m]> it's not a good reason to use another app
00:48:10 <strcat[m]> it would be easy to change that in Signal if you cared
00:48:23 <strcat[m]> literally 1 API call with a single argument set to true
00:48:48 <strcat[m]> 1 line of code if requiring StrongBox, otherwise a few more to catch the error when not supported and redo it without it set
00:49:31 <Guest944> So how do i change that code? I never changed anything in apps sorry
00:49:33 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: disabling INTERNET disallows apps from creating connections or listening for connections (including on localhost) and disallows them from using APIs requiring INTERNET
00:49:36 <qubits> Threema is far better then Signal, Session is also far better then signal, thats what i was told
00:50:01 <hypokeimenon[m]> I don't think you can judge something to be far better on hearsay
00:50:07 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: the toggles elsewhere only reject specific kinds of connections and don't prevent apps from listening / connecting via localhost or from using APIs requiring INTERNET to connect to *anything* on the internet via that API
00:50:32 <strcat[m]> qubits: and you're not on an expert so maybe you shouldn't be repeating things like that without at least giving a source
00:50:40 <hypokeimenon[m]> It's getting off topic for the room anyway. #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
00:51:04 <qubits> hypopke actually i readed statments from cryptograh when they where analzing some applications
00:56:14 <Guest944> Is there a explaination somewhere how to change signals TEE to strongbox, i m no developer but still want to do it on my phone
00:56:25 <valldrac> strcat[m]: I was not aware of the setIsStrongBoxBacked call. I'll add it to Molly
00:57:13 <alex-resist> dazinism btw I got the USB 3 cable today but still it's not working. Now I suspect the DVI->HDMI adapter. It's nerve-racking
00:57:45 <qubits> Local data security is for sure better on Threema , also group chats are on threema real end to end encrypted. I m refering to cryptography_whitepaper of threema and independent audit from cnlab  research
00:57:46 <valldrac> strcat[m]: seems trivial to implement. I wrongly assumed it defaults to StrongBox when it's available
00:58:29 <alex-resist> dazinism if it works, it would be such a breakthrough. Also an affordable one, since the hardware costs like 30 bucks. If not, I don't even know if I should be disappointed
00:58:33 <madaidan[m]> <qubits "Local data security is for sure "> Press (X) to doubt
00:58:41 <strcat[m]> valldrac: look at Auditor for an example
00:58:44 <strcat[m]> it's also easy to check if it's being used
00:59:03 <strcat[m]> you can check with the API but also with the CN of the public key certificate
00:59:07 <strcat[m]> it puts the keystore type
01:00:01 <strcat[m]> valldrac: StrongBox is a proper secure element (Titan M on Pixels, Qualcomm SPU on most other devices that have support for it) and has internal secure storage
01:00:05 <strcat[m]> and can reliably delete directly from that
01:00:44 <strcat[m]> TEE keystore is messy - TEE has a lot of attack surface and has to delegate storage to the OS (it encrypts the keys with the hardware-bound key it has in hardware and passes them to the OS to store them)
01:00:57 <valldrac> strcat[m]: I generate an HMAC key in the KeyStore to derive user's password. It should be generated randomly inside the cryptoprocessor
01:01:00 <strcat[m]> and it has rollback resistance to prevent reusing a deleted key
01:01:20 <strcat[m]> valldrac: yeah that's a good way to do it
01:01:54 <strcat[m]> valldrac: StrongBox is just better because it's an actual secure element, not an execution mode on the CPU sharing CPU hardware and delegating storage to the OS (after encrypting it with a key unavailable to the OS)
01:02:21 <strcat[m]> way lower attack surface (hardware and the far smaller and simpler API / implementation of the secure element)
01:02:54 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm SPU is a separate secure element on the SoC - which is fine, it's properly isolated from the CPU
01:03:22 <strcat[m]> TEE is a lot less good because it's just a fancy execution mode on the CPU, lot more prone to side channels than a separate secure element and the design of it has far larger attack surface
01:03:32 <valldrac> strcat[m]: so I assume without the StrongBox setting, there is a chance that the HMAC computation is done in the main CPU instead of the crypto processor (secure element)
01:03:40 <strcat[m]> TEE is basically designed to run a supervisor that has full access to the OS and monitors it in some way to detect compromise, etc.
01:03:51 <strcat[m]> it's not a good design for a place to put a keystore, etc.
01:04:07 <strcat[m]> it's just what is available if you don't have a proper secure element to use
01:04:38 <strcat[m]> valldrac: TEE isn't a secure element - it's a CPU mode, the Qualcomm TEE delegates crypto to the SoC crypto engine
01:04:44 <strcat[m]> valldrac: but not all of it
01:04:55 <strcat[m]> valldrac: and it does do things on the main CPU
01:05:13 <strcat[m]> the crypto engine does have HMAC
01:05:28 <strcat[m]> valldrac: TEE is not a secure element and doesn't use one
01:05:49 <strcat[m]> valldrac: the keys are encrypted and passed to the OS to store, it doesn't have storage itself, it has secure storage in the sense that the OS can't get those keys
01:06:16 <strcat[m]> but if you delete a TEE key it has to rely on the OS deleting it + rollback resistance implementation to prevent reusing a deleted key
01:06:25 <strcat[m]> vs. StrongBox that is an actual secure element with secure storage and deletes it reliably from that storage
01:06:31 <alex-resist> strcat we'll have a talk at this year's RC3 (remote CCC) and we will mention & recommend GrapheneOS
01:06:39 <strcat[m]> valldrac: there's no real reason to use TEE keystore aside from backwards compatibility
01:06:58 <hypokeimenon[m]> <alex-resist "strcat we'll have a talk at this"> pardon the ignorance, but who's we?
01:07:09 <strcat[m]> every keystore use should really be designed to use StrongBox and fall back to TEE if unavailable (or refuse to function at all if it's really important)
01:07:14 <valldrac> strcat[m]: got it! it's odd they don't make the strongbox by default when the secure element is available
01:07:18 <alex-resist> Me & another person from resist.berlin

01:17:02 <Guest944> Well at least something good came out of my question, valldrac s going to improve molly, going to screenshot this conversation and print it out, hang it above my bed like a troffee
01:56:51 <Latin_IME_Q> Greetings all. I have a question about the default keyboard, and something I noticed. Can anyone confirm which they have installed, or given option of? Currently, I have two Pixel 4a's with me, both running the same/latest build of GrapheneOS, but one (which has been used for a while prior) has the Android AOSP Keyboard for input, and the other,
01:56:51 <Latin_IME_Q> fresh install, shows "GrapheneOS Keyboard". I have no idea how or why the difference, as I never installed "Android AOSP Keyboard" on the first phone.
01:57:52 <Latin_IME_Q> Is this discrepancy known? I tried searching, but couldn't find any info.
02:00:35 <Latin_IME_Q> Perhaps it's nothing, but being an input method, I wanted to be sure. I checked the repo, and it looks like the latest LatinIME package states the appname is "Android Keyboard (AOSP)" @ https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_inputmethods_LatinIME/blob/11/java/res/values-en-rGB/strings-appname.xml#L23
02:01:58 <Latin_IME_Q> If both phones are running the latest release, updated from the GrapheneOS servers ('default' way of updating), I would have expected the second phone to show "Android Keyboard (AOSP)" like the first. Thanks in advance for any help/insight.
02:03:43 <Latin_IME_Q> Found this commit (with a message of 'rebranding') which does show "GrapheneOS Keyboard" in the strings, and I am a bit confused. https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_inputmethods_LatinIME/commit/b1997bcd557c378483bd4405345a639e603dcd5b
02:11:32 <Latin_IME_Q> Nevermind! I figured it out. It was due to different default system languages. Apologies for the wall of text.
03:05:35 <Liakde[m]> <Guest944 "I like molly but molly does not "> That's working as intended
03:13:53 <Liakde[m]> If you used passphrase lock
03:24:01 <organicpumpkin[m> <Liakde[m] "That's working as intended"> So can Molly not even get call notifications or ring when called if it is locked?
03:29:59 <Liakde[m]> <organicpumpkin[m "So can Molly not even get call n"> If you setup the passphrase lock, as it clears unencrypted data on RAM on lock screen

09:06:32 <ayaen_t[m]> is the reason why it is recommended to stick to the instructions got anything to do with the possibility that not following the instructions might compromise the factory image and hence render all the effort put into signature and authentication useless?
09:06:46 <somenerd[m]> > Hi - New Graphene user here. Should I be concerned about installing apps that are not open source (fDriod)? Also, is Fdroid safe?
09:06:46 <somenerd[m]> I was talking about this question
09:06:55 <paranoid11> OK
09:06:59 <ayaen_t[m]> or am i just talking in air?
09:07:02 <somenerd[m]> > is the reason why it is recommended to stick to the instructions got anything to do with the possibility that not following the instructions might compromise the factory image and hence render all the effort put into signature and authentication useless?
09:07:02 <somenerd[m]> possible bugged install and bricking your phone
09:07:31 <somenerd[m]> those are the main reasons I can see
09:07:50 <ayaen_t[m]> i was under the impression pixels are harder to brick
09:07:59 <somenerd[m]> but not impossible
09:09:19 <somenerd[m]> also following other guides may cause unofficial software to be used
09:09:31 <somenerd[m]> (I believe techlore's one was an example of this)
09:09:33 <ayaen_t[m]> yes . cant imagine the situation in this room withoutvthe installation guide
09:10:12 <paranoid11> Are there any good 3rd party guides for best privacy practices using GrapheneOS?
09:10:50 <paranoid11> (There's not much info about 3rd party apps etc on the main website)
09:11:07 <somenerd[m]> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/Home
09:11:10 <somenerd[m]> this wiki can help
09:11:21 <somenerd[m]> (general android privacy and security)
09:11:28 <somenerd[m]> even a section on apps
09:11:31 <paranoid11> Thnak you
09:14:48 <somenerd[m]> > yes . cant imagine the situation in this room withoutvthe installation guide
09:14:48 <somenerd[m]> probably a mess
09:25:49 <ayaen_t[m]> it would be nice if we did put together some basic/sane recommendations to improve privacy
09:25:49 <ayaen_t[m]> like i wasnt aware until after hauling all the apps in the owner user profile that it is recommended to use a secondary profile for daily use
09:26:52 <ayaen_t[m]> many things are covered in the site itself though
09:27:18 <strcat[m]> the reason is just because you have to log into the owner profile before you can use others (and can put secondary ones fully at rest without reboot, for the same reason)
09:27:28 <ayaen_t[m]> like lte is recommended any random vpn app is not recommended etc
09:28:54 <ayaen_t[m]> yes . and that is quiet an enhancement all by itself i feel we should put that somewhere where all can read
09:29:41 <ayaen_t[m]> before going off and trying to get gcam work , lol!
09:30:11 <Golli[m]2> strcat Would the OS Issue Tracker repo be the best place for feature requests/suggestions?
09:41:08 <graphiteos[m]> Anyone else having problems with the `.backup.metadata` file from seedvault not syncing to nextcloud?
10:04:06 <somenerd[m]> >  Would the OS Issue Tracker repo be the best place for feature requests/suggestions?
10:04:06 <somenerd[m]> yeah, at least features directly related to the OS, and not Vanadium/Auditor/PDF Viewer
10:32:05 <avensurha> hello guys. i'm trying to install to a pixel 4a from linux. once you get to fastbootd, does that mean it's done?
10:36:19 <ayaen_t[m]> avensurha: hi there
10:36:40 <ayaen_t[m]> what do you mean by get to fastbootd?
10:36:59 <avensurha> hello ayaen_t[m]. i ran the flash-all.sh and ended up in fastbootd (menu)
10:37:31 <ayaen_t[m]> oh.
10:38:31 <avensurha> fastboot/adb binaries work
10:39:22 <ayaen_t[m]> did the flashall.sh end without anyissues?
10:40:14 <avensurha> "fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable."
10:40:27 <ayaen_t[m]> ohkay.
10:41:31 <avensurha> i used "sudo env "PATH=$PATH" ./flash-all.sh"
10:41:42 <ayaen_t[m]> did you follow the inatructiins here
10:41:42 <ayaen_t[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install
10:42:11 <avensurha> yep
10:42:27 <avensurha> i'll just try it on windows
10:43:37 <ayaen_t[m]> go for following the instructions  word by word that may help avensurha .  it also makes it easier to locate the problem
10:44:30 <ayaen_t[m]> all the best
10:45:43 <ayaen_t[m]> you coul try it again on linux if you were using arch  debian ubuntu.
10:46:19 <avensurha> thanks
10:47:24 <ayaen_t[m]> avensurha: my pleasure.
11:05:41 <avensurha> got past that error in windows ayaen_t[m]
11:05:46 <avensurha> i guess it'
11:05:51 <avensurha> it's a driver issue
11:10:21 <jenniffercyber35> hello
11:10:33 <Cann0n> Hey
11:10:47 <jenniffercyber35> Cann0n, do you have any questions
11:10:55 <jenniffercyber35> I can assist with Graphen Installation
11:10:57 <jenniffercyber35> Or reccomend apps
11:11:03 <jenniffercyber35> My personal reccomendation
11:11:05 <jenniffercyber35> =)
11:11:19 <jenniffercyber35> Also, remember to donate to Graphene to support the project
11:11:54 <jenniffercyber35> Is the Graphene OS hostname, randomized?
11:12:00 <jenniffercyber35> "hostname is randomized at boot by defaul" = copperhead
11:12:22 <Cann0n> Well no I have no issues with installation. I'm new to Android but not Linux. I have one question and a recommendation
11:13:04 <jenniffercyber35> yes
11:13:08 <jenniffercyber35> ask away
11:13:19 <Cann0n> I like swype style keyboards for mobile because I type fairly fast. Can gboard or SwiftKey be used without compromisinf provacy
11:13:39 <Cann0n> Compromising privacy
11:13:43 <jenniffercyber35> Gboard, I wouldnt use
11:13:46 <somenerd[m]> you can revoke the INTERNET permission
11:13:47 <jenniffercyber35> On Graphene anyway
11:13:51 <somenerd[m]> (remove network access)
11:13:55 <jenniffercyber35> True ^
11:14:03 <jenniffercyber35> Personally, I still wouldnt instally anything Google related
11:14:07 <Cann0n> Yeah I did that but I still don't trust it fully.
11:14:25 <jenniffercyber35> Yeah it could have some remote access code exploit feature
11:14:33 <Cann0n> Exactly.
11:14:42 <jenniffercyber35> Maybe a swype keyboard will be added to fdroid soon
11:14:49 <jenniffercyber35> But googles swype keyboard is the best imo
11:14:55 <jenniffercyber35> I just type manually these days
11:15:22 <jenniffercyber35> Ok whats your reccomendation?
11:16:07 <Cann0n> What map app for gps navigation is a solid pick?
11:16:54 <Cann0n> I used Osm last night and it was a disaster.
11:17:45 <jenniffercyber35> I just lookup directions on Google Maps and screenshot/write down the turn by turn directions
11:17:50 <jenniffercyber35> using Chrome
11:18:14 <jenniffercyber35> I think theres some offline Openstreetmaps software
11:19:45 <Cann0n> I've tried a lot of apps for nav. I use navigation a lot for work and recreational. I live in a big city.
11:20:13 <jenniffercyber35> I just memorize everywhere I need to go
11:20:18 <jenniffercyber35> Or lookup directions
11:20:21 <jenniffercyber35> Im like  a bird
11:20:29 <jenniffercyber35> I have a good internal compas and memory
11:20:32 <Cann0n> I'm not lol.
11:20:47 <Cann0n> I travel all over strange cities for work.
11:21:01 <jenniffercyber35> sounds like a street pharmacist
11:21:13 <Cann0n> Definitely not.
11:21:19 <jenniffercyber35> jk lol
11:22:32 <Cann0n> Apples maps have tried to kill me twice. "continue 300ft and turn right" yet we stopped the car 10 feet from going off of a cliff...
11:22:53 <Cann0n> Siri literally tried to have us drive off a cliff.
11:23:39 <jenniffercyber35> Yeah the CIA does that too
11:23:48 <jenniffercyber35> You know how modern cars can all be hacked?
11:23:59 <jenniffercyber35> Thats so the government can shut down cars at will
11:24:15 <jenniffercyber35> Civil Crisis? Cars Shut down
11:24:26 <jenniffercyber35> Police Chase? Car remotely shut down
11:24:39 <jenniffercyber35> Has lots of possible good benefits
11:24:52 <jenniffercyber35> Just gotta have some common sense
11:24:58 <jenniffercyber35> and not just blindly trust a GPS app
11:25:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
11:25:52 <Cann0n> Yes but it's a nice feature to have when on the road all of the time.
11:26:31 <jenniffercyber35> yes
11:26:36 <jenniffercyber35> Are you using Grapene?
11:26:49 <Cann0n> Correct.
11:26:49 <jenniffercyber35> Perhaps look for a Browser-based Live GPS navigation tool
11:26:55 <jenniffercyber35> I have a feeling it should be possible
11:27:11 <jenniffercyber35> Browser tab , webpage live GPS navigation with GPS permission sounds easily doable
11:27:19 <jenniffercyber35> PErhaps slightly laggy
11:28:02 <jenniffercyber35> hey I think i found it
11:28:08 <jenniffercyber35> Waze has a webpage gps navigaton
11:28:17 <jenniffercyber35> waze live map < search
11:28:50 <Cann0n> Yeah that's what I used when I was on iPhone.
11:28:59 <jenniffercyber35> Does it work
11:29:43 <Cann0n> It has an app that I used. Fairly good. But used a lot of data including accident reporting for route redirection
11:30:34 <jenniffercyber35> yeah
11:30:40 <jenniffercyber35> I dont think you can install the app on Graphene
11:30:45 <jenniffercyber35> But the live website looks perfect
11:31:08 <Cann0n> An off-line map like Osm is really what I want but less bloat. And a better updated UI because the turn arrows are very tiny
11:31:20 <jenniffercyber35> Whats wrong with osm?
11:31:30 <jenniffercyber35> does it speak 'turn left' etc
11:32:23 <Cann0n> You can't search by address
11:32:27 <jenniffercyber35> Look for openstreetmaps
11:32:32 <jenniffercyber35> wow lol just GPS?
11:32:47 <jenniffercyber35> I think I found an offline GPS navigation app
11:32:50 <jenniffercyber35> a few months ago
11:33:32 <Cann0n> So if someone texts me an address, I can't copy and past it. I have to enter it in sections. Then the address lastnight didn't come up.
11:34:20 <Cann0n> It put me on Gilmore Rd,  not Street. Which was 4 miles off route.
11:35:07 <Cann0n> So the process I found that works is to physically scroll to the point and drop a marker. Instead of typing an address
11:35:21 <Cann0n> Today I'll use another map
11:40:05 <jenniffercyber35> 'maps and gps navigation osmand+?
13:25:06 <r0tt0r[m]> just realised 4g calls dont work,just ends directly. switching to 3g works
13:29:28 <Golli[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "just realised 4g calls dont work"> I also have this issue.
13:33:23 <jpds> You need VoLTE for 4G calls
13:34:30 <r0tt0r[m]> normally my isp provides volte
13:35:58 <bentley> oh, that explains why my calls didn't work
13:36:22 <bentley> on tracfone (don't know the underlying service provider)
13:42:45 <Golli[m]> My provider does have VoLTE though :(
13:46:04 <r0tt0r[m]> im pretty sure that worked before in earlier versions
14:00:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> r0tt0r: we have a volte fix in testing but not enough people are testing
14:00:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is also a lot of inaction from device maintainers
14:29:16 <r0tt0r[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "r0tt0r: we have a volte fix in t"> ye i would like to help testing but currently need device
14:40:31 <COVID-1984> pretty sure "make & receive calls" -- make calls with: "ask first" has been reset a few times. Any idea why?
14:49:48 <mulbr[m]> r0tt0r saw you had a pull request with boot animation. What is best way to view that animation?
15:10:32 <r0tt0r[m]> <mulbr[m] "r0tt0r saw you had a pull reques"> is general its like 700 png files in 3stages
15:11:13 <r0tt0r[m]> i guess easiest is to use any unlocked android phone and put thebootanimation.zip in place
15:20:51 <Liakde[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "i guess easiest is to use any un"> Or generate it in imagemagick and play it?
15:20:52 <Liakde[m]> Unsure
15:21:52 <Cann0n> Hello
15:22:33 <r0tt0r[m]> <Liakde[m] "Unsure"> also open first image in part0 and go through with arrow keys
15:23:30 <Liakde[m]> <Cann0n "Hello"> Hello
15:24:19 <Cann0n> How are you?
15:24:20 <Liakde[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "also open first image in part0 a"> Oh, not too shabby, that works too
15:24:29 <Liakde[m]> I'm good
15:24:37 <fomijafi[m]> <COVID-1984 "pretty sure "make & receive call"> This happens to me after every reboot.
15:25:17 <Cann0n> I was on this morning talking with jennifercyber35 about maps and Swype style keyboards
15:26:09 <Cann0n> Osmand maps seen to be a good bet for navigation.
15:26:47 <Cann0n> Any advice on a map/nav app?
15:28:16 <Liakde[m]> Depends on the place (whether OSMand is usable, or need some traffic data of GMaps), but try asking #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org as well
15:28:46 <Liakde[m]> <Cann0n "Osmand maps seen to be a good be"> Yeah that's an alright choice
15:33:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Use google maps
15:33:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> They work
15:35:12 <Cann0n> Trying to avoid google maps on grapheneos
15:35:19 <COVID-1984> fomijafi[m]: damn :(
15:36:10 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: should we report that phone app resetting after every boot (according to fomijafi[m])?
15:38:52 <Liakde[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Use google maps"> On browsers, preferrably?
15:44:53 <COVID-1984> Liakde[m]: I have the actual Google Maps app installed... Hopefully it isn't doing anything nefarious considering it is only allowed to have my location when I do use it.
15:48:47 <ruddo[m]> Why not just use Osmand+ with warts and all.
15:59:01 <COVID-1984> ruddo[m]: cuz it just doesn't work as well for restaurants and stuff where I am
15:59:28 <COVID-1984> When you're in a social situation and people need to be fed you can't be like, "oh sorry, I need to use my super secret special boy map cuz Google blah blah"
15:59:29 <jpds> COVID-1984: So, edit the map and add them
15:59:44 <ruddo[m]> Not even with the wikepidea data maps?
16:00:12 <COVID-1984> ruddo[m]: not sure what that is
16:00:14 <ruddo[m]> Over here that works okay, and if i need to, I double check using the gapps browser.
16:00:26 <COVID-1984> im in eastern europe
16:06:36 <COVID-1984> ruddo[m]: ya unless running google maps is gonna mess with me, it doesn't make sense not to use it to find restaurants and stores usually.
16:11:01 <Cann0n> I'm checking it out via browser.
16:11:47 <Cann0n> Google maps hasn't steered me wrong. Apples maps tried to kill me twice. Once by telling me to drive 300ft and turn right even tho we were parked 10ft from a cliff
16:12:46 <ruddo[m]> Haha legendary apple maps hahaha
16:18:09 <Linus[m]1> that's pretty funny
16:23:12 <PowerM> Hi, got a Question. I'm moving from my Pixel 2 to a Pixel 3. Is it better to buy the pixel 3a instead?
16:23:56 <Cann0n> I bought a 4a
16:24:30 <PowerM> I know it's the recommended phone.. can't afford it for the moment, I'm buying second hand
16:24:31 <PowerM> nd
16:25:19 <Cann0n> If it's a good deal sure. I plan on keeping this phone until it breaks or my carrier no longer works.
17:15:00 <r0tt0r[m]> wish all merry christmas, stay healthy
