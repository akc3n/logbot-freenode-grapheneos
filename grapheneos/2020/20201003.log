00:12:22 <Bramble> I am trying to flash grapheneos on my pixel 3 right now
00:12:32 <Bramble> And I keep getting this error
00:12:33 <Bramble> ./flash-all.sh: 17: [: Illegal number: 1:81fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html

00:16:43 <Bramble> What
00:17:19 <strcat[m]> Bramble: sounds like you're not using normal fastboot
00:17:27 <strcat[m]> follow the instructions at https://grapheneos.org/install
00:17:45 <Bramble> I am
00:20:19 <Bramble> I will try downloading again though
00:25:25 <Bramble> Nope didn't work
00:26:51 <Bramble> same error
00:36:38 <strcat[m]> Bramble: https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
00:36:45 <strcat[m]> Sample output from fastboot --version afterwards:
00:36:52 <strcat[m]> Bramble: so what does fastboot --version say for you
00:36:56 <strcat[m]> it should match the output there
00:37:42 <Bramble> fastboot version 30.0.4-6686687
00:38:19 <strcat[m]> and are you running ./flash-all.sh in that shell?
00:38:58 <Bramble> yes
00:39:17 <ThomCat[m]> Type 'which fastboot' on your CLI
00:39:37 <Bramble> I moved all the files in blueline-factory-2020.09.25.00 to the platform tools folder
00:39:39 <ThomCat[m]> `which fastboot` whoops
00:39:41 <Bramble> ok one second
00:40:11 <Bramble> it says /usr/bin/fastboot
00:40:24 <Bramble> wait it's not using the one in the directory
00:40:38 <ThomCat[m]> Exactly
00:40:42 <ThomCat[m]> ðŸ˜„
00:40:46 <Bramble> kek
00:40:47 <ThomCat[m]> I've made that mistake many times
00:41:23 <Bramble> Can I just move the correct fastboot file out of platform tools without any additional files
00:43:15 <Bramble> there we go
00:47:44 <strcat[m]> sounds like they were not running fastboot --version in the same shell
00:51:11 <ThomCat[m]> I think they were, they were just calling the normal fastboot instead of the newer one in the working directory
00:57:14 <bonjour> hello again. in the version of grapheneos i installed on my pixel 3a today, some of the stock apps seem almost ancient! the calendar app for instance: its icon and ui looks like it came straight from the time of gingerbread or something. are there no good stocks apps being worked on by the AOSP team these days?
01:38:31 <Sheru[m]> Some are abandoned already
01:42:28 <strcat[m]> just avoid the sample apps like Calendar and Gallery
01:42:31 <strcat[m]> we'll remove them eventually
01:43:02 <strcat[m]> little reason for those to be developed as part of AOSP when so many apps for those are available
01:43:19 <strcat[m]> they were originally made as samples for developers to fork and so they could make standard APIs for interoperability between apps
01:43:31 <strcat[m]> a lot of calendar apps are forked from Etar, a lot of keyboards are forked from AOSP keyboard, etc.
01:43:39 <strcat[m]>  * a lot of calendar apps are forked from AOSP Calendar, a lot of keyboards are forked from AOSP keyboard, etc.
01:58:29 <dexlibre[m]> Has anyone had success in downloading signal?
02:11:54 <strcat[m]> haven't heard of people having problems with it
02:12:32 <inpharmaticist[m> Ive been using it with no issues.
02:22:27 <arouzing[m]> Hello, ran into an issue the other day with bromite. Its saying something is wrong with the dns even when its working perfectly fine on vandium. Was wondering if anyone else was having this issue.
02:38:04 <anupritaisno1[m4> [arouzing](https://matrix.to/#/@arouzing:matrix.org): upstream bromite bug, already known
02:41:13 <arouzing[m]> Gotcha.
02:45:29 <arouzing[m]> I think i found the issue. Fdroid is behind a few versions. If you download the latest from github directly it works perfectly fine.
02:45:47 <anupritaisno1[m4> > fdroid
02:45:56 <anupritaisno1[m4> That's your issue
02:46:40 <arouzing[m]> Well if you would like to recommended a better alternative im all ears.
02:55:37 <mythicc[m]> Can anyone help me figure out how to take a screenshot in vanadium?
02:58:24 <strcat[m]> mythicc: as normal
02:58:36 <strcat[m]> Chromium's incognito mode disables screenshots
02:58:38 <mythicc[m]> <mythicc[m] "Can anyone help me figure out ho"> Is there a slider to enable this? I realize its a security function btw
02:59:01 <strcat[m]> mythicc: it's part of incognito mode in Chromium, it stops you from accidentally leaving something persistent
02:59:18 <strcat[m]> just how Chromium is designed, not a Vanadium feature
03:01:26 <mythicc[m]> <strcat[m] "mythicc: it's part of incognito "> Oh that makes sense, also, for some reason my gallery app crashes whenever I do any type of editing to a screenshot. Is this a bug? (Pixel 4)
03:01:55 <strcat[m]> Gallery app is a sample app, use something else for serious usage
03:02:02 <strcat[m]> it's not an app we develop
03:02:16 <strcat[m]> you can see there's an issue on the tracker about replacing it / removing it
03:02:25 <strcat[m]> from much earlier
03:02:38 <strcat[m]> same goes for Calendar
03:02:47 <mythicc[m]> <strcat[m] "you can see there's an issue on "> Any fdroid recommendations?
03:02:57 <strcat[m]> I don't have a recommendation
03:03:02 <mythicc[m]> Ok
03:03:12 <strcat[m]> just don't use Calendar or Gallery beyond sample apps / testing
03:03:18 <strcat[m]> we plan to remove / replace both
03:04:22 <strcat[m]> mythicc: the issue is we can't just remove it because it's needed for testing stuff, we have to choose something to replace it, lots of alternatives lack permissive licenses
03:04:36 <strcat[m]> Etar is a good calendar app
03:04:38 <strcat[m]> but we can't bundle it
03:08:03 <mythicc[m]> Is there an app that has a internet kill switch setting? I currently use orbot but I would prefer wireguard w a kill switch for public WiFi so I don't stand out to any traffic analysis
03:10:54 <mythicc[m]> <mythicc[m] "Is there an app that has a inter"> Or OPENVPN...
03:12:08 <ghjllk[m]> I assume the ideal would be to have an app dev create and maintain a set of bundled apps for calendar, gallery, etc.
03:12:39 <ghjllk[m]> but I'm not sure how feasible that would be and it's obviously not vital to the project
03:17:07 <strcat[m]> mythicc: what do you mean by kill switch
03:17:32 <strcat[m]> mythicc: the OS VPN support has an always-on VPN toggle with an additional toggle for blocking connections not going through the VPN
03:21:08 <mythicc[m]> <strcat[m] "mythicc: what do you mean by kil"> I mean That any outgoing connections are prevented if the VPN/TOR connection drops. I am going to check my settings right now for that toggle thx
03:21:20 <strcat[m]> mythicc: that's what the toggle does
03:21:22 <strcat[m]> it's an OS feature
03:22:05 <strcat[m]> and GrapheneOS fixes an upstream bug with it involving switching between profiles
03:22:08 <mythicc[m]> <strcat[m] "mythicc: that's what the toggle "> Dope! I found it!
03:22:34 <strcat[m]> mythicc: the OS toggle prevents leaks at an OS level and forces all traffic through the app
03:22:53 <strcat[m]> you also need to make sure that the app doesn't pass through traffic (Orbot doesn't) when the connection drops
03:23:05 <strcat[m]> some OpenVPN apps are known to do that if you don't disable it in the configuration
03:23:18 <strcat[m]> they have to go out of the way to do that, and I think it's a pretty bad default, but some do it
03:26:41 <mythicc[m]> For my orbot VPN setting, I enabled both "always on" and "block connections without VPN", which solved my issue

04:37:18 <mythicc[m]> Do you believe grapheneos is more secure than a security oriented Linux distribution?
04:39:30 <mythicc[m]> I remember reading a post by Daniel micay specifically mentioning that he believes grapheneos is superior, primarily due to the fact that the firmware/hardware is more locked down.
04:42:57 <louipc> yes
04:43:31 <louipc> what disribution do u mean tho
04:46:44 <renlord> mythicc[m]: cant compare apples to oranges
04:46:48 <renlord> and its off-topic
04:48:02 <renlord> the mobile hardware setup is inherently more secure than its desktop counterpart, so you can do secure things that are impossible to pull off in consumer desktop hardware
04:58:07 <louipc> mythicc[m]:yea theres #grapheneos-offtopic for that discussion
05:17:46 <strcat[m]> mythicc: GrapheneOS is a Linux distribution
05:18:42 <mythicc[m]> <louipc "what disribution do u mean tho"> Tails OS Is any example
05:18:47 <strcat[m]> and the Linux kernel is the most rotten part of the tech stack
05:18:53 <strcat[m]> mythicc: Tails is not hardened
05:19:03 <strcat[m]> mythicc: doesn't have an application security model either
05:20:04 <strcat[m]> doesn't have industry standard mitigations and application security model let alone being hardened
05:20:25 <mythicc[m]> Good points
05:20:34 <M-quickbrownfox[> New to GrapheneOS just wanted to say hello to everyone

05:44:53 <mythicc[m]> <M-quickbrownfox[ "Wondering if the 5G will mess th"> It will definitely allow better localization of devices via cell tower infrastructure, down to the centimeter, which is awful for privacy if you use a sim. Maybe there are undiscovered mitigations to this?
05:46:12 <mythicc[m]> The security model should not be effected very much IMO
05:51:37 <M-quickbrownfox[> Yes that kind of telemetry will be awful. Will be great if security is not affected otherwise
07:20:12 <satony-dagony[m]> I actually have a quick question regarding telemetry. I still haven't installed graphene, but I was wondering if it is like android in that it allows emergency calls even without a sim. Because that implies that you can perform cell tower telemetry even without a sim
08:34:17 <arouzing[m]> <anupritaisno1[m4 "> fdroid "> No recommendations for an fdroid alternative? Just that its the issue or bad does not really help.
08:37:22 <Biv[m]> <arouzing[m] "No recommendations for an fdroid"> You mean the app or the store?
08:37:43 <Biv[m]> If store, APK mirror. If app, Aurora droid
08:38:13 <Biv[m]> Gotta say though there isn't anything trustworthy other than fdroid iml
08:38:16 <Biv[m]> imo
08:38:50 <Beaver59> aurora is not trustworthy?
08:40:02 <arouzing[m]> I just find the vagueness in him saying "fdroid thats your issue" implying its bad, without any form of elaboration.
08:41:11 <Biv[m]> Aurora is just an app that uses repositories
08:41:18 <Biv[m]> And its open source.
08:41:26 <Biv[m]> Fdroid repos are probably good tho

09:23:28 <mrxx_0[m]> otherwise #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
09:58:36 <renlord[m]> whats there to trust about aurora

09:59:02 <renlord[m]> but if you check, it should be fine
10:03:54 <TheLnyx> helo
10:05:08 <TheLnyx> Is there currently a problem with the attesation app? I upated GOS recently as also the auditor app to version 20 but it faild for 48 hours to verify it towards the attestation.app server
10:05:52 <TheLnyx> now i updated to version 21 manually becaus of the time sync bug but no successful attestation till now (guess 4h window was not triggered)

10:13:46 <alzxjm[m]1> TheLnyx: the problem is not with the app per we but an upstream bug related to a time sync issue, I think. Auditor 21 provides a workaround. The app and server are fine - they are correctly identifying a problem.
10:13:50 <alzxjm[m]1> per se*
10:15:15 <TheLnyx> I see that is mybe the reason for the

23:23:52 <strcat> we haven't implemented a toggle to control whether tethered traffic should go through the VPN
23:23:58 <strcat> but it is definitely supposed to work just as it does on AOSP
