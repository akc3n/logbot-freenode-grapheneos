00:02:13 <louipc> mistazaki[m]: what phone do you have
00:03:39 <louipc> that will help you figure out the branch you need
00:06:15 <louipc> oh maybe this is better https://flash.android.com/back-to-public
00:08:18 <louipc> hrrm you might have cable issue too :/
00:13:18 <mistazaki[m]> Has been completed. Now need intall graphene.Thank you all.
00:13:33 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
00:13:38 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck!
00:13:50 <mrxx_0[m]> That was quick
00:14:02 <mrxx_0[m]> May the flash be with you
00:14:15 <louipc> sweeet
00:14:53 <louipc> so we know the cable works then heheh
01:08:10 <mistazaki[m]> Hi, Want to ask .. How to enable hotspot & tethering on other users? This is because I see no such option on other users.
02:33:21 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Is it possible to install uBlock Origin in Vanadium?
02:34:22 <louipc> nope
02:37:32 <louipc> you can use a vpn type blocker if that helps
02:39:21 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Already using Mullvad though.
02:39:55 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I guess it's better to use Firefox/Fennec anyway...
02:40:21 <louipc> not really
02:40:54 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Or just Tor browser.
02:41:20 <louipc> theres vpn blockers that have a vpn passthru
02:41:40 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Such as?
02:41:40 <louipc> so you can still use your actual vpn
02:42:12 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Would using NextDNS be a good idea?
02:42:41 <louipc> no idea about nextdns
02:43:42 <louipc> well yea alternative dns could be a good idea if you trust them
02:46:54 <Dylanger[m]> Is there a maintainer for the Pixel 5?
02:47:15 <Dylanger[m]> I was going to pick one up and maintain it, but worried the lawsuit could mess the entire project up
02:49:49 <brenneke[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Such as?"> https://blog.windscribe.com/r-o-b-e-r-t-now-with-superpowers-6a0c32903af9
02:55:46 <Remu[m]> <Dylanger[m] "I was going to pick one up and m"> Doubt it will, they have been already messing with this project before the counterclaim/counter lawsuit was made
02:57:20 <Remu[m]> It started as early as renlord's harassment by them, yet the project did not die anyways
02:58:54 <Remu[m]> If anything, it would have been dead after 2018, but it does not show any signs of dying, but that's just me
03:00:06 <renlord[m]> what lawsuit
03:00:15 <renlord[m]> lol
03:00:23 <Remu[m]> Oh, yeah lol
03:00:38 <renlord[m]> i just recycled the lawsuit
03:00:38 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: this has been ongoing since June 2018
03:00:49 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: nothing new
03:00:50 <renlord[m]> what a waste of paper and shipped all the way from canada too
03:00:51 <Remu[m]> Maybe there is a necessity for correction on my statements
03:00:57 <strcat[m]> before then really
03:01:11 <renlord[m]> unimelb even asked me to not receive spam mail anymore
03:01:15 <Remu[m]> <renlord[m] "what a waste of paper and shippe"> I am out of the loop why they did that though?
03:01:35 <strcat[m]> their whole goal is causing as much damage to the project as possible
03:01:46 <strcat[m]> while using our work without credit
03:01:48 <strcat[m]> claiming it as their own
03:01:53 <renlord[m]> if anyone would like to mail me something from canada, pls send something more worthwhile (i.e. maple syrup maybe)
03:02:11 <Remu[m]> <renlord[m] "if anyone would like to mail me "> I would like a
03:02:17 <Remu[m]> > <@renlord:matrix.org> if anyone would like to mail me something from canada, pls send something more worthwhile (i.e. maple syrup maybe)
03:02:17 <Remu[m]>  * I would like skme
03:02:23 <Remu[m]> Som
03:02:35 <Remu[m]> Sorry, accidental enter presses
03:02:59 <renlord[m]> authentic canadian maple syrup pls. The one that is sold by the maple syrup cartel
03:05:07 <Remu[m]> They could have sold as different OS and shut up, yet they waste their time to do these that their security patches get delayed lmao
03:06:49 <Remu[m]> Imagine being a secure phone company who can't port the project on time, not to mention it is more closed source than iOS, and they have some form of tracking, otherwise their fdroid repo would be used easily by anyone, notwithstanding the possible tracking embedded in their other apps/components in their operating system
03:07:08 <Remu[m]> I really don't see their OS' worth, any issue aside
03:07:48 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "Dylanger: nothing new"> Ah okay
03:09:11 <Linus[m]1> <renlord[m] "authentic canadian maple syrup p"> I might be able to hook you up
03:09:11 <Remu[m]> If they were so secure, why can't they prove it by letting a security expert audit it?
03:10:34 <Remu[m]> <Remu[m] "If they were so secure, why can'"> It would have been huge in their marketing
03:10:38 <Remu[m]> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
03:11:09 <Remu[m]> Does greed and love of money make a person this dumb?
03:12:08 <Remu[m]> Besides the trickery on social engineering (I mean they do get out of the way to dupe people)
03:12:51 <Remu[m]> Oh well, just my observation, really
03:13:23 <Remu[m]> It's now way harder than ever to trust anybody
03:14:01 <Remu[m]> Does some of the bundled apps need to be ported to Kotlin (PDFViewer, Auditor)?
03:15:37 <CarpeDiem[m]> Dylanger do it ! I can help with testing next week when I get mine
03:15:56 <Remu[m]> Yeah, anyways, I hope you do it Dylanger
03:16:48 <CarpeDiem[m]> Also does anyone here reside in Australia and wanna buy a Very good condition used 3aXL? No need for it as I have a 4a now and getting a 5 next week
03:17:04 <CarpeDiem[m]> üíÅ
03:17:37 <mistazaki[m]> Hi, Want to ask .. How to enable hotspot & tethering on other users? This is because I see no such option on other users.
03:18:34 <Remu[m]> <mistazaki[m] "Hi, Want to ask .. How to enable"> I don't think it is possible by design
03:18:48 <CarpeDiem[m]> <mistazaki[m] "Hi, Want to ask .. How to enable"> Do u have calls/texts disabled?
03:18:54 <CarpeDiem[m]> On secondary profile
03:19:25 <CarpeDiem[m]> That may be it, if not I dunno maybe u cant
03:20:18 <Remu[m]> <Remu[m] "I don't think it is possible by "> Even LineageOS does not allow it
04:04:28 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Does anyone else have issues with f-droid not loading icons and screenshots? I've asked on the f-droid room earlier and was told Graphene is taboo cause apparently the dev team is toxic. lol
04:07:01 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy dxrwzy9y[m], let me go and check!
04:07:46 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like they load for me, but I have to refresh and wait for them to load.
04:08:50 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Weird, refreshing doesn't help me
04:09:10 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, odd.
04:09:40 <TheJollyRoger> I've had this glitch before where F-Droid refuses to load the icons, but once I get back to WiFi and refresh sometimes they appear later. Not sure.
04:09:54 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Are you using a different version perhaps? I'm on the latest for both fdroid and Graphene
04:10:01 <TheJollyRoger> Let me check...
04:10:56 <TheJollyRoger> I got version 1.9 for F-Droid...
04:11:33 <dxrwzy9y[m]> 1.9 as well, I've even just reinstalled it, same issue
04:11:34 <TheJollyRoger> And for Graphene I got RP1A.201105.002.2020.11.05.18.
04:11:41 <TheJollyRoger> I'm on Blueline.
04:11:50 <TheJollyRoger> (Pixel 3, non-a, non-XL)
04:12:51 <dxrwzy9y[m]> RP1A.201105.002.2020.11.05.18 on a 4a, could this be a device specific bug then? Are they gonna fix it in the next update?
04:14:46 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. I'm no expert on this but I don't think this is a device specific bug.
04:15:31 <TheJollyRoger> I've had this issue before, but it usually sorts itself out after a while, and I am not sure why.
04:17:15 <TheJollyRoger> If an app won't run on GrapheneOS, typically, you're going to know right away.
04:20:28 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Are there any setting I can change perhaps?
04:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Try setting the F-Droid settings for WiFi and over Data to allow.
04:25:27 <louipcm> dxrwzy9y:  you could also try aurora droid as an alternative
04:25:36 <louipcm> enable izzyondroid repo
04:25:49 <louipcm> fdroid repo should be avoided
04:26:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Lotta abandoned and out of date apps.
04:26:19 <dxrwzy9y[m]> F-droid is working fine apart from icons and screenshots not showing up though haha
04:26:34 <dxrwzy9y[m]> What's izzyondroid?
04:27:16 <louipcm> its a repo that claims to host apps with their original signatures
04:27:22 <louipcm> fdroid rebuilds and repackages everything
04:27:57 <louipcm> so its not the same as from the original developers
04:28:19 <TheJollyRoger> In essence they become a trusted third party.
04:28:49 <louipcm> like when sourceforge built adware into all packages lol
04:29:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. An unfortunate implication of this is that should they be compromised, they can then push malware to your device at will, and something else there is that scaling across all their apps, they sometimes won't get security updates from upstream.
04:30:58 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I thought f-droid is safe?
04:31:08 * TheJollyRoger takes a deep breath.
04:32:02 <TheJollyRoger> Would you like the long and nuanced version, the brutally honest but short and controversial version, or a fireside chat?
04:32:34 <CarpeDiem[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Does anyone else have issues wit"> Disable your VPN
04:32:58 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Would you like the long and nuan"> Haha give it to me straight
04:33:06 <TheJollyRoger> If it's either the first or the third, get yourself something to drink because we could be here for a long time.
04:33:06 <CarpeDiem[m]> Then reload the repos
04:33:11 <CarpeDiem[m]> They will slowly load
04:33:29 <CarpeDiem[m]> I had the same issue and disabling nord fixed it
04:33:35 <dxrwzy9y[m]> So my VPN is the issue?
04:33:51 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I don't see how?
04:33:55 <CarpeDiem[m]> Pause it for 5 minutes and see If it fixes it
04:33:59 <CarpeDiem[m]> Worked for me
04:35:15 <TheJollyRoger> dxrwzy9y[m]: Ok so... you've asked for it straight, before we go on let's talk a bit about the Android application signing policy that's pretty much essential to almost all Android:
04:37:10 <TheJollyRoger> Inside every .apk file is a digital signature that validates the payload, and a digital certificate that signed it. When you install an APK, the operating system will pin the first certificate it finds, and validate the payload with it to the digital signature. Once it's installed, further updates /must/ either match the certificate that originally installed it, or a subsequent update that
04:37:12 <TheJollyRoger> validates a second installation with both old and new certificates.
04:38:08 <TheJollyRoger> This "Trust Upon First Use" mode of establishing and authenticating updates is essentially designed to allow upstream developers to /decentralize/ the signing process by removing the update channel from being a trusted third party once the app has been installed.
04:38:54 <TheJollyRoger> So, with me on that so far?
04:39:07 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Yeah I see
04:39:30 <TheJollyRoger> So take for example,
04:40:03 <TheJollyRoger> Let's say I develop PirateChat and I opt out of Google Play signing PirateChat.apk on my behalf and I sign it with a key I keep in my special setup, secured offline.
04:40:29 <TheJollyRoger> If you install PirateChat, and then three days later, Google Play turns evil, even Play Services isn't privileged enough to push malware to your device.
04:40:36 <TheJollyRoger> That's forbidden by the mandatory access controls in the kernel.
04:40:51 <TheJollyRoger> Because they don't have my keys.
04:41:30 <TheJollyRoger> (Note that GrapheneOS does not bundle Play Services, we consider them to be invasive)
04:41:48 <TheJollyRoger> Now on the other hand, let's say I also publish on F-Droid.
04:42:05 <TheJollyRoger> This means that F-Droid is going to recompile my package on my behalf, and then publish it.
04:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> This contravenes a few assumptions in the Android security model several ways:
04:42:57 <TheJollyRoger> First, it means that the package you're getting is no longer authenticated to be from me. Instead, it's going to be authenticated to F-Droid.
04:43:27 <TheJollyRoger> Secondly, let's say four days after I push an update I discover a critical security flaw and push an update.
04:43:38 <TheJollyRoger> On Google Play, that security update gets published right then and there with my signatures.
04:43:47 <TheJollyRoger> On F-Droid, I'm going to have to wait for them to get around to me.
04:46:01 <TheJollyRoger> Even if it's an emergency update.
04:46:39 <dxrwzy9y[m]> So are you saying you can't trust f-droid? Okay but aren't they incentivized to push out updates quite quickly? The whole point is to not have to check the dev websites every day to see if there's an update but to have it all streamlined, no?
04:46:59 <TheJollyRoger> Am I saying you can't trust F-Droid? I'm letting you answer that.
04:47:31 <TheJollyRoger> Aren't they incentivized to push updates quickly? Judging by how they often lag behind upstream, what happens in practice doesn't always match up. Sometimes they can be behind by months.
04:47:57 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Right but there's no reason to assume that fdroid has any malicious intent, right?
04:48:26 <thelonewolf[m]> It seems google play is far better and safer than f-droid for security reasons,right?
04:48:49 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Okay I guess the issue is they have enough people looking at the updates then?
04:49:27 <TheJollyRoger> dxrwzy9y[m]: I can't answer that for you with respect to malicious intent.
04:49:37 <TheJollyRoger> I can't answer conclusively on other people's intentions.
04:49:38 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I certainly don't trust Google when it comes to privacy though.
04:50:09 <dxrwzy9y[m]> What would the alternative be anyway?
04:50:11 <thelonewolf[m]> Yeah but it has one of the best security system in place
04:50:33 <louipc> you could install the apps from their websites, then use izzyondroid to keep them up to date
04:50:56 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I've seen tons of news when malware got pushed into the Play Store though.
04:51:06 <TheJollyRoger> About with "enough people looking at the code" I think this is honestly a meme.
04:51:18 <dxrwzy9y[m]> So izzyondroid, is that an fdroid repo?
04:51:26 <louipc> yea
04:51:39 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Okay, I'll check it out.
04:51:59 <louipc> has over 600 apps or something
04:52:00 <thelonewolf[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "I've seen tons of news when malw"> I have also seen a lot of news but i have not used any of those apps ever. Have you?
04:52:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, watch what you install.
04:52:51 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <thelonewolf[m] "I have also seen a lot of news b"> No, I use an iPhone as my main phone and my Pixel for Graphene
04:53:28 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah, watch what you install."> On izzyondroid too?
04:53:40 <makingaliasesisa> Yeah I try to use the ones that are listed in Aurora droid only or fdroid
04:53:59 <TheJollyRoger> This rule's applicable anywhere, honestly.
04:54:17 <thelonewolf[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "No, I use an iPhone as my main p"> Why GOS then, just curious?
04:54:22 <makingaliasesisa> And yeah I would still be careful on fdroid.
04:55:00 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <thelonewolf[m] "Why GOS then, just curious?"> Well I've seen it recommended by privacytoolsio, Techlore, thehatedone and Snowden
04:55:03 <TheJollyRoger> The attitude that Android took is remarkably pragmatic: this is why Android runs each app as the equivalent of running it under a different uid.
04:55:51 <TheJollyRoger> And relies on mandatory access control policies, makes heavy use of sandboxing, etc.
04:56:10 <makingaliasesisa> And I'd say that is the best way.
04:56:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. We've learned that perimeter based security models just don't work in practice.
04:56:40 <TheJollyRoger> Especially because apps will inevitably come from different and sometimes untrustworthy sources.
04:57:10 <thelonewolf[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Well I've seen it recommended by"> Ok. What do you use pixel for then?
04:57:34 <TheJollyRoger> F-Droid honestly has a ton of app plaque: old, abandoned apps that are no longer maintained, target older versions of the API, etc.
04:57:52 <makingaliasesisa> True
04:58:14 <makingaliasesisa> I can understand that
04:58:24 <Remu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah. We've learned that perimet"> So it has to be heavily locked down like iOS App store?
04:58:24 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <thelonewolf[m] "Ok. What do you use pixel for th"> Yeah I got my Pixel specifically for Graphene to have a second phone that I can for sure trust without any apps running Google Analytics or Facebook Graph
04:58:25 <TheJollyRoger> All of these present more attack surface, and in practice a vulnerability is a vulnerability, whether it be from malice, or simply not keeping pace with advances in attacks.
04:59:14 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Also there were a few apps I was interested in that don't work on iPhone such as NewPipe for instance
05:00:17 <thelonewolf[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Also there were a few apps I was"> I use Youtube in web browser. You can make web app of Youtube.
05:00:30 <Remu[m]> <thelonewolf[m] "I use Youtube in web browser. Yo"> Heck no
05:00:53 <TheJollyRoger> Remu[m]: with respect to a perimeter security model, we've learned that they're unsustainable, and it's best to adopt a model like the mobile security model where each app runs within its own process space.
05:01:12 <dxrwzy9y[m]> YouTube does everything it can to block background playback though and bypass adblockers
05:01:20 <makingaliasesisa> I wouldntthelonewolf
05:01:58 <Remu[m]> I only like Google Pixel, but I don't want anything to do with their softwares and ad products personally
05:02:13 <Remu[m]> (Youtube, Google search, etc...)
05:02:33 <thelonewolf[m]> <makingaliasesisa "I wouldntthelonewolf "> Could you explain why?
05:02:39 <makingaliasesisa> Yeah same
05:02:51 <Remu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Remu: with respect to a perimete"> Ah, looks like my reply earlier was unrelated, apologies. Nevertheless, I agree
05:04:24 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <Remu[m] "I only like Google Pixel, but I "> Yeah unlike other phones like Samsung they don't come with non removable preinstalled Facebook apps and can actually use GrapheneOS or custom ROMs in general
05:04:47 <Remu[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Yeah unlike other phones like Sa"> In locked bootloader too
05:04:51 <TheJollyRoger> In the end, I don't particularly enjoy telling people who to trust, I'd rather tell them the nuances and let them make their own decisions. Of course, a lot of people come to me with preexisting beliefs they want me to confirm, but I've learned that I really can't do much about that.
05:04:55 <makingaliasesisa> thelonewolf: newpipe does a much better job and I saw something about web apps being insecure in one of these chat rooms im in
05:05:13 <Remu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "In the end, I don't particularly"> Yeah, mokd
05:05:17 <Remu[m]> > <@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org> In the end, I don't particularly enjoy telling people who to trust, I'd rather tell them the nuances and let them make their own decisions. Of course, a lot of people come to me with preexisting beliefs they want me to confirm, but I've learned that I really can't do much about that.
05:05:17 <Remu[m]>  * Yeah, mood
05:05:40 <Remu[m]> <makingaliasesisa "thelonewolf: newpipe does a much"> Yeah, it is on sites like element
05:05:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
05:05:46 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <TheJollyRoger "In the end, I don't particularly"> Yeah I understand
05:07:00 <Remu[m]> Unsurprisingly, Google is good at making phones shipped with their OS
05:07:06 <TheJollyRoger> At the moment, we've got a first-party app store with a curated group of specifically chosen apps on the roadmap, but like everything GrapheneOS, we need some help with that and community involvement; it's the commits that we need.
05:07:27 <thelonewolf[m]> How are web apps  insecure? Can someone explain?
05:07:45 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <Remu[m] "Unsurprisingly, Google is good a"> It's quite ironic that Pixels are the best Android phones to degoogle haha
05:07:48 <TheJollyRoger> Hi thelonewolf[m], with respect to webapps, I can try to break that down a bit --
05:08:14 <TheJollyRoger> Webapps are as secure as TLS is and as trustworthy as the website that serves them to you is.
05:08:27 <Remu[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "It's quite ironic that Pixels ar"> I think it's something they can give up intentionally
05:09:28 <Remu[m]> Just my opinion, as all official "Android" phones has to be bundled with gms/play store
05:09:35 <thelonewolf[m]> Chromium sandboxes each tab, right?
05:09:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yes!
05:09:57 <renlord[m]> web security can be a can of worms
05:10:10 <thelonewolf[m]> Then what could go wrong?
05:10:25 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, this is correct, Vanadium takes this a step further by taking advantage of the safer memory handling routines in GrapheneOS.
05:10:27 <TheJollyRoger> Well...
05:10:29 <Remu[m]> Now I wonder if there is financial report on Youtube compared to their mobile hardware selling
05:10:30 <TheJollyRoger> thelonewolf[m], quite a lot of things.
05:10:35 <makingaliasesisa> I cant find that source I saw sadly...
05:10:52 <renlord[m]> enumerating from top to bottom would be many phd thesis(s)
05:10:57 <renlord[m]> on websecurity lol
05:11:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hohoho boy X3.
05:11:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
05:11:15 <Remu[m]> <renlord[m] "enumerating from top to bottom w"> Oh lol, because the source code is big?
05:11:19 <TheJollyRoger> But I can run over a few of the recurrent ones that more easily come to mind.
05:11:23 <TheJollyRoger> Well because it's so complex.
05:11:32 <renlord[m]> but to cherrypick one particular item, lets look at XSS
05:11:56 <renlord[m]> there are so many vectors to mount a XSS-attack on the web by serving erroneous javascript
05:12:38 <TheJollyRoger> thelonewolf[m]: let's say for instance, I run QuietMail.com, which end-to-end encrypts your E-mail in a browser. The problem is, even though the operations are taking place clientside, you're still relying on me to provide the app, and relying on every single Certificate Authority to authenticate what I'm sending to you to do the encryption.
05:12:51 <renlord[m]> there are mitigations around it both client-side (i.e. sane sandboxing to minimize leaks and privilege escalation) and precautions that can be served server-side too (i.e. content security policy)
05:13:59 <TheJollyRoger> Even if I assume that my app is perfect and doesn't contain any bugs which is a VERY TALL assumption, and that all the CAs won't misissue my certificate, there's nothing stopping me the admin of QuietMail, or my DDOS mitigation service, from making a change to that webapp.
05:14:05 <renlord[m]> anyways, web security is offtopic, pls continue in the offtopic channel
05:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, sorry.
05:14:15 * TheJollyRoger redfaces.
05:16:17 <thelonewolf[m]> So I should use android apps instead of web apps?
05:16:29 <thelonewolf[m]> Whenever possible
05:16:49 <TheJollyRoger> I'll answer you in the offtopic channel.
06:57:05 <Remu[m]> Hope this renders properly this time
07:39:35 <mrxx_0[m]> dxrwzy9y hey, I am the maintainer for 4a
07:39:35 <mrxx_0[m]> What version of GrapheneOS do you have at the moment ?
07:44:50 <mrxx_0[m]> dxrwzy9y does this issue occurs when you are on mobile data ? Or Wifi? Can you give me more details about you connection's setup ? Custom DNS ? VPN ?
07:46:10 <mrxx_0[m]> Talking about the issue with which fdroid can't load screenshots and icons
07:50:50 <dxrwzy9y[m]> RP1A.201105.002.2020.11.05.18
07:51:00 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Using Mullvad VPN on Wifi
08:06:22 <mrxx_0[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Using Mullvad VPN on Wifi"> Without it, does it work correctly ?
08:07:10 <dxrwzy9y[m]> It doesn't work using Orbot either
08:07:50 <dxrwzy9y[m]> When installing fdroid it says this app is optimized for an earlier version of Android
08:09:52 <mrxx_0[m]> You didn't answer my question, did you try without vpn and does it work ?
08:12:09 <dxrwzy9y[m]> No since I'd rather not go online without a VPN on my school network tbh :/
08:12:45 <mrxx_0[m]> Ok I get it
08:12:48 <CarpeDiem[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "No since I'd rather not go onlin"> Pause it for 5 minute's bro.
08:13:01 <mrxx_0[m]> And you don't want to try with modile data either ?
08:13:05 <CarpeDiem[m]> Trust me it'll work and your icons will most likely load
08:13:29 <CarpeDiem[m]> I have the same issue on 3aXL & 4XL
08:13:37 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I've just got my 4a, I don't have a SIM card for it yet.
08:13:56 <CarpeDiem[m]> Some vpns seem to fk with fdroid loading icons & screenshots
08:14:08 <CarpeDiem[m]> Disabling VPN allowed them to load
08:14:16 <mrxx_0[m]> <CarpeDiem[m] "I have the same issue on 3aXL & "> You have the same issue with fdroid using a vpn ? No icons and screenshots loading ?
08:14:22 <CarpeDiem[m]> Perhaps switch VPN protocol?
08:14:32 <CarpeDiem[m]> Had* ye
08:14:41 <mrxx_0[m]> <CarpeDiem[m] "Had* ye "> Ok
08:14:50 <CarpeDiem[m]> Disabling vpn fixed it
08:15:27 <CarpeDiem[m]> Try TCP or UDP if you're using wiregaurd
08:15:51 <CarpeDiem[m]> That seemed to fix my issue and allowed me to use my VPN without issues
08:16:09 <dxrwzy9y[m]> The Mullvad app only allows Wireguard
08:16:19 <CarpeDiem[m]> Ah ok
08:17:56 <mrxx_0[m]> Carpe~Diem: Did you have other issue of data not loading while using a vpn ?
08:18:43 <CarpeDiem[m]> Negative only fdroid
08:18:58 <CarpeDiem[m]> And only in that instance
08:19:06 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Sounds kinda weird that icons aren't loading when using a VPN, how it that even possible when everything else works perfectly fine?
08:19:25 <CarpeDiem[m]> Got me stumped mate
08:38:30 <vinterneti[m]> <TheJollyRoger "This means that F-Droid is going"> Is it possible for developer to check how package is compiled to verify there is nothing added? In case with fdroid developer knows fdroid checks his source code. And fdroid knows developer can check fdroid package. Otherwise user relays only on developer. Purely statistically at some point there will be application with malicious intent. It already happened with
08:38:30 <vinterneti[m]> google play. So when developer and fdroid can audit each other it looks more secure approach when addressing malicious intent. Disadvantage here is more time it takes to fix breaches and bugs. Also depending from third party could demotivat developer.
08:39:54 <mastercakex[m]> How you guys do internet speed test on graphene OS ?
08:40:19 <mastercakex[m]> All those apps I tried are not working including speed test website on vanadium
08:40:26 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Just go to a speedtest website
08:40:53 <mastercakex[m]> Won't start testing. Just halts at connecting status
08:41:46 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Speedtest.net works fine for me using Fennec
08:51:31 <renlord[m]> vinterneti: yes.
08:51:50 <renlord[m]>  * vinterneti: yes. there are methods to check how an apk package is bundled.
08:52:06 <renlord[m]> it is called reverse-engineering
08:52:21 <renlord[m]> and there are security researchers that look into that
08:55:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord[m] "and there are security researche"> U
08:55:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <mrxx_0[m] "You have the same issue with fdr"> Fdroid is the issue

09:01:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> <thelonewolf[m] "So I should use android apps ins"> No such thing has been said
09:11:44 <dazinism> dxrwzy9y: I've found fdroid app can often have trouble downloading icons & screenshots. Also downloads failing or behaves a bit weird when installing.
09:12:40 <dazinism> Aurora Droid (set to use apps private internal storage) also can fail to move to installing after downloading

11:03:56 <Remu[m]> Kicking spree again
11:19:05 <dazinism> vinterneti: there are a few apps with reproducable builds in the fdroid repos that have the developers signature. eg. Briar, Fdroid itself, Newpipe has 2 different builds available one with the devs sig, one with heroics.

11:24:50 <dazinism> dxrwzy9y: saw your question in the fdroid room, but didnt see anyone suggest that GrapheneOS is taboo there. Never seen any sign of anyone there suggesting that either??
11:26:30 <somenerd[m]> I think on f-droid it states that copperhead is a partner (idk why)
11:27:00 <somenerd[m]> wait let me check
11:29:29 <somenerd[m]> nahhh I'm just misinformed
11:29:44 <somenerd[m]> I'll repost if I see it again, but so far I haven't
11:37:56 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <dazinism "dxrwzy9y: saw your question in t"> There are two fdroid rooms.
11:38:11 <somenerd[m]> wait what?
11:38:19 <somenerd[m]> which one is official then?
11:38:44 <dxrwzy9y[m]> The one that doesn't say unofficial haha
11:38:57 <somenerd[m]> lol
11:39:13 <somenerd[m]> also offtopic ig?
11:40:22 <dazinism> Oh, yeah, the unofficial is run by that lovely lovely milkman bloke
11:41:05 <dazinism> They have a huge grudge against GrapheneOS
11:41:14 <somenerd[m]> how come?
11:41:26 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Who's that?
11:41:59 <somenerd[m]> also this is getting kinda offtopic
11:42:09 <somenerd[m]> best to move to the other room/channel
11:43:15 <dazinism> It is related to GrapheneOS and explains why theres likely to be a lot of hostility to GrapheneOS from any of the rooms for which Milkman is admin
11:43:24 <somenerd[m]> hmm makes sense
11:43:45 <somenerd[m]> wow there are a lot of grudges against GrapheneOS
11:44:02 <somenerd[m]> the devs just wanna make a hardened OS come on
11:44:45 <dazinism> He was relatively early user of matrix.org I saw him set up loads of rooms for interesting projects including the OS that was to become GrapheneOS
11:45:53 <dazinism> He's very opinionated, hates people questioning him and admins rooms in an extremely authoritarian way - quickly banning people for all kinds of weird reasons
11:46:24 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Why does he have an issue with it? Why would anyone hate Graphene? Well apart from Google and certain  politicians I guess.
11:46:38 <dazinism> When Graphene split from Copperhead he sided with James
11:46:51 <somenerd[m]> :/
11:47:10 <somenerd[m]> but isn't f-droid like, against proprietary
11:48:01 <dazinism> Fdroid is (mainly) unrelated to all this. Reread whats just been written
11:48:20 <somenerd[m]> yeah makes sense, I mistook it
11:49:28 <dazinism> Milkman also decided he didnt like  the matrix devs, so regularly rants about them, also hates XMPP and other random stuff
11:49:32 <dxrwzy9y[m]> So in other words just some nonsensical drama? lol
11:49:50 <louipc> a nutter
11:50:58 <dazinism> Yeah, pretty much nonsense drama, except he admins some big matrix rooms and regularly has his weird rants against things he doesnt like
11:51:21 <somenerd[m]> ...
11:51:21 <dazinism> And for some reason some people repeat/believe his stuff
11:51:21 <Remu[m]> Birds of the same feather flocks together lmao
11:52:16 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Wow what a kindergarten
11:53:37 <dazinism> He decided xmpp couldnt be mentioned in one of his massive rooms (cybersecurity) and banned me.for politely questioning his reasoning
11:54:05 <somenerd[m]> huh
11:54:40 <Remu[m]> Guess somebody got their feeling hurt lol
11:55:12 <Tesseract[m]> I was kicked without saying anything
11:55:35 <Tesseract[m]> He was not nice when I asked why
11:56:08 <louipc> oh yea i was banned from 40 rooms i never joined for trying to say hello directly
11:56:15 <Remu[m]> Felt like some people will just go out of their way to destroy project that was supposedly will help them
11:56:22 <dazinism> Yeah he really is toxic
11:56:29 <Remu[m]> can't we have nice things in foss community?
11:56:38 <louipc> sure
11:57:09 <somenerd[m]> :/ can't we not just fight over small things?
11:58:33 <Remu[m]> <Remu[m] "Felt like some people will just "> Lol, I won't even be mad if there'll be no more great projects in FOSS community. They brought it upon themselves.
11:58:52 <dazinism> Thankfully the matrix devs eventually got fed up with his nonsense and took away all the matrix.org aliases for his rooms. Since then the popularity of those rooms has slowly been decreasing
11:59:00 <dxrwzy9y[m]> So basically he's toxic while claiming the Graphene devs are toxic while deleting posts that even mention Graphene for any reason? Wow
11:59:40 <somenerd[m]> and you see the reddit post recently?
11:59:51 <somenerd[m]> apparently there's a lawsuit
11:59:52 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Which one?
12:00:01 <somenerd[m]> Let me check
12:00:02 <Remu[m]> I would not say all though, we won't even need Copperhead to have somebody despise the project because of some vested interest (see some certain influencer lol)
12:00:19 <somenerd[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/jp03z7/grapheneos_in_a_lawsuit_for_the_survival_of_the/
12:00:36 <somenerd[m]> also filing suits on students is sad
12:00:44 <somenerd[m]> like real sad
12:01:35 <Tesseract[m]> Copperhead os feels like a scam
12:01:44 <louipcm> Remu:  influencer against grapheneos?
12:01:52 <Remu[m]> I won't petition to cancel them, though it would be nice to bring them back to earth to humble them
12:01:59 <somenerd[m]> > Remu:  influencer against grapheneos?
12:01:59 <somenerd[m]> (techlore)
12:02:05 <somenerd[m]> > Copperhead os feels like a scam
12:02:05 <somenerd[m]> it is?
12:02:12 <Remu[m]> Who else lol
12:02:44 <Remu[m]> I always thought he was biased, but somehow seeing it first hand confirms it
12:02:44 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Okay but even so why in the world be mad about people asking questions to fix an issue?
12:03:43 <Remu[m]> His installation video was not well-accepted here, as it was not according to official installation guide
12:04:15 <somenerd[m]> ok this is getting kinda offtopic (influencers and all)
12:04:25 <somenerd[m]> sure it's about Graphene, but still
12:04:26 <Remu[m]> Yeah
12:05:30 <Remu[m]> What is being seen in FOSS commumoty makes me trust people less and less
12:07:06 <louipcm> whos the top influencer these days. lets get them on team grapheneos
12:07:12 <louipcm> kanye
12:07:27 <louipcm> no hes iphone guy

12:22:13 <louipcm> thanks trismous
12:38:58 <r0tt0r[m]> related the boot warning screen yet nothing can be done?
12:48:29 <r0tt0r[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "related the boot warning screen "> "you are booting a different operating system"
12:48:33 <ludicrous_speed[> Boot screen has a purpose
12:49:39 <ludicrous_speed[> I believe the yellow color is good, if its orange its not so good
12:50:52 <ludicrous_speed[> But from what I understand its not removeable
13:20:16 <r0tt0r[m]> <ludicrous_speed[ "I believe the yellow color is go"> ye i understand though i would like to have it removed. sadly logo is build into bootloader
13:24:28 <eenno[m]> The issue with the alarm clock screen (allowing you to snooze or dismiss the alarm) not showing up, is fixed in the latest update! Shows up on my Pixel 2XL. Just want to say a big thanks to the devs! üôÇ
13:38:29 <dazinism> r0tt0r: the yellow screen is part of verified boot, its how that works. Anything else would be a broken implementation. The only way to not have that is have an OS flashed which is signed by the key thats been burnt into the e-fuses when the device is manufactured
13:40:17 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/verified-boot
14:00:44 <briaruser[m]> I am wondering. Would the brawl between graphene and copperhead effect the users of graphene?
14:02:47 <dazinism> It diverts developer attention away from working on the OS so it has effects
14:04:11 <dazinism> Also could influence people into not using the OS. Its kinda less users = less new developers and resources
14:23:34 <dazinism> People can help out by countering dubious claims about the situation on social media, reddit etc.
14:24:00 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os
14:24:23 <A[m]7> Does anybody have an idea how to make Grindr app run on graphene? Their google suite dependency seems to mess it all up
14:25:14 <A[m]7> As well as mysudo app
14:26:43 <A[m]7> Also, does this part from the FAQ means that if I forget my password then the phone is bricked?
14:26:43 <A[m]7>  "Does GrapheneOS provide Factory Reset Protection?
14:26:43 <A[m]7> No, since this is strictly a theft deterrence feature, not a security feature, and the standard implementation depends on having the device tied to an account on an online service. The only advantage would be encouraging thieves to return a stolen device for a potential reward after realizing that it has no value beyond scrapping it for parts."
14:27:31 <A[m]7> I'm totally new to grapheneos so thanks for your help!
14:31:32 <A[m]7>  * Also, does this part from the FAQ mean that if I forget my password then the phone is bricked?
14:31:32 <A[m]7>  "Does GrapheneOS provide Factory Reset Protection?
14:31:32 <A[m]7> No, since this is strictly a theft deterrence feature, not a security feature, and the standard implementation depends on having the device tied to an account on an online service. The only advantage would be encouraging thieves to return a stolen device for a potential reward after realizing that it has no value beyond scrapping it for parts."
14:31:40 <dazinism> A: if you forget your password you'll loose all your data, but can get the phone working again
14:31:58 <dazinism> mysudo apparently can not work
14:32:32 <A[m]7> <dazinism "mysudo apparently can not work "> But I thought there are ways to fool these apps to think google services are down ans still run?
14:32:34 <dazinism> If you are in the US/Camada check out jmp.chat though. Maybe does what you looking for
14:33:30 <louipc> A[m]7: that FAQ means you can reset the phone if you get locked out but you lose the data
14:33:31 <A[m]7> <dazinism "A: if you forget your password y"> I see. So what does the part "realizing that it has no value beyond scrapping it for parts" mean?
14:33:39 <dazinism> Some apps are totally dependant on Google services so can't be fooled.
14:33:45 <louipc> reset protection would mean that you can't reset
14:34:35 <dazinism> There is no reset protection. If there was that would be the case.
14:35:52 <dazinism> Reset protection was a feature before. Bit people kept forgetting passwords and the developer had to make special builds so they could get their device working again.
14:35:52 <A[m]7> So if it's being stolen after I followed the installation tutorial and locked the bootloader as well as disabled OEM unlocking then anybody can reset the phone?
14:36:04 <A[m]7> <dazinism "Reset protection was a feature b"> Oh I see
14:36:06 <dazinism> After verifying who they were
14:36:15 <dazinism> It was loads of grief
14:36:48 <A[m]7> I just got locked out yesterday from some ROM and had to reset and I thought I would go with graphene
14:37:23 <A[m]7> So you're saying that mysudo and grindr have no hope at all to run anytime soon on graphene
14:37:30 <dazinism> Most thieves wouldnt realise as reset protection works on most pixels (those with Play Services)
14:37:53 <dazinism> Not sure about grindr
14:38:16 <dazinism> mysudo I don't think will work
14:38:28 <A[m]7> <dazinism "Most thieves wouldnt realise as "> Oh so they would think it has the same feature as the factory OS which basically doesn't allow for a reset
14:38:36 <dazinism> Heard of people trying and giving up
14:39:18 <A[m]7> Isn't there a way to sandbox a google play services environment for a single app? Maybe that would be a cool feature
14:39:43 <dazinism> Maybe worth seeing if either is in the Amazon app store or the Huawei app store. If they are, those versions of the app are likely to work
14:40:11 <A[m]7> <dazinism "After verifying who they were"> So graphene devs have/had access to unlocking devices somehow?
14:40:41 <A[m]7> Amazon app store or the Huawei app store? Are these some kind of android app stores like fdroid?
14:40:46 <dazinism> Back in the day when devices were sold with it pre installed.
14:41:40 <dazinism> They are kind of like fdroid, but much more likely to be spying on you. I'd advise creating a new user profile to download and install them
14:42:11 <A[m]7> <dazinism "They are kind of like fdroid, bu"> Oh so they need all of that user account business
14:42:11 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
14:42:29 <A[m]7> I had the worst time trying to create a google account for that google app store without a phone number
14:42:41 <A[m]7> Which failed at the end so I'm pretty much donewith them
14:43:17 <A[m]7> Oh you means user profile on the phone
14:43:28 <A[m]7>  * Oh you meant user profile on the phone, not on amazon store
14:43:33 <dazinism> Not sure what they need. Think its somewhat likely they'll ask for storage permission (and then have access to all your files). Also solewhat likely to build a device fingerprint of you
14:44:01 <dazinism> Unlike Play Store they are just normal apps though so can only see what other apps can
14:44:14 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/what-can-apps-see
14:44:17 <A[m]7> So by creating multiple user profiles you essentially sandbox various app environments?
14:44:24 <dazinism> Yeah
14:44:40 <dazinism> Read the pages I linked.
14:44:53 <A[m]7> Yeah I'm reading, thanks for sharing
15:04:44 <r0tt0r[m]> there is shelter app on fdroid which manages workprofile apps, quiet helpful

15:19:49 <r0tt0r[m]> <briaruser[m] "Is the shelter app safe in fdroi"> its a general manager to move apps from default to workprofile, block network access for shelter if you have doubts or revise its source code

16:35:27 <mulbr[m]> Yeah that lineage unofficial room was not a good experience. I def appreciate the vibe here and believe that standing up when we see it is important, places like the fdroid room too
17:19:26 <guest12365428> Hi! I'm trying to install on a Pixel 3 XL and would like to verify the signatures first before installation. The crosshatch-factory-2020.11.05.18.zip.sig link on the https://grapheneos.org/releases#crosshatch-stable page leads to a 404 Not Found. Does anyone happen to know where this signature is?
17:23:30 <louipc> Guess it's not there at the moment.. strcat should be able to fix that
17:25:47 <guest12365428> Gotcha. Just wanted to make sure that it wasn't an intentional omission for canary-ish reasons
17:26:52 <louipc> i think a newer update will be out soonish. its already tagged in git
17:27:02 <guest12365428> Awesome. Thanks!
17:47:08 <strcat[m]> leggychun: this is the official continuation of the project formerly known as CopperheadOS
17:47:16 <strcat[m]> leggychun: it is correct for the channel to redirect here
17:48:51 <strcat[m]> guest12365428: signature is uploaded for crosshatch now
17:49:02 <certainindividua> You know what, you're right. Ill delete my earlier link.
17:49:24 <guest12365428> Thanks!
17:49:36 <strcat[m]> leggychun: please use our offtopic channel to talk about things that are offtopic
17:51:41 <strcat[m]> we ultimately intend to get back our stolen Twitter account, and once they finally stop their grifting we'll obtain the old domain and redirect it to our site
18:06:40 <certainindividua> That's excellent news. Is there anything the community can do to help?
18:15:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> mulbr do give me information about this chat
18:23:33 <mulbr[m]> anupritaisno1 it was awhile ago don't remember details
18:25:40 <cenapatop689[m]> I have a Problem with the microphone and Video rights.
18:25:40 <cenapatop689[m]> In element app I can't allow it in the Background
18:25:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> mulbr what device and where
18:25:49 <strcat[m]> certainindividual: I wouldn't call that news, it has been the intention since early on
18:27:06 <certainindividua> <strcat[m] "certainindividual: I wouldn't ca"> understood
18:32:07 <mulbr[m]> anupritaisno1 not sure what your question is referring to. To clarify it was in the lineageos unofficial room owned by mmjd that was toxic and hostile towards graphene. Not lineageos as a bad experience
18:33:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> mulbr yes but can I know where this happened?
18:33:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> And for what device?
18:33:37 <strcat[m]> mmjd is a sad neonazi who makes himself feel better about his life by ruling an empire of matrix channels
18:33:56 <strcat[m]> he has a grudge against me from when I demanded control over the Matrix room that he had claimed he was creating on my behalf for the project
18:34:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Neonazi huh
18:34:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fuck why did I google that
18:34:34 <strcat[m]> he wouldn't hand it over and then ended up being kicked off of matrix.org and having the aliases for his channels taken away
18:37:54 <mulbr[m]> It was in the matrix room. Device unimportant.
19:05:37 <dazinism> Yeah we talked about mmjd/milkman earlier today. Very sad / toxic. Unfortunate they have so many large matrix rooms and push their weird hatred in them in their authoritarian style.
19:06:46 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "mmjd is a sad neonazi who makes "> He's an insane megalomaniac.
19:09:58 * kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/AxyQWAYbRgkrRLGSGexTqCXJ/message.txt >
19:12:00 <kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk> <dazinism "Yeah we talked about mmjd/milkma"> They let animalistic tendenices get the best of themselves. Can't really control the desire to hurt back
19:13:27 <nscnt> that's sum bad energy in here *lights up cinnamon candle*
19:16:52 <louipc> throw in some eucalyptus
19:17:59 <dazinism> Oh lol, didn't realize I was a mod here. You better all behave ü¶πüèª
19:18:19 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, fancy that, I couldn't see it from the IRC side XD
19:18:36 <dazinism> ü¶πüèª
19:19:09 <TheJollyRoger> Argh. Gonna have to install the fonts for this computer, for some reason the emoticons appear as little white rectangles for me.
19:19:39 <louipc> what terminal do you use
19:20:13 <TheJollyRoger> Just the default terminal emulator on Xfce4, but I think it's the VM I run Weechat in that doesn't have the fonts installed.
19:20:37 <dazinism> Wonder what that shows as on random IRC clients or older devices... yeah rectangles sometimes. Some newer emoticons show as two older ones, on older devices
19:20:40 <louipc> i think it will still depend on terminal
19:20:49 <TheJollyRoger> I keep meaning to fix it, and then usually something else breaks before I get the chance to.
19:20:54 <louipc> termite works ok
19:21:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's usually two, side by side.
19:24:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger yay -S all-repository-fonts
19:24:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> I really just do that
19:24:02 <TheJollyRoger> Sec. I'll have to look into what that is for Void.
19:26:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger use arch
19:26:28 <TheJollyRoger> Can't, it's not ported to POWER9.
19:26:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wtf
19:26:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> How did you get a power9?
19:27:07 <TheJollyRoger> https://raptorcs.com <- I'm the captain of the "Morgan's Revenge" that was featured on Raptor's Twitter Page.
19:28:31 <TheJollyRoger> My VPS is on https://integricloud.com, it's also on the same hardware.
19:30:09 <projectmoon> Just 250 USD per month
19:30:19 <TheJollyRoger> projectmoon: that's only if you rent a dedi.
19:30:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah what could go wrong
19:30:35 <TheJollyRoger> Which is where you get an entire physical machine dedicated to you.
19:30:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm pretty sure Intel dedis go for $100 for 16 cores on some providers
19:30:56 <TheJollyRoger> Generally I pay around $15-20 a month to keep my VPS active but I don't use it constantly.
19:31:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, but Integricloud operates a fully open stack all the way down to the self-boot engine.
19:31:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yep, but Integricloud operates a"> And how is that helpful?
19:32:02 <TheJollyRoger> With FlexVer remote attestation and the LPC Guard on the KGPE-D16s.
19:33:18 <TheJollyRoger> Honestly, it's the first time anyone's really tried to make a meaningful effort at doing so.
19:35:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Flexver seems pretty dangerous if you ask
19:35:16 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah?
19:35:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might be good for the paranoid
19:35:32 * TheJollyRoger clears his throat.
19:35:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Imagine you boot to Linux once
19:35:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just once
19:36:08 <kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk> <anupritaisno1[m] "Imagine you boot to Linux once"> Ah yeah, sounds like recipe of "pls track/hack me senpai"
19:36:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> On the next boot windows is like "yeah you ****ed up, enter the bitlocker recovery key"
19:37:02 <kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk> <anupritaisno1[m] "On the next boot windows is like"> Ah, an issue related to encrypted drives. Maybe I should do it now I triple boot
19:37:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh where do I buy a TPM
19:37:58 <kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk> <anupritaisno1[m] "On the next boot windows is like"> Does this release the same energy as delayed Windows booting at unencrypted drives
19:38:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't even know which one is compatible
19:38:17 <louipc> alibaba
19:38:27 <TheJollyRoger> Newegg?
19:38:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> <louipc "alibaba"> alibaba?
19:38:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've heard his stories
19:38:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> But how is that relevant
19:38:55 <louipc> ya he has all the loot
19:39:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also how do I even know it works?
19:39:25 <louipc> say "open sesame"
19:39:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> That does not help
19:39:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also why are you opening sesame seeds?
19:39:50 <TheJollyRoger> No clue.
19:40:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> +1
19:40:32 <kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk> <louipc "alibaba"> Is that some shady chinese store /s
19:40:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> louipc but how would I know the TPM works
19:41:26 <louipc> its the number one store in the world
19:41:44 <TheJollyRoger> Honestly though, I trust Raptor a lot more than I trust most other vendors. There's a knowledgeable community around the Talos and its related machines, even, which is nice.
19:42:12 <louipc> anupritaisno1[m]: sorry i fogret
19:42:32 <TheJollyRoger> It does require a bit of commitment and occasionally a bit of maintenance from time to time but this has improved hugely since launch.
22:47:10 <yehnahyeh[m]> <TheJollyRoger "yehnahyeh: are you using the Pix"> Nah, 3a.
22:56:24 <yehnahyeh[m]> <mrxx_0[m] "yehnahyeh I can't reproduce the "> Hi mate. I don't think its an Open Camera issue. The back camera won't work via any other app; the front one does. I even tries that work around I saw posted on Reddit recently for using gcam but same issue.
22:57:21 <yehnahyeh[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Since there's a bug from the ups"> Okay, so there's others experiencing similar behaviour?
23:15:23 <yehnahyeh[m]> * Hi mate. I don't think its an Open Camera issue. The back camera won't work via any other app; the front one does. I even tries that work around I saw posted on Reddit recently for using gcam but same issue.
23:15:24 <yehnahyeh[m]> Edit: Unless Open Camera provides functionality to other apps? Sorry if that's the case and I've misunderstood.
23:18:37 <dazinism> yehnahyeh: I think possibly you have a hardware issue with the camera of your phone. Don't recall anyone reporting this and theres no recent issues on github. The camera used to be a bit unstable, but things have improved significantly since the move to Android 11.
23:30:55 <seashield[m]> Can someone tell me how to disable offline mode in Vanadium? I've had a look online and in the settings but I can't find it.
23:45:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> seashield refresh the page
23:45:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you swipe down starting from below the address bar it will refresh the page
23:57:53 <seashield[m]> anupritaisno1: thanks, but even when I refresh it, it stays in offline page.
