00:02:15 <TheJollyRoger> zazagx: What you'll get is the Android Open Source Project keyboard, Calculator, Camera, Files, Gallery, Offline Contacts, SMS messaging, GrapheneOS Secure PDF Viewer, Telephone, and Vanadium, and Clock. The Calendar app is there but currently it doesn't allow you to add appointments to it.
00:02:23 <TheJollyRoger> And of course, you'll get Auditor.
00:02:33 <TheJollyRoger> I'll add that to the FAQ in a sec.
00:02:38 <zazagx> oh great thanks
00:04:18 <zazagx> I used to have the lastest and greatest smartphones. I have a flip phone right now. its running KaiOS, but it uses Google apps.
00:05:03 <zazagx> I was debating on getting a Oneplus 6t and using Lineage OS, but the phone is out of stock right now.
00:05:26 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, well, if you are interested in security, exploit mitigation, and actual, pragmatic privacy, you've come to the right place.
00:05:36 <zazagx> yeah i am
00:05:39 <TheJollyRoger> ^_^
00:05:55 <zazagx> i am actually going to try to delete my google account soon
00:06:56 <TheJollyRoger> It's kind of funny you bring up OnePlus... recently one of the members in this channel discovered that OnePlus phones don't actually do verified boot even though that's demanded of them in the Android Specification.
00:07:20 <zazagx> for the bootloader?
00:08:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. Seems that some of their devices don't seem to do it properly even though they say they do.
00:09:03 <zazagx> well, was it ordered from the oneplus website?
00:09:11 <TheJollyRoger> Dunno.
00:09:56 <zazagx> in USA, they have the oneplus 6t t-mobile version. its locked... its dumb.... if you have a postpaid account you need to wait 40 days to unlock it from t-mobile
00:10:28 <zazagx> or if you have a prepaid account from t-mobile, they make you wait 365 days to unlock it
00:11:01 <zazagx> I tried calling t-mobile support, they told me and it says on thier website too
00:11:45 <zazagx> so, i am giving up on the oneplus 6t usa version
00:12:32 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. Glad to hear you're getting off that dumpster fire!
00:13:05 <zazagx> yeah
00:13:34 <zazagx> but i am not sure if i want a pixel 3a, i still have my pixel 3, but its locked
00:14:17 <TheJollyRoger> Aw, darn!
00:14:36 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixel 3a will be similar to your 3, but it will have a 3mm headphone jack, a feature I really miss.
00:14:46 <zazagx> lol
00:15:09 <TheJollyRoger> Wonder if your provider has a tradein program?
00:15:19 <zazagx> i just got more headphone jacks for my audio. because my flip phone doesn't supprt usb type c
00:15:51 <TheJollyRoger> Aha!
00:16:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, for my 3 I have to use a Bluetooth adapter.
00:16:17 <zazagx> lol
00:16:38 <zazagx> yeah i took a purge. i had a google smartwatch
00:17:56 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Back from lunch, time to poke at it more
00:19:15 <TheJollyRoger> Go JTL Go!
00:19:31 <TheJollyRoger> I'm trying a for and echo using some stuff I found on stackexchange, no luck yet.
00:19:57 <zazagx> i have been using linux for years. do you guys know if grapneneos will be supported for years to come? any back up plans if the main dev leaves
00:22:32 <aeonsolution[m]> Hey everyone, can someone help me understand Updating and switching branch or tags https://grapheneos.org/build#updating-and-switching-branches-or-tags
00:22:45 <TheJollyRoger> I can't answer that, but my backup plan if Daniel Micay resigns is to shout "Oh no" repeatedly and progressively louder.
00:23:04 <zazagx> lol
00:23:15 <zazagx> i assume someone might fork
00:23:26 <madaidan[m]> My backup plan is to collapse to the ground in a fetal position
00:23:31 <zazagx> i thought you were Daniel Micay
00:23:58 <aeonsolution[m]> I just finished downloading both development and stable branches installed so im trying to understand the docs at this next step
00:24:15 <madaidan[m]> <zazagx "i assume someone might fork"> It will never be the same if Daniel leaves.
00:24:22 <TheJollyRoger> zazagx: ha, no, I'm just the greeter here.
00:24:53 <JTL> TheJollyRoger is a "Developer in Training" :P
00:24:57 <aeonsolution[m]> <TheJollyRoger "zazagx: ha, no, I'm just the gre"> You're being too modest!
00:25:14 <zazagx> oh
00:25:18 <TheJollyRoger> X3.
00:25:53 <zazagx> well, if i do install graphnene os, and if the main leader leaves, that would be problematic for me.
00:25:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hi aeonsolution[m] uh... crud. I'll try to experiment around with this in a bit, I haven't tried using the depot tools much.
00:26:26 <zazagx> unless its community base supported by users
00:26:29 <TheJollyRoger> Well... I can reassure you, there is one thing for certain: you *can* switch back.
00:26:46 <TheJollyRoger> To do so is just as easy as switching.
00:26:50 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Think I got the version number parsing working
00:26:51 <TheJollyRoger> The procedure is the same.
00:26:55 <JTL> (as in PowerShell)
00:27:00 <TheJollyRoger> Woah, awesome JTL!!!!
00:28:24 <aeonsolution[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi aeonsolution uh... crud. I'll"> Thank you, I'll be here.
00:28:42 <TheJollyRoger> Tad bit swamped... I'll try to see if I can figure out for.
00:28:57 <zazagx> thats good
00:29:09 <TheJollyRoger> JTL - I think I almost got it working in CMD... but it's extremely ugly.
00:29:20 <TheJollyRoger> Just a sec.
00:29:36 <JTL> Haha. Pretty sure I got it working in Powershell 5 minutes ago
00:29:41 <JTL> Ahahaha
00:30:37 <TheJollyRoger> Er, I mean I got the version isolation... so halfway there.
00:31:02 <JTL> Yeah
00:31:10 <JTL> Working on my solution some more
00:31:37 <zazagx> i don't know if i need a YubiKey, will graphnene os support it?
00:32:47 <TheJollyRoger> zazagx: Right now Yubikeys are supported by OpenKeyChain for PGP... but at this moment let me check if they're supported on Vanadium via the NFC.
00:33:02 <TheJollyRoger> JTL: "fastboot --version | findstr version > fastboot.txt && for /F "tokens=3 delims= " %i in (fastboot.txt) DO echo %i" So far this is where I'm at in cmd
00:33:28 <TheJollyRoger> I have to delete the .txt afterward... heh. Feels like I'm back in OpenVMS again.
00:35:31 <TheJollyRoger> (Sorry if I'm a bit slow. I'm juggling several things at once)
00:35:44 <JTL> It's fine
00:38:46 <zazagx> we won't whip you
00:39:50 <JTL> :D
00:41:07 <TheJollyRoger> Okay, here we are... Yubikeys...
00:41:26 <TheJollyRoger> zazagx, I will test with a Yubikey 4 and Yubikey 5NFC.
00:41:33 <aeonsolution[m]> *pulls chair up
00:41:52 <zazagx> well, just a quick comment. you guys are really nice and helpful. i was at the other channel. the other ROM brand that starts with a "L" wasn't friendly, and not helpful
00:42:21 <TheJollyRoger> If I recall right some of the U2F logic *might* depend on Play Services, which aren't present in GrapheneOS... so I'll have a go by both NFC and USB.
00:42:26 <TheJollyRoger> Here we go...
00:44:56 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to test it using my Github... just a sec.
00:46:12 <seaclown> Should be able to use for /f with fastboot --version command, check for the second word being version, if so, set it to a variable to compare required version directly
00:46:19 <seaclown> Skip the text file
00:46:34 <TheJollyRoger> No dice so far, but let me try my Trezor as my backu--
00:46:39 <TheJollyRoger> seaclown: oh joy thank you!
00:47:03 <seaclown> Just been a long time, working it out, lol
00:47:45 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, darn, it looks like I can't get my security key to work with Github... but I can try a U2F test site. One moment.
00:48:49 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Working on the fastboot version detection now
00:50:46 <zazagx> ok, i just purchased a brand new unlocked pixel 3a, with a case from the google store
00:51:49 <TheJollyRoger> Here we go, testing on yubikey's demo...
00:52:54 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. I can't seem to get it to work on Vanadium at this very moment. The functionality I think is still there, but it might need some additional code to get it to work in the absence of GPlay.
00:53:09 <zazagx> oh, its cool
00:54:05 * brenneke[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ODNxQnJLAJoqXnTzTsyFEMRF >
00:54:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. :(. Just U2F doesn't seem to work at this moment, however, I can send and recieve PGP-encrypted E-mails via my cellphone using OpenKeyChain and K-9Mail.
00:54:37 <TheJollyRoger> However, something I notice about K-9 Mail is that it insists on saving drafts to your mail server unencrypted.
00:54:56 <TheJollyRoger> Which... argh.
00:55:00 <TheJollyRoger> I might have to ask them about that.
00:56:02 <zazagx> i have never used k-9 mail before
00:56:27 <TheJollyRoger> Some people here use it, I think some other people prefer FairEmail though, but I'm not sure what the differences are between the two.
00:56:41 <TheJollyRoger> I use K-9Mail because I'm kinda old fashioned.
00:56:49 <aeonsolution[m]> Android power
00:57:48 <zazagx> oh
00:58:36 * cx2[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/qBhwPRRKDJIIkwGnSSEPERmc >
01:01:30 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: so uh... in terms of mail clients, I think you may just have to try both and see which one you like more.
01:02:01 <zxwayland> oh thanks
01:02:15 <zxwayland> i was always using the gmail app on mobile
01:04:02 <TheJollyRoger> Got it!
01:11:51 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... so far no luck on on Github or on demo.yubico. I think some code needs to be written to allow Vanadium to talk to the Yubikey in the absence of GPlay.
01:12:06 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just gonig to try it again with my Trezor.
01:15:04 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, no dice. My Trezor can be detected by Trezor Manager and work with it, but it's just I think U2F that's missing a library from GPlay. Just that function.
01:15:10 <TheJollyRoger> However the other functions seem to work fine.
01:15:34 <TheJollyRoger> So missing a library or some code
01:15:38 <seaclown> FOR /F "tokens=2,3" %%i in ('fastboot --version') do if "%%i"=="version" set RESULT=%%j
01:16:15 <seaclown> RESULT is the version # that can be used to compare
01:16:59 <TheJollyRoger> Oh sweet. Let me give this a try...
01:17:15 <TheJollyRoger> I'm getting a "%%i was unexpected at this time" error though...?
01:17:38 <zxwayland> gosh, i have been spelling grapheneos wrong this whole time
01:17:47 <JTL> grapeheneos
01:17:48 <JTL> yummy
01:18:04 <seaclown> Odd..hmmm
01:18:11 <JTL> "grape phene"
01:18:14 <JTL> (just kidding)
01:18:17 <TheJollyRoger> XD
01:18:25 * TheJollyRoger spreads grape jelly on the bread.
01:18:45 <TheJollyRoger> Oh whoops, sorry for the ping X(
01:19:15 <JTL> I'm sure he gets that a lot
01:19:23 <JTL> I know others with incredibly generic nicks
01:19:42 <seaclown> Windows10 command prompt?
01:20:00 <TheJollyRoger> seaclown: yeah, trying to figure out how to get the fastboot check on Windows 10.
01:20:17 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Think I almost have it together
01:20:19 <TheJollyRoger> I happened to have a spare Windows drive but I've almost never used cmd before.
01:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> Go JTL go!
01:20:31 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: I have, but it's been several years for me
01:20:32 <seaclown> Mine works with that in a batch file
01:20:52 <aeonsolution[m]> do you have the path set up
01:21:08 <aeonsolution[m]> i can help you out with that
01:21:43 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, heh, uh... I just need to figure out how to do the equivalent of -eq in cmd X(, I think
01:21:57 <JTL> -ge
01:22:03 <JTL> greater or equal
01:23:35 <zxwayland> i am broke now ;(...just purchased the pixel 3a
01:23:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ack, whoop
01:23:48 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. Investment in phones!
01:24:28 <zxwayland> nooo, lol i want to install grapheneos and de-google my life
01:24:56 <TheJollyRoger> X3. Investment in privacy!
01:25:18 <zxwayland> if google was a man. I would punch it right in the face
01:27:32 * TheJollyRoger squeezes a red nose and makes a "honk!" sound
01:28:19 <zxwayland> Google the clown?
01:28:22 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Give it a bunch of garbage values and it seems to be working
01:28:27 <JTL> Gave*
01:28:36 <TheJollyRoger> Oh splice the mainbrace JTL!!!!
01:28:54 <JTL> Need to make sure it works with inline Powershell, but this is good
01:28:59 <JTL> Give me a few minutes
01:29:03 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
01:29:04 <TheJollyRoger> Whew!
01:29:46 <brenneke[m]> <cx2[m] "> <@brenneke:matrix.org> Syncthi"> Yes and I do that when I accept on desktop and it works fine but if I initiate folder sync from desktop and accept on phone, there is not option in phone app to enter or choose a file path on phone. I am OK with just doing what works but wondering if that is the way it is supposed to be or I am missing something.
01:31:51 <cx2[m]> AFAIK that should work. I have shares: phone --> machine and machine--> phone. No issues here.
01:34:36 <zxwayland> wait, if i downloaded the .apk from a vpn website, will it install?
01:39:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> ...the hell's a VPN website?
01:39:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> You mean, if you download a branded VPN app from your VPN provider's site?
01:39:45 <zxwayland> yeah
01:39:58 <zxwayland> it has the .apk
01:40:14 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Well, first, I'd recommend not doing that.
01:40:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> No reason to trust their implementation of OpenVPN or Wireguard when you can use the official version.
01:41:48 <zxwayland> its from the official website, it works for android. its not on the f-droid website
01:42:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <DannyWorkOrderPr "No reason to trust their impleme"> Reread this and/or ask questions about it until you understand what I'm saying, lol
01:43:12 <zxwayland> well, i assume grapheneos will work with the built in vpn app?
01:43:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Your VPN provider is (usually) repackaging OpenVPN or Wireguard with their own logo and presets in it. How well it's implemented, or how updated they keep it compared to upstream (the original place they get the code from) is usually a bit up in the air.
01:44:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <zxwayland "well, i assume grapheneos will w"> Not sure what this means.
01:44:57 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Anyway, I'd figure out if your VPN is OpenVPN or Wireguard, and then download that app, and import/type in the connection details from your provider.
01:45:14 <zxwayland> ah, I haven't used a smartphone for 4 months already. umm in the android settings... there is a wifi setting... you can set up the login for the vpn
01:46:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It doesn't have OpenVPN or Wireguard compatibility, just IPSec and other semi-outdated stuff. This would go back to knowing what tech your provider is using =]
01:47:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Wireguard or OVPN will be listed in that VPN menu you're talking about, though
01:47:23 <zxwayland> ohh
01:49:20 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: GrapheneOS also supports VPN as a built-in function natively. If you can, you should use that, since it includes an "Always-On" function, which forces the app to go through the VPN and prevents the app from "leaking" outside the VPN if the connection to your VPN service provider quits.
01:49:55 <TheJollyRoger> It's very likely though that if the website offers an official release apk, it will run on GrapheneOS.
01:50:02 <zxwayland> ohh nice
01:50:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, check under Settings under "Network and Internet" and look for "VPN"
01:50:55 <zxwayland> will it work with wireguard protocol?
01:54:06 <TheJollyRoger> That I'm actually not sure. I haven't used it before and I generally don't use VPNs; but I think a few people here have tested the userspace implementation of wireguard and had success with it.
01:54:34 <zxwayland> ohh
01:55:06 <zxwayland> wait, maybe i won't need it. if grapheneos doesn't have any tracking google apps
01:57:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <zxwayland "will it work with wireguard prot"> As I said, if you install Wireguard (the official app), it will tie into the inbuilt VPN manager in GrapheneOS/Android
01:58:19 <zxwayland> ohh, i wasn't sure if the grapheneos was compatible with the android apk file
01:58:26 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderPr: ah thanks for clarifying, whoop.
01:59:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <zxwayland "ohh, i wasn't sure if the graphe"> Surely will, but, as said a few times now, probably don't use that. Not sure if you're not understanding my recommendation, or just disagree with it, lol
01:59:11 <TheJollyRoger> zxwayland: it likely will be. GrapheneOS is usually compatible with most android apps that don't have a hard-coded dependency on Play Services, and aren't like... abandoned for old versions of Android written many years ago.
01:59:20 <TheJollyRoger> X3.
02:00:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I agree with DannyWorkOrderPr, if the operating system already has it no need to add another middleman.
02:00:13 <zxwayland> hmmm
02:00:50 <zxwayland> does it have a kill switch?
02:02:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yes. Even adds one to the "tile menu" in the pulldown bar
02:02:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> The official Wireguard app (as in, Wireguard.com) is off-the-chain awesome.
02:02:36 <zxwayland> nice
02:03:28 <zxwayland> i am not sure if i should use a vpn on a smartphone. its slower and drains a lot of battery usage. I used to use ProtonVPN
02:04:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> ProtonVPN is an OpenVPN...uh...VPN
02:04:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Wireguard, in comparison, only sends packets when you're sending traffic
02:04:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I have found it to be wildly performant compared to OpenVPN in almost every usecase. As in, I don't notice it.
02:05:15 <zxwayland> oh, i thought wireguard is just a smaller code line protocol fot vpn. like its easier to read the code and fix bug problems
02:05:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It's also one of the stronger ways to improve the security of WiFi traffic (which I consider untrusted, due to its ability to be captured, authentication packets and all, and decrypted/SSID passphrase found at a later point)
02:06:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <zxwayland "oh, i thought wireguard is just "> It is those things, and the things I said. But it's not OpenVPN. New protocol entirely.
02:06:29 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Read the documentation at Wireguard.com
02:06:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Jason's a hell of a guy, and a fantastic writer.
02:06:55 <zxwayland> ohh
02:11:14 <zxwayland> oh crap, i forgot the time
02:11:22 <zxwayland> thanks for the help guys
02:18:29 <TheJollyRoger> Luck :). See you soon.
02:41:40 <JTL> strcat: Do you have some "known bad" version numbers of fastboot?, just trying to assess if my powershell implementation is working the same as the Unix equivalent.
02:42:09 <strcat[m]> 28.0.1 is the last 'bad' one
02:42:11 <strcat[m]> it just removes the .
02:42:16 <JTL> right
02:42:21 <strcat[m]> and compares to 2802 for whatever reason
02:42:23 <JTL> thanks
02:42:40 <strcat[m]> so if they ever have .10
02:42:42 <strcat[m]> it will break lol
02:43:47 <JTL> okay it detects 28.0.1 as bad
02:43:48 <JTL> good
02:44:22 <JTL> I'm just emulating the fastboot output by a set of careful bat files, so I don't have to futz with multiple versions
02:44:40 <JTL> as in fastboot --version output
02:45:49 <seaclown> Https://pastebin.com/XmCaJG35
02:45:59 <seaclown> Will check version and abort
02:53:26 <aeonsolution[m]> hey everyone, does building the kernel for the development branch take long? its hanging on the:
02:53:26 <aeonsolution[m]> LTO vmlinux.o line
02:54:21 <JTL> That's linker time optimization, and if I remember right it loves to use RAM
02:54:52 <fujita_[m]> Guys, is there a specific setting thats needed for GPS to work. Currently Im using magic earth but it can't seem to detect my location when GPS is "ON"
02:56:37 <fujita_[m]> WiFi scanning is on and the permission for location is "allow all the time"
02:58:42 <aeonsolution[m]> <JTL "That's linker time optimization,"> thank you, that explains it
03:02:46 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yipes.
03:10:08 <TheJollyRoger> Hi fujita_[m] we've experienced some problems with GPS on GrapheneOS taking some time to work initially. Can you get to a good location where there's good reception, and try letting it do its magic for a bit?
03:11:05 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Want to talk on Mumble soon?
03:11:11 <TheJollyRoger> Sure :)
03:11:18 <JTL> (was going to say that in PMs but forgot)
03:11:20 <JTL> Oops lol
03:11:35 <JTL> Well to be fair I was going to discusss this
03:12:45 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! I'll be on in a bit, I just have to fix some stuff here.
03:13:55 <JTL> Yeah okay
03:24:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <TheJollyRoger "Hi fujita_ we've experienced som"> Move the phone in a figure-8. No, not a joke.
03:25:49 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: Have you got a stable Riot acct yet, or am I going to need to get Freenode'd/Mumble'd up to collab with you on a Community Wiki?
03:29:08 <TheJollyRoger> I've got a stable Riot account but it leads to my phone which is usually sitting on a charging plate when I'm at home.
03:29:35 <TheJollyRoger> I have a mumble server at mumble.jollyrogers.ca and I might be there later, I just have  some non-computer work to finish here.
03:35:29 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Man, I've still got this one phone that won't keep its APN enabled. the radio button for it keeps going null/becoming unselected. Yet...there's only one in the list, lol
03:42:19 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about being such a deadbeat... lotta things came together past couple days.
03:42:37 <JTL> I get it
03:42:41 <JTL> Been there done that
03:42:47 <renlord> took like 10 days to get ovh validation done
03:42:49 <renlord> ffs
03:42:51 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <JTL "I get it"> You're fired ;D
03:42:57 <JTL> rude
03:42:59 <JTL> :P
03:43:02 <JTL> renlord: what kind of validation?
03:43:09 <renlord> identity validation
03:43:12 <JTL> ah yes
03:43:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> That was meant for TJR, hahaha
03:43:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> but YOU CAN JOIN HIM if morale doesn't improve!
03:44:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> and other sublte pirate ship references
03:46:43 <TheJollyRoger> ...ten days?
03:46:55 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha X3.
03:47:03 <TheJollyRoger> Aaaaaa
03:47:28 * TheJollyRoger watches the "You're fired!" letters in bright all capital letters come pouring out of every printer in the house including the ones that aren't plugged in like in Back To The Future.
03:55:03 <fujita_[m]> @dannyknoll:matrix.org:  Magic seems to not have a calibration mode so I just open the app n did the figure 8  but I doesn't seem to work (same with OSM). Nothing too urgent though, I will just treat it as a privacy feature and bookmark key locations.
03:55:15 <fujita_[m]> It*
03:55:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Turn by turn is for plebs that drive into rivers anyway, if you can get a list of instructions, that should be solid =]
03:56:13 <DannyWorkOrderPr> address street, city, state, country to address street, city, state, country
03:56:31 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Makes it more likely you'll actually know where the hell you're going, too - and maybe not need the service next time!
03:57:34 <fujita_[m]> Yeah, make my brain think a little. I feel so dumb down using google map for everything
03:57:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I loved their services...until they got so shitty I was missing turns, lol
03:58:18 <fujita_[m]> I live in Singapore so it pretty simple to get around anyways
03:58:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> That was a big help in ejecting from the cognitive dissonance of knowing they were AIDS, and making the jump to services I knew respected me
03:58:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> number of years back
03:58:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <fujita_[m] "I live in Singapore so it pretty"> Oh, that's cool as hell. Do you have a mount for your phone for your motorbike handlebars? =P
04:00:36 <fujita_[m]> No motorbike, just bicycle (mainly use to find the my way home, since I like to explore the city unplanned) and I mostly use map to get the bus routes
04:01:45 <fujita_[m]> Personal vehicle here are hella expensive
04:07:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Shit, I'd give me left nut to come explore there with ya, mate
04:08:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Assuming you're not native? If not, where from, if you don't mind me asking?
06:16:54 <joshman[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "ProtonVPN is an OpenVPN...uh...V"> NordVPN is wireguard. Fast and cheap. And I like they're Panama based. Wouldn't recommend any VPN for sensitive stuff though
06:24:08 <joshman[m]> And it's insanely stable on GOS compared to iOS which frequently drops connection exposing real IP

07:12:08 <renlord> does ovh's ipv6 even work?
07:12:10 <renlord> @_@
07:13:22 <JTL> renlord: it doesn't
07:13:25 <JTL> this is a well known fact
07:13:29 <renlord> lol
07:13:32 <renlord> ok
07:13:37 <JTL> https://otacon22.com/2016/02/21/two-hosting-providers-ipv6-setups-compared-ovh-online-net/
07:13:50 <renlord> man, i'd thought in 2020, it'd be working
07:13:58 <JTL> OVH must love weed
07:14:03 <JTL> "we'll get to it eventually"
07:14:17 <JTL> that's probably why /s
07:14:21 <renlord> is the provider even trustworthy?
07:14:26 <JTL> OVH?
07:14:32 <JTL> probably a coin toss really
07:14:33 <renlord> looks like the whole operation is run very lax...
07:14:54 <JTL> They are a large ISP and datacenter provider in Europe
07:15:09 <JTL> so I guess by being "big" they habe some element of trust from that
07:15:11 <JTL> lol
07:15:33 <renlord> @_@
07:15:43 <JTL> What's funny is they even have DSL/FTTP connections in France in some form
07:15:53 <JTL> alledgedly comes with their DDoS mitigation too
07:16:46 <JTL> lol the comment on that article
07:16:58 <JTL> > Well… I worked at OVH for a few years, and I can assure you : it’s worse than that.
07:17:00 <JTL> > OVH CTO/CEO, Oles, said «I don’t care about IPv6, nobody use this shit».
07:17:19 <JTL> To quote someone else who saw that article: "OVH sounds like a fucked up company"
07:20:37 <renlord> lol
07:20:40 <renlord> my god
07:36:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): BTW what's the deal with frame pointers?
07:36:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> In a hardening context
07:37:10 <renlord> i am not aware of security implications exposing frame pointers
07:37:26 <renlord> i thought optimizing them away is just for minute performance improvements and make debugging a lot harder
07:37:35 <JTL> >make debugging a lot harder
07:37:37 <JTL> hehe
07:37:55 <renlord> fkin hate dwarf unwinding
07:45:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord "i am not aware of security impli"> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): os_issue_tracker has an issue of disabling them globally
07:45:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> So was just thinking
07:45:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> So which unwinding do you prefer?
07:45:55 <renlord> stack unwinding using frame pointer?
07:46:10 <renlord> so i actually know what the stacktrace looks like?
07:46:34 <renlord> maybe there's a good reason to do it on user builds
07:46:46 <renlord> so when the stacktrace is thrown, not so much information gets exposed
07:47:17 <renlord> probably makes sense from a hardening context
07:47:51 <renlord> but i cant really read strcat[m]'s mind. He may have different reasons.
07:48:38 <renlord> i am so mad at rust binaries optimizing away frame pointers.
07:48:48 <renlord> force-frame-pointers flag in rustc does not even fkin work
07:49:51 <JTL> Have you talked with strcat about rust?
07:50:30 <renlord> not really, the rust channel is also useless, nobody seems to know what i'm talking about
07:51:18 <renlord> only obsessing over rust idioms
07:52:25 <renlord> if i was interested in beautiful languages i'd have gone to ##linguistics instead.
07:52:49 <JTL> strcat is ex rust developer
07:54:53 <renlord> i'll ask when he's around
07:58:58 <JTL> > 00:50 <@renlord> not really, the rust channel is also useless, nobody seems to know what i'm talking about
07:59:00 <JTL> lol how so?
07:59:22 <renlord> nobody does not seem to have a good understanding how the toolchain works
07:59:36 <renlord> *no one seems to have
07:59:53 <JTL> Can't say I'm surprised, that's kind of obscure stuff for most folks
08:12:25 <joshman[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Just host your own"> Not a solution. I need at least 5-6 ips from different countries
08:15:37 <joshman[m]> * Not a solution. I need at least 5-6 ips from different countries. Hosting 6 servers around the world would make me a small size VPN provider 😄 and at least 40$ poorer on a monthly basis
08:19:42 <dazinism> fujita_  First GPS lock can take some time. It may have to download data from satellites so can help if you are outside
08:22:53 <dazinism> Also if I'm not getting confused theres other data that the phone downloads from the internet. So need to let that happen
08:24:03 <dazinism> Was reading that Magic Earth makes most of its connections over http rather than https
08:24:45 <dazinism> Possibly a concern worth considering.
08:30:10 <dazinism> <DannyWorkOrderPr "TheJollyRoger: Have you got a st"> I set up https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Home
08:31:20 <dazinism> Welcome contributions, or any thoughts about it, or ideas of what would be good to add.
08:43:09 <dazinism> https://f-droid.org/app/com.android.gpstest.osmdroid
08:44:38 <dazinism> fujita_: ^ thats pretty nice for seeing whats going on with your GPS - which satellites you see/connect to etc.
08:52:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <joshman[m] "Not a solution. I need at least "> Maybe don't ddos other people so much?
08:58:47 <renlord[m]> Lol
09:08:39 <dazinism> ... actually apparently Magic Earth sorted out the http connections,  all is done via https now.
10:01:59 <dazinism> -biscuits-: not sure how that works. Cant think of anything GrapheneOS related, other than if theres bugs in the software that are causing problems due to GrapheneOS hardened memory allocator. Its pretty rare this causes issues
10:02:33 <dazinism> -biscuits-: other thing is it could be related to the lack of Google Play Services
10:04:52 <dazinism> May be worth doing some searches to see if people are managing to use it with LineageOS
10:04:52 <hitchhooker[m]> probably google push notifications
10:05:32 <joshman[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Maybe don't ddos other people so"> Maybe back off and rethink your behavior
10:07:01 <dazinism> More ddos?
10:42:30 <renlord> hmm, with dane, is it still necessary to have HTST or Cert Pinning?
10:43:13 <renlord> unless the RTT with DANE and extra checks hurt user experience so much so that its still better to have the former?
10:43:40 <renlord> but people already do kind of expect sending an email to be immediate
11:55:03 <seaclown> JTL - not sure if you saw it last night but I posted a paste bin bat which does the same thing as the current .sh. Strips version, removes . and compares to min.  I know you're working on something a bit more advanced but its there if at all useful.
11:55:12 <seaclown> Be back this afternoon, going riding
11:57:09 <needhelp-basicbr> anyone here used Magic Wormhole or croc? Need help in regards to Magic and install for windows 10. thanks
11:57:50 <Cyrinux[m]> croc will be better in windows i think, because its python
11:57:52 <Cyrinux[m]>  * croc will be better in windows i think, because its golang
11:58:09 <Cyrinux[m]> I use magic wormhole but got my own croc instance, croc is very well
11:58:26 <needhelp-basicbr> okay, I checked github but there's no install file only zip for windows 64bit
11:58:51 <needhelp-basicbr> install guide/help would be greatly welcomed.
11:59:21 <needhelp-basicbr> Also, have tried finding a windows 10 install guide, but couldn't... unless i missed it
12:00:04 <Cyrinux[m]> windows 32 binary should make the job
12:00:16 <Cyrinux[m]> just take the zip https://github.com/schollz/croc/releases/download/v8.0.9/croc_8.0.9_Windows-32bit.zip and unzip it
12:00:29 <needhelp-basicbr> okay
12:00:39 <Cyrinux[m]> there is a croc.exe that will be sufficiant in
12:01:02 <needhelp-basicbr> If I wanted to used Magic Wormhole, how would I install it?
12:02:50 <Cyrinux[m]> i think install python for windows, then python ./setup.py install
12:03:22 <needhelp-basicbr> I unzip and open it, only comes up with - Enter receive code. referring to croc
12:03:30 <Cyrinux[m]> it will be simpliierrr with croc
12:03:33 <Cyrinux[m]>  * it will be simpliierrr with croc trust me
12:03:39 <needhelp-basicbr> okay
12:03:53 <Cyrinux[m]> so croc works ...
12:04:06 <Cyrinux[m]> read the doc to use it now
12:06:05 <needhelp-basicbr> doc in zip file?
12:06:30 <Cyrinux[m]> https://github.com/schollz/croc
12:08:11 <needhelp-basicbr> another thing, why when i open it asks for Enter receive code:
12:09:22 <Cyrinux[m]> what is your goal
12:11:52 <needhelp-basicbr> to send files to another comp
12:12:01 <Cyrinux[m]> needhelp-basicbr: just read the manual, if you dont give something as input this will ask you a receive code to receive something
12:12:22 <Cyrinux[m]> croc send myfile.txt on the sender
12:12:47 <Cyrinux[m]> then croc on the receiver and put the code the croc sender give you
12:15:15 <Cyrinux[m]>  * "croc send myfile.txt" on the sender
12:16:48 <needhelp-basicbr> keeps crashing
12:17:52 <mxnorvak[m]> I was wondering since custom hardware is a goal for GrapheneOS based phones, are there any plans for a future GrapheneOS that is actually something completely new and not based on AOSP?
12:18:51 <matic_nick[m]> Does anyone use eap-tls?
12:20:41 <soliquid> <mxnorvak[m] "I was wondering since custom har"> Yes, there are. Obviously not happening in the foreseeable future though
12:24:09 <soliquid> The idea is to base GrapheneOS on a microkernel architecture. It's just a distant goal atm, I don't think there's much more to say
12:28:12 <matic_nick[m]> <matic_nick[m] "Does anyone use eap-tls?"> How vulnerable are users if the key server ever gets compromised?
12:31:54 <mxnorvak[m]> <soliquid "The idea is to base GrapheneOS o"> Thanks
12:53:21 <cx2[m]> off topic - PDF Editors for desktop... anyone have suggestions?
12:59:46 <mxnorvak[m]> I think you can use libre office
13:01:30 <cx2[m]> to edit? ive nver tried..... i'll give it a shot
13:03:56 <mischling[m]> talking about pfds, the included one is pretty barebones so i use libera. there are other security risks beside clicking on dubious links?
13:05:49 <cx2[m]> I'm talking about desktop applications. Not on your handset. The I would recommend using the PDF app that is packaged with GrapheneOS unless you created the document or Sanitized it yourself.....
13:07:01 <mxnorvak[m]> <cx2[m] "to edit? ive nver tried..... i'l"> Yea
13:12:20 <mxnorvak[m]> <cx2[m] "off topic - PDF Editors for desk"> What is your choice for just a pdf viewer?
13:13:26 <cx2[m]> Preview works fine really. But I guess LibreOffice Stepped it up a bit
13:17:32 <mxnorvak[m]> Preview? Is it available for windows?
13:23:52 <cx2[m]> I don't believe it does. it's the stock PDF viewer on macOS

16:28:42 <strcat[m]> renlord: HSTS is an HTTPS feature, doesn't impact email
16:28:57 <strcat[m]> renlord: you should still use a Web PKI certificate with DANE for email
16:29:00 <strcat[m]> and set up MTA-STS
16:29:10 <strcat[m]> because few people actually VERIFY DANE
16:29:35 <strcat[m]> gmail, protonmail, fastmail, outlook, etc. none of them verify DANE
16:29:38 <strcat[m]> gmail and outlook do use MTA-STS
16:29:47 <strcat[m]> most mail providers have no TLS authentication at all
16:30:15 <strcat[m]> microsoft said they're adding DANE for both inbound (i.e. DNS records + DNSSEC) and outbound (i.e. verifying DNSSEC + DANE themselves)
16:30:32 <strcat[m]> netherlands has super high adoption of DANE in terms of DNSSEC + DANE records but... few verify it
16:30:45 <strcat[m]> what happens when the government standardizes using it
16:30:48 <strcat[m]> but not verifying it
16:30:55 <strcat[m]> so it's just there - and can be verified if you want
16:31:15 <strcat[m]> no point of DANE for HTTPS even though you can do it since nothing checks
16:32:11 <strcat[m]> renlord: also you should set it up for all the ports on the mail server not just 25 - might as well enable for the submission port, smtps, imap and imaps ports too if enabled
16:47:49 <nickcalyx[m]> > no point of DANE for HTTPS even though you can do it since nothing checks
16:47:49 <nickcalyx[m]> There used to be these browser plugins from nic.cz but they stopped maintaining them
16:48:27 <nickcalyx[m]> Its another project I've wanted to revive
16:48:55 <nickcalyx[m]> For years was trying to get Tor browser to include them
20:14:16 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: the reason Firefox and Chromium haven't is because DNSSEC is unreliable due to networks screwing it up or messing with DNS
20:14:34 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: so something like ~5% of people can't receive DNSSEC responses even if they switch to a DNS server providing them
20:14:50 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: but DNS-over-TLS / DNS-over-HTTPS fix that since nothing can mess with the DNSSEC queries
20:15:14 <strcat[m]> plus it means the resolver authenticating DNSSEC means you can at least trust it to do it for you even if you don't have a local resolver like unbound doing it
20:15:26 <strcat[m]> or a library like libunbound doing it in the browser (probably what they have to do for now)
20:15:37 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: so maybe it will change due to that
20:15:58 <strcat[m]> they could add DANE without DNSSEC for DNS-over-HTTPS/DNS-over-TLS and then add DNSSEC via libunbound later
20:16:08 <strcat[m]> can enforce DANE regardless
20:16:18 <TheJollyRoger> strcat, should I start incorporating your writeup in the faq about separate user profiles into the usage guide?
20:16:23 <strcat[m]> ideally there is DNSSEC locally but DNS-over-TLS -> DNSSEC enforcing resolver is better than nothing
20:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Condensing it, and then clarifying about work profiles?
20:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> I'm rebasing some of the PRs that are outstanding right now.
21:17:58 <zoraver[m]> strcat: Vanadium on the latest release of GrapheneOS reports itself as 32-bit on chrome://version
21:22:16 <zoraver[m]> Inspecting the contents of https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_external_vanadium/blob/10/prebuilt/arm64/TrichromeLibrary.apk reveals that libmonochrome.so is 32-bit
21:22:26 <zoraver[m]> Unless I am missing something
21:22:32 <strcat[m]> zoraver: there's both a 32-bit and 64-bit library
21:22:57 <strcat[m]> I think we lost a change to use is_64_bit_browser at some point
21:22:59 <strcat[m]> the webview should still be 64-bit
21:23:06 <strcat[m]> I don't know when that change got lost
21:23:14 <JTL> > 04:55 <seaclown> JTL - not sure if you saw it last night but I posted a paste bin bat which does the same thing as the current .sh. Strips version, removes . and compares to min.  I know you're working on something a bit more advanced but its there if at all useful.
21:23:16 <JTL> Yeah. I wrote an implementation last night that uses inline PowerShell in the .BAT (and PowerShell is included by default with Windows 7 and later)
21:25:33 <zoraver[m]> strcat: Yeah, the webview appears to be 64-bit
21:27:03 <strcat[m]> thanks for noticing it
21:27:06 <strcat[m]> will change it again
21:27:13 <strcat[m]> I think something changed upstream
21:27:18 <strcat[m]> the target I was using was originally 64-bit afaik
21:33:26 <cdesai> strcat[m]: do you know if the server needs anything special for streaming OTAs?
21:33:45 <strcat[m]> cdesai: you need to generate more files
21:34:00 <strcat[m]> cdesai: so, you need to have an update package without payload.bin in it, and another with it
21:34:05 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I had it working with just the one incremental, but it won't on another server.
21:34:06 <strcat[m]> cdesai: that's it on the server
21:34:32 <strcat[m]> cdesai: do you mean my sample streaming code? that doesn't actually help since it downloads the entire update package
21:34:36 <strcat[m]> then streams the payload from within it
21:34:40 <strcat[m]> it's just for testing it
21:34:45 <strcat[m]> really you need another update package WITHOUT payload.bin in it
21:34:50 <strcat[m]> and when using streaming, download that one
21:35:10 <cdesai> strcat[m]: yes, that. I enabled it as a workaround for that updater issue, and it does work even if not the right thing.
21:35:30 <strcat[m]> how does it work around it?
21:35:44 <strcat[m]> oh to avoid writing to the ota_package directory?
21:35:47 <cdesai> no access to /data/ota_package, so can't download ota to the usual stop
21:35:47 <cdesai> yeah
21:35:49 <cdesai> spot*
21:36:02 <strcat[m]> cdesai: well it needs HTTP Range requests
21:36:05 <strcat[m]> to request payload at the offsety
21:36:12 <strcat[m]>  * to request payload at the offset
21:36:13 <strcat[m]> but so does resuming downloads
21:36:21 <strcat[m]> if that's broken, resuming is broken, and resuming is used very often
21:36:28 <cdesai> exactly, that does work
21:39:21 <TheJollyRoger> Hi strcat[m], I condensed the ~20 CTS test cases I ran to a single text report here: https://jollyrogers.ca/public/cts-report-blueline-QQ2A.200405.005.2020.04.14.23.txt I've referenced some of the ones that included too much information to be included here.
21:39:27 <cdesai> strcat[m]: also for chromium 64-bit, there's https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/master/docs/android_native_libraries.md#trichrome
21:39:39 <TheJollyRoger> Is this something like you'd hoped for, for the CTS test cases?
21:40:09 <TheJollyRoger> I included some footnotes in the bottom just in case.
21:41:53 <TheJollyRoger> I tested cts-java twice and cts-camera once in addition to the regular "cts" plan.
21:42:52 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: cts includes those
21:42:53 <TheJollyRoger> Going to just clarify it.
21:42:55 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
21:42:55 <strcat[m]> they're just less thorough plans
21:43:01 <TheJollyRoger> OHHHH
21:43:02 <strcat[m]> cts is everything sane to run
21:43:03 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops.
21:43:09 <strcat[m]> cts-java is the subset to test java
21:43:13 <strcat[m]> it is just a group of modules / tests
21:43:18 <strcat[m]> to run instead of the full plan
21:43:25 <strcat[m]> but you can manually pass modules yourself
21:43:37 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#compatibility-test-suite-run-modules
21:43:37 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
21:43:46 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: yes that's exactly what I want
21:43:53 <TheJollyRoger> Yay!
21:43:54 <strcat[m]> a list of what's currently broken
21:43:55 <TheJollyRoger> Okay uh...
21:43:59 <strcat[m]> and then slowly documenting which are expected
21:44:07 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to run it with some of the failures I identified and just see if I can reproduce a few of those.
21:44:21 <strcat[m]>     - android.security.cts.PackageSignatureTest#testPackageSignatures
21:44:23 <strcat[m]> so for example
21:44:23 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to try to narrow it down a bit, since I ran the cts about ~20 times.
21:44:25 <strcat[m]> this one
21:44:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah?
21:44:30 <strcat[m]> I think is just the CTS shooting itself in the foot
21:44:39 <strcat[m]> the CTS you're using is a test key signed CTS
21:44:43 <strcat[m]> and it's seeing packages it installed
21:44:49 <strcat[m]>     junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: These packages should not be signed with a well known key: [android.packageinstaller.admin.cts]
21:44:57 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: try just uninstalling any packages it accidentally left behind
21:45:10 <strcat[m]> look in apps (the regular list, not system) and remove any cts apps it left
21:45:11 <strcat[m]> then run that
21:45:17 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
21:45:22 <strcat[m]> and if as I expect that's the problem, just document it as a flaky CTS test
21:45:35 <strcat[m]> the issue is that an EARLIER test failed in some horrible way that didn't uninstall the package
21:45:36 <strcat[m]> or the package cleanup failed
21:45:36 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome, thanks!!
21:45:40 <strcat[m]> so it left a package
21:45:49 <strcat[m]> and since the CTS is test key signed, it gets mad about a package that IT PUT THERE
21:46:13 <TheJollyRoger> oh wow. That's so weird. So all I have to do is just pull the remaining cts apps off, and run it a few more times to make sure...?
21:46:34 <strcat[m]> yes just uninstall them
21:46:38 <strcat[m]> and run that test suite once (no need to run it more)
21:46:46 <strcat[m]> and I think the issue is sometimes the admin app doesn't get uninstalled
21:46:49 <strcat[m]> the one it uses to test admin stuff
21:47:10 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: also for all the failures you should put "- fail" or "- flaky" if it's just flaky and then describe it after
21:47:23 <strcat[m]> just so there are only 3 possible states to look for (pass, fail or flaky)
21:47:37 <strcat[m]> so you can ctrl-f search for "- fail"
21:47:38 <strcat[m]> and look through all
21:47:45 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, only three states for easy searching and indexing
21:48:19 <cdesai> TheJollyRoger: are you running cts manually?
21:55:39 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
21:56:00 <cdesai> https://source.android.com/compatibility/tests/development/android-test-station/ats-user-guide?hl=en
21:56:03 <TheJollyRoger> I'm running the cts plan and then I tried running some other cts test cases like cts-camera and cts-java since I didn't quite know what I was doing.
21:56:11 <TheJollyRoger> Oh!! Oh excellent!
21:56:26 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just seeing where things zonk out.
21:57:15 <TheJollyRoger> Since I don't have a USB-C Splitter what I've taken to doing is cordoning off my phone in the kitchen and running it from my laptop so I can leave it undisturbed at night.
22:00:09 <TheJollyRoger> But I can do it during the day now since right now I'm not going outside. The town is on lockdown so I just use the computer.
22:41:46 * mischling[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/fyIhGSBUoMFXSZwSMfNhWfAv >
23:06:56 <strcat[m]> mischling: GrapheneOS doesn't have Google apps and services, and either way services like that are opt-in / opt-out on the stock OS rather than mandatory
23:07:06 <strcat[m]> so even for the stock OS you can choose not to use services collecting that kind of information
23:08:10 <strcat[m]> about the clipboard: apps in the foreground have read/write access to the clipboard, that's how it works
23:08:28 <strcat[m]> that's how you are able to copy/paste
23:14:26 <cx2[m]> strcat: what constitutes "foreground"? Is it apps that have been recently accessed and are currently available in app switcher? If so, would clearing the app switcher in effect move the app into the background?
23:14:26 <cx2[m]> I apologize in advance if this is one of those "doh" questions.
23:14:55 <strcat[m]> the app that is currently actively, and foreground services
23:15:26 <strcat[m]>  * the app that is currently active, and foreground services
23:15:39 <strcat[m]> i.e. apps that are in the foreground and visible on the screen
23:16:32 <strcat[m]> if you do split screen both of those are foreground
23:16:35 <strcat[m]> if they target current API levels at least
23:18:16 <cx2[m]> Got it. So you could have 5 apps open, but are looking at vanadium and are about to login to a webpage. When you copy a password to the clipboard, only vanadium and not the other 4 apps should have access to the clipboard.
23:18:31 <strcat[m]> correct
23:18:42 <strcat[m]> unless one of them has a foreground service open
23:18:48 <strcat[m]> like Signal's foreground service
23:19:31 <cdesai> foreground services need to have a notification, so you'll be able to see those too, unless you've hidden the notification
23:19:34 <cx2[m]> Ok, great! Thanks for the help
23:20:30 <rwarr627[m]> Hey strcat . Can you explain issue #23 for the hardened_malloc project? https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/issues/23
23:20:31 <strcat[m]> actually on Android 10
23:20:32 <rwarr627[m]> Gonna start on that
23:20:38 <strcat[m]> the restriction is tightened up a bit
23:20:40 <strcat[m]> I don't think foreground services can access it
23:20:42 <strcat[m]> I think it's just the app with FOCUS and the configured default input method
23:21:09 <strcat[m]> yeah sorry was explaining that wrong
23:21:10 <cx2[m]> for whatever it's worth, I'm generally using magikeyboard when copy/pasting
23:21:22 <strcat[m]> some things are limited to foreground apps (including foreground services)
23:21:28 <strcat[m]> the clipboard restriction is stronger
23:21:42 <cx2[m]> <strcat[m] "I think it's just the app with F"> I guess that's what I was attempting to ask before but not using the right language.
23:21:48 <strcat[m]> it's restricted to the app with FOCUS or the default input method
23:22:40 <strcat[m]> i.e. your configured keyboard can provide a clipboard manager
23:22:42 <strcat[m]> but nothing else can
23:24:36 <cx2[m]> Copy all.
23:24:36 <cx2[m]> ...get it...😶
23:25:00 <JTL> strcat[m]: Just ran some tests and it looks like I got fastboot version detection working with inline PowerShell on Windows.
23:25:08 <JTL> (confirmed with my "shim" and the actual fastboot.exe binary)
23:25:33 <JTL> Someone else here already made a pure BAT version though :|
23:25:41 <JTL> seaclown
23:25:45 <mischling[m]> strcat thanks for the explanations
23:25:56 <strcat[m]> JTL: I'd rather use powershell
23:25:59 <JTL> Good
23:26:03 <strcat[m]> in anticipation of the script eventually being powershell
23:26:10 <strcat[m]> JTL: we only support Windows 10+
23:26:22 <JTL> Seeing how Powershell is included by default with Windows 7 and later, and that reason as well. I agree.
23:26:40 <strcat[m]> Windows 10 also has curl and bsdtar
23:26:42 <JTL> (the only Windows box I had handy that belonged to me was a Windows 7 box I use old haware with)
23:26:46 <JTL> lol
23:26:55 <strcat[m]> so we can switch the 'unzip' commands to 'tar xf' for Windows
23:27:00 <JTL> That makes sense
23:27:01 <strcat[m]> but unfortunately GNU tar is shit
23:27:11 <cdesai> version detection could be sent to AOSP
23:27:43 <JTL> cdesai: I'll make a PR after I confirm generate-factory-images-common.sh works with my inline powershell-foo added :D
23:27:49 <JTL> (to GrapheneOS that is)
23:29:09 <strcat[m]> they might not want to use powershell, not sure
23:29:27 <JTL> Eh whatever, still going to PR it to GrapheneOS soon
