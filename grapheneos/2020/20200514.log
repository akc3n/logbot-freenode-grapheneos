00:03:46 <virgin_eagle[m]> > make sure you VPN connection is IPv6
00:03:46 <virgin_eagle[m]> I read somewhere that ipv6 is not secure. And has leaks.
00:41:24 <strcat[m]> virgin_eagle: doesn't make sense
00:41:32 <strcat[m]> 'read somewhere'
00:41:34 <strcat[m]> where?
00:41:39 <strcat[m]> you can read a lot of random things on the internet
00:48:21 <strcat[m]> it's not really ipv6's job to be 'secure' unless you're talking about ipsec
00:49:01 * gervarouge[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/daZvWNPZufAfOiNOGISnpUWA >
00:49:12 <gervarouge[m]> It's all their lack of effort
00:55:36 <renlord> the networking layer does not have any notions of security
00:55:39 <renlord> ll
00:55:41 <renlord> lol
00:55:50 <strcat[m]> other than ipsec
00:55:54 <strcat[m]> which afaik is better in ipv6
00:55:57 <renlord> its either its implemented correctly, or its broken
00:56:09 <renlord> i think the author meant its broken
00:56:14 <renlord> which is unsurprising
01:06:34 <aeonsolution[m]> Hey everyone,  where is the best place to ask a question about the development branch commits on Github?
01:17:21 <aeonsolution[m]> False alarm, I figured it out.
01:21:43 <k3tan> sigh, really struggling here. my settings were absolutely fine yesterday. overnight, i woke up to my zerotier vpn disconnected. i connect to it, but after [random time, it's never the same] it just auto disconnects. it happens when im on wifi or 4G. there is no warning of disconnection, it usually happens after i keep the phone sitting there idle. i come back and vpn is disconnected. this was
01:21:44 <k3tan> working perfectly yesterday, i haven't changed any settings.
01:36:59 <bseeinu[m]> Any keepass android app with WebDAV support integrated?
01:54:45 <renlord[m]> <k3tan "sigh, really struggling here. my"> Which telco
01:54:56 <renlord[m]> Sounds like cgnat problems.
02:10:36 <k3tan> optus 5g
02:10:47 <k3tan> and boost mobile
02:11:02 <k3tan> but my router has a vpn on it
02:12:25 <brenneke[m]> Things not going so well with Google phones:
02:12:26 <brenneke[m]> Google Pixel’s camera lead quits after the failure of the Pixel 4 | Ars Technica
02:12:26 <brenneke[m]> https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/shakeup-at-google-sees-the-pixels-camera-lead-and-general-manager-quit/
02:17:02 <BalooRJ> The OG Pixel and Pixel 3a have been the best phones from this line
02:18:17 <BalooRJ> I don't understand how phone companies don't understand that the high range phone market is dead, everyone wants a midrange phone
02:18:26 <BalooRJ> and a haedphone jack
02:27:09 <renlord> k3tan: no surprise then
02:27:15 <renlord> optus 5g is an unreliable piece of shit
02:27:48 <renlord> and the price reflects that too
02:28:29 <k3tan> it's not optus in this case renlord
02:29:50 <k3tan> my pfsense router is connected to a vpn. zerotier drops out when i connect to it. when im not on my wifi and on boost mobile, still happens, drops out
02:30:35 <renlord> your router NAT then maybe?
02:39:57 <JTL> 19:18 <BalooRJ> I don't understand how phone companies don't understand that the high range phone market is dead, everyone wants a midrange phone
02:39:59 <JTL> Sure. And I feel this gave Purism (oops I used the "P" word) some leeway with the Librem 5 marketing wise. Sure I thought taking a random ARM SoC and slapping Debian on it to be a losing battle, among other issues, but I can understand the want for a phone that isn't "condescending" with omitted features.
02:40:19 <JTL> Doesn't change the fact I stil think Purism is a dumpsterfire with other issues.
02:40:22 <JTL> Anyways
02:42:11 <renlord> are there any respectable chinese soc manufacturers?
02:42:26 <renlord> i know people complain about mediatek all the time
02:42:34 <renlord> what about amlogic?
02:43:17 <JTL> I haz an odroid board with some USB controller issues I need to look at later
02:43:50 <rwarr627[m]> strcat: did a little searching but not too sure where to find information for malloc_object_size in AndroidHardeningArchive, if you're able to find where it's at I'd appreciate it
02:44:06 <JTL> renlord: I think the previous iteration of "this project" supported a SBC with a Huawei SoC
02:44:12 <JTL> some HiKey board
02:52:50 <gervarouge[m]> It most definitely did support a HiKey board
02:54:07 <renlord> they are like double the price of an amlogic soc
02:58:52 <gervarouge[m]> I feel if any device should be added it probably would be a Qualcomm reference phone if there could be something setup
02:59:13 <JTL> graphenehelp[m]: I can understand that
03:01:51 <gervarouge[m]> Google Pixels kinda suck as phones. If the 5a is bad I'm going iPhone
03:02:35 <strcat[m]> rwarr627: in platform_bionic
03:02:56 <gervarouge[m]> I had a lot of Pixels all had some issue beside my 3a and OG
03:03:02 <joshman[m]> BalooRJ do you base everyone's opinion on your own? For me 3a is cheap plastic with awkward display position. Headphone jack? No. I'll pass this waterhole
03:03:41 <JTL> joshman[m]: Water resistent phones with headphone jacks have been done before
03:04:27 <joshman[m]> I don't need water resistent headphone jack
03:04:50 <JTL> I would :)
03:04:50 <joshman[m]> I use TW earbuds or USBc
03:05:33 <gervarouge[m]> I wish I grabbed a Pixel 3 tbh
03:17:53 <MadCamel> I really wanted a headphone jack but I'd rather have a functional phone when (not if) I drop it in water because I'm a klutz.
03:19:08 <MadCamel> It's a shame there are no cases with a little usbc audio adapter built in. I'd happily use a slightly bulky case if it integrated a headphone jack. Can never find the dongle when it's needed.
03:19:33 <MadCamel> Maybe I'll just use ducktape.
03:39:30 <organella[m]> I got 3a because of headphone and I hate notches but it is a bit slow opening thing and I also sort of wish I got the 3 instead
03:40:43 <gervarouge[m]> <organella[m] "I got 3a because of headphone an"> You and me both. It was between the 3a and XR
03:40:48 <gervarouge[m]> The 3a is aight though
03:44:13 <organella[m]> Yeah, it's quite alright, the slowness is minor and only during loading and once the app is in ram it's as fast as anything
03:45:35 <gervarouge[m]> All the hardening
03:47:49 <organella[m]> Ah, totally forgot that would affect it too! It's only my second day on Graphene and my first thought was it's due to the storage type
04:02:25 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you also own hikey boards?
04:07:45 <JTL> > 20:17 <MadCamel> I really wanted a headphone jack but I'd rather have a functional phone when (not if) I drop it in water because I'm a klutz.
04:07:46 <JTL> The two aren't entirely mutually exclusive. Samsung has an IP68 "rugged" device with headphone jack, even removable battery (the back seems harder to remove by design), etc.
04:07:51 <JTL> I do agree it's more complex though
04:08:11 <gervarouge[m]> <organella[m] "Ah, totally forgot that would af"> No, most hardening features hit startup time and ram the hardest
04:08:36 <gervarouge[m]> Pixel 3 would be better, but it's more the rom. Stock is super fast for me
04:09:01 <gervarouge[m]> A small price to pay
04:09:23 <gervarouge[m]> That's the main reason Google hasn't upstreamed all the Graphene changes
04:09:31 <gervarouge[m]> They aren't as efficient as CFI and the like
04:09:56 <gervarouge[m]> There's work to improve the malloc on Android which is good, but it's not going to be hardened malloc level protections
04:10:49 <gervarouge[m]> Google is trying to strike that balance between performance and security which would be fine for iOS, but running on Linux is not an excellent thing
04:11:52 <gervarouge[m]> Imo
04:12:18 <gervarouge[m]> In all fairness Stock Pixels are incredibly secure compared to almost anything else
04:48:04 <brenneke[m]> Can anyone recommend a good magnifier app that works with GrapheneOS and doesn't ask for too much?
04:48:58 <gervarouge[m]> The built in one
04:50:22 <gervarouge[m]> Magnify with triple tap with accessibility settings
04:57:20 <brenneke[m]> Lol....thanks!
05:00:01 <gervarouge[m]> Anything else is likely to have privacy and security implications
05:05:20 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes
05:05:37 <capr[m]> Is VirtualXposed not compatible with GrapheneOS? I can add apps to it but none of them will open.
05:06:30 <renlord> strcat[m]: do all the kernel drivers exist for the components on the socs?
05:07:01 <gervarouge[m]> <capr[m] "Is VirtualXposed not compatible "> It works for some apps, but it's not a great solution
05:07:04 <renlord> i find that buying arm SoCs can be a hit/miss when it comes to proper hardware support
05:07:29 <renlord> like my odroid n2 purchase, looks good on paper, but the gpu drivers arent even available on the official distro
05:07:36 <renlord> cant even use HW acceleration
05:08:38 <capr[m]> Probably better than nothing though. I can't make it work with any apps.
05:08:58 <JTL> renlord: we both have n2's :P
05:09:09 <gervarouge[m]> It's probably a false sense of privacy if you're using XPrivacy
05:09:11 <JTL> I need to dig it out and see if a newer kernel "solves" the USB issues I've been having
05:09:24 <gervarouge[m]> Client Side Checks and all that
05:09:43 <renlord> i thought about buying another one but zzz
05:10:18 <JTL> I haven't audited the XPrivacy stuff at all, but from what looks of it injecting a bunch of code that (probably) breaks the OS security model doesn't seem like the best idea to me
05:10:28 <JTL> so I'd avoid
05:10:34 <gervarouge[m]> capr: I wouldn't use it. Web Apps are a much better option
05:10:42 <gervarouge[m]> <JTL "I haven't audited the XPrivacy s"> Virtual Xposed is much safer
05:10:48 <gervarouge[m]> It's still not ideal
05:11:00 <gervarouge[m]> It's based on VirtualApp
05:11:01 <JTL> Virtual Xposed is newer then what I know
05:11:06 <JTL> so I have no comment
05:11:17 <gervarouge[m]> Which means it's fully compatible with GrapheneOS
05:11:30 <gervarouge[m]> I wouldn't recommend using it for various reasons
05:12:44 <capr[m]> <gervarouge[m] "capr: I wouldn't use it. Web App"> There's no web app for Discord though and some web apps break for me.
05:13:58 <gervarouge[m]> <capr[m] "There's no web app for Discord t"> You can use the desktop site
05:14:01 <gervarouge[m]> It works fine
05:14:56 <gervarouge[m]> The other option is AnLinux
05:18:11 <capr[m]> Okay thx. I didn't know Discord supported webpage access. I thought they didn't allow that.
05:18:38 <gervarouge[m]> <capr[m] "Okay thx. I didn't know Discord "> I do it on mine occasionally. I don't have an account though
05:18:45 <gervarouge[m]> Just checking groups for info
05:18:59 <gervarouge[m]> Desktop site does the trick
05:20:24 <capr[m]> What is AnLinux?
05:21:18 <capr[m]> Apparently it allows u to run Linux on Android without root? Why do I want that?
05:24:04 <gervarouge[m]> If you insist on running Discord as an app that's the best way
05:24:27 <gervarouge[m]> Discord is still OpenFeint
05:24:30 <gervarouge[m]> People forget that
05:47:00 <capr[m]> Okay well on trying out AnLinux right now. Looks like an interesting adventure:) Thx for the suggestion.
06:03:32 <gervarouge[m]> <capr[m] "Okay well on trying out AnLinux "> It's a rough pickle with Discord such a horrible app and service
06:03:33 <gervarouge[m]> Hope that works
07:27:58 <strcat[m]> more and more people asking about Pixel 4 support and wasting time trying to argue for it but still no one interesting in working on it? strange
07:28:11 <strcat[m]> the project has wanted Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL support since they were released
07:28:33 <strcat[m]> the issue has been that people are not stepping up as device maintainers and to work on support for devices
07:28:53 <strcat[m]> I promise you that no further devices will ever be added by the project without people stepping up to work on it
07:29:02 <strcat[m]> I will not be doing it all myself anymore
07:29:20 <strcat[m]> there will never be another device added where I had to put it all together
07:29:22 <strcat[m]> it won't happen
07:30:05 <strcat[m]> if you want Pixel 4 support, start working on it
07:30:11 <TheJollyRoger> Cripes.
07:30:19 <headgas[m]> I'm no dev but I'll learn what I can, is there anything I an do?
07:31:06 <analog[m]> Donate $100 or more to Daniel Micay on March 25th
07:31:10 <analog[m]>  * Donate $100 or more to Daniel Micay on May 25th
07:31:26 <TheJollyRoger> I think the first step to learning to support the device would be to start learning to build it and compile the operating system. It's a bit of a journey and I haven't figured it out fully yet.
07:31:28 <headgas[m]> Who is Daniel Micay>
07:31:40 <headgas[m]> Oh
07:31:45 <analog[m]> Read AOSP docs
07:31:47 <JTL> strcat, lead developer of the project
07:31:49 <analog[m]> <headgas[m] "Who is Daniel Micay>"> strcat / creator of GrapheneOS
07:31:54 <headgas[m]> Yea this is why I'm thinking about selling my pixel 4xl and buying a 3
07:32:01 <analog[m]> his birthday is coming up
07:32:08 <analog[m]> on the 25th
07:32:16 <analog[m]> sending money could help with development too
07:32:25 <analog[m]> I wanted to donate some money on his bday
07:33:06 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a support will not be an option until months after it's released
07:33:17 <strcat[m]> so if people want a new device to be supported it has to be the Pixel 4 / 4 XL
07:33:23 <strcat[m]> and it has to be before July
07:33:42 <strcat[m]> once it's time to start focusing on the Android 11 migration, we're obviously not going to be dealing with adding new devicesd
07:33:54 <strcat[m]> if people want Pixel 4 support they have May and June to get it ready
07:34:15 <strcat[m]> will not be adding Pixel 4a support if we do not add the Pixel 4, to be 100% clear, it will NOT be accepted
07:34:30 <strcat[m]> it does not make sense to support only the Pixel 4a
07:34:42 <strcat[m]> it depends on the work that's done for the Pixel 4 including the kernel
07:35:06 <strcat[m]>  * once it's time to start focusing on the Android 11 migration, we're obviously not going to be dealing with adding new devices
07:35:21 <cdesai> I've pushed support to CalyxOS so that can help as abase for anyone that wants to work on this
07:35:52 <cdesai> strcat[m]: trying to build aosp hardware/QCOM libs but sadly it's not straightforward
07:38:07 <strcat[m]> we don't have the basic maintenance being done for the existing devices like handling the kernel LTS releases
07:38:11 <strcat[m]> and applying the past kernel hardening changes
07:38:25 <strcat[m]> all future supported devices need maintainers actually working on them
07:39:11 <strcat[m]> it's looking to me like there just isn't interest from the community in stepping up to get Pixel 4 / 4 XL / 4a support implemented
07:39:18 <strcat[m]> we aren't just doing the 4a, to be clear
07:39:31 <strcat[m]> 4 and 4 XL come first, 4a support will depend on a device support branch and the 4 / 4 XL support
07:39:51 <strcat[m]> I don't care if people buy the 4a and step up to work on it later - it will not be accepted if 4 and 4 XL support is not there before July
07:39:55 <headgas[m]> Why isnt enough people interested in 4?
07:40:01 <strcat[m]> it will be taken off the table and we'll skip it
07:40:14 <gervarouge[m]> So the next phone would be the Pixel 5?
07:40:20 <strcat[m]> Android 11 will be late August / early September
07:40:27 <strcat[m]> gervarouge:  only if people step up to support that
07:40:28 <TheJollyRoger> headgas[m]: it's not that not enough people are interested, it's that not enough people are interested in /contributing the work to get it built./
07:40:33 <strcat[m]> otherwise it won't be supported either
07:40:52 <strcat[m]> gervarouge: it takes ~3 months after a device is released for it to be supported by the mainline AOSP branches
07:40:55 <gervarouge[m]> Won't the project die without the Pixel 5?
07:40:56 <strcat[m]> instead of device support branches
07:41:03 <strcat[m]> and we've decided not to use device support branches anymore
07:41:21 <strcat[m]> gervarouge: there will not be any further supported devices without device maintainers
07:41:22 <strcat[m]> I hope that's clear
07:41:32 <strcat[m]> it isn't up for debate, there has to be someone doing the work to support devices
07:41:38 <headgas[m]> What does it take to be a maintainer?
07:41:55 <strcat[m]> doing the work to implement and maintain support for the device
07:42:00 <strcat[m]> committing to long term support for it
07:42:27 <strcat[m]> that includes handling the kernel, SELinux policies and all the device support code
07:42:39 <strcat[m]> putting together the initial support for it and working on issues that are discovered
07:42:40 <gervarouge[m]> Gotcha, so there has to be help or the project does with the Pixel 3a in 2022
07:42:41 <TheJollyRoger> headgas[m]: In order to be a maintainer, what that means is doing things like backporting the security updates from the kernel into the kernel for the phones, implementing the driver updates and device-specific functions and exploit mitigations,
07:42:42 <strcat[m]> and working to complete it
07:42:45 <headgas[m]> So after the initial work as been done to be able to use graphene os on a device, is the maintaining as difficult? Could someone that isn't a dev do that?
07:43:06 <strcat[m]> it is development work
07:43:10 <TheJollyRoger> It's a three-year commitment, not just a "once and done" sort of thing.
07:43:18 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you think I mean by maintenance
07:43:30 <strcat[m]> it means maintaining the code and handling all of the changes and issues that come up
07:43:37 <headgas[m]> OK
07:43:43 <gervarouge[m]> GrapheneOS is not a good first coding project. Hello World is a lot different
07:43:49 <headgas[m]> I was just hoping maybe It was something I could help with
07:44:20 <strcat[m]> well I hope I've made it clear that device support won't be added without device maintainers and that the Pixel 4a is an extension of Pixel 4 and 4 XL support
07:44:33 <strcat[m]> and it isn't an option to only add the 4a by itself because it would be building on the existing support
07:44:38 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense to only support 1
07:44:41 <strcat[m]> waste of time
07:44:56 <strcat[m]> most of the work is shared between a generation
07:45:15 <gervarouge[m]> Understood
07:45:52 <headgas[m]> yea thats clear
07:46:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
07:46:26 <gervarouge[m]> So someone has to have a Pixel 4 or 4a to help support this line and they need it soon
07:46:33 <headgas[m]> I was at least one person that emailed so I'm sorry if I added to your stress, I was just trying to find out if it was going to happen for the 4
07:46:34 <gervarouge[m]> * So someone has to have a Pixel 4 to help support this line and they need it soon
07:46:48 <headgas[m]> I have a pixel 4xl
07:47:00 <headgas[m]> But no dev experience hah
07:47:15 <headgas[m]> I got Ubuntu touch on my nexus 5 and that was a pain
07:47:24 <JTL> We all start somewhere
07:48:05 <headgas[m]> I think  security and privacy is very important, so I really wish I was able to help
07:48:41 <gervarouge[m]> Sell your Pixel 4 and buy a Pixel 3x or iPhone?
07:48:51 <headgas[m]> No one else is doing anything for the 4 either, but no one else has security and privacy as a main focus either
07:49:03 <headgas[m]> Yea I think I'm gunna sell it and buy a 3xl so i can use grapheneos
07:49:19 <gervarouge[m]> That's only going to be supported for 1.5 years
07:49:28 <headgas[m]> That sucks
07:49:32 <gervarouge[m]> Worth keeping in mind
07:49:37 <headgas[m]> So what should I do now?
07:49:55 <headgas[m]> I think I just broke something in the sim card tray for my nexus 5 too uhg
07:50:15 <gervarouge[m]> Nexus 5 still has solid value you could have sold that iirc
07:50:24 <gervarouge[m]> Well I dunno
07:50:33 <gervarouge[m]> Pixel 3a is a decent phone
07:50:37 <gervarouge[m]> I like mind
07:50:40 <headgas[m]> Well I was using the nexus 5 instead of my pixel since its running ubuntu touch and google free
07:50:44 <gervarouge[m]> Huge downgrade from a Pixel 4
07:50:52 <headgas[m]> Yea
07:51:01 <gervarouge[m]> If you want a full upgrade from your Pixel 4 you have to go iPhone
07:51:12 <gervarouge[m]> Pixel 4 is a good phone
07:51:13 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3 will be dropped when it's EOL
07:51:25 <headgas[m]> But the sim card tray was stuck for some reason and having to force it out must have broke something because the phone doesn't see the sim card now
07:51:40 <headgas[m]> Can you put graphene os on the iphone?
07:51:46 <headgas[m]> What is eol
07:51:49 <TheJollyRoger> No.
07:51:52 <JTL> End of life
07:51:53 <TheJollyRoger> EOL is "End of Life"
07:51:55 <strcat[m]> end-of-life
07:52:00 <headgas[m]> Oh ok
07:52:05 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "Can you put graphene os on the i"> Haha no
07:52:05 <strcat[m]> the supported devices for GrapheneOS are listed on the site
07:52:11 <headgas[m]> I know
07:52:34 <TheJollyRoger> Google negotiates with Qualcomm (the vendor of the chip) for 3 years of Qualcomm's support: this means firmware updates for the components on the SOC.
07:53:00 <TheJollyRoger> (Things such as the Graphics Processing Unit, the chip for the WiFi, the Cellular Radios, etc, on the System-on-Chip).
07:53:21 <TheJollyRoger> Once those three years are up, Qualcomm will stop issuing firmware devices and essentially say "You're on your own now."
07:53:57 <headgas[m]> My messages arent getting sent anymore...
07:54:01 <gervarouge[m]> Android for iPhones hardly works and relies on old devices
07:54:03 <strcat[m]> since no one seems interested in working on support for the Pixel 4, 4 XL and 4a, I haven't bought a 4 / 4 XL
07:54:03 <gervarouge[m]> Even if you could run the GrapheneOS code on it it wouldn't be GrapheneOS
07:54:07 <gervarouge[m]> Wouldn't support the needed features
07:54:09 <TheJollyRoger> Even if there was community interest in maintaining these devices, the only person that can issue new firmware is Qualcomm.
07:54:12 <gervarouge[m]> EOL devices are not secure unlike products like Lineage who will lie about the patch levels
07:54:25 <headgas[m]> Wow now that message sent but my last two dissapeared
07:54:26 <strcat[m]> I generally would have but I've seen no interest in working on this
07:54:28 <headgas[m]> Oh ok
07:54:41 <strcat[m]> it'd just be a waste of money to buy them if no one is going to work on it so I'll never have anything to build / test
07:54:57 <TheJollyRoger> headgas[m]: there have been some quality-of-service issues with Matrix lately.
07:55:38 <gervarouge[m]> You won't add Pixel 4 support if someone does it in 6 months?
07:55:40 <headgas[m]> So whats my best option since no one is doing anything for the 4 and the 3 is only gunna last a year and a half
07:56:07 <headgas[m]> Ah ok, and its taking a while for my messages to send now
07:56:33 <TheJollyRoger> A 3a, looks like.
07:56:38 <gervarouge[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Once those three years are up, Q"> Speaking of that what are the implication of Google making their own chips? I've heard Qualcomm is the only reason the bootloader supports custom keys since that's the stock bootloader.
07:56:42 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "Ah ok, and its taking a while fo"> 3a or iPhone
07:56:53 <gervarouge[m]> Whoops wrong reply
07:57:13 <gervarouge[m]> I only considered a 3a or iPhone 11 when shopping recently
07:57:23 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know. If Google makes their own chips, they'll be the ones who'll make that call.
07:57:27 <gervarouge[m]> I picked the 3a with GrapheneOS and my intent is too build my own GrapheneOS and hopefully start helping
07:57:36 <gervarouge[m]> I have a build I haven't flashed it yet
07:58:07 <headgas[m]> I don't understand, you have grapheneos on it but you want to build your own grapheneos?
07:58:12 <headgas[m]> Why would I get an iphone?
07:58:20 <gervarouge[m]> Build it from source
07:58:23 <gervarouge[m]> I want to eventually help out
07:58:25 <headgas[m]> I want to be free of apple and google and facebook
07:58:43 <headgas[m]> Isn't the 3 better than the 3a?
07:58:50 <gervarouge[m]> iPhones are generally recommended here to the less tech savvy or people who need phones longer
07:59:01 <headgas[m]> Ah ok
07:59:11 <TheJollyRoger> The 3 has a nicer screen and nicer camera, and a faster CPU.
07:59:15 <headgas[m]> Apple still tracks too
07:59:20 <TheJollyRoger> And it's got a nicer case.
07:59:22 <gervarouge[m]> Apple is a much better company than Google which in turn is vastly better than Facebook. Not sure why you would group those
07:59:32 <strcat[m]> I don't recommend selling your Pixel 4
07:59:53 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "Apple still tracks too"> Opt out of telemetry on the home screen. I've never seen anything sketchy on the MITMs
07:59:54 <headgas[m]> Oh haha, i just think they are all the devil but facebook being the worst
08:00:15 <headgas[m]> Why not Strcat
08:00:17 <gervarouge[m]> Apple and Google are the few companies I still trust
08:00:20 <TheJollyRoger> What gervarouge[m] said. Apple's going to be MUCH better than the other two.
08:00:24 <headgas[m]> I can't de-google it
08:00:40 <headgas[m]> Ah ok, yes Ive heard that
08:00:45 <strcat[m]> do you understand we will drop Pixel 3 support when it's end-of-life?
08:00:48 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "I can't de-google it"> Yes you can
08:00:50 <gervarouge[m]> Disable gapps
08:00:53 <headgas[m]> Yes
08:00:56 <gervarouge[m]> Done
08:01:03 <TheJollyRoger> Most of the tracking on your Pixel 4 is opt-in. Yes, it will pester you like crazy to turn it on.
08:01:07 <headgas[m]> Theres no roms for pixle 4
08:01:11 <gervarouge[m]> Pixel 4 is very secure and with gapps off it can be private
08:01:15 <TheJollyRoger> But it's not being done without consent.
08:01:17 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS isn't a "ROM"
08:01:37 <gervarouge[m]> Google Stock OS is fine
08:01:37 <gervarouge[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Most of the tracking on your Pix"> You can disable all those apps or notifications about play store
08:01:40 <headgas[m]> So how do I disable gapps?
08:01:55 <strcat[m]> it's not really on-topic here
08:01:59 <headgas[m]> I already have fdroid and have replaced as much of the apps as i can with apps from that store
08:02:31 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS needs people to step up and work on device support to continue the project
08:02:40 <headgas[m]> And I deleted google.  But I thought if i delete google play services the phone wouldn't work
08:02:59 <headgas[m]> Well, I would if I could, honestly.
08:03:14 <gervarouge[m]> <TheJollyRoger "What gervarouge said. Apple's go"> Yeah I admit Apple is a lot better than Google, but Google is in a completely different orbit trustworthiness than Facebook.
08:03:27 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "And I deleted google.  But I tho"> He said it's off topic I'll dm you about disabling gapps I have done it on a Pixel before and it worked fine
08:03:47 <headgas[m]> Ok thank you
08:04:15 <gervarouge[m]> * He said it's off topic I'll dm you about disabling gapps I have done it on a Pixel before and it worked fine. Actually dm me if you can. My app is goofing up
08:09:20 <renlord> apparently the google pixel team had an exodus of experienced staff
08:09:45 <renlord> https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/top-members-of-googles-pixel-team-have-left-the-company/
08:10:16 <headgas[m]> What the heck
08:11:11 <gervarouge[m]> Hopefully they go to Apple would be a shame to see them wasted on OnePlus or something
08:49:53 <dazinism> Over 4000 Android Apps Expose Users' Data via Misconfigured Firebase Databases
08:49:53 <dazinism> https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/android-firebase-database-security.html
09:01:16 <strcat[m]> https://internet.nl/mail/librem.one/362387/
09:01:17 <strcat[m]> this is amusing
09:01:52 <strcat[m]> no authenticated encryption (neither DANE or MTA-STS so there's only opportunistic, unauthenticated encryption), no DMARC/DKIM to prevent mail spoofing from those addresses
09:02:22 <strcat[m]> funny how they advertise their stuff as being secure when it's just garbage way worse than mainstream options
09:02:36 <strcat[m]> they're scammers, that's it
09:03:32 <headgas[m]> I have librem one
09:03:42 <headgas[m]> And I'm on their librem 15 v4 laptop running pureos
09:03:50 <strcat[m]> gl with that
09:03:58 <strcat[m]> insecure hardware/software/services from scammers
09:04:07 <headgas[m]> its open source
09:04:18 <strcat[m]> their hardware is not open source
09:04:24 <headgas[m]> Thats what they told me
09:04:25 <strcat[m]> they don't even publish schematics for the boards
09:04:30 <strcat[m]> the firmware is not open source
09:04:31 <headgas[m]> Thats why its older hardware
09:04:36 <strcat[m]> it's not open source
09:04:39 <strcat[m]> that's simply not true
09:04:44 <headgas[m]> great
09:04:51 <headgas[m]> I spent so much money for this thing 2 months ago
09:04:58 <strcat[m]> neither the hardware or firmware is open source
09:05:05 <strcat[m]> and it's insecure, they do not provide full security updates for it
09:05:22 <strcat[m]> and do not protect you against stuff like spectre and other architectural vulnerabilities in the CPU by not shipping firmware / microcode updates
09:05:26 <strcat[m]> so as I said gl with that
09:05:45 <strcat[m]> privacy and security industries are full of lots of scammers / charlatans, Purism is one of many examples
09:06:00 <strcat[m]> their email server literally doesn't provide authenticated TLS, lol
09:06:02 <headgas[m]> uhg
09:06:05 <strcat[m]> and doesn't prevent mail spoofing
09:06:10 <strcat[m]> so people can send fake emails from your address
09:06:17 <headgas[m]> So what can I do since I already have it
09:06:17 <gervarouge[m]> Yeah Librem are glorified scammers
09:06:27 <strcat[m]> and you don't have basic authenticated TLS encryption for sending / receiving mail
09:06:39 <strcat[m]> headgas: I don't have a suggestion
09:07:02 <strcat[m]> they're nothing more than scammers, they are incredibly dishonest and repeatedly and incessantly lie about their products and those of others
09:07:21 <strcat[m]> I reported a bunch of issues to them and noted false claims they were making
09:07:26 <strcat[m]> and they just ignored me and continued on
09:07:34 <strcat[m]> they are dishonest, unethical people
09:07:41 <strcat[m]> scamming people with dishonest claims
09:07:52 <strcat[m]> there is nothing open source about their hardware - NOT EVEN THE CASE / BOARD SCHEMATICS ARE OPEN
09:07:52 <strcat[m]> like
09:08:04 <headgas[m]> I talk to their head customer service guy, and he's been crazy helpful and nice
09:08:22 <strcat[m]> doesn't have anything to do with how they are dishonest scammers
09:08:31 <strcat[m]> I'm sure being nice works well for scammers, why would they be?
09:08:38 <headgas[m]> hah true
09:08:39 <strcat[m]>  * I'm sure being nice works well for scammers, why would they be mean?
09:08:50 <renlord> does .one even support dnssec?
09:09:05 <strcat[m]> renlord: no
09:09:13 <renlord> well it all falls apart then
09:09:14 <renlord> sad
09:09:15 <strcat[m]> but they don't have authenticated TLS for email at all
09:09:42 <strcat[m]> or DMARC
09:11:16 <shad0wbit[m]> Does anyone know a good resource/s for learning Android App developmemt?
09:12:03 <renlord> google dev youtube videos?
09:12:36 <gervarouge[m]> Kinda off topic. Use Kotlin though
09:27:32 <blacklight447[m]> <renlord "does .one even support dnssec?"> apparently, they are just some crappy digital ocean droplets
09:27:49 <blacklight447[m]> i wonder if they even frequently update their servers
09:28:33 <renlord> the .one TLD?
09:29:28 <blacklight447[m]> oh know, i was talking about librem.one
09:29:43 <renlord> all new .gTLD must support dnssec, mandated by ICANN now
09:29:44 <blacklight447[m]> thought you were talking about them
09:29:54 <renlord> do they own the TLD?
09:31:18 <blacklight447[m]> not to my knowledge
09:32:46 <blacklight447[m]> https://www.hardenize.com/report/librem.one/1589448690
09:33:03 <blacklight447[m]> no mta sts, no dnssec, no dane, no caa, no tls-rpt
09:33:03 <blacklight447[m]> no hsts
09:33:39 <blacklight447[m]> they even have issues with their start tls
09:33:57 <blacklight447[m]> no dmarc
09:34:20 <organella[m]> It takes only seconds on Purism's site to see how ungenuine they are, anyone who promises the world and 'goodness' and doesn't address caveats is full of shit, and 100x more so when it comes to security
09:34:38 <blacklight447[m]> litterly the only security related items they configured are spf and start tls
09:34:55 <blacklight447[m]> andone of those is wrongly configured
09:35:19 <blacklight447[m]> ive seen barely maintained corporate email servers which were better then this
09:35:21 <organella[m]> Contrast this with Qubes' tag 'reasonably secure os', which is probably the biggest promise one can reasonably make
09:37:17 <blacklight447[m]> <headgas[m] "So what can I do since I already"> atleast flash an os which does support microcode updates
09:37:34 <blacklight447[m]> <organella[m] "Contrast this with Qubes' tag 'r"> heh, thats why im a qubes contributer
09:37:50 <blacklight447[m]> qubes does claim to be more then what it is
09:37:54 <blacklight447[m]> yet, if you ask me, its one of the most sane distros out there
09:38:15 <headgas[m]> Gervarouge was just telling me to use qubes  aswe ll
09:38:18 <headgas[m]> as well
09:38:33 <blacklight447[m]> anyway, purism can be best described as snake oil
09:38:34 <blacklight447[m]> they promise great things, but deliver nothing
09:38:47 <gervarouge[m]> I mean I don't love Qubes
09:38:47 <blacklight447[m]> and using their stuff could even set your back
09:39:08 <blacklight447[m]> (btw im sorry that you bought of of their laptops)
09:39:13 <gervarouge[m]> They have way too insecure of guests and trust too many packagers
09:39:25 <blacklight447[m]> the thing i like most about using qubes it that it gives you lots of control, yet be still fairly secure
09:40:09 <BallMonokuma[m]> <blacklight447[m] "https://www.hardenize.com/report"> Glad I didn't buy into their shitty service, then
09:40:16 <gervarouge[m]> PureOS is a security hazard
09:40:21 <blacklight447[m]> if i wanna test something out, i can spin up a random new vm, even give it root, nd throw it away after
09:40:23 <blacklight447[m]> as im not relying on the security of the guests, but of the xen hypervisor
09:41:02 <gervarouge[m]> I agree it's not bad
09:41:03 <blacklight447[m]> its impressive what they have built with qubes though, considering they built it in a time were only bad parts were available
09:41:08 <BallMonokuma[m]> <gervarouge[m] "PureOS is a security hazard"> Normal linux distro level security hazard, or worse?
09:41:17 <gervarouge[m]> <BallMonokuma[m] "Normal linux distro level securi"> Worse
09:41:22 <blacklight447[m]> <BallMonokuma[m] "Normal linux distro level securi"> worse
09:41:24 <blacklight447[m]> they dont supply microcode updates as they are closed source
09:41:35 <gervarouge[m]> It's based on Debian which is the bottom of the barrel already and doesn't ship freaking microcode
09:41:40 <blacklight447[m]> but that leaves your vurneable to issues like spectre and meltdown
09:41:50 <gervarouge[m]> It's super bad
09:42:01 <BallMonokuma[m]> <blacklight447[m] "but that leaves your vurneable t"> oof
09:42:38 <blacklight447[m]> so, their argument is that because their could hypothetically be a backdoor in those microcode updates, they are gonna leave them out even though they know you will be vurnable to known security issues nonetheless
09:42:42 <blacklight447[m]> genius
09:43:09 <BallMonokuma[m]> <blacklight447[m] "so, their argument is that becau"> Who needs a back door when the hinge on your front door is fucked?
09:43:23 <headgas[m]> So get qubes and that will help a lot?
09:43:54 <gervarouge[m]> PureOS gets a 0/10. Debian gets a 2/10. Fedora gets a 3/10.  Qubes gets a 6/10. macOS gets a 6/10. ChromeOS gets a 6/10. Where ten is GrapheneOS and iPadOS
09:43:57 <gervarouge[m]> That's my rough opinion at least
09:44:01 <blacklight447[m]> https://www.hardenize.com/report/privacytools.io/1589375455
09:44:13 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "So get qubes and that will help "> Literally anything
09:44:14 <gervarouge[m]> Fedora, hell Debian
09:44:15 <blacklight447[m]> <blacklight447[m] "https://www.hardenize.com/report"> we atleast got our shit together, and we don't run a commercial email service
09:44:16 <gervarouge[m]> Literally anything else
09:44:22 <gervarouge[m]> Not Debian
09:44:26 <gervarouge[m]> Not Ubuntu
09:44:37 <gervarouge[m]> Fedora is a good step in the right direction
09:45:03 <gervarouge[m]> Fedora is the only traditional Linux distro I don't hate
09:45:08 <headgas[m]> OK, and what about using librem one?
09:45:10 <BallMonokuma[m]> I would go the qubes route, but my pc has 4G of ram lol
09:45:19 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "OK, and what about using librem "> Don't do it
09:45:34 <BallMonokuma[m]> <headgas[m] "OK, and what about using librem "> ***d o n ' t***
09:45:36 <gervarouge[m]> <BallMonokuma[m] "I would go the qubes route, but "> 8GB sucks too I tried
09:45:53 <BallMonokuma[m]> <gervarouge[m] "8GB sucks too I tried "> I don't even have enough ram to run fucking Who ffs
09:45:57 <headgas[m]> I just swtiched everything over from gmail to my libre.one email already and i use the vpn
09:46:07 <blacklight447[m]> <headgas[m] "OK, and what about using librem "> librem.one, basically its a service which doesnt use any proper security protocals
09:46:09 <BallMonokuma[m]> > <@gervarouge:hackerspaces.be> 8GB sucks too I tried
09:46:09 <BallMonokuma[m]>  * I don't even have enough ram to run fucking Whonix ffs
09:46:10 <headgas[m]> I have 8gs of ram, I can't run qubes?
09:46:25 <blacklight447[m]> headgas, compare these:
09:46:43 <blacklight447[m]> https://www.hardenize.com/report/librem.one/1589448690
09:46:45 <blacklight447[m]> https://www.hardenize.com/report/privacytools.io/1589375455
09:47:00 <blacklight447[m]> the one below is our service, how you should have it configured
09:47:02 <blacklight447[m]> the top is librem.one
09:47:20 <blacklight447[m]> compare the results
09:47:26 <blacklight447[m]> they barely support any security standards, and the ones they do support are poorly configured
09:47:26 <BallMonokuma[m]> What is the most secure email service?
09:47:40 <renor[m]> <headgas[m] "I have 8gs of ram, I can't run q"> Qubes doesn't solve anything if you're still running insecure OSs
09:47:43 <organella[m]> Isn't own mail server best?
09:48:00 <blacklight447[m]> you cant go wrong with our list tbh: https://www.privacytools.io/providers/email/
09:48:03 <blacklight447[m]> its not perfect
09:48:07 <headgas[m]> Qubes is an os i dont understand
09:48:18 <gervarouge[m]> <organella[m] "Isn't own mail server best?"> Yes and no
09:48:20 <gervarouge[m]> Generally no
09:48:27 <headgas[m]> How much does privacy tools cost?
09:48:34 <blacklight447[m]> we are in the middle of doing some more improvements that strcat  pointed out
09:48:35 <blacklight447[m]> but any thing there is far , far better then librem.one
09:48:49 <gervarouge[m]> If you have to ask the answer is no
09:48:54 <blacklight447[m]> <headgas[m] "How much does privacy tools cost"> oh we don't have an email service for normal folks
09:48:56 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "How much does privacy tools cost"> Free
09:49:06 <gervarouge[m]> The page is at least
09:49:15 <blacklight447[m]> our privacytools.io email service is only for team members
09:49:24 <headgas[m]> Ah ok
09:49:26 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "Qubes is an os i dont understand"> It is pretty advanced
09:49:30 <blacklight447[m]> privacytools is our website were we recommend privacy friendly alternatives
09:49:43 <headgas[m]> Oh
09:49:50 <blacklight447[m]> the email service is just run so people have a way of contacting us via email
09:50:15 <blacklight447[m]> headgas: https://privacytools.io
09:50:16 <blacklight447[m]> go take a look
09:50:32 <blacklight447[m]> also click on the about page, you will see what its about
09:50:33 <BallMonokuma[m]> <renor[m] "Qubes doesn't solve anything if "> I mean, If i'm browsing the internet in a disposable whonix vm and I get hacked, they can't do jack to my other vms (Unless a new xen vunrability is discovered and has not been patched yet).
09:50:54 <headgas[m]> ok thanks
09:51:11 <BallMonokuma[m]> <blacklight447[m] "you cant go wrong with our list "> I can't believe I forgot about that lol
09:51:25 <gervarouge[m]> <BallMonokuma[m] "I mean, If i'm browsing the inte"> Sure, but if there is an exploit for Whonix there's an exploit for your work domain
09:52:27 <organella[m]> <gervarouge[m] "If you have to ask the answer is"> Haha, that is, unfortunately, right :)
09:52:39 <renor[m]> <BallMonokuma[m] "I mean, If i'm browsing the inte"> Yeah that's true, but still you are running insecure OSs. You just solve the problem by using disposable vms and so
09:52:54 <gervarouge[m]> Qubes doesn't protect you from the reality that you still use the internet with an insecure OS
09:53:25 <headgas[m]> Ok so if i switch to qubes I'll be better than running pure os
09:53:28 <renor[m]> And if there's a vuln on Whonix or something you still have a problem
09:53:38 <renor[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Qubes doesn't protect you from t"> This
09:53:38 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "Ok so if i switch to qubes I'll "> Literally do anything else
09:53:54 <gervarouge[m]> Fedora is the easiest drop in replacement that at least tries
09:54:15 <renor[m]> <headgas[m] "Ok so if i switch to qubes I'll "> You could use Fedora. Qubes is complex and doesn't really solve tje problem
09:54:44 <gervarouge[m]> Fedora is good for a beginner like yourself
09:54:50 <renor[m]> Fedora wont solve it
09:55:06 <gervarouge[m]> Windows 10 LTSC might be worth a mention
09:55:07 <headgas[m]> Ok thanks
09:55:07 <renor[m]> But you will save a headache
09:55:29 <headgas[m]> I came to linux cus i thought it was safer
09:56:22 <renor[m]> Not safer, just more respecting with users
09:57:03 <gervarouge[m]> Any security is only from obscurity
09:57:18 <gervarouge[m]> It's less secure than Windows, Mac, and ChromeOS
09:57:53 <gervarouge[m]> However macOS is the only option that offers the privacy control I would consider acceptable. That means I usually just use Linux
09:58:40 <headgas[m]> I really like linux

09:59:18 <gervarouge[m]> Linux is nice as a developer I can't use anything non unixy
10:00:01 <organella[m]> But if you use Linux, why wouldn't Qubes be better as you can use the same Linux and have some extra insulation such as browsing in disposable vms?
10:00:57 <blacklight447[m]> <organella[m] "But if you use Linux, why wouldn"> as qubes is a lot more complex in usage then an average linux os

10:02:05 <gervarouge[m]> Ball Monokuma:
10:02:24 <gervarouge[m]> Qubes is a tool that's helpful if you really understand how it works. If you don't you're probably doing more harm than good
10:02:25 <blacklight447[m]> <renor[m] "This"> lol, thats the entire reason qubes was built
10:02:50 <organella[m]> It does have some problematic things, like I had to use a different computer to install grapheneos because even the usb domain was interrupting the process but for general use I find it perfectly simple and convenient
10:03:07 <blacklight447[m]> the knew all os's were garbage because of their monolythic kernel, so they made qubes that even if one vm is busted, you switch to another
10:03:07 <blacklight447[m]> your browsing  dispvm is wiped every session
10:03:23 <organella[m]> No network access except to my backup servers on the main work domains
10:03:25 <blacklight447[m]> you can keep your secure stuff in your secure vault vm without network access, etc
10:03:32 <gervarouge[m]> <organella[m] "It does have some problematic th"> Yeah... It's rough
10:03:50 <gervarouge[m]> Yeah if you know what you're doing Qubes can be cool
10:03:54 <cx2[m]> Fedora SIlverblue is going to be a REALLY good option for a lot of people. In addition to some of the “better” things that Fedora does, SIlverblue specifically mounts root as read only by default.
10:04:00 <blacklight447[m]> qubes doesn't aim to fix the security holes in the guest os's, thats outside the scope
10:04:02 <gervarouge[m]> If you don't it's probably a bad idea
10:04:11 <organella[m]> Browsing from disposable for general things and a couple of specific vm-s for certain trusted servers only
10:04:53 <blacklight447[m]> i always use throw away whonix dispvms
10:04:55 <blacklight447[m]> lol
10:05:49 <organella[m]> Not a problem that it's wiped on exit, I've configured it as I want it and it's for general browsing to sites where I wouldn't login
10:05:55 <gervarouge[m]> <cx2[m] "Fedora SIlverblue is going to be"> It's got no meaningful security right now, but it could be hardened
10:06:08 <gervarouge[m]> Compared to normal Fedora I mean
10:06:13 <cx2[m]> >Going to be really good
10:07:30 <cx2[m]> <gervarouge[m] "It's got no meaningful security "> Well of course... again, I said *going* to be. I am pretty stoked to see it mature, and potentially replace workstation altogether
10:07:38 <organella[m]> Of course linux is monolithic and with plenty of problems, but I want an open source system both for knowing what's running and to be able to tweak it, and I hate the restrictiveness of MacOS for the latter so what else is there that one can actually work on?
10:07:46 <gervarouge[m]> Yeah true
10:07:47 <gervarouge[m]> I agree

10:08:24 <gervarouge[m]> BSD Desktop doesn't have any browser sandboxing
10:08:30 <gervarouge[m]> There's no good options
10:08:53 <gervarouge[m]> It's between Fedora and macOS for most people
10:09:08 <gervarouge[m]> They are both private, but one is more about user freedom and the other about security
10:09:25 <gervarouge[m]> Which both of those things are often mutually exclusive so not unsurprising
10:10:37 <c3po[m]> Use OpenBSD
10:11:01 <gervarouge[m]> Don't use OpenBSD
10:11:07 <gervarouge[m]> No
10:11:09 <gervarouge[m]> That's a terrible idea
10:11:11 <gervarouge[m]> OpenBSD is not at all secure as a desktop
10:11:22 <organella[m]> And Qubes isolating the network card and providing firewalling and no network to domains covers for a lot of the problems and ends up as a very reasonable compromise between security and convenience, at least for me
10:11:33 <blacklight447[m]> openbsd is only secure when you have the base package
10:11:34 <blacklight447[m]> but thats not how you use a desktop
10:11:48 <blacklight447[m]> on a desktop, you install shit
10:11:48 <blacklight447[m]> and that is not secure on openbsd
10:11:55 <gervarouge[m]> OpenBSD mitigations are highly overrated anyway
10:12:05 <organella[m]> But I'm no expert so don't take my word :)
10:12:07 <blacklight447[m]> see openbsd more as a research project rather then a daily driver os
10:12:08 <gervarouge[m]> HardenedBSD is vastly superior and still has the same issues
10:13:24 <gervarouge[m]> OpenBSD is horrible for desktop
10:13:24 <c3po[m]> Daniel could talk about OpenBsd maybe more, he works or worked there
10:13:50 <gervarouge[m]> I don't think he did either correct me if I'm wrong
10:14:19 <c3po[m]> If you only use the basics, why horrible?... It' s more secure than Linux or other Bsd,s
10:14:38 <gervarouge[m]> If you want a good desktop system it's between Windows 10 LTSC, macOS, QubesOS, and Fedora in no particular order
10:14:41 <cx2[m]> <blacklight447[m] "see openbsd more as a research p"> Truth. And I think it should be messaged that way a lot more, rather than folks calling it trash. There is a MOUNTAIN of work that openBSD has authored that is phenominal

10:15:48 <organella[m]> Then there is the issue of hardware - without trusted hardware of which there is none, the whole house of cards collapses

10:16:10 <gervarouge[m]> Windows 10 LTSC can be tweaked to be very private

11:08:56 <renlord> anyone having the same problem?
11:20:56 <cdesai> renlord: dan linked a fix earlier
11:21:08 <cdesai> https://github.com/RattlesnakeOS/android-prepare-vendor/commit/32e6e21fda3347850f1a1cffc12e0350715c694c
13:08:16 <joeri_poeri[m]> is there a way to get the system clock in the top left to show the seconds?
13:13:54 <shad0wbit[m]> Clock-> more -> Settings -> display seconds
13:17:42 <propertype> I think he means the clock in the top bar
13:23:00 <shad0wbit[m]> I think it isn't possible in Android 10 anymore. I guess you need an external app for that
13:39:25 <totemswitch[m]> Hi guys, do you know if there is a plan to support the fairphone 3 in the near future? I ask this because the support for the pixel 3a will end with googles march 2022. the fairphone should get support for 5 years
13:42:41 <shad0wbit[m]> No there isnt' one
13:42:53 <gervarouge[m]> <totemswitch[m] "Hi guys, do you know if there is"> The Fairphone is not a serious security phone
13:42:55 <gervarouge[m]> It won't be supported
13:43:03 <gervarouge[m]> If you need 5 years of support get an iPhone
13:43:10 <gervarouge[m]> That's your only good option
13:44:46 <gervarouge[m]> Pixel 3 and 3a is the only Linux based phone we can recommend seriously here
13:56:57 <totemswitch[m]> Ok, So what makes the pixel lineup seriosly secure?
13:58:39 <strcat[m]> renlord: lol someone downvoted your comment at https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/208
13:58:46 <strcat[m]> gave me a laugh
14:00:19 <gervarouge[m]> <totemswitch[m] "Ok, So what makes the pixel line"> Titan M chip is the only chip to be in the same league as the Secure Enclave is a big one. Solid SELinux rules. Quick patches. Long support time
14:00:40 <gervarouge[m]> It's also the IOMMU to be in the same league as the iPhone
14:01:10 <gervarouge[m]> It also is the only major device to have full support for custom boot keys
14:02:09 <strcat[m]> cdesai: can the latest android-prepare-vendor stuff be put in that AOSP alliance repo?
14:02:12 <gervarouge[m]> There's more details, like the CFI support and various other security measures that give a lever hardening found on something like an iPhone
14:03:09 <gervarouge[m]> Pixels also get the latest version of Android much faster than the rest which is important for security and privacy reasons
14:03:53 <gervarouge[m]> Essentially Pixels are effectively in the same range security wise as iPhones and they have the long security support which is ideal for a project like this. They also support important customization features
14:04:14 <gervarouge[m]> Pixels completely dominate the Android field
14:04:34 <cdesai> strcat[m]: yeah I will push it today, I just cleaned up Pixel 4, removed anything that was in AOSP already
14:04:41 <gervarouge[m]> They also exclusively use Qualcomm chips which are the best Android chips for security and privacy
14:05:02 <cdesai> building display hals and such is a pita though, needs qcom repos, I added one from caf but that doesn't even have the same revision, and then it wanted more which I couldn't find from a quick look so I gave up
14:05:32 <cdesai> but can do the same later for all other devices, remove stuff that's in AOSP, I have a semi scripted approach now so it should be straightfoward
14:05:35 <gervarouge[m]> The only other option would be something custom maybe based off a Qualcomm reference device. Especially if OpenTitan is a thing
14:06:14 <totemswitch[m]> gervarouge: thx for the info 👍
14:07:55 <gervarouge[m]> Your complaint about a mid ranged phone like a Pixel 3a only having 2 years of updates left highlights how bad the other devices are. Samsung has a $400 ish phone. The A50 which runs with quarterly updates which is a major facepalm and probably won't get much in the way of OS updates. The Pixel 3a is very incredible

14:08:54 <Nikos[m]> Very interesting article about small tech communities I found online. Hope people enjoy the read.
14:08:56 <gervarouge[m]> Pretty much Pixel 3 or 3a. If you need longer support an iPhone is truly doing a good job. Never seen anything funky on my iPhone and I run MITM(I mainly use Graphene so the iPhone I mess with a lot)
14:09:38 <strcat[m]> cdesai: if we're going to fully fork it I also think Nexus 5X / 6P / 9 should be removed and probably also Pixel / Pixel XL
14:09:49 <strcat[m]> although maybe wait til Android 10 to drop those, dunno
14:10:06 <totemswitch[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Your complaint about a mid range"> I wasn't complaining just hoping for something more 😉 hardware is expensive in many ways and i like to keep stuff as long as possible
14:10:40 <totemswitch[m]> Guess you can't have it all
14:10:48 <cdesai> strcat[m]: https://github.com/anestisb/android-prepare-vendor/issues/169#issuecomment-619323824 - we can leave them in for now until there aren't any issues, they exist on their own so that's fine
14:10:54 <cdesai> but yeah, could then create a new android11 branch
14:11:05 <gervarouge[m]> I totally get it. In that case I think an iPhone is probably your best fit. totemswitch
14:11:31 <gervarouge[m]> They are most cost effective long term and they trade blows on privacy and security
14:11:34 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: the BUILD_NUMBER thing in envsetup.sh is fixed btw
14:12:51 <gervarouge[m]> Could also pick up a Pixel 4 and disable gapps, but that's a lot more expensive, doesn't support GrapheneOS, and still is only 2.5 years
14:13:01 <strcat[m]> totemswitch: we want to support the Pixel 4 and 4 XL along with eventually the Pixel 4a
14:13:15 <strcat[m]> but we can't do that without people stepping up to help
14:13:23 <strcat[m]> we need device maintainers for devices from now on
14:13:39 <strcat[m]> the approach of me doing everything doesn't work and I was unable to get done even the kind of device support I used to do
14:13:42 <strcat[m]> too much on my plate now
14:13:47 <strcat[m]> need other people to maintain devices
14:14:44 <gervarouge[m]> totemswitch: yeah if you're interested in development get a Pixel 4 and work on porting Graphene. You probably would need another daily driver though
14:15:03 <gervarouge[m]> My advice was purely as a user
14:18:41 <totemswitch[m]> I am most likely not skilled enough. What skills are needed to maintain a device?
14:20:01 <gervarouge[m]> Do you code?
14:21:21 <strcat[m]> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows10-secured-core-computers is microsoft working towards having basic hardware/firmware security for laptops btw
14:21:35 <strcat[m]> but the OS still doesn't extend that security model past the kernel yet
14:21:55 <strcat[m]> lots of progress at least?
14:22:01 <gervarouge[m]> Haha
14:22:04 <strcat[m]> but the userspace is still totally insecure
14:22:10 <strcat[m]> like other desktop OSes
14:22:13 <gervarouge[m]> Immutable verified Windows 10 please
14:22:25 <totemswitch[m]> No, still in the early stages for learning python.
14:22:48 <gervarouge[m]> ChromeOS is okay
14:22:52 <strcat[m]> 'Secured-core PCs' have the basics of hardware/firmware security including proper IOMMU setups, closer to proper verified boot for firmware and the kernel, etc.
14:23:00 <strcat[m]> but doesn't chain along to userspace
14:24:03 <gervarouge[m]> Chromebooks are ARM based, have verified boot, and sandboxing
14:24:24 <gervarouge[m]> Not much close to that in the modern desktop scape
14:24:33 <gervarouge[m]> Privacy is terrible, but it's a start
14:24:46 <cdesai> there are many x86 chromebooks, usually only the cheaper ones are ARM
14:25:22 <cdesai> and you can still get ~$200 x86 chromebooks, which can make for a good travel device.
14:25:36 <gervarouge[m]> <totemswitch[m] "No, still in the early stages fo"> Yeah, if you want a Graphene device go 3a. If you want value per year probably the SE. 3 is probably too short of support it sounds like. 4 is too big of a commitment
14:25:55 <gervarouge[m]> <cdesai "there are many x86 chromebooks, "> I'd prefer ARM
14:25:59 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: are you around
14:26:08 <strcat[m]> I want to show you this email lol
14:26:35 <gervarouge[m]> If they didn't suck for privacy I'd switch over
14:26:42 <gervarouge[m]> iPad is probably the best bet for a close to laptop experience right now
14:26:47 <gervarouge[m]> That doesn't actively diminish your security and privacy
14:27:39 <gervarouge[m]> Hopefully Microsoft keeps drudging on though
14:29:18 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "I want to show you this email lo"> lol, what email?
14:33:51 <shad0wbit[m]> Project Cerberus from Microsoft looks also interesting, but unfortunately it's atm only for servers
14:34:07 <shad0wbit[m]> Similar to OpenTitan
14:37:09 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "lots of progress at least?"> Do you think Windows could turn into a somewhat secure OS in the future?
14:37:40 <madaidan[m]> Seems that way to me with all their progress on sandboxing, exploit mitigations, verified boot etc.
14:39:54 <shad0wbit[m]> Microsoft also wants to use automatic initialization for their stack
14:41:06 <strcat> they do for some code
14:42:57 <shad0wbit[m]> Oh ok
14:43:25 <shad0wbit[m]> I think they are planning to do so with all the stack variables
14:46:51 <blacklight447[m]> fun fact of the day: did you guys know that microsft used qubes as an example for their usage of IOMMU to enhance security?
14:46:56 <cdesai> strcat[m]: https://github.com/chirayudesai/android-prepare-vendor/commit/741933c36b71eda483bef5c9246c2ea2697e9096
14:59:59 <strcat> cdesai: can you push what you have to https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-prepare-vendor ?
15:00:10 <strcat> it's just confusing as is
15:00:34 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I will tonight, this is a mess so let me clean it up and then I will also pull in any fixes I missed from anywhere
15:07:28 <strcat> cdesai: you should update to the new approach for kernel building btw: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/kernel_google_crosshatch/blob/10/build.sh
15:07:46 <strcat> cdesai: clang as HOSTCC, using more of the prebuilts, etc.
15:08:20 <cdesai> strcat[m]: yeah, we build kernel inline, could use some more prebuilts for sure, will check.
15:08:48 <strcat> cdesai: if you build inline within soong it will already be putting those in PATH I assume
15:08:52 <cdesai> I even had inline external module build working for the most part, there's just some paralleization issue so builds sometimes fail / need -j1 to work, so I skipped it
15:09:11 <cdesai> yep. though sometimes that's an issue, e.g. prebuilts dtc is too told for coral kernel
15:10:51 <strcat> cdesai: well it's the wrong prebuilts
15:10:53 <strcat> for kernel build
15:11:06 <strcat> cdesai: kernel build uses closer to aosp master
15:11:16 <strcat> clang isn't always the same as the userspace either
15:11:22 <cdesai> yeah
15:11:37 <cdesai> for coral it seemed behind, rXc vs rXc1 for userspace
15:11:44 <strcat> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/script/blob/10/release.sh has also been updated somewhat
15:12:23 <cdesai> I've been meaning to ask you, what are those encrypt / decrypt scripts for?
15:12:38 <strcat> cdesai: it's for doing proper key encryption on the signing device
15:12:47 <strcat> key encryption at rest with scrypt + AES256
15:12:59 <strcat> instead of just relying on disk encryption since I leave it on
15:13:03 <strcat> so that doesn't help really
15:13:31 <strcat> cdesai: the issue is that AOSP's support for key encryption only supports legacy algorithms due to how signapk decrypts
15:13:41 <strcat> and also it's super inconvenient, it makes you enter the passphrase for EACH key
15:13:52 <strcat> cdesai: so I decided to just wrap it
15:14:16 <cdesai> i see. nice, much easier to do than switching to a hsm, we've always wanted to do that
15:14:30 <strcat> cdesai: I documented how to use the scripts
15:14:44 <strcat> cdesai: https://grapheneos.org/build#generating-release-signing-keys
15:14:48 <cdesai> <3
15:14:56 <strcat> cdesai: encrypt_keys.sh can be used to encrypt an existing set of keys or change the passphrase
15:15:09 <cdesai> yeah I figured that the latter might have been why you did it too.
15:15:15 <strcat> cdesai: and decrypt_keys.sh can be used to remove the passphrase - although it's not meant to be used directly
15:15:30 <strcat> cdesai: the way it works is that release.sh copies the keys to a temporary /dev/shm directory
15:15:38 <strcat> and removes passphrase with decrypt_keys.sh
15:16:17 <strcat> cdesai: this avoids having AOSP ask the passphrase for each key + it doesn't support modern encryption due to signapk code + it decrypts the keys over and over and over each time it spawns a process which is super slow especially with modern encryption
15:16:52 <strcat> cdesai: I've confirmed that you CAN use AOSP's encryption it's just a pain in the ass and the best algorithm available is like some shit pbkdf2 with sha1 and 3des and fixed iteration count
15:17:07 <strcat> cdesai: because basically AOSP's approach only supports the standard algorithms
15:17:15 <cdesai> thanks, I will switch. I think we might have some differences but I'll try rebasing mine / sending anything that differs as PRs.
15:17:17 <strcat> this uses openssl's support for scrypt which is a non-standard algorithm
15:17:25 <strcat> (for this use I mean)
15:17:42 <strcat> cdesai: you should back up keys then
15:17:44 <strcat> encrypt_keys.sh
15:18:11 <cdesai> main difference for us is apex (few lines) + a2 (few lines), so no reason to have significantly diverging scripts. And we use otatools.zip
15:18:43 <strcat> cdesai: I just don't use non-flattened APEX because this is simpler and we have no use for it
15:19:25 <strcat> cdesai: they usually release the APEX tags substantially after the security update too
15:19:36 <cdesai> yeah that makes sense. I figured we might be able to test out APEX updates on CalyxOS using F-Droid if ever needed, so might as well do the one time setup.
15:19:47 <strcat> actually I haven't noticed those tagss show up for a while let me look
15:20:14 <strcat> cdesai: APEX is a nice approach but we just don't have a use for it
15:20:23 <strcat> signed apk with a verified boot fs image inside
15:21:06 <cdesai> just checked a stock walleye, it's on May update but "Google play system update" says March
15:21:35 <strcat> cdesai: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+log/0af0f194faede21a006a0af6d2939f10820fedda
15:21:37 <strcat> yeah
15:22:53 <strcat[m]> I'm glad they deleted AOSP Email upstream
15:23:19 <cdesai> AOSP apps are a mess.
15:23:51 <cdesai> Lineage has been sending patches upstream to fix API 29, but there's issues.
15:24:09 <strcat[m]> they need to remove a couple more
15:24:19 <strcat[m]> if they aren't required for CTS / functionality used by other apps
15:24:31 <cdesai> e.g. https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/packages/apps/Messaging/+/1122619
15:24:33 <strcat[m]> I haven't removed the calculator per upstream yet though
15:24:36 <strcat[m]> cause it's harmless
15:24:47 <cdesai> same
15:27:31 <cdesai> strcat[m]: https://github.com/luk1337/Etar-Calendar this lets Etar build in tree, will switch to that when Lineage ships
15:29:18 <cdesai> strcat[m]: plan with AOSPAlliance was to push stuff like this to a central place. I got sidetracked with some stuff but I have some time now, will start updating things there.
15:59:18 <Cyrinux[m]> <blacklight447[m] "fun fact of the day: did you guy"> do you got a link about this?
16:22:20 <blacklight447[m]> I would have to find it
16:22:50 <blacklight447[m]> It was in onr of their slides
17:38:10 <joshman[m]> Fingers crossed they delete AOSP clock app in the next ver
17:39:01 <mxnorvak[m]> What would be a good clock app to replace it tho?
17:44:32 <mxnorvak[m]> I should have asked it before that question, why should they delete the clock app?
17:45:38 <c3po[m]> Simple clock in Fdroid
17:45:51 <c3po[m]> I used before and it works fine.
17:48:13 <c3po[m]> * I used it before and it works fine.
17:49:12 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: yep! Sorry about that, I'm here!
17:52:56 <strcat[m]> josh.man: clock is needed for CTS
17:53:04 <strcat[m]> dunno what issue you have with that app since it's still maintained
17:58:04 <joshman[m]> Strictly esthetics. It's just too ugly and off the wall
17:58:24 <strcat[m]> don't find it ugly
17:58:31 <cam_> i wish i had the resources to contribute to the project as it's so important to the battle for privacy
17:59:44 <cam_> but one thing i can suggest/was wondering, is has anyone posted to hacker news or lobste.rs to ask for contributors?
18:00:10 <joshman[m]> Why on Earth it is blue and orange when everything else is not?
18:00:31 <joshman[m]> * Why on Earth is it blue and orange when everything else is not?
18:01:17 <strcat[m]> cam_: those sites aren't a place to ask for contributors
18:01:21 <strcat[m]> they are for posting news, blog posts, etc.
18:01:25 <strcat[m]> they aren't a place to beg for help
18:03:01 <cx2[m]> josh.man: It’s pretty useful actually. Alarm works as expected, has a pretty neat minimalist analog widget, world clock, stopwatch etc. Clocks displayed chronologically (something I asked simple clock to do and they dont’ plan to per Dev) etc.
18:03:04 <joshman[m]> * Why on Earth is it blue and orange when everything else is not? And why can't they make active icon? Seeing clock at 10:10:30 24hrs a day is just not what a clock is designed for
18:03:45 <joshman[m]> <cx2[m] "josh.man: It’s pretty useful act"> Why is it blue and orange? Any chance to change this ugly theme to AMOLED black?
18:04:51 <joshman[m]> 10hrs 10min and 30seconds is what it shows me 24hourd a day
18:04:58 <cam_> strcat[m]: i guess you're right. though i think maybe some variation of that, presented the right way (like via a blog post explaining the project's situation and importance to the community) or as an "Ash HN" post just asking for advice on finding contributors could be helpful
18:06:23 <cam_> and any writing/communication involved is something people without enough technical knowledge to contribute as a dev could do or help with
18:06:38 <cx2[m]> I mean, it’s not a game, or messaging app, etc.... you’re not giving it any screen time just watching a countdown timer are you?
18:06:38 <cx2[m]> Color could be different.... aside from that, it accomplishes a number of things. Chief among them? Actively developed, native meaning it’s passed the scrutiny of @strcat and co., and it’s one less app that you have to worry about downloading and having two of.
18:06:38 <cx2[m]> Th
18:06:45 <cam_> just throwing out ideas
18:08:04 <cam_> *correction "Ask HN" (a type of post on HN to ask a question)
18:10:30 <joshman[m]> One less app downloading is why I keep using it matter the hatred to its design
18:10:45 <joshman[m]> * One less app downloading is why I keep using it no matter the hatred to its design
18:12:13 <cam_> i mean, i think it's reasonable to think that an important free software project, that many people in the community use, in danger of dying for lack of contributors, would be of interest to that community, and thus valid to post about there
18:12:34 <joshman[m]> And yes. I frequently stare at timer while working out
18:12:49 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think we want to spread the impression that the project is "dying"... that paradoxically will scare a lot of people off.
18:13:07 <TheJollyRoger> It's not as healthy as it should be, sure.
18:13:27 <joshman[m]> And yes. I use built-in Calculator daily. And Iove it. It is much better than iOS's Calc
18:16:03 <strcat[m]> people don't have permission to post on behalf of the project begging for help
18:16:12 <strcat[m]> it is not helpful
18:16:23 <strcat[m]> posting on hacker news asking for help is not going to accomplish anything
18:16:30 <strcat[m]> it's the existing community that needs to help
18:16:43 <strcat[m]> introducing people to the project by asking for their help is not productive
18:16:44 <strcat[m]> especially there
18:16:55 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
18:17:00 * TheJollyRoger gets a large sweatdrop.
18:17:03 <strcat[m]> there are already a LOT of people using it
18:17:14 <strcat[m]> and substantial number watching the twitter account, here or reddit
18:17:20 <strcat[m]> plenty of people that can help already
18:17:36 <cam_> ok. good points. understood
18:18:54 <lvkm[m]> josh.man yes is ugly but i it's a well maintained and useful tool. i prefer it to some shiny playstore thing loaded with trackers or some abandoware from fdroid
18:19:18 <lvkm[m]> it gets the job done. think of it as a hammer
18:20:39 <strcat[m]> I don't find the clock app particularly ugly
18:20:57 <strcat[m]> the stock OS one is just a different color theme reallyt
18:21:00 <strcat[m]>  * the stock OS one is just a different color theme really
18:21:31 <lvkm[m]> dat blue tho
18:21:33 <strcat[m]> don't know why people are concerned about the theme of the clock app or anything else
18:21:37 <strcat[m]> it's not important especially right now
18:21:50 <shad0wbit[m]> What is wrong with the stock one?
18:22:01 <strcat[m]> the project has tons of work to do and serious things to address
18:22:17 <strcat[m]> and someone is super concerned about the clock app being blue instead of black
18:34:13 <lvkm[m]> is there a way to disable password prompt when switching users? sometimes i can log in with the fingerprint sometimes i get "password is required after reboot"
18:39:40 <strcat[m]> the initial unlock after reboot has to be done with the main unlock method
18:40:07 <strcat[m]> and after the secondary unlock times out for security too
18:46:19 <hitchhooker[m]> strcat, is it by design that analog audio adapter is not compatible with GOS on blueline or something I should create issue+pr?
18:49:09 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: Pixels don't have analog USB audio
18:49:19 <strcat[m]> they only have digital USB audio
18:49:44 <hitchhooker[m]> this error comes when using adapter to usb port
18:49:45 <strcat[m]> the headphones need to work with digital USB audio and provide a DAC
18:50:07 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: don't know what you mean by error or that it's not compatible
18:50:27 <strcat[m]> digital USB audio works
18:50:39 <strcat[m]> if you use a digital -> analog converter (DAC dongle) it will work
18:50:55 <strcat[m]> if you use something that tries to use analog USB audio it isn't supported by the hardware
18:50:57 <strcat[m]> there isn't a DAC in the phone
18:51:51 <hitchhooker[m]> "Analog audio accessory detected" "The attached device is not compatible with this phone. ..." when plugging in usbc to female phone jack
18:52:07 <strcat[m]> yeah so as I said
18:52:09 <strcat[m]> analog USB audio is not supported
18:52:12 <lvkm[m]> hitchhooker: better not lose the audio adapter you got in the box. the standard usb c to 3.5 jack doesn't work on pixels. found that the hard way
18:52:12 <strcat[m]> only digital
18:52:16 <strcat[m]> that's a hardware thing nothing to do with GrapheneOS
18:52:16 <hitchhooker[m]> okay.
18:52:18 <hitchhooker[m]> got it.
18:52:32 <strcat[m]> lvkm: it does work.
18:52:34 <strcat[m]> as I explained above
18:52:41 <strcat[m]> Pixels do not have a DAC, they only have digital audio, not analog
18:52:47 <strcat[m]> this is a valid way to do things and in fact a better way to do it
18:52:56 <strcat[m]> because DACs in phones are always low quality
18:53:19 <strcat[m]> comparable to the quality of the DAC in the bundled adapter
18:53:43 <strcat[m]> digital USB audio is fully supported - there is nothing proprietary or special about the implementation
18:53:54 <strcat[m]> it's compatible with third party headphones and DACs
18:54:10 <strcat[m]> what you need to understand is that the dongle that comes with the phone is a super cheap DAC
18:54:19 <strcat[m]> it's an active part converting digital -> analog
18:54:30 <strcat[m]> you either need to use digital USB C headphones or a DAC like that
18:54:45 <MadCamel> eh. I wish they had a jack though. Can never find my dongle when I need it and don't want to buy headphones I'll forget to charge or will only work with this one device.
18:54:47 <lvkm[m]> got one from a xiaomi and nope. guess it didn't have an integrated dac
18:55:05 <strcat[m]> MadCamel: use USB C headphones then
18:55:18 <strcat[m]> there is nothing special about it
18:55:23 <strcat[m]> it's not a proprietary protocol
18:55:28 <strcat[m]> it's a fully compatible standa4rd
18:55:32 <strcat[m]>  * it's a fully compatible standard
18:55:44 <strcat[m]> Pixels have digital USB C audio, they do not have analog USB C audio
18:55:56 <strcat[m]> you cannot use analog USB C audio accessories - and really, analog USB C audio should probably not exist at all
18:56:57 <strcat[m]> the reason that adapter you're talking about is not working is because it's an analog USB C audio accessory - it's not a DAC, it can't convert digital -> analog, it's probably just a dumb adapter thing depending on the phone having a DAC providing analog audio
18:57:38 <strcat[m]> the one that comes with the phone is a cheap DAC, you can either buy digital USB C headphones or a fancier DAC, either way works
18:57:51 <strcat[m]> but a dumb converter that just tries to adapt the connection isn't going to work
18:58:06 <strcat[m]> blame the stupid analog USB standard for existing
18:58:27 <strcat[m]> it sends an analog signal along the USB data connectors alongside actual USB protocol
18:58:32 <strcat[m]> it's a super weird extension to the standard
18:58:34 <hitchhooker[m]> coolcool, makes sense. cant really remember the history of the adapter
18:58:35 <analog[m]> don't blame me.
18:58:40 <strcat[m]> digital USB C audio is just a normal usage of USB
18:59:01 <strcat[m]> that adapter that's not working is a super weird thing using a fucked up analog audio extension to the USB protocol
18:59:07 <strcat[m]> the most a Pixel can do is detect it
18:59:12 <strcat[m]> and say it's not supported
19:00:27 <strcat[m]> this is how USB-C is in general - there are a bunch of extensions / standards, not everything is compatible
19:00:31 <strcat[m]> plus vendors have a lot of extensions
19:00:34 <strcat[m]> well, USB in general
19:04:32 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS itself supports analog USB audio, it's Pixels that don't
19:04:38 <strcat[m]> and also analog USB audio is just dumb IMO
19:04:40 <strcat[m]> shrug
19:04:44 <JTL> Agreed
19:04:58 <strcat[m]> by creating that extension they made things confusing since some things are digital only, some are analog only, and some do both
19:05:12 <strcat[m]> and they mostly don't communicate this to users
19:06:16 <strcat[m]> digital USB audio supports lossless transfers - it passes along the digital audio
19:06:24 <strcat[m]> and then the headphones convert to analog with their DAC
19:06:39 <strcat[m]> or you use a separate DAC (like the dongle for backwards compatibility)
19:07:01 <strcat[m]> that way you don't have a low quality DAC in the phone converting, and then sending along an analog signal that picks up noise along the way
19:07:28 <strcat[m]> convert inside the headphones is best, since it's a self-contained thing that's shielded well
19:07:43 <strcat[m]> not a big analog cable picking up noise
19:07:46 <lvkm[m]> is there a way of transfering files between users on android apart fom a flash drive or cloud?
19:08:04 <strcat[m]> lvkm: no there's deliberately no communication or data sharing, they're fully isolated
19:08:36 <strcat[m]> and I think all the known ways to bypass that aside from side channels are fixed
19:09:50 <lvkm[m]> would using a flash drive to store my keepass database and transfer files would be a security risk?
19:10:07 <MadCamel> Analog cables will not pick up enough noise to be heard in headphones. You'd have to be standing in a very intense EM field to generate enough power to be audible even in the most efficient driver
19:10:49 <dallemon[m]> Just wanted to chip in and say I use a USB-C to USB-A adapter with a DAC and it works perfect, most of the time. I get some weird digital distortion occasionally, but I think it's due to the DAC being sensitive to the connecting moving slightly when the phone is in my bag.
20:19:38 <pmn369[m]> Hi all! I think Graphene OS is a great project and I want to help. I want to improve the Updater app, if I can, add pause/resume functionality of image downloading, and the ability to install the update later. I want to know what is the preferred way to debug system apps?
20:19:38 <pmn369[m]> If I simply start a project from Android Studio, it does not have enough permissions to write downloaded images to /data/ota_package/. I have to build a complete emulator image just to test one simple change and it takes ages.
20:21:23 <Cyrinux[m]> <lvkm[m] "is there a way of transfering fi"> Bluetooth?
20:34:05 <TheJollyRoger> Hi pmn369[m], I'm not sure at this moment. I'll try to do a bit of reading and see what I come up with!
20:35:35 <organella[m]> Universally Shit Bus
20:35:42 <pmn369[m]> TheJollyRoger: that would be great!
20:44:21 <brenneke[m]> <Cyrinux[m] "Bluetooth?"> If a regular thing how about Syncthing?
20:49:32 <overheadscallop[> isn't lvkm talking about user profiles on the same device?
21:05:48 <BrokenCog> hellos.  I've flashed a local build of the grapheneOS, however after 'fastboot flashing lock' ... I get a "unable to load operating system" and the Pixel 3aXL stays at the boot menu.  I can unlock and then boot.  It seems a key is invalid?  any idea which one? or if it's some other issue?
21:10:58 <BrokenCog> actually, the text is "Can't find valid operating system.  The device will not start."  if I unlock it, it'll start.

21:18:43 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: did you run the command to generate the avb public key blob? and flashed it?
21:19:02 <strcat[m]> make sure that's included in your factory images
21:19:21 <BrokenCog> "that's included in your factory images" ... how?
21:19:33 <BrokenCog> this step? https://grapheneos.org/build#generating-release-signing-keys
21:19:54 <BrokenCog> or this step: https://grapheneos.org/build#generating-signed-factory-images-and-full-update-packages
21:27:34 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: look with unzip -v to see if it's included
21:31:23 <BrokenCog> could you be specific please, things are confusing as is ... check to see if what file exactly is incrluded?
21:42:02 <cdesai> strcat[m]: https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-prepare-vendor
21:42:12 <cdesai> tried and find and include all patches that made sense from everywhere
21:42:46 <cdesai> only thing you should miss is "temporarily disable preopt"
21:47:49 <dan-v[m]> cdesai: nice! pixel 4 support hoorayyy
21:48:36 <dan-v[m]> gonna swap rattlesnakeos upstream to this
21:49:25 <qyo3462572445[m]> So I saw a while.back about how fdroid isn't the best way to download apps. What is recommended then? Downloading right from the app's website or github?
21:49:59 <cdesai> dan-v[m]: just did that for calyx, I have two commits on top, calyx_ and esim.
21:50:23 <dan-v[m]> nice!
22:24:53 <cdesai> strcat[m]: dan-v[m] https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/vendor_google_devices
22:32:03 <BrokenCog> sorry, laptop froze.  had to hard boot ... strcat[m] did you comment on the file name by chance??
23:14:52 <TheJollyRoger> Hi qyo3462572445[m], if your app self-updates, as is the case with Signal private messenger, or is security-critical and you know to keep it updated (as is the case with Tor Browser), you should obtain it directly from where it is published.
23:22:22 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: the avb pkmd
23:24:01 <BrokenCog> okay, thanks.  I wipe'd out/ to do a clean build, I thought maybe something was wrong with the build image, before I flash I'll ensure the keys are present in the zip.
23:26:14 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: in the case of Signal, Signal publishes a signed, self-updating "Harm Reduction" .apk on their website. This .apk is going to be different than the .apk you will find on GPlay, because Google Play has a very strict policy that apps must play by the rules and must not ask the user for "Allow this app to install other apps" permission.
23:36:05 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi qyo3462572445, if your app se"> Sounds good thanks. I've been using fdroid for most things (except signal), however I really don't have many apps, so I guess just looking at the individual github or website pages is a better option then
