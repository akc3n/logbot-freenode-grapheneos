04:54:14 <YouCanGhostMyKat> Hello GrapheneOS community again. So I believe I switched from beta to the stable channel. How do I verify exactly which one I am apart of? I did check the build number which didn't really help out.
04:54:18 <mistazaki[m]> Hi, im running video at bromite browser. every time I open the video and within a few minutes my phone automatically reboots.Why?
05:30:09 <TheJollyRoger> Hi YouCanGhostMyKat, it's likely you'll need to wait for an update to push, actually.
05:30:54 <TheJollyRoger> Since while your bootloader is locked, the phone can only upgrade to later versions, but it can't go back to older ones (anti-downgrade attack mitigation).
05:31:08 <TheJollyRoger> (*downgrade-attack mitigation)
05:31:37 <TheJollyRoger> Let me go and see.
05:31:51 <TheJollyRoger> mistazaki[m]: huh. Very strange! Let me go and check the issue tracker.
05:33:47 <TheJollyRoger> mistazaki[m], we might need to get logs of it using either a debugging cable or a userdebug build, you can reliably reproduce the bug on demand?
05:45:57 <mistazaki[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mistazaki, we might need to get "> Where to on?
05:46:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. To the crash.
05:47:10 * mistazaki[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201119-134653.png (170KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/EdCjhSHhOHqEAHmVODVbtoPT/Screenshot_20201119-134653.png >
05:49:41 <mistazaki[m]> How to on?
05:50:00 <mistazaki[m]> Sorry, my english slow.
05:53:04 <TheJollyRoger> You might need to compile a userdebug build or build a debugging cable for this, unfortunately. This requires special equipment and is extremely time consuming, so I think it might be best to know how to reproduce the bug.
05:55:49 <mistazaki[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You might need to compile a user"> i dont know ..
05:56:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. So would you be able to tell us how to reproduce the bug?
05:56:22 <TheJollyRoger> (So we can test it here)
05:57:56 <TheJollyRoger> If you're getting crashes, you might want to file a bug on the issue tracker detailing exactly the steps you took to reproduce the bug, information about the device...
05:58:01 <TheJollyRoger> When it appeared, your build version.
05:58:44 <TheJollyRoger> (Device, as well, is also important.)
05:59:29 <YouCanGhostMyKat> <TheJollyRoger "Hi YouCanGhostMyKat, it's likely"> Yeah I actually did this and I believe I updated from the beta channel to the stable channel. At least I switched from that in the update settings. Just wondering if it worked.
05:59:48 <TheJollyRoger> YouCanGhostMyKat: ah, I see. I'm not sure I recall if there's an indicator to tell you. >_<.
06:00:22 <mistazaki[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah. So would you be able to te"> How to on?
06:01:06 <TheJollyRoger> mistazaki[m]: Could you explain how you found the bug?
06:01:24 <TheJollyRoger> That's all I'm asking.
06:02:24 <TheJollyRoger> mistazaki[m]: if you want to build a debugging cable or try this yourself:
06:02:46 <TheJollyRoger> I have a tutorial on how to build a debugging cable.
06:03:05 <TheJollyRoger> But first I'd like to know what the steps to reproduce the bug are, and I'm pretty sure the develeopers will too.
06:03:09 <TheJollyRoger> You don't need a debugging cable for that.
06:03:14 <TheJollyRoger> *developers
07:27:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> mistazaki:

09:30:06 <besamim5781[m]> Do you know why the AOSP keyboard on GOS does not have a dictionary for some languages when other ROMs have one for the same languages?
09:48:46 <renlord> besamim5781[m]: yes, we dont ship one with it
09:52:08 <dazinism> YouCanGhostMyKat: stable and beta are currently the same.
09:52:26 <dazinism> The exact same build
09:53:23 <dazinism> When there is a new build it is put out through beta. If there are no issues the same build is pushed out through stable.
09:54:50 <dazinism> You can check from which channel you will be updated, by looking at the updater settings
09:57:24 <besamim5781[m]> <renlord "besamim5781: yes, we dont ship o"> But why do I then get words suggested on the English keyboard for example?

10:02:11 <dazinism> besamim5781: if you look at the keyboard settings theres a list of languages. I guess they all have dictionaries included?

10:07:05 <besamim5781[m]> OK those are the only languages supported apparently, which is weird because other ROMs have more for the AOSP keyboard
10:22:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys we still need more people to help combat misinformation that is being spread about grapheneos. Please pm me if you can help
10:23:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Copperhead and James are spreading misinformation and attacking the project and we need people who can step up and help
10:25:59 <nscnt> besamim5781[m]: What's weird about this? If they choose to ship other languages, they'll have it. GrapheneOS doesn't if it's not part of AOSP.
10:28:24 <besamim5781[m]> <nscnt "besamim5781: What's weird about "> I understand. Thought this is part of AOSP
10:28:30 <nscnt> besamim5781[m]: And you're only referring to Spell checking. Spell checking is not which words are suggested.
10:28:43 <nscnt> There are way more languages.
10:29:31 <besamim5781[m]> So word suggestions are also not part of AOSP?
10:30:38 <nscnt> They are. Spell checking is just that your words are underlined in red if you put in words in e.g. a chat. It's not about your input language.
10:32:13 <besamim5781[m]> But it is possible that other ROMs like LOS have word suggestions for languages that Graphene doesn't?
10:33:50 <besamim5781[m]> * But it is apparently possible that other ROMs like LOS have word suggestions for languages that Graphene doesn't?
10:34:01 <nscnt> Yes it may be possible.
10:34:14 <dazinism> besamim5781: if LineageOS add extra stuff that isn't in AOSP then yes
10:36:39 <besamim5781[m]> Now it is clear why my uncommon language does not have suggestions üòÄ
10:41:29 <besamim5781[m]> Thank you all for clarification BTW!
10:41:50 <jpds> besamim5781[m]: I just use OpenBoard, it has a load of languages built in
10:58:51 <renlord> we dont have other keyboards besides english
10:59:00 <YouCanGhostMyKat> dazinism: Not sure why my matrix client didn't notify me but regardless thank you. Pretty interesting how everything is on the same page.
10:59:01 <renlord> iirc
11:01:19 <somenerd[m]> It's a custom made keyboard?
11:01:42 <somenerd[m]>  * It's a custom made keyboard right? Or have I missed something?
11:18:33 <renlord> stock
11:19:47 <nscnt> renlord: We have. The "number" of keyboards depends on what we actually refer to. Keyboard layout is pretty much every keyboard I could think of, dictionaries and spell checking are the "big" languages.
11:51:17 <anon765[m]> Sorry but how do I get to #grapheneos-offtopic?
11:55:47 <strcat> anon765[m]: don't know what matrix client you're using, but try /join #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
11:56:28 <strcat> #grapheneos-offtopic is the name of the channel on freenode (IRC) and the bridged Matrix room has the alias #grapheneos-offtopic on matrix.org
12:12:50 <somenerd[m]> > Sorry but how do I get to #grapheneos-offtopic?
12:12:50 <somenerd[m]> On Element, you can search up GrapheneOS on the public room list. Not sure about the other clients though
12:20:45 <shurke> somenerd[m]: usually with any irc client, you just type "/join #grapheneos-offtopic"
12:20:55 <shurke> don't know how element handles it
12:21:06 <somenerd[m]> really?
12:21:10 <somenerd[m]> hmm let me see once
12:21:35 <somenerd[m]> it works on Element too!
15:14:35 <friend_of_scienc> I'm probably just an idiot, but I tried verifying the grapheneOS image for the pixel4a (following the grapheneOS.org/install page) using signify but was unable to verify.  Has anyone encountered this before?  My terminal log:
15:14:35 <friend_of_scienc> <...>$ signify-openbsd -Cqp factory.pub -x sunfish-factory-2020.11.05.18.zip.sig && echo verified

15:22:50 <Joeri[m]> jk no idea
15:26:29 <Johnnynator> friend_of_scienc: Sounds like your downloaded zip is corrupted.
15:34:41 <friend_of_scienc> I tried removing the file and re-downloading and got the same issue.  My factory.pub file matches what is listed on the install page.  Could it be an issue with using ubuntu version 1804.5 LTS not 20.04 LTS?  My version of Ubuntu says it is up to date.

16:22:42 <mrxx_0[m]> I am on 20.04 LTS
16:23:01 <ss132ikl> try `cat`ing the file and see if it shows up as an http error or something like that?
16:23:09 <ss132ikl> sometimes that happens if you don't enable redirects

16:27:13 <ss132ikl> cat the zip not the sig
16:27:17 <ss132ikl> wait
16:27:23 <ss132ikl> i'm confused
16:28:07 <ss132ikl> yeah try `cat`ing factory.pub and the zip to make sure they're both proper
16:28:09 <ss132ikl> or run `file` on them
16:28:19 <friend_of_scienc> I think the issue was the first thing I wrote:
16:28:21 <ss132ikl> that's probably better actually since you wont have  bunch of garbage in your trem

16:29:15 <friend_of_scienc> I thought the .zip.sig was the .zip file plus a signature, not ~just~ the signature.  So I never downloaded the .zip
16:29:26 <ss132ikl> oh
16:29:29 <ss132ikl> yeah that would do it
16:29:31 <ss132ikl> lol
16:29:44 <mrxx_0[m]> Works better with the .zip downloaded yes x)
16:29:59 <mrxx_0[m]> Take your time :)
16:30:00 <mrxx_0[m]> Don't rush
16:31:01 <friend_of_scienc> The discussion about 'if you want to / can verify do X, otherwise just do Y' left me thinking that those two downloads for the .zip and the .zip.sig were the exclusive X and Y options
16:32:01 <friend_of_scienc> Now it verifies, of course

16:37:20 <memelord669[m]> You can compile your own ROM with microg and sign it yourself but if anyone gets tour secure boot key they can modify the OS after you lock the bootloader
16:38:17 <ss132ikl> how would someone get my secure boot key?
16:39:19 <memelord669[m]> If they have read access to your private key on the computer you build it on
16:39:26 <goblinslayer[m]> perhaps if at all possible try and get a separate mobile cheap second hand from some reputable marketplace linked to a techforum or similar if that exists in you region steven

16:42:27 <goblinslayer[m]> reward - loss ~ goal - importance

16:43:15 <memelord669[m]> > seems time-consuming tbh :/
16:43:15 <memelord669[m]> It depends on the speed of your CPU, SSD, and RAM. Typically a workstation or desktop processor is much faster if you build locally
16:43:37 <somenerd[m]> yeah, and maybe to gain the knowledge needed to build it
16:43:51 <somenerd[m]> (unless they already know)
16:44:04 <ss132ikl> once you build your image you can use the updater right?
16:44:13 <ss132ikl> then you only have to rebuild for major versions?
16:45:05 <memelord669[m]> You have to rebuild every time you want the software on your phone to change, you can do updates or just build a over the air update and adb sideload it in graphene recovery
16:46:10 <memelord669[m]> The official ota updates use the official secure boot key and won't install even if it was compatible enough to update in the first place
16:46:39 <ss132ikl> oh so you still have to build it's just you don't have to go through the whole bootloader process
16:46:46 <ss132ikl> as long as you have an update server
16:47:34 <memelord669[m]> > as long as you have an update server
16:47:34 <memelord669[m]> ADB sideload removes the need of a update server. A update server is also more attack surface unless you have multiple devices with your fork of grapheneos
16:48:22 <memelord669[m]> * > as long as you have an update server
16:48:22 <memelord669[m]> ADB sideload removes the need of a update server. A update server is also more attack surface and uneeded unless you have multiple devices with your fork of grapheneos you want to update ota
16:51:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> memelord669: update server is not extra attack surface
16:52:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> We use TLS pinning for the update server
16:52:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> So nobody can mitm it
16:52:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> And even then updates are done with the client not trusting the update server at all
16:52:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> The client will verify what the server sends it
16:53:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> And will not update unless verified
16:53:22 <memelord669[m]> > memelord669: update server is not extra attack surface
16:53:22 <memelord669[m]> I meant for a user to have a server up on their home network or server for custom versions
16:53:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> memelord669: again, no concerns due to the zero trust nature
16:54:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless your signing keys are on the update server itself
16:54:10 <ss132ikl> ah okay
16:54:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> The update server would have no way to sign a malicious OTA
16:54:41 <ss132ikl> is there a vm i can use to test my image to make sure it works before buying the phone?
16:54:58 <ss132ikl> oh wait i just saw the emulator section in the build guide
16:55:14 <ss132ikl> sweet
16:55:19 <memelord669[m]> > The update server would have no way to sign a malicious OTA
16:55:19 <memelord669[m]> No, unless it was a PC without a VM or container even for the update server. I mostly commented as if someone self builds they may allow access though their routor on a home PC and be pwnes
16:55:24 <memelord669[m]> * > The update server would have no way to sign a malicious OTA
16:55:25 <memelord669[m]> No, unless it was a PC without a VM or container even for the update server. I mostly commented as if someone self builds they may allow access though their routor on a home PC and be pwned
16:56:04 <ss132ikl> this is great, thanks guys
16:56:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> memelord669: unlikely that would happen
16:57:24 <goblinslayer[m]> BTW I am really happy there is the official chatrooms now for GrapheneOS  thanks for getting around to do so

17:00:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> It can stop working at any time
17:01:54 <somenerd[m]> and I believe signature spoofing needs to be on
17:01:57 <somenerd[m]> which poses a security risk
17:02:29 <ss132ikl> hmm it seems like life360 doesn't work on microg

20:13:52 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: you want to take this one...?
20:14:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
20:14:19 <TheJollyRoger> Ok.
20:15:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys we still need more people to help combat misinformation that is being spread about grapheneos. Please pm me if you can help
20:15:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hey everyone. We do need some more help counter some misinformation and FUD that's been spread about GrapheneOS; anupritaisno1[m] is the point of contact for this.
20:19:00 <pallaf> anyone got issues with bluetooth? My device won't pair with bluetooth headphones
20:22:00 <TheJollyRoger> pallaf: I haven't noticed any issues, I've been using several different bluetooth devices so far.
20:22:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: don't do it like that
20:22:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Try to determine what device and what earphones
20:22:58 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry.
20:23:49 <pallaf> i get error popup on my pixel 3a which says "can't communicate with device aukey ep-t25"
20:38:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> pallaf: got it
20:38:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Often it can be the case that Bluetooth devices can only connect to 1 client
20:39:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can you check that something else is not connected to your headset?
20:50:53 <pallaf> it used to work before on vanilla and calyxos
20:51:08 <pallaf> I just installed fresh grapheneos
22:05:37 <memelord669[m]> What is the expected behaviour of USB C docks on grapheneos?
22:12:29 <poizn[m]> Does this work on Graphene?  https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/ime-autofill
22:24:26 <strcat[m]> poizn: sure
22:24:29 <strcat[m]> use a keyboard that supports it
22:58:44 <poizn[m]> strcat Using bitwarden+gboard combo. Logins don't show on the keyboard suggestion strip no matter the app I try to log in on. Will also post on the bitwarden forums then.
23:04:14 <AndroUser> Hey.. Is there any way to remove the browser ..aside from disabling.. Or its just baked into the OS
23:06:20 <AndroUser> I was advised to get device manager software to prevent my employees from accessing certain apps. But every company ive contacted dont really support devices without foofle services. Any recommendations? Thank you
23:33:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw I solved arept's issue
23:49:13 <renlord[m]> <AndroUser "Hey.. Is there any way to remove"> baked in
23:49:36 <renlord[m]> many other apps rely on webview also
23:50:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord[m] "many other apps rely on webview "> You can disable trichrome chrome btw
23:50:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just don't disable the webview
