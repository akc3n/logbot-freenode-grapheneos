02:36:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Still don't get what you mean here
02:37:48 <renlord> anupritaisno1[m]: you said to add unifiedNlp -- we need https://github.com/GlassROM/android_vendor_lineage/commit/45facdf664c73fcaaded8a28a9155b84d4d7357f
02:38:02 <renlord> that commi requires FdroidPrivilegedExtension as a dependency.
02:38:16 <renlord> we dont want to use FdroidPrivilegedExtensions
02:42:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> No it does not
02:43:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's an example of adding it to a makefile
02:43:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> I just appended it to where fdroid was
02:54:33 <renlord> if you suggestion is to just add unifiednlp as the location provider, then sure, possible but some work needs to be done to remove the microg references.
07:51:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): I think that's fairly easy
07:52:26 <renlord> anupritaisno1[m]: looking forward to your PR.
07:53:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> The app has 1 reference to microg and we can just use sed to rename it to something else
07:53:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> And that's just a permission
07:54:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise the app is just unifiednlp
07:54:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Given graphene's security model you shouldn't be able to install the real microg anyway

08:23:30 <bablux[m]> Hi ðŸ‘‹
08:41:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> bablux: I had an implementation for quite a while
08:41:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's just that it kept crashing location settings so I didn't release it

11:25:24 <mxnorvak[m]> Well it's not surprising, you just need to read the pricvacy policy of their devices, its all mentioned there, and for all xiaomi stock apps, there is an option in the setting that by default is turned on that indicates that you agree on usage data being collected ,you could turn it off but idk if it'd make any difference
11:27:14 <mxnorvak[m]> There is a reason they're not profiting much from the hardware in their phones (which to be honest is quite good) and selling their devices so much cheaper than other companies
11:28:10 <mxnorvak[m]> Having said all of this i have a xiaomi phone lol xD
11:42:03 <magicos[m]> Could someone try to explain the Auditor app? I have set it up for remote verification, but what am I looking for?
11:42:04 <magicos[m]> Does it only inform me on physical tamper? If no, then what does it show? If a malicious app try to disable some security features?
11:42:04 <magicos[m]> What about a malicious OTA or serial nr. Constraint?
11:44:08 <mischling[m]> got a xiaomi mi mix 2 a while back. had to register it than wait 7 days until i was allowed to unlock the bootloader. have it as a backup with lineage installed. wonder if thr chinese botnet reaches into firmware and hardware or a lineage would get rid of it
11:46:59 <nscnt> magicos[m]: Have you read https://attestation.app/about ?
11:49:52 <magicos[m]> <nscnt "magicos: Have you read https://a"> Yes, but i'm having a hard time understanding the kind of attack it inform me about. Is it only physical or would a malicious OTA show up there too?
11:59:25 <nscnt> magicos[m]: An OTA is signed. If it doesn't fit the current key it isn't possible to be installed if I recall correctly.
12:00:24 <nscnt> That's the case for every app you install, too.
12:01:39 <nscnt> So I think it won't show up as it outright doesn't work.
12:02:05 <nscnt> show up *in Auditor
12:02:11 <magicos[m]> <nscnt "magicos: An OTA is signed. If it"> Android support Serial nr. Constraints, so it would be signed and send out to everyone, but only activate on your phone.
12:02:39 <nscnt> Mh?
12:04:07 <magicos[m]> <nscnt "Mh?"> "Android updates can support serialno constraints to make them validate only on a certain device"
12:05:43 <nscnt> magicos[m]: Do you use GrapheneOS?
12:07:11 <magicos[m]> <nscnt "magicos: Do you use GrapheneOS?"> Yes, I do. But the question was for learning. So just thought about if the Auditor app would show that on Google Android.
12:09:52 <nscnt> If it's signed with the same key I think it would be installed, not sure.
12:13:30 <magicos[m]> <nscnt "If it's signed with the same key"> I know it would be installed on Google Android. The Auditor app is only for informing and was curious if it would inform it.
12:15:06 <nscnt> If you use Google Android you approve that it's trustable. When the same source pushes out a "malicious" update, I wouldn't know how Auditor would find something like that out.
12:17:41 <nscnt> But take my words with a grain of salt.
12:19:03 <magicos[m]> Thanks for your answer though.

15:23:10 <strcat> magicos[m]: there is no such thing as a 'serial number constraint' for over-the-air updates via the stable/beta channels

15:25:09 <strcat> joeri_poeri[m]: sockpuppet account?
15:26:49 <strcat> magicos[m]: read https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases and https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates and don't spread misinformation
15:27:11 <strcat> I expect that you actually got that from the documentation and then spun it into something else conveniently leaving out what it says there
15:28:14 <strcat> the Auditor app is explained at https://attestation.app/about
15:28:27 <strcat> first paragraph
15:28:47 <strcat> don't even need to read beyond the first paragraph to understand what it does
15:29:04 <strcat> > The Auditor app uses hardware-based security features to validate the identity of a device along with authenticity and integrity of the operating system. It will verify that the device is running the stock operating system with the bootloader locked and that no tampering with the operating system has occurred. A downgrade to a previous version will also be detected.
15:29:09 <strcat> > It builds upon the hardware-based verification of the operating system by chaining verification to the app to perform software-based sanity checks and gather additional information about device state and configuration beyond what the hardware can attest to directly.
15:30:38 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: unified nlp is problematic and we won't be including it as is, just like we won't be including the f-droid or aurora privileged apps
15:31:06 <strcat> it has to be rewritten to include it in GrapheneOS, best to just start over
15:32:05 <joeri_poeri[m]> <strcat "joeri_poeri: sockpuppet account?"> haha man I wish. I wish I had something to do
15:32:06 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: it has serious privacy and security issues and we do not bundle code like that
15:32:23 <strcat> joeri_poeri[m]: so why are you claiming that I'm in legal trouble?
15:32:29 <strcat> where do you get that BS from?
15:32:29 <joeri_poeri[m]> <strcat "joeri_poeri: why are you claimin"> I got that impression from what you described on the website. I'm very happy to hear you are not in legal trouble.

15:33:26 <joeri_poeri[m]> haha sorry man. I just assumed that
15:33:26 <joeri_poeri[m]> "Since then, they've taken to fraudulently claiming ownership and authorship of our work, which has no basis in fact.
15:33:26 <joeri_poeri[m]> I just assumed that this meant you were in legal trouble.
15:33:36 <joeri_poeri[m]> claiming ownership sound a tad legal to me
15:33:54 <strcat> it's them breaking the law
15:34:32 <strcat> I'm not in any legal trouble and if things proceed forward with going to court that's a very good thing for us
15:36:47 <joeri_poeri[m]> very happy to hear that man. thank you for making this awesome operating system, you have given me a reason to continue to believe in the future of android and open source software
15:46:01 <cyborgninjaneer[> Daniel's on solid legal footing since everything leveled against him is a lie. James would be committing legal seppuku by taking him to court, and I would love to watch the guy eviscerate himself with a fraudulent lawsuit and have to sell his house to pay damages to Daniel and the GrapheneOS project, if that's possible.

16:14:06 <status_active[m]> Guys, quick question. I have private home-hosted Nextcloud cloud and I notice that under GrapheneOS the upload from the NextCloud app takes a lot of time to upload. This is not happening with my other Android and iPhone devices. Is there anything that I should check or uncheck or give permissions to?
16:15:55 <brenneke[m]> My first bug with GrapheneOS - renamed my Documents folder in Files to get ready for Syncthing, now cannot access over 2 GBs of files. Original folder named Documents is also there but empty.
16:28:22 * brenneke[m] posted a file: Screenshot_20200501-092809.png (141KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/edhpfmhBVhTjHABjVqKLZkiQ >
16:29:53 <brenneke[m]> Now really screwed, have 3 Documents folders that I cant delete or rename, any suggestions as to how I can fix? Pixel 2 XL GrapheneOS
16:31:11 <strcat[m]> brenneke: don't understand what you mean
16:31:25 <strcat[m]> it's probably not a bug in the OS
16:32:02 <strcat[m]> you moved one of the standard top-level directories with special meaning so it should be expected that it will create a new one
16:32:34 <strcat[m]> it essentially has to exist and if you move it it's going to make a new one, that's expected and normal, not a problem
16:33:49 <strcat[m]> don't bother trying to delete those special top-level directories
16:33:56 <strcat[m]> all I see is an error message from trying to delete it
16:34:22 <strcat[m]> status_active: there's no relevant permission or setting
16:34:49 <strcat[m]> status_active: I suggest looking into what you might have done that would screw it up including your network configuration (DNS, VPN, etc.)
16:35:50 <strcat[m]> status_active: can't think of any reason that it would be substantially slower on GrapheneOS, you aren't stating if this is specific to that app or your network connection is slow everywhere, etc. so you have some basic stuff to check first
16:35:52 <nscnt> strcat[m]: I just tested it. If you "rename" it to 'Documents-test' you actually can't delete it.
16:37:00 <nscnt> 'Documents-test' is a newly created folder, not able to be deleted.
16:37:09 * brenneke[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/lMwaXBbifJEXrVuAuNbQPFZL >
16:37:31 <nscnt> brenneke[m]: Yes, I can confirm.
16:37:51 <strcat[m]> confirm what? I don't get it
16:38:18 <nscnt> If you create a folder with the prefix 'Documents' you can't delete it anymore.
16:38:28 <nscnt> It's not the actual Documents folder, though.
16:40:23 <nscnt> I have several folders called 'Documents-$random' now too and I can't delete it.
16:42:19 <nscnt> Always if it has the prefix 'Documents'
16:42:38 <nscnt> Documents*
16:43:00 <strcat[m]> I think we just don't have an implementation of the documents provider
16:43:23 <strcat[m]> on stock it'd be google docs
16:44:12 <mischling[m]> strcat thanks for all the great work man
16:45:30 <status_active[m]> <strcat[m] "status_active: can't think of an"> This issue is just for this app, nothing else. I'm not over VPN. same DNS ip address for every device.
16:46:50 <brenneke[m]> <nscnt "brenneke: Yes, I can confirm."> I didn't send that, not sure how my name on that message.
16:47:00 <strcat[m]> it's not
16:47:03 <strcat[m]> they replied to you
16:47:13 <brenneke[m]> Lol....OK.
16:47:16 <status_active[m]> So, I made some test syncing 9 files, the same 9 files on all my devices. The fastes is the iphone, second an Android phone and the most painful slow is the GrapheneOS. I don't know what else to check
16:47:32 <strcat[m]> look at the logs
16:47:36 <strcat[m]> as it's going
16:47:40 <strcat[m]> see if anything stands out
16:48:07 <strcat[m]> brenneke: nscnt: probably just need to disable some boolean to say we don't have a documents provider
16:48:20 <strcat[m]> the files are still there, Files app is just trying to be overly clever by delegating to a documents provider
16:48:25 <status_active[m]> you mean, logs on the cloud server side?
16:48:37 <strcat[m]> i.e. having that open it and show them
16:48:59 <strcat[m]> it works fine in the actual home directory storage, just a Files app UI issue
16:49:42 <strcat[m]> for an idea of what it's doing
16:49:45 <brenneke[m]> Can you please suggest a fix?
16:49:45 <strcat[m]> make Documents/test
16:49:47 <strcat[m]> and Documents-test
16:49:53 <strcat[m]> and delete Documents-test
16:50:38 <strcat[m]> brenneke:  I mean, nothing is broken aside from the Files UI
16:50:46 <strcat[m]> you can still access the files via MTP
16:50:47 <strcat[m]> or ADB
16:50:48 <strcat[m]> or another app
16:51:00 <strcat[m]> use a different file manager
16:51:36 <strcat[m]> I don't know why it's trying to use the documents provider for that
16:51:48 <strcat[m]> probably provides a better UX for handling documents on stock
16:52:03 <strcat[m]> let me try on stock
16:52:26 <brenneke[m]> I am not worried about files as I have a backup but would like to know if there is a way I can straighten out directory back to normal with only 1 Documents folder.
16:52:55 <strcat[m]> exactly the same thing happens on the stock OS actually
16:53:00 <strcat[m]> brenneke: use MTP, ADB or another file manager
16:53:10 <strcat[m]> brenneke: nothing is wrong with the underlying storage implementation just the Files app UI
16:53:20 <strcat[m]> it's a UI bug
16:54:01 <strcat[m]> my recommendation is allow another file manager to access storage and use that to deal with it
16:54:06 <strcat[m]> or use MTP
16:54:45 <brenneke[m]> OK, so you feel I can rename and delete from there?
16:54:45 <brenneke[m]> Any suggestions for alternative file app?
16:55:00 <strcat[m]> I'll see if I can toggle off this Files app UI feature
16:55:12 <strcat[m]> brenneke: I know you can, I tested myself
16:55:24 <strcat[m]> and I tested on the stock OS too
16:55:27 <strcat[m]> the same issue happens with the Files app
16:55:31 <strcat[m]> it's purely a Files app UI issue
16:55:33 <strcat[m]> not specific to GrapheneOS either
16:56:58 <strcat[m]> brenneke: you have 3 options: another file manager, MTP or ADB - although I would recommend against using ADB unnecessarily
16:57:30 <strcat[m]> essentially Files is applying special treatment to directories starting with Documents*
16:57:34 <strcat[m]> in the UI
16:57:39 <strcat[m]> I'd need to look at the sources to figure out what it's actually trying to do and why
16:59:59 <brenneke[m]> Thanks for you help, much appreciated.
17:01:49 <strcat[m]> Files is higher level than just direct access to storage - it uses providers
17:02:02 <strcat[m]> it lets you access stuff like storage in a cloud storage app, etc.
17:02:10 <strcat[m]> so the issue here is that for documents it uses the documents provider
17:02:19 <strcat[m]> and there is some weird quirk about how it decides to do that
17:02:54 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't be surprised if the issue is an ambiguous URL specification
17:04:28 <strcat[m]> since it happens in the stock OS too someone could report it to them
17:04:33 <strcat[m]> doesn't have to be us that fixes it at all since it's not specific to GrapheneOS
17:04:37 <strcat[m]> 05-01 13:03:51.036  4097  4129 W DocumentsProvider: java.io.FileNotFoundException: Missing file for home:test at /storage/emulated/0/Documents/test
17:04:50 <strcat[m]> anyway basically when you delete '/Documents-test' it actually tries to delete '/Documents/test'
17:05:12 <strcat[m]> if you have '/Documents/test' it will successfully delete that, instead
17:05:17 <strcat[m]> DocumentsProvider is being silly
17:05:31 <strcat[m]> let me try to narrow it down a bit further
17:06:56 <strcat[m]> so yeah the - is not special
17:07:00 <strcat[m]> it's matching Documents*
17:07:07 <strcat[m]> probably easy to fix
17:07:14 <strcat[m]> I think I know what mistake they made
17:07:37 <strcat[m]> I just have no idea where the code is that they made this mistake
17:07:43 <strcat[m]> yeah I have a very good idea how they fucked up
17:07:52 <strcat[m]> easy mistake to make
17:29:47 <nscnt> It would be nice to have a log for the work that has been done under the hood of the GrapheneOS project. Especially if it's a big one so it could be said "We did that" (for future marketing or smth)
17:36:02 <nscnt> Ofc I know about Vanadium, Auditor and similar. But there's probably more I don't know of. It's especially interesting if it goes upstream so really every Android user profits of the work by the GrapheneOS project
17:36:51 <nscnt> profits *from
17:37:45 <strcat[m]> nscnt: I used to maintain a technical overview of the project including documenting what went upstream
17:38:00 <strcat[m]> but it was incomplete and I didn't know how to handle all the features that were dropped for various reasons such as being implemented upstream
17:38:27 <strcat[m]> and that hasn't been around since Copperhead tried to take over the project
17:39:11 <strcat[m]> I also think that calling it a technical overview was the wrong way to put it
17:39:17 <strcat[m]> since it was just a way of covering what GrapheneOS changed
17:39:42 <strcat[m]> not an overview of the OS
17:47:34 <Gutty7> Good afternoon, is this a good place to look for support with an install? i'm having some issues. if not where do you recommend I go? Thank you
17:48:15 <nscnt> Imo the actual changes are the interesting part. I could read about the AOSP and LineageOS, but what I would ask myself why GrapheneOS is the interesting party (what are the changes there, etc.)

18:03:42 <strcat[m]> I feel like if I try clarifying things even further it's just going to make it harder by making it longer

18:06:29 <danvittegleo[m]> wouldn't need to worry about what os someone is running, what version of fastboot
18:06:31 <danvittegleo[m]> etc
18:06:46 <danvittegleo[m]> yes
18:07:04 <strcat[m]> it rules out using signify to verify instead of trusting HTTPS but it could be an option for people that aren't going to do that anyway
18:07:10 <danvittegleo[m]> we flashed calyxos factory image with it the other day
18:07:16 <strcat[m]>  * it rules out using signify to verify instead of trusting Web PKI but it could be an option for people that aren't going to do that anyway
18:08:07 <strcat[m]> including locking?
18:08:22 <danvittegleo[m]> yes, that is true
18:08:42 <strcat[m]> I don't see how it can avoid instructions since it has to tell you to boot into fastboot mode, accept unlocking on the device, boot back into fastboot mode and lock
18:09:51 <strcat[m]> the only thing it really alleviates is needing to install fastboot because people struggle with installing it and not downloading some random untrustworthy / broken / out-of-date version of it
18:11:11 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah it just has a web enabled version of fastboot
18:11:26 <danvittegleo[m]> so you can flash a factory image and lock
18:12:20 <danvittegleo[m]> it gives you a nice web UI with instructions as you go along
18:13:48 <strcat[m]> via Web USB or whatever?
18:14:19 <danvittegleo[m]> ideally we would extract out the web enabled version of fastboot, but for now just trying to get it to work.
18:14:24 <strcat[m]> I think the main issue is that people are following unofficial guides and not referring to the official one
18:15:01 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't matter if I list out all the things that can go wrong there if people aren't using it
18:15:11 <danvittegleo[m]> i think it prevents having to read a wall of text as well, you just arrive at a web page and follow a wizard
18:15:15 <strcat[m]> people could still run into problems with USB ports, cables, etc. with the web one
18:15:51 <danvittegleo[m]> could even auto select latest build for your specific phone (working on that)
18:16:03 <strcat[m]> not being able to verify the signature is a major downside
18:16:22 <strcat[m]> a nice thing about the official guide is that on a distribution with proper packages
18:16:30 <strcat[m]> you just install android-tools, android-tools, signify
18:16:38 <strcat[m]> from the first party repositories
18:16:50 <strcat[m]> and just enter each of the commands
18:17:09 <strcat[m]> and you easily check that the signify public key is valid with the links provided
18:17:13 <strcat[m]> so you aren't relying on Web PKI
18:17:38 <nickcalyx[m]> Part of the reason we could never get institutional funding for calyxos was the funders said nobody can flash a custom ROM so it can never reach a wide audience
18:17:47 <strcat[m]> unfortunately a lot of distributions make that very difficult and some people are on Windows or macOS and aren't already using a package manager for those
18:18:06 <strcat[m]> I regularly test my instructions in a fresh container
18:18:09 <strcat[m]> for build and install
18:18:12 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah it uses webusb
18:18:42 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: well why is that relevant when that can be done for them and they can eventually buy devices with it
18:18:50 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is NOT a "custom ROM"
18:19:09 <strcat[m]> it can be flashed in the factory and shipped on devices, there is nothing that makes it a "custom ROM"
18:19:32 <strcat[m]> it's an OS, and I have never referred to it as a "custom ROM" anywhere, which is an inaccurate and confusing term
18:19:47 <strcat[m]> the end goal is not to be using third party devices like Pixels
18:20:24 <strcat[m]> it's harmful and confusing for people to wrongly call it a "custom ROM"
18:20:50 <strcat[m]> simply not what it is and it has never been referred to that way in official documentation or posts
18:21:04 <strcat[m]> and I mean going years back, NEVER referred to that way, since it doesn't make any sense
18:21:34 <strcat[m]> if people think there's some inherent requirement for people to flash it on their device they are just confused about what it is probably due to people spreading misinformation like that
18:21:50 <strcat[m]> the purpose of GrapheneOS is NOT to replace the stock OS on existing devices
18:22:12 <strcat[m]> it states in the official documentation that it's expected for people to buy a device specifically for GrapheneOS - whether or not it comes with it
18:22:36 <strcat[m]> goal is not providing something for people to flash on their existing phones - explicitly stated otherwise
18:23:00 <nickcalyx[m]> I argued that we could do it for them but they didn't find that a compelling argument
18:23:25 <aeonsolution[m]> Hi everyone, I'm trying to setup the Stable build on my machine. https://grapheneos.org/build#stable-release
18:23:25 <nickcalyx[m]> they say if you make an app that goes in the app store that can reach 10s of millions of people and they'd rather invest in apps
18:23:26 <hitchhooker[m]> i think he just exit wrong fastboot window during install causing it to not find fastboot anymore
18:23:29 <strcat[m]> I don't know how I can make things any clearer
18:23:30 <aeonsolution[m]> Where can I pull the TAG_NAME from
18:23:33 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: you shouldn't say you can do it for them
18:24:03 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: you should say that devices will ship with it
18:24:05 <nickcalyx[m]> I'm saying what the funders have said
18:24:05 <aeonsolution[m]> Setting up the for the Pixel 3a
18:24:08 <strcat[m]> people will buy devices that come with it instead of Google Android
18:24:13 <strcat[m]> the goal is not having people flash it, it's having them get a device with it in the first place
18:24:34 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: for building a stable release? it's listed on https://grapheneos.org/releases
18:24:46 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: I'm saying what needs to be said in response
18:24:51 <nickcalyx[m]> I wasn't talking about graphene either, but calyxOS... but the same principle applies to getting funders for graphene
18:24:57 <strcat[m]> you need to be clear that it's an OS, not a 'custom ROM' (and explain why that term doesn't make sense and is inaccurate)
18:25:22 <strcat[m]> and explain that the goal is not to provide something for people to flash
18:25:26 <strcat[m]> but rather for people to get devices that come with it
18:25:49 <nickcalyx[m]> my point is that having a nice graphical installer makes dumb funders think its easy for end users, and therefore more likely to fund
18:25:49 <strcat[m]> whether or not those devices originally had it flashed at the factory doesn't matter
18:26:15 <strcat[m]> end users can't be expected to install it with a nice graphical installer either
18:26:19 <strcat[m]> that's not how it has to work for them
18:26:22 <strcat[m]> so those people are just confused
18:26:33 <strcat[m]> regular people do not install operating systems, they buy a phone and use the OS that comes with it
18:26:33 <nickcalyx[m]> and to some extent it's true.. since most people can't do command line stuff
18:26:51 <strcat[m]> most people will not install an OS
18:26:53 <strcat[m]> on anything
18:26:56 <strcat[m]> regardless of the interface
18:27:03 <strcat[m]> there are GUIs for fastboot, it just makes things harder imo
18:27:10 <strcat[m]> harder to debug what's going wrong
18:27:12 <strcat[m]> more things that can go wrong
18:27:40 <strcat[m]> I can just imagine trying to support people here using some complex / opaque GUI installer, step 1 is telling them to follow the old style instructions probably
18:28:00 <strcat[m]> most people are not going to install operating systems
18:28:05 <strcat[m]> it just isn't something they are going to do
18:28:13 <strcat[m]> so reaching a wide audience requires that it come on the device
18:29:47 <mischling[m]> a store would be a great way to support the project. i guess many people would buy a phone with graphene preinstalled.
18:29:50 <strcat[m]> the install guide is written with best practices like verifying with the signature and not installing any software on the host machine other than from trusted repositories
18:29:55 <nickcalyx[m]> I hear you but funders aren't going to fund that either
18:30:30 <cclown[m]> I agree with that. mass adoption isn't through self installation and will only attract a niche who has sought it out and has some form of comfort with taking it on themselves, recognizing that things can go wrong if not followed properly
18:30:41 <strcat[m]> I'm getting funding from the community
18:31:24 <strcat[m]> if people don't understand it that's their problem
18:31:50 <strcat[m]> I've done everything I can to explain it
18:31:53 <strcat[m]> I don't really care if a specific company or organization funds it or not and I'm not going to pursue them
18:32:14 <strcat[m]> not my problem
18:33:02 <nickcalyx[m]> ok then
18:33:13 <strcat[m]> my approach has always been making something good
18:33:18 <nickcalyx[m]> that solves that problem
18:33:31 <strcat[m]> and it was going to work out well if an insider hadn't tried to destroy it
18:33:45 <nickcalyx[m]> except you keep saying you need other people to work on it.. and you need maintainers for various devices
18:34:00 <strcat[m]> and people are starting to do that
18:34:06 <strcat[m]> and the issue has never been money
18:34:28 <nscnt> aeonsolution[m]: The tag_name for Pixel 3a is QQ2A.200405.005.2020.04.14.23 . You can find it on the release page.
18:34:32 <strcat[m]> look at how much money I have donated to the Bitcoin address I published and extrapolate PayPal donations from that
18:34:47 <strcat[m]> and consider that there was basically the same amount donated in the past which got stolen
18:34:55 <nickcalyx[m]> developers gotta eat too
18:34:56 <strcat[m]> the problem has always been finding motivated people that can be trusted
18:34:59 <cclown[m]> Agreed.
18:34:59 <cclown[m]> Tutorials are great but people are generally inpatient ane don't fully read / comprehend.
18:34:59 <cclown[m]> I spent years in the xbox360 community supporting firmware, applications and tutorials. People generally just want the end item and not willing to put in the effort to get there.
18:34:59 <strcat[m]> not money
18:35:18 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: and if someone wants to work on it full time I think we can already fund them
18:35:23 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: I work on it full time, I get enough money from this
18:35:31 <strcat[m]> I don't have another job and I do not do any contract work
18:36:30 <strcat[m]> I don't think I would struggle to get 60k/year to pay someone to work on it full time
18:36:42 <strcat[m]> the problem is finding someone trustworthy
18:37:17 <strcat[m]> and I can simply ignore developers in the US, etc. who would expect 150k/year, they aren't any smarter or more trustworthy than someone in Germany, Australia or whatever
18:37:26 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: Thanks, I found it. I was able to make the connection when I saw the "Tags" in the Change Log, it was a little hard to understand the convention.
18:37:27 <aeonsolution[m]> nscnt: Got it, thanks for confirming. I appreciate the help!
18:37:36 <strcat[m]> and it's just plain stupid to have it set up so that people do entirely remote work from a place with a super high cost of living like bay area california
18:37:49 <strcat[m]> why work from a place with 100k/year cost of living instead of 20k
18:38:01 <strcat[m]> I'll happily just ignore that bubble
18:38:13 <strcat[m]> if Google didn't require people to relocate they wouldn't pay them nearly as much
18:39:02 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: the tags are $BUILD_ID.$BUILD_NUMBER
18:39:04 <strcat[m]> $BUILD_ID maps 1:1 with AOSP tags
18:39:16 <strcat[m]> we leave BUILD_ID as is so you can see the AOSP base for our tags from BUILD_ID
18:39:31 <strcat[m]> and we set BUILD_NUMBER to a representation of the date that's an always incrementing string
18:40:04 <strcat[m]> it's essentially ISO 8601 but with dots instead of dashes since you can't put dashes in the version
18:40:15 <strcat[m]> QQ2A.200405.005.2020.04.14.23
18:40:25 <strcat[m]> QQ2A.200405.005 is the AOSP BUILD_ID for the AOSP tag
18:40:42 <strcat[m]> https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers#source-code-tags-and-builds
18:40:50 <strcat[m]> that's android-10.0.0_r33
18:41:17 <strcat[m]> 2020.04.14.23 is the date when I started the builds (2020-04-14 at 23:xx UTC time)
18:41:45 <strcat[m]> so BUILD_NUMBER uniquely identifies the GrapheneOS version
18:42:01 <strcat[m]> that's why the changelog just uses that
18:42:07 <BrokenCog> >>> if Google didn't require people to relocate ... makes one wonder why they insist on that?
18:42:16 <strcat[m]> because sometimes there are different BUILD_ID per device
18:42:45 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog:  because companies don't trust employees to do remote work and think they won't be productive
18:43:19 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: and the culture of companies is defined by the people who are already there
18:43:23 <strcat[m]> and since they don't hire people who do remote work that's not their company culture
18:43:37 <strcat[m]> it's a bubble
18:44:07 <strcat[m]> similarly, they largely hire people out of the same small set of universities they attended themselves
18:44:15 <BrokenCog> well, that doesn't work for the google example does it?  The founders, at least the initial half dozen, were grad students doing work at home.
18:44:16 <strcat[m]> they hire people with similar experiences and ways of doing things as their own
18:44:25 <BrokenCog> perhaps it's something else?
18:44:40 <strcat[m]> that's just how humans do things
18:44:55 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: those people aren't involved in hiring software engineers
18:45:00 <strcat[m]> software engineers are essentially interviewed and hired by software engineers
18:45:22 <strcat[m]> and the team you are being hired to work on is not involved in hiring you
18:45:39 <strcat[m]> so it's a completely generic process and every interview process is basically the same for a software engineer
18:45:42 <strcat[m]> regardless of whether you are going to work on frontend JavaScript, security engineering or whatever
18:45:55 <BrokenCog> but the premise was the "corporate culture" was defined by the higher ups ... the very first HR person hired was hired by the initial founders to implement THEIR culuture.  They did it in everything *execpt* remote work?
18:46:17 <strcat[m]> so first of all there's this long, ridiculous and outrageous interview process
18:46:24 <strcat[m]> and you have to go there to do it
18:46:26 <cdesai> starting a company from home != remote work
18:46:28 <nickcalyx[m]> Well google is 100% remote now
18:46:34 <BrokenCog> perhaps remote work is not as productive (in aggegragate) as the myth implies?
18:46:40 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: that's not the culture they defined
18:47:07 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: not by choice and the people they've hired and largely not productive with remote work
18:47:07 <aeonsolution[m]> <strcat[m] "that's why the changelog just us"> Got it. Thanks.
18:47:08 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: because it doesn't work well for everyone
18:47:17 <BrokenCog> exactly. they chose not to create remote work as part of their culuter.  Why not??
18:47:30 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: so if anything it will give them a more negative outlook on it imo since it's a high stress way of doing it without people suited to it
18:47:57 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: because they don't trust people to be productive if they have any privacy
18:48:15 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: and they see a lot of value in doing things in-person, whatever that is, along with essentially enforcing uniformity of culture, etc.
18:48:19 <BrokenCog> or perhaps the vast majority of workers aren't productive when left to themselves?
18:48:22 <strcat[m]> they don't just want people to do work at work
18:48:51 <strcat[m]> they want them to spend as much time there as possible when they aren't working
18:48:52 <danvittegleo[m]> lol.. i wouldn't say it's a completely generic process across those domains.
18:48:52 <strcat[m]> they want most of their life to be based around the company
18:48:53 <BrokenCog> >> doing things in-person ... that was going to be my second point.  there is a lot of sociological study showing groups are much more productive.
18:48:54 <strcat[m]> eat 3 meals a day there, go to gym there, everything there
18:49:18 <Gutty7> I just wanted to say thanks I was able to get it installed with a newer ver of the sdk tools thanks for the help
18:49:35 <strcat[m]> everyone you know part of that work bubble
18:49:41 <danvittegleo[m]> i've done my fair share of interviews on both sides.. they are all over the place.
18:50:28 <cclown[m]> I am more productive at home than I am in the office and COVID, unfortunately, is definitely showing that
18:50:33 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: the US Google has a pretty generic hiring process for those roles
18:50:50 <strcat[m]> there's a hiring process for SWE, a hiring process for SRE, etc.
18:50:55 <strcat[m]> and they deliberately avoid having the team you are being hired to work on interview you
18:52:00 <strcat[m]> not a domain specific interview process
18:52:08 <strcat[m]> maybe at non-US Google corporations
18:52:14 <strcat[m]> but not there
18:52:26 <strcat[m]> lots of people only work for Google because their company was acquired by it
18:52:31 <strcat[m]> that's a major way they do 'hiring'
18:52:53 <strcat[m]> lots of those people never would have been accepted going through the regular process even though it's a lot of their most productive and innovative employees
18:53:05 <strcat[m]> they love acquiring companies as a way to hire people
18:53:15 <strcat[m]> it's not the products of those companies that matter for the most part
18:54:42 <strcat[m]> they see something good and buy out the company because they largely don't have a successful process for building a team like that themselves
18:54:50 <danvittegleo[m]> yes, each company has their own methods
18:54:55 <strcat[m]> they have a really serious problem with hiring and retaining good people
18:55:09 <strcat[m]> projects like Android are super understaffed largely because they suck so much as hiring people
18:55:17 <danvittegleo[m]> amazon for example, you are interviewing for a specific team
18:55:19 <strcat[m]> they always want to hire people because they never have enough
18:55:27 <strcat[m]> and they lose the people they do hire after a year or two most of the time
18:55:34 <danvittegleo[m]> actually, most companies that i know of, you are interviewing for a specific role/team
18:55:43 <strcat[m]> the people who work there and say it's great are the ones filtered through all this
18:56:02 <strcat[m]> and they hire other people like themselves, I'd say that's the number #1 thing actually being checked by people in interviews
18:56:04 <strcat[m]> are you like them?
18:56:25 <strcat[m]> consciously or not
18:56:36 <strcat[m]> that's how it works
18:56:39 <danvittegleo[m]> and beyond a phone screen, the interview loop generally is specific to that role minus behavioral questions
18:56:42 <nickcalyx[m]> a friend of mine just got hired to the Android security team just now, remote
18:59:53 <cdesai> nickcalyx[m]: would they have to move / work in office once this ends?
19:01:30 <danvittegleo[m]> i think that's a pretty normal human bias that's unfortunately hard to remove from the interview process without having a good mix of different people doing the interview and also a well defined process for what you are determining is a good fit for a candidate
19:02:37 <strcat[m]> danvittegleo: their hiring process tends to be very generic though
19:02:55 <strcat[m]> part of their 'solution' to problems like this is doing that
19:05:23 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah, i've never dealt with google hiring process directly, so not sure.
19:05:50 <strcat[m]> I have
19:06:43 <nscnt> Have you failed it?
19:08:00 <strcat[m]> no I stopped because it was a waste of time
19:08:15 <strcat[m]> if they want to waste that much of my time and energy they'd have to pay me
19:08:21 <nscnt> Yea, no accusation here. I wouldn't be suprised.
19:08:24 <strcat[m]> they failed at keeping me interested in doing it
19:08:26 <nscnt> Because I agree with you
19:09:49 <strcat[m]> you can't waste people's time for an entire week and make them travel somewhere
19:10:01 <strcat[m]> and expect people who aren't desperate to go along with it
19:10:32 <strcat[m]> if you just want to hire desperate people or people who value working at Google extremely highly I'm sure it works
19:10:41 <strcat[m]> there was a time when I might have done it
19:11:04 <strcat[m]> before I had already established a place for myself
19:11:16 <strcat[m]> but they would have had to do a much better job than they did of trying to hire me to succeed at it
19:11:39 <strcat[m]> a job offer that leads to wasting a week of time with no guarantee of getting anything out of it? and no attempt to convince me that I even want to do it? nah
19:12:37 <strcat[m]> I have 0 interest in taking a place to SF to be there for 2 days solely to do an interview too, maybe if they offer to book me a hotel for 2 weeks and only take 2 days of my time
19:12:43 <strcat[m]> there's no way I'm travelling anywhere for < 2 weeks
19:13:02 <nscnt> There are amazing stories about absolutely broken dudes that worked for Google. Money was big, but they don't know how they let Google do this to them (unsatisfying work all day everyday)
19:13:17 <strcat[m]> especially to be put through some high stress, low value cargo cult interview process
19:13:50 <strcat[m]> if they want to hire and more importantly retain good people then that's their problem to sort out, I have 0 interest in working for them now that I really don't have a reason to
19:15:23 <strcat[m]> I notice that most people don't stay at Google, they leave pretty fast, some people are happy there and stay even though they have opportunities elsewhere but seems the majority of people working for these silicon valley companies come and every 1-2 years
19:15:27 <strcat[m]> constantly job hopping
19:15:43 <strcat[m]> if that
19:16:05 <strcat[m]> it's hard for me to keep track of which people I know work for which company since most switch so quickly
19:16:11 <strcat[m]> shrug
19:16:43 <nscnt> That's /r/cscareerquestions 101
19:16:50 <strcat[m]> by the time they know enough to be productive they're leaving
19:16:59 <strcat[m]> whatever they are doing doesn't work
19:17:13 <strcat[m]> and totally fucks over their products
19:17:52 <strcat[m]> also the way they value/reward people is all screwed up
19:18:45 <strcat[m]> they have a culture of creating/launching a product (useful or not) to be rewarded/recognized and moving on
19:18:55 <strcat[m]> including moving on to another company, a lot of the time
19:19:28 <nscnt> lol
19:19:32 <strcat[m]> most of those companies are pretty screwed up in this regard
19:19:40 <strcat[m]> microsoft and apple have a lot less of these problems
19:20:01 <strcat[m]> they don't have that silicon valley VC culture nearly as much
19:20:40 <strcat[m]> they can actually retain employees and consistently develop and continue something in a strategic way
19:21:46 <nickcalyx[m]> > nickcalyx: would they have to move / work in office once this ends?
19:21:46 <nickcalyx[m]> I think so, yes. They already are in the sf bay area
19:22:19 <nickcalyx[m]> Its just remote because covid19
19:22:32 <cdesai> gotcha
19:23:54 <strcat[m]> for roles like SWE/SRE, I don't think remote work really exists other than the COVID-19 thing
19:24:04 <strcat[m]> at least for US corp Google there is not really remote work
19:24:09 <strcat[m]> outside of some super special cases
19:24:24 <strcat[m]> it is not what they do
19:24:28 <strcat[m]> same applies to most companies there
19:24:28 <danvittegleo[m]> if you live in a big city, financially it makes a lot more sense to hop around from job to job
19:25:22 <strcat[m]> they are based around the bay area specifically because they highly value being in that bubble and making people relocate there
19:25:41 <strcat[m]> it makes sense when companies don't properly recognize and reward employees
19:25:45 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense when they do
19:26:03 <strcat[m]> it makes sense when the culture at those companies is broken and the way to move up is moving from company to company
19:26:15 <strcat[m]> since it's all based around hiring people not retaining/rewarding/recognizing them
19:26:17 <JTL> > 11:42 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog:  because companies don't trust employees to do remote work and think they won't be productive
19:26:19 <JTL> I've seen plenty of people I'm sure you'd describe as "lazy" work inside office jobs lol
19:26:44 <strcat[m]> in an industry with a less fucked up culture you don't advance yourself by job hopping
19:27:00 <strcat[m]> JTL: yeah I'm not saying it makes any sense
19:27:18 <strcat[m]> JTL: it's really hard for most people to actually be productive in that kind of open office plans with tons of meetings, etc.
19:27:39 <strcat[m]> so you pretty much guarantee they are not going to be productive
19:27:44 <strcat[m]> and set the baseline as barely getting stuff done
19:27:59 <JTL> I've noticed
19:28:15 <danvittegleo[m]> yeah i'm not saying it's a good thing, it's just the current state of the industry for the most part
19:28:26 <strcat[m]> there is actually a version check in flash-all.sh
19:28:30 <strcat[m]> but it's not in flash-all.bat
19:28:47 <strcat[m]> it checks for 28.0.2
19:29:01 <JTL> I'm glad all this COVID lockdown stuff has placed emphasis on improving remote work. Sadly I wouldn't be surprised if all this becomes moot when the pandemic is over...
19:29:46 <strcat[m]> I wasn't actually aware of that when I said 28.0.2 is the requirement in the install guide
19:30:18 <danvittegleo[m]> <JTL "I'm glad all this COVID lockdown"> yeah, i'm also curious to see where this lands
19:30:56 <strcat[m]> I think a lot of those companies will get a bad impression of remote work
19:31:01 <strcat[m]> because people are not doing it by choice
19:31:07 <strcat[m]> they're forced into it and not prepared for it
19:31:20 <strcat[m]> and it's not just people suited for doing remote work
19:31:28 <BrokenCog> >>> describe as "lazy" work inside office jobs  ... I'm not saying anything about workers in an office.  I'm suggesting that "alone" few workers have a) the dedication to the Boss and b) the internal veracity to focus  on something "un-interesting" and c) procrastination with which to put aside personal at-home distractions and complete tasks for The Boss in a remote location.   Capitalism rides on
19:31:34 <BrokenCog> the myth that "people are interested in making themselves unhappy doing work for someone elses benefit.  given the choice, people wourd rather do their OWN work (read, TV, game, bike ride, etc) than something for someone else, payment is a weak form of motivation.
19:33:13 <BrokenCog> it will become moot:  corporatians are going to realize that all these managers have been padding work requirements because they know if they don't have several underling workers THEY don't have a job.  work at home is showing the senior board that workers are VASTLY over rated and redundant.  We'll start to see a very much larger implementation of automation in office work.
19:33:42 <cclown[m]> Not in the same industry but definitely see more  recent grads (+/-5yrs out)/in my field hopping from employer to employer looking to move up the ladder
19:34:05 <BrokenCog> all industry's are roughly the same WRT to workers.
19:34:27 <BrokenCog> some companies have different policies, etc. but it's all the same:  minimize cost maximize production.
19:34:56 <BrokenCog> workers have always known this:  they compensated by having a retirement.  now, they compensate by moving around to new company's with (hopefully) higher pay.
19:35:10 <BrokenCog> it's all a circle jerk.
19:35:20 <nscnt> *soviet symphonies starting to play*
19:35:38 * BrokenCog Capitalist apologist being noticed
19:35:55 <JTL> > 12:30 <strcat[m]> I think a lot of those companies will get a bad impression of remote work
19:35:56 <JTL> I'm sure being rapdily rushed into it doesn't help things, but I think the pargmatic and sensible companies will look at it "what's wrong" and what needs to be imrproved going forward. Of course like I said I wouldn't be surprised altogether if they just forget about this when the pandemic ends.
19:36:00 <BrokenCog> i have no interest in the former soviet union, nor communism.
19:37:00 <nscnt> it's not that deep, bro
19:37:16 <BrokenCog> JTL: for sure.  remember:  if a job consists of recivieng a task, and producing an output: that role can/will be automated.  When you're sitting at home reading that email from BossMan about tomorrow's work ... That's Automation!
19:37:24 <cclown[m]> I will definitely be pushing to work from home more frequently when this is over
19:37:32 <JTL> BrokenCog: Yeah
19:38:19 <BrokenCog> last year I felt 90% of the work force would be automated within 10-15 years.  now, I'm willing to say it'll be five years.  maybe 7 or 8..
19:40:45 <BrokenCog> nscnt: I don't know what you're getting at.
19:40:53 <BrokenCog> presuming the comment was directed at me.
19:41:28 <nscnt> just don't mind it
19:41:39 <BrokenCog> roger.
19:44:07 <nscnt> BrokenCog: And was the "Capitalist apologist" directed at me? I'm not sure because it's /me
19:44:34 <BrokenCog> IFF *soviet symphonies starting to play* was for me, THEN yes.
19:45:06 <nscnt> huh maybe I fucking like communism?
19:45:31 <nscnt> or well the stuff the Soviet Union did
19:46:14 <BrokenCog> okay.
19:46:44 <nscnt> as I said it wasn't too serious
19:46:53 <BrokenCog> okay.
19:47:01 <nscnt> :]
19:48:41 <cclown[m]> Is there usually a big lag b/n irc and matrix? I'm seeing messages 10mins after timestamp and mine take forever to be posted.
19:48:41 <cclown[m]> Maybe have to to back to good old irc
19:48:58 <strcat[m]> yes matrix is super laggy
19:49:06 <yekip[m]> wondering what people think about syncing passwords between Mac and Graphene. Bad practice? I was going to use BitWarden, but I just heard about https://macpassapp.org/ - no syncing to phone though.
19:49:58 <flabbergasted[m]> Bitwarden works fine
19:53:58 <yekip[m]> <flabbergasted[m] "Bitwarden works fine"> syncing to graphene?
19:54:00 <yekip[m]> you use it?
19:54:57 <nscnt> yekip[m]: What issue do you think there is?
19:54:58 <flabbergasted[m]> Yes
19:55:56 <yekip[m]> no specific issue in mind. just asking for guidance, i am new to this stuff and making chioces about what process and apps to use etc.
19:56:32 <nscnt> yekip[m]: You can choose whatever app you like to use. There'll be no issue because of the operating system.
19:57:19 <nscnt> yekip[m]: And BitWarden is a good choice in my opinion. It work's completetly fine.
19:59:06 <nscnt> yekip[m]: If you initally wanted to use BitWarden, I'm not sure why you would want to use something like MacPass that doesn't even sync to your phone (if you want it to).
20:02:04 <cclown[m]> Tnx, will switch back
20:02:37 <yekip[m]> well kind of deciding whether or not to have it sync at all, thats main thing really. maybe i will keep two separate vaults. will have a think. Actually, saying that, I am just about to setup a laptop too so it will be three machines. So yeah, bitwarden sounds like tyhe way to go. thanks
20:04:15 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Yea, that's a reasonable question to ask oneself. Some prefer to not sync it to a server. But you could use an offline password vault, synced peer-to-peer with e.g. Syncthing.
20:05:12 <nscnt> yekip[m]: BitWarden is a good choice if you don't want to think much about it.
20:06:21 <yekip[m]> very good idea that thanks. and you also recognise it may be beyond me :D . I am actually planningh on using syncthing as per conversation the otgher day about backing up media from phone. So I MAY be able to do that. But will try BW out i think beforehand. nice idea though. thanks
20:09:59 <nscnt> No problem c:
20:26:45 <yekip[m]> has anyone used this https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.callrecorder/? if so, does it work on graphene ?
20:33:24 <cx2[m]> <yekip[m] "very good idea that thanks. and "> I have used bitwarden for a while.... really like it. BUT I have transitioned for KeePass.
20:36:38 * cx2[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ImJgJyDqBsraLaKObFUTaXOA >
20:47:55 <mischling[m]> this is my thinking also. why bother with all this security and then store your passwords on someone else's computer?
20:49:33 <cx2[m]> Well, it's not that simple but you have a point. What I briefly outlined above is kept "in-house" so to speak.
20:49:33 <cx2[m]> In all fairness, Bitwarden can be self hosted, and done so pretty easily
21:00:28 <strcat[m]> would appreciate if someone can port the version check in flash-all.sh to flash-all.bat
21:00:40 <strcat[m]> in device/common https://github.com/GrapheneOS/device_common
21:01:48 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/device_common/blob/10/generate-factory-images-common.sh#L108
21:02:08 <JTL> I have a Windows machine a desk over
21:02:15 <JTL> I could try and bang something out
21:02:17 <JTL> lol
21:02:36 <JTL> Haven't done bat in a while
21:02:58 <strcat> I need to set up opendmarc so I don't need to check spf/dkim headers myself plus it'll wipe out this spam that started company from SEO companies
21:03:21 <JTL> "Pay us to index your site on Google"?
21:03:54 <seaclown> Let me know JTL, I can take a look later at if as well if needed. Also haven't worked in bat in a while bit shouldn't be a huge issue
21:27:29 <TheJollyRoger> Let me go and get my Windows drive in a sec... I'm fighting with firmware at this moment.
21:27:35 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. On my way.
21:36:44 <TheJollyRoger> I think I still remember how to use findstr on Windows... rebooting in a sec.
21:44:04 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Powershell is a non-optional feature on Windows, right? It's only Windows 7, and Windows Vista that doesn't have it installed by default?
21:44:13 <strcat> I only care about supporting Windows 10
21:44:18 <TheJollyRoger> Okay got it!
21:44:21 <strcat> I am not supporting old versions of things
21:44:25 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense.
21:44:27 <strcat> Windows 10 has curl and bsdtar
21:44:32 <TheJollyRoger> Woah.
21:44:35 <strcat> it doesn't have an unzip command
21:44:39 <JTL> strcat: so I don't need to right some obnoxious for loop in bat?
21:44:40 <strcat> but you can unzip with bsdtar
21:44:48 <JTL> er write*
21:44:51 <strcat> JTL: there might be a reason to use bat instead of powershell
21:44:57 <JTL> Yeah okay
21:44:58 <strcat> it would be a pain to port the whole thing to powershell
21:45:01 <strcat> that aosp script is... special
21:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> Oh!
21:45:06 <JTL> right
21:45:06 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
21:52:45 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: I figured out hwo to substring in batch
21:58:33 <TheJollyRoger> Woah.
21:58:47 <TheJollyRoger> I'm trying to find out if there's an equivalent to awk in Windows XP... go go go!
21:59:14 <JTL> It's called "reimplemnting Unix utilities using clear plastic tape and paper clips"
21:59:37 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Don't limit youreslf to that for back, although I don't think much changed from XP->7
21:59:39 * JTL shrug
22:55:52 <JTL> strcat: Looks like it's possible to use inline Poweshell with batch files as far back as Windows 7, would that be okay for fastboot version detection?
22:56:15 <strcat[m]> yes probably
22:56:18 <JTL> Alright
22:56:24 <strcat[m]> is powershell installed by default on all versions of Windows 10?
22:56:26 <strcat[m]> that's what matters
22:56:44 <JTL> I don't actually have a stock Windows 10 machine of my own
22:56:46 * JTL blush
22:56:49 <JTL> I could look into that too
22:56:56 <zazagx> hello
22:57:35 <aeonsolution[m]> powershell is installed
22:58:15 <JTL> It's installed by default with Win7
22:58:24 <JTL> I remember for XP and Vista it was a additional download
22:58:50 <aeonsolution[m]> i was responding to windows 10
22:58:54 <aeonsolution[m]> you can upgrade win7 to win10
22:58:54 <JTL> Ah thanks
22:58:59 <JTL> right
22:59:06 <aeonsolution[m]> i can get you the official windows tool link to do that
22:59:21 <JTL> I'm literally protoyping this from memory with the win7 box next to me
22:59:26 <JTL> (it's not on the internet) :P
22:59:40 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: No need at the moment
22:59:46 <aeonsolution[m]> you dont need internet just make a usb
22:59:49 <JTL> it's just a "lab" box to run drivers for old hardware
22:59:57 <JTL> so Windows 10 probably won't work
23:00:02 <aeonsolution[m]> ah got it
23:00:24 <JTL> I realize it's kind of a clunky thing and security risk, far from ideal
23:00:36 <JTL> I'll try Windows 10 on that machine at some point
23:04:18 <strcat> JTL: yeah use powershell
23:04:30 <strcat> JTL: maybe we should port the whole script to powershell
23:04:34 <strcat> but it's a pain
23:04:36 <strcat> inline is easier
23:05:54 <JTL> Yeah okay
23:06:00 <JTL> Agreed
23:18:56 <izymandias[m]> what are the benefits of an e-sim?
23:36:11 <TheJollyRoger> findstr version... now just gotta do the equivalent of awk ' { print $3 } ' or what have you...
23:36:13 <TheJollyRoger> Argh.
23:37:46 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: I'm working on an inline powershell solution
23:37:57 <JTL> Pertty sure I figured out how to do string indexing now
23:38:04 <JTL> I'll go grab lunch
23:38:07 <TheJollyRoger> Go JTL GO!
23:38:09 <JTL> (late day yada yada)
23:38:31 <zazagx> hey, i am thinking of getting an unlocked pixel 3a and flashing it with grapheneos. does it run f-droid or some kind of app store?
23:40:17 <TheJollyRoger> Hi zazagx, we don't bundle F-Droid or an application store, but you can simply collect the F-Droid app yourself if you opt to do so.
23:40:27 <TheJollyRoger> Or rather, GrapheneOS doesn't bundle
23:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> (Sorry, I'm not there yet XP)
23:45:38 <zazagx> i am not sure, I just want the Tutanota app. its on the google play store and f-droid store
23:45:58 <TheJollyRoger> You'll have to go to f-droid.org and download the f-droid app if you want f-droid. That's all.
23:46:20 <zazagx> oh its not recommended from you guys? for privacy reasons?
23:46:31 <TheJollyRoger> (one sec)
23:50:13 <seaclown> The OS only comes with basic apps, from there you can download apks directly from developers or through fdroid , aurora droid, etc..
23:50:23 <TheJollyRoger> At this particular moment in time, F-Droid isn't seen as ideal because of the large amount of legacy or unmaintained apps that it has, and that it's also got a large amount of legacy code. However, it's kinda recognized as being one option that we realize a lot of users are going to end up taking because it's there.
23:50:44 <zazagx> oh
23:50:53 <TheJollyRoger> You can download and install apps through F-Droid but for apps like Signal, or apps that self-update I highly recommend you get them directly from the developers /where you can./
23:51:05 <TheJollyRoger> But if you want F-droid, you can go to F-Droid.org and download it directly frem there.
23:51:23 <zazagx> would it be better to download the app from the google play store from grapheneos?
23:51:56 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS doesn't include the Play Store.
23:52:13 <zazagx> oh
23:53:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. You'll have to find your apps yourself -- whether by downloading F-Droid from the website and installing it (from there, the experience is the same except it will ask you to manually approve it)
23:53:47 <TheJollyRoger> Or by sourcing your apps yourself.
23:54:04 <zazagx> hmmm
23:54:24 <zazagx> i don't like compiling by source
23:54:28 <TheJollyRoger> At this moment, GrapheneOS doesn't include an app store. So if you want F-Droid, just when you've installed, open up the browser, go to F-Droid's homepage, download the APK, and tap on it once.
23:54:34 <TheJollyRoger> That's all you need to do if you want F-droid.
23:54:44 <TheJollyRoger> navigate, download, tap, confirm.
23:54:52 <TheJollyRoger> Compiling from source is not needed.
23:55:04 <zazagx> nice
23:56:26 <TheJollyRoger> If you want, you can verify the GPG signature on the F-Droid .apk on a computer, but that's not necessary: a core tenement of the Android security model is that each app is signed and verified with a certificate included in the .apk.
23:56:33 <TheJollyRoger> Future updates must match that .apk.
23:56:44 <zazagx> oh no
23:56:47 <TheJollyRoger> *future updates must match that certificate included in the .apk, when the app was first installed.
23:56:59 <TheJollyRoger> What's the oh no for? This is a good thing.
23:57:07 <zazagx> are you guys going to rebrand any app store and do upsteam updates?
23:57:51 <TheJollyRoger> No. An app store of specially curated apps has been put on the wishlist for GrapheneOS, but that's at this moment a wishlist item and this project has much bigger priorities to worry about.
23:58:03 <TheJollyRoger> But a GrapheneOS app store is on the wishlist.
23:59:26 <zazagx> oh, i am looking at the grapheneos.org, i don't see the list of apps included pre-installed by vanilla stock rom
