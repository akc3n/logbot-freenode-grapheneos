00:01:06 <JTL> I find I can easily get over 100Mbps single stream TCP to/from Europe from here
00:01:29 <JTL> (playing with iperf and various "cloud providers"
00:01:31 <JTL> )
00:01:32 * TheJollyRoger is jealous.
00:01:34 <renlord> TCP can get really fast too when it has warmed up enough
00:01:38 <JTL> right
00:01:40 <renlord> and reaches the ssthresh
00:02:04 <JTL> this is iperf, because speedtest.net is a) multithreaded, b) has browser shenanigans, c) only lasts about 10 seconds on average
00:03:27 <strcat[m]> renlord: QUIC is a draft but won't be for long
00:03:30 <strcat[m]> also worth noting it's a LOT different than it used to be
00:04:12 <strcat[m]> originally QUIC had QUIC Crypto instead of TLS, but they moved to TLS due to TLS 1.3
00:04:20 <strcat[m]> QUIC Crypto was still much simpler than TLS 1.3
00:04:30 <strcat[m]> but wouldn't really be faster now
00:04:54 <strcat[m]> and they made special TLS integration into it just like before anyway
00:05:09 <strcat[m]> it was also originally just a transport for SPDY and then HTTP/2
00:05:12 <strcat[m]> but now it's generic
00:05:22 <strcat[m]> and WebRTC, etc. will likely move to QUIC too
00:05:51 <strcat[m]> since it's great for stuff like video, voice, etc. as a replacement for all the custom protocols on top of UDP
00:32:04 <renlord> does anyone wish NAT will just go away?
00:32:52 <algebro[m]> It will with ipv6 supposedly
00:33:13 <renlord> that's the mantra since ipv6 was introduced?
00:33:43 <JTL> Yeah
00:34:09 <JTL> Unfortunatly some ISPs use dynamic prefixes and some firewalls don't handle prefix changes very well at all for incoming connections so that's any potential issue
00:34:25 <JTL> (for example)
00:35:07 <renlord> relying on NAT for netsec was not intended
00:36:50 <strcat[m]> mobile is already usually pure ipv6
00:37:00 <JTL> Yup
00:37:04 <strcat[m]> cellular data
00:37:11 <renlord> not in australia
00:37:15 <JTL> My carrier strted supporting IPv6 about 4-5 years ago
00:37:17 <renlord> cgnat piece of shit
00:37:24 <strcat[m]> but I mean they don't even do ipv4
00:37:56 <JTL> Last time I bothered to check I get both CGNAT IPv4 and IPv6 assigned to my mobile data connection
00:42:36 <strcat[m]> JTL: what I mean is they can tunnel the ipv4 over ipv6
00:42:43 <JTL> right
00:43:08 <strcat[m]> and have the network only do ipv6
00:43:13 <strcat[m]> cgnat is demanding since it's stateful
00:43:18 <strcat[m]> they drop connections
00:43:24 <strcat[m]> which is why stuff like Signal polls so frequently
00:43:31 <JTL> I've noticed
00:44:03 <strcat[m]> you have people dragging their heels on ipv6 to thank for the hit Signal has on battery life
00:46:00 <JTL> Can't say I'm surprised sadly
01:02:15 <madaidan[m]> Our beloved James just joined a telegram group I'm in lmao
01:02:28 <JTL> Donaldson?
01:02:37 <madaidan[m]> Yes
01:02:39 <JTL> What's the group?
01:02:53 <JTL> (I don't use Telegram, just curious)
01:04:26 <madaidan[m]> @Whonix_Chat
01:04:32 <madaidan[m]> It's also bridged to matrix
01:04:34 <JTL> Ah
01:05:51 <TheJollyRoger> sadtrombone.wav
02:05:16 <madaidan[m]> He keeps sidestepping everything
02:08:25 <sel[m]1> madaidan. Lol it's funny
02:13:16 <rutxonboard[m]> If Daniel was so dangerous to Copperhead customers Copperhead should have made sure no devices trusted his keys(effectively deleting them). But no Daniel destroying the keys(as the original guy and full controller of the project) destroying keys was too far
02:14:59 <rutxonboard[m]> I don't follow the logic from this guy at all
02:15:51 <rutxonboard[m]> Daniel thought Copperhead was a threat. Copperhead thought Daniel was a threat. If you assume both are fair positions then only Daniel did the right thing
02:16:27 <rutxonboard[m]> Which we all know Daniel was not a threat to Copperhead, but even humoring that it doesn't make any sense
02:18:06 <madaidan[m]> He repeatedly dodged that
02:18:50 <rutxonboard[m]> As someone who stopped using Copperhead before this who debacle this is all I needed to see to know beyond a shadow of a doubt Copperhead was 100% in the wrong and by their own omission willingly putting their customers at risk
02:19:35 <rutxonboard[m]> I asked 3 times clarifying each time and he didn't even walk it back
02:19:49 <rutxonboard[m]> Or answer
02:20:02 <rutxonboard[m]> What a joke
02:20:21 <rutxonboard[m]> I tried to be respectful of him as much as possible and give him total benefit of the doubt
03:10:39 <strcat[m]> I still own half the company even though he hijacked it and embezzles all the money
03:11:38 <strcat[m]> how about he starts by returning all the donations he stole
03:11:46 <strcat[m]> he doesn't stop spending every day doing all the damage he possibly can
03:11:49 <strcat[m]> lowlife scumbag
03:11:51 <rutxonboard[m]> Damn straight strcat (@strcat:matrix.org)
03:13:22 <rutxonboard[m]> Looks like he denied the legal stuff madaidan.
03:13:28 <rutxonboard[m]> ?
03:15:03 <madaidan[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Looks like he denied the legal s"> Wdym
03:16:35 <rutxonboard[m]> The legal attacks on Gos
03:17:06 <madaidan[m]> You mean the tax stuff?
03:17:20 <madaidan[m]> Yes, he denied that.
03:18:02 <madaidan[m]> He said:
03:18:02 <madaidan[m]> > Its an insane narrative and anyone with half a brain can see through it
03:18:05 <rutxonboard[m]> Yes
03:18:23 <rutxonboard[m]> Okay I'm insane and have half a brain
03:18:25 <rutxonboard[m]> Less than
04:23:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4muxd
05:16:21 <mmcblk0[m]> i have a Pixel 4 and would like to Auditee with Attestation.app, but i cant, HW is a Titan, same as Pixel 3, isnt?
05:17:03 <TheJollyRoger> Hi mmcblk0[m], tap submit a sample. When Auditor's updated it might be supported at a later date.
05:17:14 <JTL> mmcblk0[m]: Needs to have device support in the app
05:17:20 <JTL> (What TheJollyRoger said) :P
05:22:55 <TheJollyRoger> mmcblk0[m], if I recall correctly (don't take my word for it) each phone's unique certificate is signed by a lot key. That lot key, is then validated by a lot key specific to a set number of phones, which is then validated by a vendor key specific to that OEM, which is then validated by a key belonging to Google, which is self-signed but preauthenticated in enough places to be known to be
05:22:56 <TheJollyRoger> traceable back to Google.
05:24:29 <TheJollyRoger> The Titan M just holds the private keys to your phone's certificate, but it's likely that the sample data for the information specific to those phones just hasn't been included in Auditor yet. The process to include new phones in Auditor isn't yet automated, so it could take a bit of time.

05:35:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW had something interesting on telegram
05:35:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're welcome
05:36:41 <JTL> "fucking lineage fork" my sides
05:38:10 <graphenehelp[m]> Hello, having installation issues on pixel 3a xl, unlocked and unlocked bootloader, adb setup 1.4.3, latest graphene release for pix3axl, extracted and flashall.bat, flash writes avb_custom_key, reboots to bootloader, then error: unknown option--skip reboot, press any key to exit
05:53:53 <analogpathy[m]> if you have an unlocked bootloader you already failed
05:56:13 <graphenehelp[m]> by your standards, which have no influence on my standards
06:05:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hi graphenehelp[m] , I think analogpathy[m] is referring to a link that was posted earlier.
06:05:52 <TheJollyRoger> just a sec, let me get a few things here and I'll pitch in.
06:06:28 <graphenehelp[m]> apologies if so. and thank you
06:06:40 <TheJollyRoger> graphenehelp[m]: can you run `which fastboot` and `fastboot --version` and show me the output?
06:14:55 <graphenehelp[m]> your message prompted me to check everything again. I failed to see that the creator of adb setup 1.4.3 admits it is outdated. I have installed the latest platform tools and will attempt everything again. thank you for your help and i will update when finished
06:21:07 <renlord> ovh verification taking forever :/
06:32:47 <TheJollyRoger> renlord:  what are you doing...?
06:33:03 <TheJollyRoger> graphenehelp[m]: got it! Don't forget, you're going to need to completely remove your old adb and old fastboot from your operating system.
06:33:22 <TheJollyRoger> If you need to, you can check using `which fastboot` to see what's in your path.
06:33:53 <renlord[m]> TheJollyRoger: marking undergraduate assignments.
06:34:10 <TheJollyRoger> You'll then need to append to your path variable to where you've downloaded platform tools. Please only use the official releases of adb and fastboot unless you run Arch which has a correctly versioned and up to date package, or you run the risk of bricking the phone if you force it.
06:34:15 <TheJollyRoger> renlord[m]: oh goodness >_<.
06:35:18 <TheJollyRoger> graphenehelp[m]: I'm just clearing some stuff up here, if you need me, ping me and there's a good chance I'll check before I go to sleep.
06:36:21 <graphenehelp[m]> @joll
06:36:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yep?
06:36:57 <graphenehelp[m]> JollyRoger: success :) thanks for your help
06:37:04 <TheJollyRoger> Arr! Welcome aboard the ship! :)
06:37:20 <TheJollyRoger> Don't forget to lock bootloader to complete the install, and you can go and try out attestation.app if you're feeling unlucky today!
06:37:20 <fujita_[m]> hi there im pretty new to riot, does it have a seperate room for help or is everything on the main page
06:37:46 <TheJollyRoger> Hi fujita_[m], at this moment we only have this one channel. If need be we could spin off another one but this is the main channel for discussion and for help. Welcome to it. What can I do for you?
06:39:19 <graphenehelp[m]> Already locked. Thank you so much for what you do for the community
06:39:40 <TheJollyRoger> graphenehelp[m]: Yarr, splice the mainbrace!
06:39:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe, thanks :)!
06:40:06 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just the channel greeter though X3.
06:43:43 <TheJollyRoger> Well, for now. I'm hoping I can learn development and stuff as I go :P.
06:47:30 <fujita_[m]> 9 days ago i made a post a reddit titled: Help with Installation, i tried Daniel's recommandation on Windows 10 but still could not get GrapheneOS to load as it kept booting up as android 10. So i figured might as well give linux a try since i wasnt too familiar with troubleshoot thinking it just copy and pasting the given codes on the terminal after seeing afew youtube vidoes but while flashing my device it was stuck a
06:47:30 <fujita_[m]> <waiting for device> , i couldnt figure out how to flash the the original stock img back and it has been stuck at "can't find a valid operating system"  for the past couple of days .
06:50:21 <dazinism> fujita_: Did you follow the install instructions on grapheneos.org?
06:50:31 <fujita_[m]> not the best decision making there but im really glad to finally move to linux
06:50:53 <fujita_[m]> nope i just followed afew guides on youtube
06:51:31 <dazinism> At any time did you follow any other guides, or try and install any other OS on the phone
06:51:37 <fujita_[m]> since i could not understand some of the terms on the official guide
06:52:06 <dazinism> YouTube guides were specifically for installing graphene?
06:52:33 <fujita_[m]> nope, i have tried to install Graphene about 10 times while on windows
06:52:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hi fujita_[m], let me give you a hand.
06:52:48 <fujita_[m]> yup, only graphen guide
06:52:53 <TheJollyRoger> First off, what operating system are you on?
06:52:56 <TheJollyRoger> What distro?
06:53:32 <fujita_[m]> Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon
06:53:50 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, acknowledged... Alright, if your fastboot is stuck at <waiting for device> then this means your udev rules aren't set properly, but we're going to go over a few ground rules before then.
06:53:59 <TheJollyRoger> First up, did you install adb or fastboot from apt?
06:54:15 <TheJollyRoger> If so, stop right here and don't go further, because that needs to be removed.
06:54:30 <fujita_[m]> i think so
06:54:52 <TheJollyRoger> The version of adb and fastboot shipped in Mint is old, out of date, incorrectly version, and in the worst case, can SOFTBRICK YOUR PHONE, so you must remove them.
06:54:53 <fujita_[m]> but i did reboot mint once
06:55:01 <TheJollyRoger> *incorrectly versioned
06:55:23 <dazinism> adb or fastboot via the mint app store or apt
06:55:38 <TheJollyRoger> So you need to uninstall adb and fastboot via apt first. Don't worry, we will get the official version afterward.
06:55:59 <TheJollyRoger> dazinism: oh whew. I haven't used Mint before you're going to have to help me.
06:56:17 <fujita_[m]> where can  i find it on the system?
06:57:01 <TheJollyRoger> ok, for a quick sanity check, can you run `apt search fastboot` for me?
06:57:03 <fujita_[m]> via the terminal or the app store?
06:57:11 <dazinism> Mmmm... its been a long time.. but many distros have some kind of a GUI app store thing
06:57:24 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know anything about the app store.
06:57:40 <TheJollyRoger> So the only answer is, I think you'll have to check both and make damn well sure it's not installed in either place.
06:58:06 <dazinism> It'll just be a GUI interface to apt
06:58:08 <TheJollyRoger> Old versions of fastboot can brick your device. I think I'm going to have to probably send in some kinda warning.
06:58:11 * fujita_[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/sYlnkhpNyJrNefJMTQfDHkhT >
06:58:15 <TheJollyRoger> dazinism: oh it is? Oh heavens be praised.
06:59:05 * fujita_[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/PZfutHuLCCXXRkwYSHhJQQul >
06:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. fujita_[m] can you do `sudo apt purge android-tools-fastboot`
06:59:35 <TheJollyRoger> and `sudo apt purge android-tools-adb` for me?
07:00:34 <fujita_[m]> Package 'android-tools-adb' is not installed, so not removed
07:00:35 <fujita_[m]> 0 to upgrade, 0 to newly install, 0 to remove and 0 not to upgrade
07:01:02 <TheJollyRoger> ok. Can you try `fastboot` and see if it returns `fastboot: command not found`? If it does, you're in good shape.
07:01:26 <fujita_[m]> yup
07:02:04 <TheJollyRoger> Ok great. Hang on one moment...
07:02:15 <fujita_[m]> Do i grab SDK
07:02:45 <TheJollyRoger> Nope, hang on a moment.
07:03:25 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. The first thing we're going to do is get you the correct platform tools.
07:04:05 <TheJollyRoger> `mkdir -p ~/Applications && cd ~/Applications`
07:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> If that returns you to the prompt in ~/Applications, then run the next thing:
07:04:33 <TheJollyRoger> `wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip`
07:05:01 <fujita_[m]> Dome
07:05:08 <fujita_[m]> Done*
07:05:26 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Is it downloading platform tools?
07:05:40 <fujita_[m]> its in a zip
07:05:58 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. `unzip platform-tools.zip && ls`
07:06:03 <TheJollyRoger> Tell me what it returns.
07:06:24 <TheJollyRoger> Er
07:06:33 <TheJollyRoger> `unzip platform-tools-latest-linux.zip && ls`
07:06:35 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. That one.
07:06:37 <fujita_[m]> unzip platform-tools.zip && ls
07:07:12 <fujita_[m]> alrite
07:07:16 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, I made a mistake: it's
07:07:19 <TheJollyRoger> `unzip platform-tools-latest-linux.zip && ls`
07:07:29 <TheJollyRoger> It should return `platform-tools` as a directory.
07:07:46 <fujita_[m]> platform-tools  platform-tools-latest-linux.zip
07:08:02 <fujita_[m]> thats what it says
07:08:10 <TheJollyRoger> Great, we're looking good... one moment
07:09:38 <TheJollyRoger> `cd platform-tools && export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd) && echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Applications/platform-tools/" >> .bashrc`
07:09:45 <TheJollyRoger> now try `fastboot --version`
07:09:52 <TheJollyRoger> Tell me what it returns.
07:10:52 <fujita_[m]> bash: cd: platform-tools: No such file or directory
07:10:55 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops. I made a mistake
07:11:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, hold it right there.
07:11:42 <fujita_[m]> must i cd to the application first?
07:11:49 <TheJollyRoger> `pwd && ls` what do you see?
07:12:19 <fujita_[m]> Applications  Desktop    Downloads  Music     Public     Videos
07:12:19 <fujita_[m]> Books         Documents  Internet   Pictures  Templates
07:12:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yes `cd Applications && ls`
07:13:02 <TheJollyRoger> Pardon me, it's kinda late.
07:13:04 <fujita_[m]> cd Applications && ls
07:13:13 <fujita_[m]> platform-tools-latest-linux.zip
07:13:14 <TheJollyRoger> In your command shell :)
07:13:22 <fujita_[m]> im at here^
07:13:33 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, do you see a directory called `platform-tools` ?
07:14:51 <fujita_[m]> <TheJollyRoger "`cd platform-tools && export PAT"> do i paste this in now
07:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hold it.
07:15:29 <TheJollyRoger> Do you see a directory called `platform-tools`?
07:15:37 <TheJollyRoger> If you get ahead of me, I'm flying blind.
07:16:11 <TheJollyRoger> I don't have a remote shell to your computer, so I'm entirely reliant on what you tell me.
07:16:31 <TheJollyRoger> Also something I should ask before we do this:
07:16:40 <fujita_[m]> platform-tools-latest-linux.zip
07:16:43 <TheJollyRoger> You are running this natively on hardware, correct, and not in a virtual machine?
07:16:55 <fujita_[m]> yes
07:16:57 <TheJollyRoger> ok `unzip platform-tools-latest-linux.zip`
07:17:13 <TheJollyRoger> Great. And you have a high-quality USB-A to USB-C cable plugged directly into one of the rear ports of your motherboard, not a front port?
07:17:47 <fujita_[m]> replace platform-tools/NOTICE.txt? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename:
07:17:57 <TheJollyRoger> y
07:18:17 <TheJollyRoger> ls
07:20:08 <fujita_[m]>  platform-tools-latest-linux.zip
07:20:17 <fujita_[m]> uhm
07:20:22 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I think you may have skipped a step. We're going to start again.
07:20:35 <fujita_[m]> i opened the application file from folder
07:20:52 <fujita_[m]> and there is an unzipped file
07:20:55 <fujita_[m]> and a zip file
07:21:35 <TheJollyRoger> You know what I'm just going to write you a script.
07:21:39 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a moment.
07:21:41 <fujita_[m]> "platform-tools" and "platform-tools-latest-linux.zip"
07:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. cd to platform-tools
07:22:02 <TheJollyRoger> can you see 'adb' and 'fastboot' in there?
07:22:15 <TheJollyRoger> pwd and get its directory name.
07:22:33 <fujita_[m]> bash: cd: too many arguments
07:22:44 * TheJollyRoger laughs
07:22:46 <TheJollyRoger> Oh cripes, sorry,
07:22:50 <TheJollyRoger> `cd platform-tools`
07:23:04 <TheJollyRoger> My bad, sometimes I use cd as a verb :P.
07:23:18 <TheJollyRoger> Can you see 'adb' and 'fastboot' in there?
07:23:36 <fujita_[m]> no
07:23:50 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. I don't know what on earth you're doing. I'm going to write you a script.
07:23:57 <TheJollyRoger> Sit tight.
07:24:03 <fujita_[m]> ~/applications/platform-tools$
07:24:14 <fujita_[m]> thats whyat it says
07:24:23 <fujita_[m]> really sorry for the trouble
07:24:52 <TheJollyRoger> I'll write you a script. Give me a couple moments.
07:25:17 <TheJollyRoger> Before you do anything. Is fastboot and adb uninstalled? Check, check, and doublecheck.
07:25:48 <fujita_[m]> alrite i will just scroll to the top and past the commands u gave
07:25:58 <TheJollyRoger> No, just sit tight a minute.
07:26:27 <TheJollyRoger> Tell me if there's anything in /etc/udev/rules.d/  ?
07:26:55 <fujita_[m]> nope
07:27:05 <TheJollyRoger> But that directory exists?
07:27:36 <fujita_[m]> 0 to upgrade, 0 to newly install, 0 to remove and 0 not to upgrade
07:27:49 <fujita_[m]> after typing in both the sudo purge
07:28:02 <TheJollyRoger> Ok.
07:30:17 <fujita_[m]> As for the cables i have a [usb-c to usb-c] stock cable and a [usb-a to usb-c] cable
07:30:24 <TheJollyRoger> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peter-Easton/grapheneos-easy-installer/master/prepare-mint.sh Download this, allow it to be run with `chmod u+x prepare-mint.sh` then execute it with `./prepare-mint.sh`
07:30:42 <TheJollyRoger> You may need to reboot after running the script.
07:31:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, use the A to C
07:31:21 <fujita_[m]> by download do you mean paste in the terminal?
07:31:31 <TheJollyRoger> Linux support for USB C on older kernels is broken in wierd ways.
07:31:47 <TheJollyRoger> No hit ctrl-S and save it to your 'Downloads' directory.
07:32:26 <TheJollyRoger> don't run random scripts off the internet. Look through it first to see if it contains anything like "rm -r /" or something.
07:32:43 <TheJollyRoger> I've done my best to make it readabel.
07:32:45 <TheJollyRoger> *readable.
07:33:45 <TheJollyRoger> you'll need to set it to an executable script with `chmod u+x prepare-mint.sh`
07:34:01 <TheJollyRoger> then run it while you're in the working directory with `./prepare-mint.sh`
07:34:07 <fujita_[m]> so i will exit the ~/applications
07:34:44 <TheJollyRoger> It's half past three for me... so after this I have to pile up the Zs.
07:34:58 <JTL> I can read it :p
07:35:11 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Likewise. Sleep well
07:35:16 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks :)
07:35:19 <fujita_[m]> chmod: cannot access 'prepare-mint.sh': No such file or directory
07:35:26 <fujita_[m]> do take a reast
07:35:31 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to be in the directory where prepare-mint.sh is.
07:35:39 <fujita_[m]> i cant do it later
07:35:43 <TheJollyRoger> Where did you save prepare-mint?
07:35:45 <fujita_[m]> can*
07:35:55 <TheJollyRoger> Just let's get this over with.
07:36:07 <TheJollyRoger> use `cd` to change the directory to where you saved `prepare-mint.sh`
07:36:08 <fujita_[m]> downloads
07:36:21 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. use `cd` to change the directory to where you saved `prepare-mint.sh`
07:38:05 <TheJollyRoger> once you can see it with `ls` in the working directory, run `chmod u+x prepare-mint.sh && ./prepare-mint.sh`
07:38:06 <fujita_[m]> alrite the script is running
07:38:09 <TheJollyRoger> Ok.
07:38:10 <fujita_[m]> i will just follow it
07:38:16 <TheJollyRoger> Tell me what it says on exit.
07:38:19 <fujita_[m]> thanks alot
07:38:24 <TheJollyRoger> It may pause for several seconds at a time.
07:38:27 <TheJollyRoger> Depending on what's going on.
07:38:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, no problem :). S'what I'm here for.
07:38:46 <fujita_[m]> You now are ready to download and install GrapheneOS on this operating system.
07:38:46 <fujita_[m]> Follow the instructions on https://grapheneos.org/install#enabling-oem-unlocking
07:38:46 <fujita_[m]> Good luck.
07:38:53 <TheJollyRoger> You made it :)
07:39:10 <TheJollyRoger> The reason why it said "<waiting for device>" at your prompt is because you were missing udev rules.
07:39:13 <fujita_[m]> thats after runnig `chmod u+x prepare-mint.sh && ./prepare-mint.sh`
07:39:26 <TheJollyRoger> Splice the mainbrace! That means it worked!
07:39:42 <TheJollyRoger> The script will automatically download and set those udev rules for you.
07:39:43 <TheJollyRoger> HOWEVER
07:40:14 <TheJollyRoger> You may need to log off, or reboot your PC before they take effect, so if you get <waiting for device> when fastboot tries to run and the phone is connected and powered on to fastboot,
07:40:20 <TheJollyRoger> it may be because they aren't taking effect yet.
07:40:25 <TheJollyRoger> Let's finish this and get you onboard.
07:40:31 <TheJollyRoger> Do you have your phone in your hand?
07:40:38 <fujita_[m]> yes
07:40:40 <TheJollyRoger> It's a 3a or 3?
07:40:45 <fujita_[m]> do you want me to reboot
07:40:47 <fujita_[m]> 3a
07:40:58 <TheJollyRoger> Is OEM unlocking switched on in your developer options?
07:41:22 <TheJollyRoger> Not yet, not just yet.
07:41:34 <TheJollyRoger> Just turn on OEM unlocking.
07:41:45 <fujita_[m]> uhm my phone is in cant find valid OS
07:42:01 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, got it. Turn the phone off and wait one second.
07:42:03 <TheJollyRoger> Now...
07:42:08 <TheJollyRoger> Put your finger on VOLUME_DOWN
07:42:26 <fujita_[m]> yup
07:42:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hold it down tight. Now put your next finger on POWER and hold that down. Wait until the screen comes on.
07:43:03 <TheJollyRoger> It may take up to twelve seconds.
07:43:07 <fujita_[m]> fastboot lock
07:43:14 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, is it on fastboot?+
07:43:16 <TheJollyRoger> Plug it in.
07:43:16 <fujita_[m]> im connecting the phone
07:43:23 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Plug it in!
07:43:39 <TheJollyRoger> now... return to your computer and type in "fastboot --version"
07:43:54 <TheJollyRoger> Tell me what you got.
07:44:28 <fujita_[m]> fastboot flashing unlock?
07:44:34 <fujita_[m]> fastboot --version
07:44:39 <TheJollyRoger> Not yet. "fastboot --version"
07:44:44 <TheJollyRoger> Please don't get ahead of me.
07:44:47 <fujita_[m]> Command 'fastboot' not found, but can be installed with:
07:44:47 <fujita_[m]> sudo apt install fastboot
07:44:50 <TheJollyRoger> If you get ahead of me, you can blindside me.
07:45:04 <TheJollyRoger> And if you blindside me, then I will often give you incorrect information.
07:45:10 <TheJollyRoger> OK. Stop right there.
07:45:39 <TheJollyRoger> run `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/GrapheneOS/platform-tools/`
07:45:46 <fujita_[m]> im in /Downloads on the terminal
07:46:07 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, just run that command `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/GrapheneOS/platform-tools`
07:46:19 <fujita_[m]> done
07:46:30 <TheJollyRoger> now try `fastboot --version`
07:46:50 <TheJollyRoger> We do this check first, because if you use the wrong version of fastboot, this can softbrick your device, as you found out earlier.
07:46:53 <fujita_[m]> fastboot version 30.0.0-6374843
07:46:53 <fujita_[m]> Installed as /home/caiman/GrapheneOS/platform-tools/fastboot
07:47:00 <TheJollyRoger> Great. It's working.
07:47:21 <TheJollyRoger> Now... now is the fun part.
07:47:39 <fujita_[m]> im ready
07:47:48 <TheJollyRoger> Go `cd` to where you've saved the files you downloaded from GrapheneOS.org.
07:48:12 <TheJollyRoger> Have you verified them? If not, I'll walk you through it.
07:49:41 <fujita_[m]> it didnt save the file
07:49:46 <fujita_[m]> i*
07:50:04 <TheJollyRoger> `cd ~/Downloads`
07:50:28 <TheJollyRoger> `mkdir GOS-install/ && cd GOS-install/`
07:51:17 <fujita_[m]> ok
07:51:21 <TheJollyRoger> `wget https://releases.grapheneos.org/factory.pub https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-factory-2020.04.14.23.zip https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-factory-2020.04.14.23.zip.sig`
07:51:28 <TheJollyRoger> And give that a moment to download.
07:51:52 <fujita_[m]> yeah
07:51:54 <TheJollyRoger> Now. Factory.pub is the factory release signing key. We installed Signify when you ran prepare-mint.
07:52:13 <TheJollyRoger> So... I SHOULD NOT tell you what's inside it because you should trust nobody but what you see on your own computer.
07:52:14 <TheJollyRoger> So instead,
07:52:48 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to ask you to run `cat factory.pub` and see what it looks like. You should see some kind of gibberish string.
07:53:38 <TheJollyRoger> Go and visit https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1145259815851253762 The GrapheneOS official Twitter page, https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/c7gb3f/grapheneos_factory_images_are_now_signed_with/esewpm9 the GrapheneOS official Reddit page, https://github.com/GrapheneOS/releases.grapheneos.org/blob/master/static/factory.pub and the Grapheneos Github repo
07:53:55 <TheJollyRoger> And confirm it on https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-factory-images
07:54:00 <TheJollyRoger> All of 'em should match.
07:54:12 <fujita_[m]> cat: factory.pub: No such file or directory
07:54:13 <TheJollyRoger> If you have a VPN, or Tor Browser, repeat that exercise through that.
07:54:39 <TheJollyRoger> `cd ~/Downloads/GOS-install/`
07:54:57 <TheJollyRoger> Are you by any chance opening and closing terminal windows?
07:55:19 <fujita_[m]> nope
07:55:20 <TheJollyRoger> Because if you are, that's going to throw me off
07:55:27 <JTL> > 00:52 <@TheJollyRoger> So... I SHOULD NOT tell you what's inside it because you should trust nobody but what you see on your own computer.
07:55:29 <JTL> On the other hand, you could paste it here and tell them to verify it through other channels as well :)
07:55:51 <fujita_[m]> im still in cd ~/Downloads/GOS-install/
07:55:52 <TheJollyRoger> JTL heh well... I just kinda don't want to accept the responsibility.
07:56:03 <JTL> Fair
07:56:12 <TheJollyRoger> fujita_[m]: what did wget spit out? Is it downloading anything?
07:56:53 <fujita_[m]> Ok im gonna update you on what im seeing
07:57:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah because right now I feel like I'm flying blinfd.
07:57:39 <fujita_[m]> 1) Current on ~/Downloads/GOS-install$:
07:58:33 <fujita_[m]> pasting in "cat factory.pub" shows "cat: factory.pub: No such file or directory"
07:58:49 <TheJollyRoger> Run `ls`
07:58:55 <TheJollyRoger> Has wget completed?
07:59:12 <TheJollyRoger> Wait for wget to complete
07:59:13 <fujita_[m]> factory.txt
07:59:30 <TheJollyRoger> cat factory.txt
08:00:05 <TheJollyRoger> Do you see "Untrusted comment: GrapheneOS factory images public key" and then a jumble of letters like RWQZ... and such beneath it?
08:00:30 <fujita_[m]> got the gibberish string
08:00:40 <TheJollyRoger> Ok great. Go and check those links and see if it matches.
08:00:47 <fujita_[m]> yup
08:01:39 <fujita_[m]> yup it matches the twitter post
08:02:04 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
08:02:08 <TheJollyRoger> How's the download look?
08:02:09 <fujita_[m]> Currently still on ~/Downloads/GOS-install
08:03:06 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Well...
08:03:24 <TheJollyRoger> From here, you've got most of the hardest parts done.
08:03:59 <fujita_[m]> yeah
08:04:10 <fujita_[m]> its just following the instruction now?
08:04:16 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. It's 4 AM though and I'm determined to see this through.
08:04:25 <TheJollyRoger> How's the download look?
08:04:44 <fujita_[m]> i suggest not
08:05:03 <fujita_[m]> its takes pretty long to download
08:05:23 <fujita_[m]>  pls go to sleep i can continue tomorrow
08:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> Okay. Well, quick sanity check...
08:05:49 <TheJollyRoger> can you run `signify` without any commandline arguments?
08:06:08 * JTL offers TheJollyRoger some ice cream
08:06:18 <TheJollyRoger> It should spew out some gibberish that looks like some commandline arguments and pubkey seckey file.
08:06:27 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, thanks.
08:07:38 <TheJollyRoger> Tell me how it looks.
08:08:12 <TheJollyRoger> I just want to make sure you got signify.
08:08:21 <fujita_[m]> im trying to obtain signify
08:08:31 <TheJollyRoger> It should have been included in the script.
08:08:38 <TheJollyRoger> I just want to mak esure it works.
08:08:47 <TheJollyRoger> Please don't get ahead of me, again.
08:08:53 <TheJollyRoger> If you get ahead of me, very likely you WILL throw me off.
08:08:58 <fujita_[m]> is there a code i need to run
08:09:23 <TheJollyRoger> Just please run the command `signify` without any other options and see if it returns anything that's not `command not found`
08:09:25 <fujita_[m]> - still on the same terminal
08:09:44 <fujita_[m]> - currently just downoading the sargo zip file
08:10:00 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. open up another terminal, run `signify` just like that and see what it gets you.
08:10:19 <TheJollyRoger> it might give you some gibberish.
08:10:49 <TheJollyRoger> If not, don't worry about it, verification prior to installing is optional and we can always use auditor to verify it once it's been installed. I just like to have that little assurance going into it.
08:10:55 <fujita_[m]> Command 'signify' not found, but can be installed with:
08:10:55 <fujita_[m]> sudo apt install signify
08:11:13 <TheJollyRoger> ok, nevermind that then, it looks like mint doesn't package signify-openbsd
08:11:40 <TheJollyRoger> Do not install `signify` - it's a different package on any Debian based Linux distribution, and it's a four-year old utility for generating E-mail signatures.
08:11:43 <TheJollyRoger> Not what you need.
08:12:04 <TheJollyRoger> We'll skip the pre-verification install and you'll have to use remote verification post-install.
08:12:09 <TheJollyRoger> So before I head off.
08:12:19 <fujita_[m]> alrite
08:12:54 <TheJollyRoger> Go to https://attestation.app and bookmark that page. You can read the "About" and "Tutorial" sections, which will tell you how the Remote Attestation can verify the device even while it's in your hands.
08:13:10 <fujita_[m]> ok i will
08:13:22 <fujita_[m]> just want to let you know
08:14:08 <fujita_[m]> the Sargo file is currently downloading in /Downloads/GOS-install
08:14:13 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
08:14:34 <TheJollyRoger> You should be able to follow the rest of the instructions from here on how to get it flashed  -- let's do another quick sanity check.
08:14:47 <TheJollyRoger> Open *another* fresh terminal window and in that terminal window type `fastboot --version`
08:15:34 <fujita_[m]> fastboot version 30.0.0-637484
08:15:37 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
08:15:39 <TheJollyRoger> It's working.
08:15:52 <TheJollyRoger> This means your command path is properly set up and ready.
08:15:55 <fujita_[m]> ok thanks alot
08:15:58 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime.
08:16:11 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck :). The rest should be fairly downhill from here.
08:16:12 <fujita_[m]> will update you tomorrow
08:17:10 <fujita_[m]> sleep tight once again thanks for your hardwork
08:17:24 <TheJollyRoger> I'm probably going to put a warning out for Mint users because we'vebeen having a very large number of users install Mint, and then end up battling with Mint when Mint quite helpfully does its best to assume that the user wants to work on 6 year old Android devices.
08:19:07 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome :). Pour yourself a tot of rum, set it aside, and save it for when you see that GrapheneOS logo boot :)
08:20:16 <fujita_[m]> planning to have a bigger celebration than that, its been nearly 2 weeks without a phone
08:20:30 <TheJollyRoger> Aaaargh X(
08:20:32 <TheJollyRoger> That's way too long!
08:20:37 <TheJollyRoger> Well hang in there, land ho! :)
08:20:54 <fujita_[m]> suprisingly great though
08:21:32 <fujita_[m]> my body clock has been reset and i no longer feel the need to constanly check the phone
08:22:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ehehe. No infoglut :)
08:22:59 <fujita_[m]> just wondering
08:23:16 <fujita_[m]> are you a pirate of the sea or the web
08:23:27 <TheJollyRoger> A pirate of the sea! :)
08:23:38 <TheJollyRoger> To be precise, a pirate of the high seas of the web :D
08:23:52 <fujita_[m]> XD
08:24:03 <fujita_[m]> Aye
08:24:19 <fujita_[m]> Ahoy, Matey
08:24:22 <TheJollyRoger> Pour yourself 1/8 a pint of a strong rum like Kraken Black Spiced Rum or Wray & Nephew Overproof, then dilute it with about 1/4 cup of water, squeeze a dash of lime in there, and you have grog :)
08:24:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yo-ho, shipmate :D
08:24:41 <TheJollyRoger> And then you can splice the mainbrace when you finish the install :)
08:24:46 <TheJollyRoger> (Don't forget to lock the bootloader)
08:24:55 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, I best be off, arr ^_^.
08:25:06 <fujita_[m]> arr
08:25:17 <fujita_[m]> yup i will
08:27:09 <fujita_[m]> Too cheap for rum
08:28:38 <fujita_[m]> where im from 500ml beer cost $7 USD
10:43:03 <mischling[m]> test
11:44:47 <mxnorvak[m]> How should the sealed sender portion of signal be configured ?
11:58:04 <bablux[m]> Hi, anybody use seedvault ? (backup feature of grapheneos)
11:59:39 <renlord> yes
11:59:47 <renlord> bablux[m]: ^
12:00:18 <renlord> backup (provider) for grapheneos
12:00:45 <bablux[m]> cool, so, i got questions:
12:01:19 <bablux[m]> I just try it, first, i search how to backup on my seafile instance,  i see no picker selector to choose an external storage other than an USB key
12:01:47 <renlord> bablux[m]: because there's no external storage besides that on the pixel
12:01:51 <bablux[m]> also, i so my try on internal, what mean the error i got, seems like some app can't be backup, but i can't find an explain
12:01:57 <renlord> you can use something like nextcloud
12:02:19 <renlord> bablux[m]: apps that dont implement the backup api cant be backed up
12:02:33 <bablux[m]> yes, in my case, i use seafile, it like nextcloud,
12:03:01 <bablux[m]> but with only storage feature, i got my own instance, and so in other app, i can without problem write my data in my seafile storage
12:03:20 <bseeinu[m]> 1. Can I run Auditor on a Nexus 6P (Auditor) and Pixel 3 (auditee)?
12:03:20 <bseeinu[m]> 2. If when one starts using those the system has already been tampered with, will that reflect it or not since it already happened?
12:03:53 <bablux[m]> i have just open an issue on seedvault about this, because i was not sure if its an grapheneos integration problem, or seedvault that as only support nextcloud
12:03:57 <renlord> bablux[m]: what do you mean by 'in other app,....'
12:04:25 <renlord> seedvault supports any other storage backend that exposes the intents required to store backups
12:04:30 <bablux[m]> for example, my otp app, "andOTP", i can backup my config on seafile
12:04:52 <renlord> does andOTP actually implement the backup api?
12:05:08 <cx2[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "How should the sealed sender por"> Doing some REALLY quick reading.... it would seem that allowing for everyone makes sense? I don't know what the disadvantage would be
12:06:22 <bablux[m]> idk renlord (when i said "my", i mean otp app i use, not i dev :))
12:06:37 <bablux[m]> how can i check this ?
12:06:40 <renlord> bablux[m]: you need to check. I dont use andotp
12:20:40 <renlord> bablux[m]: are you using v0.7.0?
12:21:14 <renlord> Improvement: Enable Android backup by default (Issue #341, PR #342 by @RichyHBM)
12:21:20 <renlord> apparently its a recent feature
12:21:41 <bablux[m]> of which app ? seafile?
12:21:46 <renlord> andotp
12:21:48 <bablux[m]> my seafile app version if 2.2.25
12:22:02 <bablux[m]> ha :)
12:22:34 <bablux[m]> so, this mean, if andOTP can see my seafile, SeedVault need to also enable Android Backup ?
12:22:53 <renlord> no
12:23:42 <renlord> seedvault is the provider for android backup, but apps need to implement the backup api so they can get backed up using android backup
12:23:50 <renlord> andotp implemented this in v0.7.0
12:24:04 <renlord> can you confirm that you are using v0.7.0?
12:24:23 <renlord> backing up to seafile is a different api and intent afaik
12:24:32 <bablux[m]> ha mannnn,, i catch you
12:24:38 <bseeinu[m]> Any other launcher considered light, safe, and battery wise? Or just default?
12:24:50 <bablux[m]> yes i use the last one so i think 0.7.0
12:25:00 <renlord> can you check in appinfo?
12:25:19 <renlord> if it does not work, please capture traces and then report to #seedvault
12:25:36 <bablux[m]> yes 0.7.0
12:25:54 <renlord> run 1 more time and if it does not work, please report to #seedvault
12:26:13 <bablux[m]> so, i as said, i catch you about problem from app that can't being backup BY seedvault
12:26:18 <bablux[m]> i understand that the app need backup api to be backup
12:27:12 <bablux[m]> and so, you start to tell, about the fact that seedvault CAN'T see my seafile storage, and so put the backup in my seafile storage
12:27:48 <bablux[m]> its another problem? i as said also, for example, in my file browser, or other app that can storage file, i see my seafile storage in the storage picker,
12:27:57 <bablux[m]> but not in seedvault so
12:30:03 <renlord> do you have password enabled on seafile?
12:30:19 <renlord> if you do, can you try turning it off and see if seedvaults picks it up
12:30:52 <renlord> seems to be an issue affecting nextcloud also, when you have password turned on, seedvault cant pick up that storage backend.
12:31:46 <bablux[m]> ha let me try
12:32:34 <bablux[m]> hmm no, i have no password when i open the app, nor fingerprint needd
12:32:34 <nscnt> bseeinu[m]: Would any other launcher have features that you feel are missing in the stock launcher? Otherwise I would just stick to the stock one.
12:33:05 <bablux[m]> there is also a "gesture lock" feature, but turnoff
12:35:16 <renlord> no idea
12:35:39 <renlord> bablux[m]: you should open an issue on seedvault and ask them
12:38:37 <bablux[m]> ok renloard, i have done it, thanks you :)
12:45:29 <dazinism> When you have a password or fingerprint set to access Nextcloud you dont see them in the GrapheneOS Files browser
12:46:07 <dazinism> My guess is that Seafile isnt using Storage Access Framework properly
12:46:32 <dazinism> bablux: ^
12:47:53 <dazinism> If you could see them in the Files browser it would be a way around the locked access - make the lock pointless
12:47:56 <bablux[m]> https://github.com/stevesoltys/seedvault/issues/84
12:48:32 <bablux[m]> my issue is here, if you can help on this one btw the way with your maybe more explained idea
12:49:00 <bablux[m]> I was preparing me to try to install a nextcloud to validate this one is ok
12:49:42 <bablux[m]> dazinism: dont sure you catch me, i see my seafile storage in the file browser
12:50:25 <bablux[m]> but i canT see a file browser selector in the seedvault, just "internal" , "usb" and i understand if i install nextcloud and set it up, i should be able to see "nextcloud" also
13:01:20 <dazinism> bablux: yeah, you'll see nextcloud as an option there
13:02:55 <bablux[m]> its overkill for my usage :/ i already use mailcow for example for my contact or calendar, and when i study the seafile solution, its was better for the storage goal
13:04:38 <dazinism> Nextcloud only recently included the necessary stuff for seedvault to work there.
13:06:24 <dazinism> If I remember right it was one of the seedvault devs who made the modifications to nextcloud
13:06:31 <bablux[m]> can you give me the PR maybe for this ? i can put this in a seafile server issue maybe and cross link the PR
13:07:37 <bablux[m]> good, so i just need to wait for a reply on my issue?
13:07:42 <bablux[m]> if you read it and not clear tell me, im not so much easy in english
13:12:02 <dazinism> Yeah I'll have a look and dig out the PR
13:14:43 <bablux[m]> 👍️
13:18:55 <dazinism> bablux: commented on your issue
13:24:31 <bablux[m]> thx man 🙂
13:46:31 <bseeinu[m]> Absolutely nothing necessary. Removing icon labels on the home screen when it's on portrait mode just like when it's on landscape. Not gonna risk a totally different launcher for that unless there's a safe and widely used solution/equivalent
13:55:36 <mxnorvak[m]> cx2 : yea i guess so
13:57:04 <cx2[m]> mxnorvak: You could individually verify contacts....but I don't know about you, the moment I don't have random / shady characters attempting to contact me.
14:02:33 <mxnorvak[m]> I haven't had that issue so far
14:03:56 <mxnorvak[m]> what's recomened as an office app for opening and creating word,ppt and excel files
14:04:41 <mxnorvak[m]> Libre office viewer looks as if its not being maintained and well its just a viwer
14:05:11 <mxnorvak[m]> Its last update was for a year ago
14:06:00 <mxnorvak[m]> And there doesn't seem to be any other option available, at least not in f-droid
14:07:10 <mxnorvak[m]> The same goes for file snanner that automatically convert it to a pdf ,i couldn't find any good option in f-droid
14:38:35 <bablux[m]> guy, another topic, do you use aurora droid and aurora store? together?
15:10:21 <bseeinu[m]> Fdroid and aurora store
15:10:24 <bseeinu[m]> Love the exodus adtrackers report
15:10:31 <bseeinu[m]> Actually love their app too
15:11:11 <brenneke[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "what's recomened as an office ap"> I personally have used these apps for some time, unfortunately not from F-Droid:
15:14:51 * brenneke[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XhAsYkchTEemOfybXNVPCwcp >
15:17:46 <dazinism> I tried out Collabora for office docs, appears OK. Took away its network permission and still functions OK
15:18:40 <dazinism> Got it via Aurora store. Its a split apk so
15:20:02 <dazinism> Had to use SAI https://f-droid.org/app/com.aefyr.sai.fdroid to install
15:20:48 <dazinism> Although possibly Aurora can now install split apk?
15:22:17 <dazinism> Or am I imagining that?
15:31:14 <mxnorvak[m]> I installed Collabora office from Aurora and it worked fine but i remember it was still on beta and i didnt know what that could mean for furthur usage so i didnt really spend much time on it
15:35:30 <mxnorvak[m]> brenneke : yeah unfortunately some apps don't have good alternatives and i appart from scanning it for trackers and payin attention to the permissions it needs, there's not much i can do to know if its trustworthy, like if it targets the correct API or if the developer has a good history  privacy/security wise
15:36:13 <mxnorvak[m]> But tbh this could also be told about F-droid apps as well
15:37:48 <cx2[m]> I had an issue with F-Droid telling me that nearly every app targeted an "older version of Android".... Keep in mind I don't really install a lot of apps, and the ones that I do, are strictly the ones that are updated regularly.... Simple apps suite, Etar, EteSync, and the like.
15:38:26 <mxnorvak[m]> Maybe they have better permission models but the rest is just the false assumption of FOSS = better security and privacy
15:38:34 <cx2[m]> I guess that's a bit dramatic.... "some" apps would say they targeted an older version of android.
15:41:04 <mxnorvak[m]> Hmm, i use simple apps from f-droid, well not all of em and i haven't ever had this issue
15:45:15 <bablux[m]> bseeinu:  i was asking this, because, sometimes, there is like conflict between app that can be un aurora droid (or fdroid) and aurora store
16:09:51 <bseeinu[m]> True
16:17:53 <fll[m]> bablux: usually aurora/play has the more up to date version
16:19:49 <bablux[m]> fll do you use microG service core ?
16:20:05 <bablux[m]> i got doubt also, because in aurora store, i can udnerstand that he want to replace my microG buy the true play service core
16:20:09 <fll[m]> No
16:20:50 <fll[m]> You can blacklist apps in aurora though
16:21:18 <bablux[m]> yes i just discover that !
16:21:39 <bablux[m]> thx
16:22:33 <bablux[m]> and what about several profile (like default work profile), do we need a aurora/store/droid by profil or when we update in the main profile this update in the other, i think its totally seperate but not sure
16:23:25 <fll[m]> In general though, if an app is available on both I use Aurora to have more up to date versions
16:25:03 <fll[m]> Apk is only installed once on the phone but I think the user storage of one app is separated per profile
16:25:20 <fll[m]> But I don't know
16:28:27 <bablux[m]> ok 🙂 thansk, will study this a little more ;)
16:29:21 <bablux[m]>  * ok 🙂 thanks, will study this a little more ;)
17:37:27 <cx2[m]> can anyone recommend a decent app lock? For journaling as an example, it's nothing wildly sensitive, but i'd rather not give free access to family/friends to my daily thoughts.
17:50:39 <gervarouge[m]> <cx2[m] "can anyone recommend a decent ap"> Profiles
17:51:17 <cx2[m]> Clever response. Not an app though, is it?
17:51:20 <gervarouge[m]> No stronger lock. It will even stand up to cold boot attacks if you didn't unlock it on a reboot
17:51:50 <gervarouge[m]> Profile with your note apps and a unique Lock password is your only safe option
17:52:05 <gervarouge[m]> <cx2[m] "Clever response. Not an app thou"> You don't want to give that much power to an app
17:52:10 <gervarouge[m]> It has full control of your device
17:52:36 <gervarouge[m]> Even if it's open source and built from said source on your machine after a review. The risk of an exploit against it by an app you have installed is to high
17:52:45 <gervarouge[m]> Profiles are the app you are looking for
17:54:02 <cx2[m]> I understand all of the above.... which is why I was asking for a recommended one, i.e. something that doesn't require those permissions.... I didn't know if one existed. The use case would be purely for a cursory search.
17:55:04 <TheJollyRoger> cx2[m]: use a profile.
17:55:08 <gervarouge[m]> I have one idea, but it's really crazy and has a slew of issues
17:55:28 <TheJollyRoger> Drag down the top and add another one, then you can have a separate space for it.
17:55:46 <gervarouge[m]> VirtualApp, but that's crap. It could be modified to do what you are looking for without permissions I guess. I wouldn't do it though
17:55:50 <gervarouge[m]> Tons of issues with that
17:57:23 <cx2[m]> I wonder if within a profile, I can have the same signal account as the main profile.... I tend to compose some lengthy texts via text editor on my machine.... so i'ts handy to haves a notes app that I have syncing in the back ground via Syncthing, then simply copy paste.
17:57:53 <gervarouge[m]> Would be much easier to make your own notes app that locks its self and encrypts
17:58:26 <gervarouge[m]> Maybe even through in some Titan M compatibility 😆😆😆 for ultimate security
17:59:21 <gervarouge[m]> cx2: use a notes app with a pin lock that's different then your main one. Or be sane and not give your phone to people you already said you don't trust
17:59:44 <cx2[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Would be much easier to make you"> haha... well it's pretty likely that if I  COULD do that, I probably wouldn't have posed the question in the first place..... dang brain only able to process so many things
18:01:18 <gervarouge[m]> Haha
18:02:03 <cx2[m]> <gervarouge[m] "cx2: use a notes app with a pin "> See therin lies the problem.... I have standard notes...but more and more it's become irritating. I opted to support / pay for the 5 year option.... and now it just crashes constantly, doesn't have an offline editor access for mobile, etc.
18:02:07 <gervarouge[m]> You can give other people their own profile
18:02:18 <gervarouge[m]> People you don't trust shouldn't be on your owner profile
18:02:41 <nscnt> cx2[m]: "Offline edit access"?
18:02:44 <cx2[m]> the one i WANT to use, Joplin, used to have an app lock . few years back if i remember correctly but no longer does.
18:02:44 <nscnt> *editor
18:02:55 <nscnt> cx2[m]: I don't have these issues.
18:03:37 <nscnt> cx2[m]: Standard Notes can be used offline and is lockable.
18:03:48 <nscnt> Encrypted if wanted.
18:04:32 <cx2[m]> <nscnt "cx2: "Offline edit access"?"> Yeahhhh their "editors" are third party.... and the only one that I want is their markdown editor The problem is, you can't use it without a connection..... yet another issue I have with them.
18:04:54 <nscnt> You can't use the third-party ones offline?
18:05:09 <cx2[m]> Not on mobile
18:05:14 <nscnt> Yea, could be. I don't use them.
18:05:22 <cx2[m]> <nscnt "cx2: Standard Notes can be used "> Correct. On desktop. However, offline access on mobile is not possibile if it's anything other than the 3 (not great) editors that SN built themselves.
18:05:23 <cx2[m]> "Not yet.."
18:05:50 <Zenithium[m]> cx2: This might seem like a stupid suggestion but if the people that you hand your phone over are not tech-savvy you could just hide the apps you want in the app menu, I doubt they would go around looking for it
18:07:03 <cx2[m]> But this goes bring up a good quiestion... or at least what I would consider a good question. To your point gervarouge and TheJollyRoger : I have every intention of setting up a profile for other users. Especially those that I would like to get on the GrapheneOS train. If I install some of the same apps that I have in the owner profile, is that in effect installing the app twice, and in turn taking up twice the disk space?
18:07:56 <cx2[m]> <Zenithium[m] "cx2: This might seem like a stup"> Not stupid at all, and a great point. I need to toy with it though as I have seemingly hidden apps from myself 😒
18:10:33 <cx2[m]> <cx2[m] "But this goes bring up a good qu"> I have noticed that I have the option to uninstall an app "For all users".... This would make me believe that an app is only install once and sort of symlinked to other profiles?
18:12:32 <nscnt> cx2[m]: The apks are "shared" I think
18:13:44 <cx2[m]> #magic
18:16:55 <Zenithium[m]> <cx2[m] "But this goes bring up a good qu"> AFAIK it's just one app and the profiles just have different user data for the app (you can see it in the settings for the app: App size, User data, Cache, Total)
18:25:08 <cx2[m]> Just looked.... that would make sense. Would also make sense that this is why apps need to be the same version across profiles
18:37:29 <mxnorvak[m]> How are we supposed to update apps that are installed in different profiles?
18:37:33 <mxnorvak[m]> I mean lets say i have f-droid installed in 3 profiles
18:37:37 <mxnorvak[m]> Updating one would result is the version not matching with the 2 other
18:37:41 <mxnorvak[m]> And it'd probably not get installed right?
18:38:03 <mxnorvak[m]> Result in*
18:38:35 <yekip[m]> Looks like lots of new faces in here, hoping that means the insanity going on lately has pushed people to discover the wonders of Graphene OS :)
18:38:41 <yekip[m]> hoorah
18:38:53 <yekip[m]> I haven't played with profiles yet so can't help. that reminds me to do that though
18:40:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Anyone had an issue where their APN radio button ("bubble") keeps going null ("getting unselected")?
18:40:52 <yekip[m]> anyone know if this works to record calls on Graphene? https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.callrecorder/
18:41:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> APN = Verizon, AT&T, etc

18:44:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Perhaps TheJollyRoger or strcat has seen this before? =]
18:48:37 <TheJollyRoger> Hi DannyWorkOrderPr, I haven't noticed this issue.
18:50:44 <gervarouge[m]> <cx2[m] "Just looked.... that would make "> Yeah apps are universal they just exist in the profile or not. That's why you can't fully remove gapps from a stock Android phone, but disabling it is completely effective
18:54:41 <yekip[m]> i am used to iphone synced to my desktop mac. so for example Contacts - I can update those with keyboard on desktop and it syncs to phone when i plug it in (i dont use cloud). Is there any way to do similar with Graphene? Assuming not but checking before I sit tapping for next two hours to set up all contacts!
18:56:22 <strcat[m]> just plug a keyboard into the phone
18:56:25 <strcat[m]> use the adaptor
18:56:28 <strcat[m]> it supports keyboard and mouse
18:57:24 <yekip[m]> haha, never even thought of using a keybaord. use what adapter? graphene didn't send me a dongle of any kind. tssk.

18:58:14 <TheJollyRoger> yekip[m]: heh, turn the box your Pixel 3 came in upside down and give it a good shake. There should be a small white adapter underneath the cardboard tray your phone came in.
18:58:21 <yekip[m]> not sure what that is. but i have an old bluetooth keyboard, that may work?

18:58:57 <yekip[m]>  * hahahaha. i see, said the blind man. thanks JR
18:58:58 <TheJollyRoger> Be very careful, it's smaller than a house key so don't lose it. If you do lose it though, you can buy generic ones at the electronics store and they should work.
18:59:19 <yekip[m]> hehe. no probs
18:59:26 <yekip[m]> <TheJollyRoger "yekip: heh, turn the box your Pi"> hahahaha. i see, said the blind man. thanks JHR
19:00:24 <yekip[m]> i dont actually have one but have a feeling 'someone' round here may have half-inched it
19:00:54 <yekip[m]> is it the adapter, USB-C one end, USB-A female the other?
19:01:03 <cdesai> yes
19:01:05 <yekip[m]> i have the 3.5mm adapter. can't find a keyboard with 3.5mm plug. dammit. ;-)
19:03:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > I seem to be having issues getting the LTE to turn on, even though other cellular is working just fine.
19:03:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Wondering if maybe something went wrong during radio firmware flashing? But am assuming a flag would have been thrown, if that was the case, right?
19:06:09 <TheJollyRoger> yekip[m]: yeah, the adapter is USB-C male, but USB-A female. You can plug your USB keyboard into it, and then plug the other end into your cellphone. If you lost the original dongle, never fear, you can find them at most computer stores for around seven or so bucks on a good day.
19:06:19 <TheJollyRoger> Or just order from the internet.
19:07:52 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderPr: Yeah, it might be that LTE is spotty in your area, even. I know that sometimes when I ride in the subway, my phone falls back to 3G because there is no service except for 3G routers down there.
19:08:26 <TheJollyRoger> Or if I'm out of town.
19:09:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Definitely considered this - the other identical phone hitting the same towers is doing okay, though 🙃
19:26:39 <TheJollyRoger> That's bizarre!
19:35:19 <yzernik> Hi everyone. Does anyone know the best way to buy a sim card anonymously? I prefer to not go into a store now because of lockdown.
19:36:27 <yzernik> I already bought a sim card from T-Mobile, but the website is requiring me to enter my information to activate it
19:42:10 <yzernik> I would like to pay using bitrefill if possible and avoid linking my credit card
19:52:14 <DannyWorkOrderPr> For sure. Dialed a carrier * code, and it "reprogrammed" and got me 3G (better than nothing for now!), so thinking it was carrier issue, but...fuckin odd.
19:53:50 <yekip[m]> or to put that another way, if you're in the UK, I can make suggestions
19:54:02 <yekip[m]> which country are you in?
19:54:07 <yekip[m]> Or i could just post you one ;)
19:57:21 <mischling[m]> talking about the otg usbc adapter, mine stays snugly at the end of a small usb stick, attached to my keychain.
19:59:09 <mischling[m]> that way i have it with me at all times. i also have a small usb a to microusb that i use along with otg to sideload books to my always offline kindle.

20:05:03 <yekip[m]> ah. otg, thats me educated. tahnks
20:07:01 <mischling[m]> you can also connect a a usb cable to it and another phone and copy or delete files
20:09:11 <yekip[m]> you can move files between phones that way?
20:09:15 <yekip[m]> that surprises me
20:10:05 <yekip[m]> this is all new to me. only phone experience i have is with iphones synced with my desktop iMac, which was very convenient and i am struggling a bit with changinhg to graphene. I wish there was a way to plug pixel into computer and it takes a full backup image, or even just a way to backup photos easily. Someone mentioned Nextcloud so I will see if I can suss something with that
20:11:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <yekip[m] "that surprises me"> Freedom™︎. Enjoy it.
20:11:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> There is a backup utility embedded into Graphene, depending on what you're trying to back up
20:12:14 <mischling[m]> apple is a helluva drug man :)))
20:13:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Contacts can also be synced with something like DavX on phone <-> CalDav account (I like KolabNow for this, albeit, much more expensive than competitors, it will provide you with the desktop interface you're "used to" for editing/creating)
20:13:07 <mischling[m]> not even joking. took me a few years to get rid of it.
20:14:28 <DannyWorkOrderPr> yekip: Highly recommend you check out those two. davx^5 or whatever they call it these days (green icon), and a cheap CalDav server (self-hosted or paid for) will be perfect for you.
20:17:20 <mischling[m]> <yekip[m] "this is all new to me. only phon"> there is a easier way. no server and hosting bullshit. you install an app to your phone and one to your computer. then you select one or many folders to sync. open source direct connection no sercers or accounts. look for syncthing on fdroid.
20:17:37 <bablux[m]> For mail and caldav carddav server there is the excellent mailcow.email project
20:20:42 <yekip[m]> sry, puter crashed. back reading
20:20:57 <yekip[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Freedom™︎. Enjoy it."> He says during lockdown :D
20:21:36 <mischling[m]> i sync my pictures and, txt notes and encypted keepass database
20:21:47 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "there is a easier way. no server"> now THAT sounds like what I am lookig for!
20:21:56 <yekip[m]> hosting servers and stuff, me? forget it :D
20:23:30 <yekip[m]> whats caldav, sounds calendary? i dont care about calendars really, just contacts and photos mainly, music also maybe. I am bvery much a phone user, as opposed to most people's use of smartphones as computers. I do 99% of stuff on a desktop computer. phone is mainly for phon calls, messaging, music/youtube (entertainment), and maybe a few files here and there but i doubt it. images/videos and music is about all i need to
20:23:30 <yekip[m]> "sync", and that would be nice as i hate losing photos. with my iphone i have a dock on desk, stick it on and it syncs up to copmuter itunes backup. Dont get me wrong, I am not trying to ask Graphene to compete with apple shit. if i wanted that I wouldn't be enjoying smashing the hellout of my iphone. I detest it! But yes, I am a bit drugged t o the convenience of no hands backups
20:24:32 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "i sync my pictures and, txt note"> that sounds great. i intend to use BitWarden, so would be nice to be able to sync that, plus pics/media on phone. if i could do that i would be cooking with gas
20:24:46 <yekip[m]> do you remember name of app you use for the syncing?
20:25:47 <yekip[m]> i am also gonna look at graphene backup utility again. JR kindly explained (hurriedly as I only had a few mins) how it works, and whilst it is impressive and great from a security standpoint, I dont see me being up to it for a while. just so little time. this is why i have had a graphene phone on my desk for like 3-6 MONTHS and STILL not used it yet, still running iphone! I just need to switch over, maybe forego a bit of
20:25:47 <yekip[m]> security for convenience for now, and learn to improve it over next 6 months as time allows
20:26:24 <nscnt> mxnorvak[m]: Profiles share the android application package (apk) of one app. If you update one, the app in all profiles are updated. On Android you can't downgrade and that's why some people run into the issue that they can't install the app in the second profile, because they try to install a version older than the one that's already installed.
20:26:37 <mischling[m]> for youtube try Syncthing | Downloads
20:26:37 <mischling[m]> https://syncthing.net/downloads/
20:26:56 <mischling[m]> that is the app. for youtube try newpipe
20:27:19 <mischling[m]> it has audio and video downloads and backgroud playback
20:27:31 <yekip[m]> sorry, not sure what you mean. i dont need to sync any YT stuff
20:27:50 <yekip[m]> ah yes, i have newpipe on it. that will be my YT client (or just invidious in browser).
20:29:28 <yekip[m]> i am ok with using the phone, its the backing up issue thats slowing me down from diving full on into it. basically...... if i have a few days of photos on the phone, i wnat to be able to quickly plug it in and have those images on my computer backed up. i suppose i could do that with just importing to my photo library like it's an external hard drive. duh. this is what i mean! so used to apple, the idea of plugging in a
20:29:29 <yekip[m]> "phone" and it being seen as a hard drive, haha. thats weird to me. which is ridiculous :D
20:30:30 <nscnt> yekip[m]: You can back up photos.
20:30:42 <mischling[m]> with this you can do it automatically and wirelessly

20:32:01 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "with this you can do it automati"> ah i see. never used cloud services at all. but i could be pushed into it, if it was fairly private and secure.

20:33:28 <nscnt> yekip[m]: I misunderstood your messages, yea.
20:34:06 <yekip[m]> i think someone above asked about taking a full image of their phone, like a complete backup. not sure i would want that, but if anyone knows if it's doable, please shout

20:35:17 <mischling[m]> not on graphene as it would be a big security risk.

20:37:40 <MadCamel> stupid question that's surprisingly hard to find on the website/github: What version of AOSP is grapheneos based on? 9? 10?

20:38:49 <mxnorvak[m]> nscnt : thanks :)
20:39:00 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "it kind of was possible on a roo"> ah yes, i heard about that way back. that was in the days when I thought LineageOS would protect me :D
20:39:11 <yekip[m]> before one very drunk sailor came along and educated me. :D
20:39:15 <nscnt> Syncthing itself isn't a backup btw. Backups are something different than to synchronize.
20:39:16 <yekip[m]> he knows who he is, but I wont mention his name to wake him from his slumber.
20:39:45 <nscnt> than to *just synchronize
20:40:01 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "you can backup internal storage "> so it sounds like syncthing only backs up the storage inside the phone, but not the apps. is that right?
20:40:28 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Right. It syncs data.
20:40:57 <yekip[m]> so in practice, what stuff would it 'backup'?
20:41:19 <mischling[m]> backup – one who supports or reinforces another: I’m his backup; (computers) a copy or duplicate version of a file, program, or computer system: I made a backup of the file.
20:41:21 <yekip[m]> photos? contacts? (dont think so), what about email account settings? obviuosly i doubt it, but just in case it does
20:42:16 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Example to show the opposite: If your data gets deleted or encrypted by a milicious application, have fun with all of your synced files.
20:42:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Syncthing+DecSync is awesome
20:43:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If you trust yourself to make proper local backups of the files/have enough devices
20:43:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> And you trust Syncthing
20:44:14 <nscnt> yekip[m]: All text files, photos, pdfs, ... You could export your contact list regularly in the folder that gets synced, too.
20:44:17 <yekip[m]> i dont trust myself at all to do anthing manually, basically
20:44:18 <yekip[m]> i dont understand that
20:44:46 <yekip[m]> so i have to hand over trust. i am happy to trust syncthing. but not sure its simple enough for me to use to be honest
20:44:53 <mischling[m]> true that. weekly backups on an external media are a must
20:44:57 <yekip[m]> just reading the site now
20:45:03 <yekip[m]> has a MacOS version, which is good. but will need to play with it to see if its in my abilities to set up syncing of certain things on phone
20:45:52 <nscnt> yekip[m]: When I was completely new to Syncthing I honestly had a hard time. But looking back now I don't know why. You just need to understand its concept once.
20:45:53 <mischling[m]> i jusr sync all the memory
20:45:53 <yekip[m]> <nscnt "yekip: All text files, photos, p"> that sounds good. so there's a folder on the pixel i will choose to sync?
20:46:04 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "true that. weekly backups on an "> i dont understand what you mean by "have fun with all of your synced files". If they were synced yesterday, and today my phone is stolen, what "fun" would I have? Surely I would just have the files?
20:46:16 <nscnt> yekip[m]: You can choose which folders will be synced. Can be 1 or more.
20:46:33 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "i jusr sync all the memory"> there's no command line needed for this, is that right?
20:46:50 <nscnt> yekip[m]: It could be one big folder with everything or seperate folder like one for photos, documents, etc.
20:47:27 <yekip[m]> so you haev to create these folders?
20:47:39 <yekip[m]> i wouldnt have a clue how to create a folder on a phone :D
20:47:44 <yekip[m]> i will need to install and see if my head explodes.
20:47:56 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Or you choose a folder to be synced that already exists.
20:48:10 <yekip[m]> wish me luck!
20:48:19 <mischling[m]> <yekip[m] "i dont understand what you mean "> he means that if a virus encrypts your files then the app syncs them to the pc and overwrites the good ones
20:48:28 <nscnt> Right
20:48:43 <nscnt> As an example
20:49:04 <mischling[m]> <yekip[m] "there's no command line needed f"> no just select the base folder
20:49:11 <nscnt> Or if you accidentally delete files, you should be quick to disable internet lol
20:49:23 <yekip[m]> ah! thanks. so whats the mitigation for that?
20:49:53 <yekip[m]> whats the base folder, does it have a standard name?
20:50:44 <nscnt> Sync is the standard folder
20:50:50 <yekip[m]> haha, i see!
20:51:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <yekip[m] "so i have to hand over trust. i "> Doubtful. If not, probably fire up the iPhone again ;D
20:52:10 <mischling[m]> i keep the router plug at hand so i can quickly yank it just for this situation :)))
20:52:33 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "i keep the router plug at hand s"> I am always ready to yank mine too
20:53:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If not DecSync, how are you guys handling making the file that Syncthing synchronizes? Manually?
20:53:20 <yekip[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Doubtful. If not, probably fire "> hahaha. no chance. i would rather risk losing data
20:53:37 <nscnt> DannyWorkOrderPr: You mean backing up the synced files?
20:55:14 <yekip[m]> woah. i installed syncthing on mac. no app to speak off, then saw a little icon in menu bar at top. clcked that, hit "open" and it opened a browser on local ip address. is that normal?
20:55:26 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Yes
20:55:48 <nscnt> It just has a web ui
20:56:29 <yekip[m]> cool. so you didn't just walk me into a bear trap and steal all my animal porn?
20:56:49 <nscnt> oof
20:56:50 <yekip[m]> 😋
20:57:16 <mischling[m]> <yekip[m] "😋"> drugs, animal porn. you need jesus son

20:58:33 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "drugs, animal porn. you need jes"> found him, but he ran off to hide again
20:59:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nscnt "Danny@WorkOrderPro: You mean bac"> The usecase we're discussing is backing up yekip's contacts etc. What is hypothetically being used to make the backup file of the contacts/calendar etc that he/she is trying to sync/backup with Syncthing?

20:59:28 <yekip[m]> he's got a fireandbrimstonewall

21:00:00 <mischling[m]> terry makes sure god doesn't get hacked
21:00:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, if you're doing it via Contacts->Manual Export/Import, that's fuckin annoying (especially across multiple devices)
21:00:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> DecSync seems to fit the bill for this.
21:00:35 <analogpathy[m]> <mischling[m] "terry makes sure god doesn't get"> His Holy Internet cannot reach to the peasant internet so he can't maintain TempleOS for peasants now
21:00:37 <analogpathy[m]> you have to be an angel to get those patches
21:00:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> (single user synchronization, not multiple)
21:01:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TempleOS is kind of a masterpiece, jokes aside.
21:01:14 <yekip[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Yeah, if you're doing it via Con"> at this point i was kinda asuming i will have to give that up, contact syncing. i can live with that. most people i dont know i am happy to forget anyway :-D

21:02:00 <mischling[m]> terry was an autistic genius
21:02:03 <yekip[m]> i use LittleSnitch on mac. It denied incoming connection from syncthing. not sure if i should overturn that denial and allow it, anyone know/\
21:03:10 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <yekip[m] "at this point i was kinda asumin"> Am confused at what you're trying to accomplish then, lol
21:03:10 <yekip[m]> so, i downloaded syncthing on mac. now i need to do same on Graphene, from Fdroid maybe? then try to set up a synced folder?
21:03:23 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Not sure what the connection is about. But noone could do anything without your confirmation like starting to syncronize a new folder to a device or smth
21:03:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yes, follow a guide/read their docs. Long story short, you have to tell each peer about the others.
21:04:06 <yekip[m]> hehe. well, ifthat could be accomplished, that would be good. but i was getting impresion its not. but either way, it would be nice to backup music/video/photos, and maybe other files i might download
21:04:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <yekip[m] "i use LittleSnitch on mac. It de"> You should read their docs, too (if you use something, please understand it, for the sake of the world). Unless something's on a whitelist, pretty sure they block/notify you about everything by default.
21:04:32 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Music, video, photos is easy to backup.
21:04:45 <nscnt> And DannyWorkOrderPr just gave you an option for contacts I guess
21:04:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> So, it "snitching" about the connection is expected.
21:05:41 <yekip[m]> i actually did read all their docs about these weird UDP blocks, they happen because the system can't notify in time, the connection can't wait, basically. no worries, if it doesnt work, i will unblock
21:05:58 <yekip[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "So, it "snitching" about the con"> its not the snitching, its the auto blocking. it denied the connection, but no worries
21:06:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nscnt "And Danny@WorkOrderPro just gave"> For posterity, "DecSync" stands for "Decentralized Sync", as in, create a file that can be synchronized by a tool of your choice (rsync/Dropbox/Syncthing/copy and paste like a neanderthal, etc)
21:07:16 <nscnt> Ah, I understand
21:07:25 <nscnt> Good to know
21:08:15 <yekip[m]> sorry for what may be a dumb question....... (what another?!)
21:08:26 <yekip[m]> but when you sync files from graphene to a folder on desktop, will they be readable on desktop, or encrypted?
21:08:58 <yekip[m]> Damn i LOVE Graphene
21:09:56 <yekip[m]> partly the pixel 3 too, coming from battered iphone5, its like a dream!
21:10:39 <nscnt> yekip[m]: You mean using Syncthing?
21:11:27 <nscnt> It's readable either way.
21:14:13 <mischling[m]> <yekip[m] "partly the pixel 3 too, coming f"> you should have got pixel 3 a xl. samr camera and the battery is fenomenal on grapheneos. i get 10-12 hours of screen on time
21:14:46 <yekip[m]> i meant if i sync some photios from graphene to desktop, will they be hashed/encrypted files on desktop, or images just like on graphene
21:14:50 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "you should have got pixel 3 a xl"> wanted smallest possibole
21:15:08 <yekip[m]> wish i could half the sizse of the pixel 3@
21:15:37 <nscnt> yekip[m]: They will be readable.
21:15:50 <mxnorvak[m]> <nscnt "It's readable either way."> What would one use to encrypt em, veracrypt?
21:16:24 <yekip[m]> Signal - asking:
21:16:24 <yekip[m]> "Optimize for missing Play Services. This device does not support play services. Tap to disable system battery optimizations that prevent Signal from retrieving messages while inactive". Votes on whether to do that?
21:16:35 <yekip[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "What would one use to encrypt em"> vera or AEScrypt i like, if that can do what you need
21:16:43 <nscnt> mxnorvak[m]: Uh... If you like to do it that way. I would just use disk encryption on my computer.
21:17:41 <nscnt> mxnorvak[m]: Using Syncthing, the files are encrypted on the device before getting synced.
21:18:48 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Yes, press agree.
21:19:45 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Signal will keep an connection open in the background all the time. It's really efficient and shouldn't drain more battery than other apps.
21:19:55 <yekip[m]> <nscnt "mxnorvak: Using Syncthing, the f"> thats what made me ask if they will be readable on the ciomputer they are synced to

21:20:06 <nscnt> Otherwise you wouldn't recieve messages.
21:20:54 <nscnt> yekip[m]: It's encrypted for transit and decrypted on the device again if recieved.
21:21:05 <nscnt> yekip[m]: It will be readable for you.
21:21:25 <mxnorvak[m]> <nscnt "mxnorvak: Using Syncthing, the f"> My understanding is that once you connect your device to a computer ,select to load storage and unlock the screen, all the files accessible from computer are decrypted right?

21:23:41 <nscnt> mischling[m]: You mean draining battery?
21:25:05 <nscnt> I've heard it from some, yea. But I've never had issues. Get away from your phones and talk irl, dudes
21:25:31 <yekip[m]> ah i see. so Syncthing takes the raw file (image for instance), encrypts it during transit and decrypts on the device the other end. cool! i was more wondering if graphene encrypted it or something. good stuff thanks
21:26:03 <nscnt> yekip[m]: It's encrypted before transit.
21:26:07 <nscnt> On your device.
21:26:27 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "it kind of does tho. at least co"> i have been moaning about that forever. Signal gets 5/10 for me due to that, whereas without phone nubmer requirement it would get 10! My other complaint is desktop app, as usual they don't care aboiut it enough as everyone is going to these mobile damn things. I still have to use Wire for desktop as Signal Desktop client can't do calls. Wire is great in that way, but i
21:26:27 <yekip[m]> know it has question marks over privacy since the buyout or whatever happened
21:26:28 <mischling[m]> <nscnt "mischling: You mean draining bat"> yes
21:26:51 <TheJollyRoger> nscnt: sorry I'm late. You asked about what utility to encrypt, could you tell me your use case?
21:26:51 <nscnt> yekip[m]: Android has its file-based encryption, which shouldn't bother you in anyway.
21:27:16 <nscnt> TheJollyRoger: Huh? Not me.
21:27:37 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, nvm, it's mxnorvak[m], whoop. Yo, what's the use case?
21:28:17 <mischling[m]> <yekip[m] "i have been moaning about that f"> check out this
21:28:19 <mischling[m]> Jami is completely peer-to-peer and doesn't require a server for relaying data between users. 
21:28:23 <nscnt> mischling[m]: 5% with last full charge 23 hours ago and screen usage since last full charge 3hr, 54. And this 5% is quite high rn for me
21:28:59 <nscnt> Signal used for 23hr, 23 min
21:29:12 <mischling[m]> perhaps latest version is better optimised
21:29:30 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "Jami is completely peer-to-peer "> thats a new one on me. i was about to try Qtox for the third time, but I am sure it will still be unbearable !
21:29:34 <TheJollyRoger> Signal's a battery-sipper on my device. I have multiple instances of it running and its impact on my battery life is negligible.
21:29:36 <nscnt> I never had an issue in a year.
21:29:56 <TheJollyRoger> yekip[m]: if you actually care about security and privacy, stay away from tox.
21:30:30 <cx2[m]> TheJollyRoger: multiple instances running in seperate profiles?
21:30:32 <nscnt> mischling[m]: What's is higher with 8% and used for 2hr, 42 min lol
21:30:37 <nscnt> *WhatsApp
21:30:54 <TheJollyRoger> Aside from the toxcore protocol being developed extremely haphazardly and shaky encryption, Tox has a particularly dirty secret and that's it's defective by design: not only does it rely on a DHT system which is EXTREMELY vulnerable to sybil attacks, but it also relies on supernodes.
21:31:03 <TheJollyRoger> Which are essentially servers that anyone can set up and anyone can run.
21:31:11 <TheJollyRoger> Put those two together and think for a moment.
21:31:19 <TheJollyRoger> Not a very pretty picture.
21:31:27 <mischling[m]> <nscnt "mischling: What's is higher with"> WhatsApp is a mess :))

21:31:40 <TheJollyRoger> ^_^
21:31:46 <yekip[m]> only tried it breifly a year or two ago. but wont try again in that case. there was me thinking it was all P2P via Tor. hmm
21:32:34 <mischling[m]> you can install orbot and force any app through tor
21:32:43 <TheJollyRoger> Don't ever let anyone tell you that "Distributed Hash Tables" are "secure through decentralization" -- without manual vetting or a proof of work consensus system such as blockchain that provides economic incentive for people to work against each other, Distributed Hash Table systems are vulnerable to being taken over by whoever has a lot of computers.
21:32:47 <yekip[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Put those two together and think"> Damn, even I can see the dirty picture that paints. thanks JR. deleting the app!
21:32:51 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "WhatsApp is a mess :))"> and nor should it be ever spoken of again. please. :D
21:34:11 <TheJollyRoger> cx2[m]: yes, multiple running in different profiles, and I have one running in a managed work profile but that's not a use case I recommend.
21:34:21 <TheJollyRoger> Since it's done for convenience and not security.
21:34:47 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Oh, nvm, it's mxnorvak, whoop. Y"> Just making sure i encrypt some personal files o keep on my hard drive and make a backup of the encrypted file,is that even a good practice for keeping personal stuff safe?
21:34:57 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "you can install orbot and force "> yes I was actually about to ask. I plan on running a VPN (forced always on). Just a habit of mine really from desktops and i may as well. But I have never used Orbot. I suspect it will be slower, but obviously other advantages.
21:35:15 <yekip[m]> thanks JR. I have heard a lot of people say "tox is the best", and still I continued with Wire because for now it works. but i wont be going there. what about what was mentioned above, jama was it?
21:35:17 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: it's a perfectly good practice. Just don't save your veracrypt encrypted file containers to a cloud server.
21:35:18 <yekip[m]> if you haev heard of it
21:35:35 <TheJollyRoger> Keep them on your hard drive.
21:35:51 <nscnt> mxnorvak[m]: I think VeraCrypt offers system encryption, too. Not sure, though.
21:35:55 <yekip[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: it's a perfectly good "> unless via uTox. bwaa haaa haaa
21:36:01 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
21:36:10 <mischling[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: it's a perfectly good "> and watch out for quantum computer advances :)))
21:36:56 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahaha! Well... interestingly enough, your veracrypt containers will still (provided your enemy only gets one snapshot of them) be safe even if someone invents a sufficiently powerful quantum computer.
21:36:58 <cx2[m]> <yekip[m] "yes I was actually about to ask."> Gotcha... I actually eliminated the managed work profile on your advice... and I know it's been brought up here a few times, without being admonished wholeheartedly....if one *were* to, how would you go about it?
21:37:01 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "cx2: yes, multiple running in di"> Switching between profiles throughout the day is so exhausting,at least for me that used to have em all in one profile
21:37:03 <TheJollyRoger> The defaults in Veracrypt is to use 256-bit keys.
21:37:09 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: it's a perfectly good "> Had never used any cloud service,probably will never use any in the future either
21:37:10 <yekip[m]> can i ask why you use profiles so much?
21:37:19 <TheJollyRoger> yekip[m]: convenience.
21:37:35 <yekip[m]> i toyed with the idea, for ringfencing apps and sytuff, but wondered if others did that
21:37:42 <TheJollyRoger> I have several different phone numbers, one for my personal line, one for my public line, and one for work.
21:37:44 <TheJollyRoger> That's all.
21:38:03 <yekip[m]> more comnvenient to run apps in different profiles, than all in one?
21:38:13 <TheJollyRoger> It depends on you.
21:38:37 <mxnorvak[m]> <mischling[m] "and watch out for quantum comput"> Yeah,i prefer to keep my sanity and do what i can for now xD
21:38:43 <cx2[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ahahahaha! Well... interestingly"> Shit.... i like my VeraCrypt Vaults to take 20 minutes to unlock..... #cascading encryption....x3
21:39:11 <mischling[m]> yekip: jami. works great of you can get your friens to switch to android and install it. orbot is quite fast for day to day browsing don't know about using a vpn also as orbot creates a virtual vpn of it's own
21:39:16 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: Gotcha. So about quantum computers... 256 bit keys will still be safe even in the face of Grover's Algorithm, which will reduce the key length by the square root, so 256-bit strength will become reduced to 128 bit strength equivalent in the face of a quantom computer. So it's still actually going to be safe, by a long shot.
21:39:17 <yekip[m]> google voice et al?
21:39:30 <yekip[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I have several different phone n"> so another profile can have a differnet phone number? damn, I LIKE that! how?!
21:39:41 <TheJollyRoger> yekip[m]: a different *signal* phone number.
21:39:59 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry :(
21:40:22 <yekip[m]> ah, gotcha. thanks,. i still like that idea. tricky to set up, but once done, beautiful
21:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
21:42:07 <yekip[m]> thats great. i actually two sets of people (personal/friends/family, and 'other'). so in the other profile, i could run signal again. i was planning on using desktop signal (to a diff phone number) for "other", and phone for personal only. but that way i could check messages on the fly from "other". neat stuff. JR isn't just a pretty face. :D

JR isn't just a pretty face. :D
21:42:23 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: the reason I say don't put Veracrypt containers on a cloud server is because veracrypt has a specific threat model, and that's "Someone cinderblocks your window, grabs your laptop while it's powered off, and runs." Veracrypt file containers are *not* designed to detect ciphertext tampering nor maintain confidentiality against traffic analysis, they weren't ever designed for that.
21:42:24 <TheJollyRoger> For that vector you're going to want to use something like AGE or tarsnap.
21:42:42 <yekip[m]> ha, same goes for Wire too actually, so I can already see 2 profiles being a great advantage. 3 if i include business
21:43:06 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: Gotcha. So about quant"> Yay :D
21:43:51 <TheJollyRoger> For its threat model of "Someone cinderblocks the window, grabs your laptop while it's in the back of your car at night, and runs" Veracrypt meets this threat model incredibly well.
21:44:31 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "yekip: jami. works great of you "> so jami is android only? thats a shame, i turned down a few others for that reason. most people i know are still on iphones, sadly. i am slowly convincing them to buy a pixel and mail it to me !
21:44:36 <limitless0[m]> <yekip[m] "i have been moaning about that f"> Is it that hard to get hold of a sim card or virtual nr?
21:45:07 <mischling[m]> <yekip[m] "ha, same goes for Wire too actua"> more complexity=bigger attack surface. keep it minimal
21:45:18 <cx2[m]> TheJollyRoger: can tarsnap be used on your own cloud instance? or even a third party?
21:45:41 <mxnorvak[m]> Yeah that's pretty much my threat model, using it as a safe
21:46:07 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "more complexity=bigger attack su"> not really sure thats relevant to this, but take your point which generally is very true
21:46:11 <TheJollyRoger> After QuadrigaCX's founder died (or "died") and left the last publicly known remaining copy of the Bitcoin private keys to the exchange worth 100 million dollars on a laptop with an encrypted hard drive, so far nobody has been able to get at those keys yet, although there are theories that he has a copy of the keys, faked his death, escaped to India, and is now living like a king somewhere in
21:46:13 <TheJollyRoger> locations unknown. I don't know.
21:46:20 <TheJollyRoger> But they haven't been able to decrypt that hard drive.
21:46:55 <yekip[m]> <limitless0[m] "Is it that hard to get hold of a"> i didn't say my complaint was because of how hard it is to get a sim card, and for many that answer is "yes". SIgnal is great. I just wish it could be tied to an email instead of a phone, but i know that comes with other problems. The desktop app being dumb is also a bugbear
21:47:18 <yekip[m]> and its costly to get anotgher sim or bvirgtual number, in my expeirence anyway
21:47:18 <TheJollyRoger> cx2[m]: no, Tarsnap is not self-hostable. The source code is source-available, but the terms of the license are that it's open and available to you for the purposes of being a tarsnap client.
21:47:35 <TheJollyRoger> So it's service-locked.
21:48:20 <mischling[m]> make a free email on tutanota or protonmail and use it to register with wire. by far the best solution
21:48:36 <cx2[m]> TheJollyRoger: right... ive been toying with it, trying to determine the advantage of it vs RAGE. I don't know that I can say that there is one for me.
21:48:42 <limitless0[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: it's a perfectly good "> Whats wrong with storing veracrypt on cloud? If its encrypted
21:48:50 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "For its threat model of "Someone"> And i figured its better to just encrypt the important files rather than the whole hard drive for the sake of hard drive's health , in case of HDD, does it affect lifespans in any noticeable way?
21:48:53 <TheJollyRoger> limitless0[m]: I'll get back to you in a second
21:49:31 <TheJollyRoger> cx2[m]: rage just encrypts the files. Tarsnap however is an entire backup system that incrementally backs up only the files that you've changed, in order to minimize storage space and provide you with an archive "back through time" while reducing trust in your service provider.
21:50:06 <yekip[m]> <mischling[m] "make a free email on tutanota or"> i dont even bother wasting my Proton or Tuta "lives"! I just use guerilla or a forwarder (33mail.com or masqt.com)
21:50:11 <TheJollyRoger> So rage is one little piece of software that can do what you want it to do, and you can combine with other things. Tarsnap is an all-in-one backup system and service all rolled into one thing as a package deal.
21:51:09 <yekip[m]> I have to scoot. Thanks to everyone above for the inpiut, and to JR as usual. Consider me detoxed. 🙂
21:51:18 <cx2[m]> TheJollyRoger: So like a a CryptoMator....do you find that it's price point is cost effective for you? I'm not a bright guy and I was trying to determine if i am only charged per new block, or each time it's backed up... etc.
21:52:55 <yekip[m]> PS damn i wanted to ask JR or others what the opinion is on Jami. Just seen teh website and looks very nice on the surface, and doesnt appear to be android only at all. I could get interested in this. if anyone has any red flags or warnings aboiut it, please shout. i will check back later. thanks again
21:53:39 <TheJollyRoger> limitless0[m]: The reason why you should never put Veracrypt containers on a cloud server is because full disk encryption utilized by Veracrypt is actually a considerable compromise in terms of performance and threat model. XTS mode is unauthenticated because to authenticate each block would cost too much performance, and the changes propagate through it to ensure that the ciphertexts always
21:53:39 <limitless0[m]> <yekip[m] "and its costly to get anotgher s"> There are lots of webistes which offer free virtual numbers,google them
21:53:40 <TheJollyRoger> come out to be the same size as the plaintexts. In layman's terms, this means that that XTS is not designed to protect confidentiality against an opponent that can see the data multiple times at different states, nor provide any means to detect if someone tampers with the drive image.
21:53:55 <TheJollyRoger> Simply put, it's outside of Veracrypt's threat model.
21:54:13 <TheJollyRoger> You should be using AGE for that instead.
21:54:35 <limitless0[m]> <TheJollyRoger "limitless0: I'll get back to you"> No worries, cos everywhere the recommended options are Veracrypt or Crypyomator hence the question
21:54:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yes - for full disk encryption.
21:55:09 <mischling[m]> yekip: i have more than a dozen email adreeses with these two without issues. i use a different email for each service. temporary mail is not a good ideea as adresses are reused (securty risk) and you lose access to a way to recover your password
21:55:17 <TheJollyRoger> But that's a vector where if you lose your hard drive, your adversary will only ever have one copy of that hard drive at that one specific point in time.
21:55:21 <TheJollyRoger> And you won't be getting it back.
21:55:37 <TheJollyRoger> So the limitations and compromises Veracrypt has to make are not an issue in that threat vector.
21:55:44 <TheJollyRoger> Specifically, the vector it is designed to protect against.
21:57:05 <TheJollyRoger> TLDR: using Veracrypt to store encrypted volumes on a cloud server is very much like using one of my good wood chisels to pry out a nail. You can do it and you'll probably succeed at it, but don't expect it to be very clean and you'll probably make a mess of things.
21:57:12 <limitless0[m]> TheJollyRoger: but if lets say i back up photos videos etc via veracrypt and store them on drive
21:57:27 <limitless0[m]> Whats the danger there since they are encrypted
21:57:52 <limitless0[m]> No full disk encryption as i dont ude pc/laptops
21:58:03 <limitless0[m]> Use*
21:58:42 <TheJollyRoger> The danger there is that as you add more to that drive, if you believe your cloud service provider is out to get you (and remember this could happen unintentionally, since versioning is a thing), your adversary will start to see more snapshots of different data in different states encrypted with the same key in XTS mode.
21:58:56 <TheJollyRoger> Over time, this erodes its confidentiality.
21:59:03 <mischling[m]> @TheJollyRoger device encyption on phone, os encyption on ubuntu laptop, backup on encrypted external hard. is this a good model?
21:59:16 <TheJollyRoger> One at a time guys -
22:00:55 <limitless0[m]> TheJollyRoger: i dont understand the threat model here, im not trying to hide that im storing emcrypted files of folder,i just want them encrypted with a very complex password and thatd that
22:01:05 <TheJollyRoger> limitless0[m]: the worst that could happen, is that because XTS doesn't offer any means to authenticate the data again, someone could actually tamper around with the ciphertexts and have them decrypt to an entirely different plaintext.
22:01:48 <TheJollyRoger> limitless0[m]:  what I'm saying is that veracrypt containers and veracrypt encrypted drives belong on physical devices you control, and should NEVER be saved on an online backup.
22:01:52 <TheJollyRoger> Because they're not for that.
22:01:55 <limitless0[m]> <TheJollyRoger "limitless0: the worst that could"> Decrypt the whole folder without yhe passw?
22:02:28 <limitless0[m]> Hmmm well this is new
22:02:37 <limitless0[m]> So cryptomator then?
22:02:49 <TheJollyRoger> It's not a matter of what software you use,
22:02:54 <TheJollyRoger> Well,
22:02:56 <TheJollyRoger> necessarily.
22:03:02 <TheJollyRoger> It's a matter of the /mode of functioning of the cipher./
22:03:06 <limitless0[m]> TheJollyRoger: so Eds Lite id useless then
22:03:17 <TheJollyRoger> Hold on and listen a second, will you?
22:03:27 <TheJollyRoger> Don't get ahead of me.
22:03:34 <limitless0[m]> Lol
22:03:38 <limitless0[m]> Pausing
22:03:42 <TheJollyRoger> It's a matter that XTS mode of functioning is designed to maintain confidentiality /once./
22:03:48 <TheJollyRoger> That's it.
22:03:57 <TheJollyRoger> It is NOT designed as a general purpose cipher.
22:04:10 <TheJollyRoger> It is NOT designed to be an authenticated cipher.
22:04:20 <TheJollyRoger> It is NOT designed to handle attacker-controlled inputs.
22:04:27 <TheJollyRoger> All of which you have to worry about when you store something online.
22:04:41 <TheJollyRoger> Modes such as GCM are.
22:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> Veracrypt is secure FOR ITS INTENDED THREAT MODEL. So use it.
22:05:36 <TheJollyRoger> Just don't use it outside of its intended threat model and expect it to remain secure.
22:05:50 <TheJollyRoger> The same goes for EDS Lite, which also uses XTS.
22:06:35 <TheJollyRoger> So if you're encrypting a file that's going on a USB drive which you carry with you, sure. Use Veracrypt. Protecting a hard drive you're going to put in cold storage. Sure. Use Veracrypt.
22:06:46 <limitless0[m]> Its to technical for me to understand when i dont even know what XTS is.but in plain simple i understand encrypt for local storage and not cloud
22:06:49 <TheJollyRoger> Protecting a drive whose contents you want to protect if the physical media is stolen.
22:06:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
22:07:15 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yes - for full disk encryption."> Was this in response to if full disk encryption decreases the lifespan of a hard drive?
22:07:23 <TheJollyRoger> It's for protecting against data theft via physical theft of the physical media the data is located on.
22:07:34 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: it will make no difference to the lifespan of your hard drive.
22:07:51 <limitless0[m]> TheJollyRoger: very well explained,Thank you
22:08:40 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome! If you want to do something that involves storing data on a cloud server, right now "age" is probably your best bet because it offers an authenticated mode of functioning.
22:08:46 <limitless0[m]> So if i want to store pics on cloud is therr any safe way?
22:09:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! You would use something like age or rage. (Actually Good Encryption or Rust Actually Good Encryption)
22:09:21 <TheJollyRoger> This also uses AES, but it uses AES in Galois Counter Mode.
22:09:27 <TheJollyRoger> Which is an authenticated mode.
22:10:04 <limitless0[m]> Android compatible?
22:10:21 <TheJollyRoger> Sadly not at this moment, it's a commandline utility. I think a port is underway though.
22:10:48 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: it will make no differ"> Oh ,i thought full disk will decrease the health and increase the wear level of the encrypted hard drive,so full disk encryption would be a better choice than encrypting selected files yeah? Or would it be just more work for the hard drive
22:11:50 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: for encrypting a hard drives, remember that XTS will always produce ciphertexts the exact same size as the plaintexts that form them. So you're still writing the same amount of bits to the drive.
22:12:47 <limitless0[m]> TheJollyRoger: thanks again for detailed answers, if not sure ask a question as the saying goes
22:13:04 <TheJollyRoger> They won't be transparently compressible, but that's an issue so niche that I wouldn't even bother trying to take it into account. The temperature inside the case, the amount you use it for, and the brand you buy is going to have way more of an effect on your SSD life than your cipher ever will.
22:13:15 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
22:13:45 <zaxxa[m]> Sorry for dumb question I am a bit confused, so is "AGE" a new standard to encrypt data or a utility tool?
22:13:48 <TheJollyRoger> Hard drives, as in, spinning-disk hard drives, actually don't care so much with the *amount of* writes and reads they go through.
22:13:58 <TheJollyRoger> However, the *manufacturer* of the drives will have a *massive* effect.
22:14:33 <TheJollyRoger> Google carried out a study some time ago, and found that not all hard drives are created equal, but it didn't matter how much data got written to them, it mattered more who made them.
22:14:48 <TheJollyRoger> As well - heat.
22:15:23 <TheJollyRoger> In the past at least, heat was a major contributor to shortened SSD life.
22:16:20 <TheJollyRoger> zaxxa[m]: you got it on the latter, age is a simple software utility to encrypt files with AES GCM.
22:16:54 <TheJollyRoger> Some people have written their own versions of it following the document that Filipo Valsorda posted about its design, but yes, age or "Actually Good Encryption" is a utility.
22:17:57 <TheJollyRoger> The philosophy behind age is simple: ciphersuite negotiation is the work of the devil; we should just use the best encryption all the time rather than having backwards compatibility to the 1990's, and if the situation changes, we throw out the entire design all at once and make a new one to avoid being hobbled by backwards compatibility.
22:18:00 <cx2[m]> TheJollyRoger: not a crypto expert by any stretch so deciphering Cryptomators architecture is a bit above my head. It specifically targets cloud users. Do you know anything about it, and if so, would you recomend it? That is until RAGE comes on board for mobile
22:18:00 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "In the past at least, heat was a"> I remember reading backblaze's data when i wanted to choose one but that wasnt still a good indicator as for some sizes the data was kinda random from year to year
22:18:35 <TheJollyRoger> cx2[m]: Sorry, at this point I don't. Not enough hours in the day, heh.
22:19:02 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: for hard drives?
22:19:04 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Google carried out a study some "> Any chance i can find it?
22:19:12 <TheJollyRoger> I actually have to get going...
22:19:17 <TheJollyRoger> Just a sec.
22:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> I think I got it... just a moment.
22:19:57 <TheJollyRoger> Then I have to go.
