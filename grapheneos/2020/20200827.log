00:48:30 <renlord[m]> It just stubs out all the Google apis that gcam requires.
00:58:37 <takhar[m]> Grapheneos has been great for me, not just privacy wise, but abstractly as well. The limitations make you really consider what apps sit on your phone and what you use a phone for.
00:58:37 <takhar[m]> I used to buy Samsung phones bc of the cameras and Samsung pay, but now I realize I don't take many pictures and chip cards are just as convenient as spay.
00:58:37 <takhar[m]> I can surf the net privately, contact my friends securely, and take a solid picture. All without telling a private corporation my every move. Can't beat that.
02:04:55 <burlycootz[m]> Hey anyone have any idea about why a Bluetooth connection that requires a passcode would fail? I never get prompted. Other devices can connect, just not my pixel.
02:05:36 <burlycootz[m]> Ran an adb logcat during the attempts
02:06:04 <burlycootz[m]> Just see that the session terminates but no smoking gun as to why
02:07:18 <burlycootz[m]> This is for my car using a2dp; regular phone Bluetooth connection is fine, that setup does not require passcode
02:08:16 <spoonhoarder82[m> OK so update for all pixel 4 and pixel 4 xl users with screen flicker bs: the adb commands to set screen refresh to be capped at 60hz solve the problem almost entirely, and DO NOT wipe your personal data.  I can confirm a bit more battery life too.
02:12:15 <Harpocrates[m]> burlycootz: There's an option in developer options to disable a2dp offload, try toggling that setting, it might help.
02:12:51 <burlycootz[m]> Yeah should have mentioned that, I did search for answers, tried that previously
02:12:58 <burlycootz[m]> Sadly did not work
02:13:54 <burlycootz[m]> Found this in the logs
02:13:57 <burlycootz[m]> 08-26 22:01:21.420 22230 22282 W bt_stack: [WARNING:connection_handler.cc(328)] auto bluetooth::avrcp::ConnectionHandler::AcceptorControlCb(uint8_t, uint8_t, uint16_t, const RawAddress *)::(anonymous class)::operator()(bluetooth::avrcp::ConnectionHandler *, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint16_t, uint16_t) const: No device found for handle: 0x01
02:14:25 <burlycootz[m]> After that it disconnects
02:16:43 <burlycootz[m]> Never prompts for passcode and I don't have an option in my stereo to connect without passcode
02:22:34 <Harpocrates[m]> You may need to reset the BT connector in your car, if you're not sure how to then you may need to check the car manual to find out how to do that.
02:24:56 <burlycootz[m]> I did pull the battery cable a while back, that was actually the start of the issues; it forgot all Bluetooth connections and I couldn't get reconnected. Worked fine before, no issue with connecting. Just can't understand why every other phone I've tried will prompt but the pixel.
02:25:29 <burlycootz[m]> Appreciate the advice though
02:33:45 <Harpocrates[m]> No worries. Not sure it will be a good idea for a car but when the BT on my PC goes haywire I pull the power and turn it on to drain any excess electricity, after that it connects.
02:43:02 <burlycootz[m]> Tried an old BlackBerry and got connected. Passcode prompt showed up
02:44:14 <burlycootz[m]> Log notes that com.android.settings generates /.Bluetooth.bluetoothpairingdialog
02:53:46 <Harpocrates[m]> I'm honestly not sure then buddy, sorry I couldn't help.
02:56:46 <burlycootz[m]> Eh no worries. I shall keep digging. There has to be something. Might just wipe again.
02:56:54 <burlycootz[m]> Appreciate the help
03:47:54 <spoonhoarder82[m> Question: when GrapheneOS moves to android 11, it is likely that it can be done via and ota update, or will we have to do a fresh install to move up to 11?
03:47:55 <spoonhoarder82[m> I ask because I am thinking about installing gos for a nontechnical relative since I've has such good luck with gos and it is locked down pretty well.
03:49:49 <nickcalyx[m]> It will be an OTA update
03:50:03 <nickcalyx[m]> 99.9%
06:03:25 <niky> hello everyone, im in the market for a phone and my two options are iphone se 2020 / pixel 4a w graphene os when its supported ..
06:03:56 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "hello everyone, im in the market"> whats your threat model?
06:06:55 <niky> im quite new to this idea of privacy n security , but after reading tons of comments and article abt how companies use and sell our data i wanted to change
06:07:47 <niky> im just a normal person with no one in paricular targetting me
06:11:40 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "im just a normal person with no "> but like, who do you want to defend your data from?
06:13:19 <niky> i want opt out of mass surveillance and data collection
06:14:38 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> I would say there is no one-size-fits-all privacy device, so here are some pros and cons and you can decide which one suits you
06:15:06 <niky> could you help me understand that pls
06:15:47 <niky> ive read daniel micays ios vs aosp vs graphene os on reddit
06:16:14 <niky> but thats a year old now
06:16:26 <cn3m[m]> <niky "ive read daniel micays ios vs ao"> ah that is a good synopsis. I saw one of the guys here made a list of his Matrix comments too one sec
06:16:36 <cn3m[m]> <niky "but thats a year old now"> it is still up to date mostly
06:16:40 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> Apple pro: great security updates supports (5 years), great security and privacy features (like proximate locations), and if you happen to have lots of friends who have iphones but wont switch to imessage
06:16:44 <cn3m[m]> <cn3m[m] "ah that is a good synopsis. I sa"> https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/ifllgs/pixel_or_iphone/g2sazav/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
06:17:00 <cn3m[m]> > <@cn3m:privacytools.io> ah that is a good synopsis. I saw one of the guys here made a list of his Matrix comments too one sec
06:17:00 <cn3m[m]>  * https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/ifllgs/pixel_or_iphone/g2sazav
06:17:06 <renlord> what does it mean to want to opt out of mass surveillance and data collection?
06:17:31 <renlord> do you even read the ToS for the services that you consume?
06:18:37 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS and iOS won't fix terrible habits ^
06:18:49 <cn3m[m]> no such thing as a silver bullet
06:19:08 <renlord> people with terrible habits are just asking to be spied on and getting taken advantage off, no OS can save you from yourself
06:19:15 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> well fuck it Im not gonna top that summary lol
06:20:00 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> although I would say, and its just my opinion, when the new iOS 14 come out, iOS is just better than stock Android, its not just trading blows anymore
06:20:20 <cn3m[m]> iOS has always been better. So has GrapheneOS
06:20:37 <cn3m[m]> I trust them both ad tracking was my job. I trust iOS and GrapheneOS to restrict apps far more
06:20:58 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <cn3m[m] "iOS has always been better. So h"> yeah but in the article it says they are trading blows, but that article is an year old
06:21:30 <niky> the ad data and analytics they collect , be it location or audio ,etc
06:21:55 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> yeah, if you goes thru all the hoops and flashed Graphene, but the first thing you did was installing Facebook.................
06:21:57 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> I mean...
06:22:14 <niky> yes i understand but id like improve so just wanted to know what should i go for ios or graphene os
06:22:45 <renlord> the issue with fb is not so much about using fb directly
06:22:57 <renlord> but what they do in the internet in general, but that's offtopic anyways
06:23:32 <niky> no im not on any social media
06:23:54 <renlord> niky: sure, but the sites you visit use their services
06:24:03 <renlord> and FB screws you over indirectly.
06:24:12 <renlord> do you even read the cookies policy?
06:24:13 <theultron[m]> Higher problem is on devices which ships with Facebook as system service. Many OEM Roms like Xiaomi have FB services as system app and many of their inbuilt apps have intents to communicate with that service app. Not sure what sort of deal FB made with manufacturer but it's clear they are buying our data.
06:24:52 <cn3m[m]> lets move this to offtopic if anyone needs an invite let me know
06:25:07 <renlord> theultron[m]: that's none of our concern and its a non-issue on grapheneos
06:25:23 <cn3m[m]> ^
06:25:32 <renlord> we dont ship any built-in services besides what's shipped via aosp
06:25:38 <niky> yes renlord i do read the policies and i use vpn or tor to surf
06:26:30 <niky> im not completely ignorant but im no where close to u guys in terms of knowlegde
06:26:31 <theultron[m]> Ofcourse. I was just saying that using FB app on something like GOS won't invade your privacy.
06:26:47 <theultron[m]> What you do inside the app is a different thing!
06:26:49 <cn3m[m]> niky: https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/ I would read this site especially the VPNs and the Browser Tracking article
06:26:57 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> I hate the fact that I brought up Facebook...its just an example guys!
06:27:15 <niky> hence i thought talking to you guys might increase my insight which it actually is right now
06:27:16 <cn3m[m]> this is probably the best starter guide and of course the GrapheneOS official FAQ and Usage Guide
06:28:05 <niky> ive watched installation guides too for graphene os
06:28:12 <niky> but im confused guys
06:28:24 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> look, here's the thing. More metaphors coming
06:28:26 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QMcpPuWJeVnHQpLyTgBrNMWQ/message.txt >
06:28:32 <renlord> niky: the point is that you need to practice opsec, as oppose to relying on an OS to save you
06:28:39 <niky> should i buy an se or a pixel 4a
06:28:49 <niky> where should i start ?
06:28:49 <renlord> using a nice OS is a good start, but you need more than a nice OS to achieve your goals
06:28:56 <renlord> a nice OS is a not a panacea
06:29:18 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> you going to a knife fight, but you have a machete and you have a baseball bat, the question shouldnt be which one should I take with me, rather how I use them
06:29:23 <renlord> i dont have a list of reading material to recommend, but its a lot of work to realise what you want
06:29:28 <theultron[m]> I will say go out and try both the devices. Buy what you like the feel, size and the experience.
06:29:31 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> cuz in some situations, Id argue that Apple is better than Graphene!
06:29:49 <renlord> SEWaRybdALEy[m]: depends on trust model
06:29:50 <niky> where is graphene os better than ios ?
06:30:01 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> so it would be irresponsible to say that...oh graphene is just better! pick graphene!
06:30:06 <theultron[m]> <niky "where is graphene os better than"> First Party Privacy.
06:30:11 <niky> renlord i completely understand your examples but all im looking for is a good start
06:30:16 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <renlord "SEWaRybdALEy: depends on trust m"> yeah! exactly, it depends on your threat model and what kind of situation you are in
06:30:22 <niky> and gradually change my digital habits
06:31:15 <renlord> [aside] apple is a for-profit company beholden to very greedy shareholders that expect good QoQ growth
06:31:37 <renlord> i dont know how well that agrees with security/privacy in the long-run
06:32:13 <renlord> speculative opinion, dont take too seriously
06:32:18 <theultron[m]> <niky "and gradually change my digital "> You can start at reddit privacy, reddit privacytoolsio, privacytoolsio discussion on matrix and techlore.
06:32:37 <cn3m[m]> niky: iPhone SE and Pixel 3a is what I would get since both are available right now
06:32:47 <cn3m[m]> 4a is not guaranteed support
06:33:10 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> yeah, if you have the money, Id rather buy SE and a 3a both too
06:33:12 <renlord> 4a is now available in AVP
06:33:21 <renlord> *APV
06:33:33 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> cuz graphene is privacy and secure, but its not for everyone
06:33:37 <renlord> kernel port next
06:34:33 <theultron[m]> May be you can buy both used iPhone SE and 3A.
06:34:53 <theultron[m]> 2 devices is better for security and privacy due to isolation.
06:34:58 <cn3m[m]> I wasn't suggesting both
06:34:59 <cn3m[m]> I was suggesting one
06:35:03 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "2 devices is better for security"> double the attack surface
06:35:56 <niky> i can afford only one device and like cn3m said 2 devices mean more surfaCe attacks
06:36:05 <cn3m[m]> 1 device would be ideal
06:36:10 <niky> i have used ios and stock andriod both
06:36:17 <niky> im comfortable with both
06:36:50 <cn3m[m]> For example if you could pull it off you can't beat the iPhone + iPad pair for security and privacy since it has only one OS and chipset as attack surface and it is a hardened mobile OS.
06:36:50 <cn3m[m]> Though GrapheneOS uses Chromium which you probably use on your PC.
06:36:53 <niky> but if im buy an android device it will be a pixel coz of titan m and updates
06:36:59 <cn3m[m]> but at the end of the day
06:37:17 <cn3m[m]> your phone is far more secure than your desktop if you use either option
06:37:31 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> well you kinda have to buy a pixel since graphene only supports pixel
06:37:49 <niky> yes exactly SEWaRybdALEy[m]
06:38:25 <niky> and on those privacy based sites they have graphene os as a safe os no mentions of ios
06:39:20 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "and on those privacy based sites"> yes, thats true. but with graphene OS it comes with a price, you have to absolutely sure that your daily life isnt hindered by that
06:39:45 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> It took me a year to adapt to graphene and sometimes I still dont get used to it
06:39:52 <theultron[m]> Those privacy based sites will never mentioned iOS because iOS source code is not open to inspect. With GOS you can read and see the code for yourself./
06:39:53 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> but the peace of mind it offered was amazing
06:40:39 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> well thats other people whose threat model values open and transparency
06:40:54 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> thats not necessarily for you
06:41:14 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> not saving you dont need openess and transparency, but gos, it comes with a price
06:41:28 <travankor> "It took me a year to adapt to graphene" wdym
06:41:38 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> like getting used to it
06:41:51 <travankor> it's android?
06:42:21 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> yeah, first week, lost 50% of my apps, so I scrambled for weeks to finally get my life back together
06:42:33 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> also, im in Canada, so iMessage or WhatsApp
06:42:41 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> and suddenly, I lost iMessage, and I hate Whatsapp
06:42:49 <niky> SEWaRybdALEy[m] what is your threat model ? why do you use gos ?
06:42:52 <travankor> me too lol
06:43:15 <niky> i dont use imessage  but will use whatsapp in shelter or island thats possible right ?
06:44:00 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> so it took me a month or two to familiarize my graphene os's features and tweak it to my usage
06:44:14 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> still lost some apps, but fortunately, I bought an used iPhone
06:44:32 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> so I can get rid of my whatsapp reliance
06:45:11 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "i dont use imessage  but will us"> yeah but you lost notifications and even so, the idea of giving my data to Fecesbook, I hate it
06:45:43 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "i dont use imessage  but will us"> now I rarely use it and I put them in my Shelter and freeze it most of the time
06:46:08 <niky> SEWaRybdALEy[m] so using whatsapp in shelter via gos is safe right ?
06:46:16 <travankor> iMessage only works for iOS users
06:46:25 <niky> thats the only app in need due to work
06:46:34 <dmatrixs[m]> niky if you've got this much interest in these topics you probably aren't gonna be happy unless you use graphene
06:46:39 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "SEWaRybdALEy so using whatsapp i"> Facebook can still get a lot of info of you just by you using that service though
06:46:55 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "SEWaRybdALEy so using whatsapp i"> its secure, but its still not private
06:47:21 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> so, as you can see, I prioritize not giving FB anything, so I value iOS in that respect
06:47:31 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> in a iOS dominant country
06:47:37 <renlord> niky: if you really wanna achieve your goals
06:47:48 <niky> dmatrixs[m] im very interested in trying gos but i dont have a device atm & i have to get a new phone so it can either be pixel or the se hence im here asking for views
06:48:01 <renlord> the inconvenience you get from using graphene os pales in comparison to the opsec daily practices you are expected to be practising
06:48:56 <cn3m[m]> If you prefer a little more freedom choose the Pixel if you prefer being able to keep your phone for more than 3 years(more like 6) then go for the SE
06:49:01 <niky> the only reason i need whatsapp is for work groups t
06:49:14 <cn3m[m]> This is not as complicated as it sounds
06:49:15 <dmatrixs[m]> i personally would love to hear more about what those are, at least the more inconvenient ones lol
06:49:21 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> yeah, if you want a long term phone, iOS...
06:49:21 <dmatrixs[m]> renlord:
06:49:27 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> so you see its impossible to give recommendations
06:49:38 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> unless we know your threat model
06:49:45 <renlord> niky: just read the privacy policy and compare it to graphene os
06:50:02 <renlord> in our case, we have none since we dont log nor need to log since we have no helpdesk to help you
06:50:11 <renlord> lol
06:51:36 <niky> is there any way i can try graphene without buying a pixel?
06:51:43 <niky> like just to taste it
06:51:47 <renlord> niky: maybe, emulator
06:51:55 <renlord> very clunky thouhg
06:51:58 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "is there any way i can try graph"> nope
06:52:05 <theultron[m]> Is there any x86 image for GOS?
06:52:13 <renlord> niky: but its just like stock AOSP
06:52:19 <renlord> just flash stock aosp and try
06:52:27 <renlord> the user experience is very similar
06:52:48 <travankor> minus apps that run with google services
06:53:01 <renlord> aosp has no google services
06:53:06 <louipc> so u guys gearing up for pixel 4a/5?
06:53:21 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <louipc "so u guys gearing up for pixel 4"> 4a yes!
06:53:51 <niky> guys can i just know how gos is better than ios other than first party privacy ?
06:53:59 <niky> like i know ios and gos trade blows
06:54:10 <niky> but where does gos come on top of ios
06:54:18 <niky> ive read alot of pro for ios
06:54:19 <niky> n
06:54:32 <niky> but not specifically for gos
06:54:43 <cn3m[m]> <niky "guys can i just know how gos is "> it is not that simple iOS is better at restricting third party and iOS is better verified boot. Otherwise it gets really complicated
06:54:46 <cn3m[m]> like I said they both beat your PC
06:55:00 <cn3m[m]> The differences really don't matter
06:55:13 <cn3m[m]> which lets you do what you want to do better?
06:55:14 <louipc> graphene is open source so its more easily customizable to the minute detail
06:55:29 <dmatrixs[m]> that^
06:55:41 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> gos being open source, take that ios!
06:55:47 <louipc> but then u can't call it graphene if you change it
06:56:10 <louipc> and u have to do all security update builds yourself
06:56:43 <niky> louipc but im not going to change the code and like daniel had said in a comment  that just becoz a code is open soucre doesnt mean it better than closed one
06:56:57 <niky> im blindly going to trust gos and install it
06:57:07 <niky> not alter it in any way
06:57:09 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> and gos is extra hardening security
06:57:45 <louipc> niky: doesnt mean its better for security, but maybe better for other things
06:58:02 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> and gos supports multiple user profile, it might be nothing, and it might be super useful privacy feature, its really up to how you use it
06:58:39 <niky> can you enlighten me ? even if the user is using linux debian or tails?
07:00:07 <niky> SEWaRybdALEy[m] so different user profiles means that apps in one cant talk to the other ?
07:01:41 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "SEWaRybdALEy so different user p"> yep
07:01:57 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> also, it compartmentalise your data
07:02:28 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> you wouldnt wanna install whatsapp and give it permission to ALL your photos would you
07:02:59 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> and this is where ios wins, ios have the option for users to select the photos that an app can access
07:03:23 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> so as you can see, ios, gos, which one is more private? its really complicated
07:04:07 <louipc> hey but maybe it is better for security... because you could remove 99% attack surface and make it into a flashlight or somthing.
07:04:19 <louipc> only flashlight function
07:06:57 <niky> SEWaRybdALEy[m]if i give whatsapp access to my photos do they upload to their servers ?
07:07:50 <niky> louipc hmm got it
07:12:58 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "SEWaRybdALEy[m]if i give whatsap"> not that I know of but I know there are apps that do
07:13:08 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> whatsapp is just an example
07:13:43 <niky> what os do you use on a pc ? SEWaRybdALEy[m]
07:13:44 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> and like I said, I hate facebook just as a hobby lolll
07:14:05 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> mac and linux
07:14:15 <niky> got it SEWaRybdALEy[m] you have fb
07:15:02 <theultron[m]> Guys it's time to move over to off-topic channel.
07:15:02 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <niky "got it SEWaRybdALEy you have fb"> yeah, unfortunately. but signed up with fake IDs and I use frost

07:50:33 <zombieworld[m]> Hello, I have a Pixel 3a and installed GrapheneOS a week ago. The security patch is 5 August 2020. I have a huge question: this means my phone is already patched for the vulnerabilities of the Qualcomm SDM670 chipset that they were published in the August Security Bulletin from Qualcomm website ?  https://www.qualcomm.com/company/product-security/bulletins/august-2020-security-bulletin
07:51:08 <zombieworld[m]> They are 33 vulnerabilities discovered in a month !
07:52:08 <cn3m[m]> zombieworld: that is a general security bulletin
07:52:10 <cn3m[m]> very few actually effect the Pixel
07:52:11 <cn3m[m]> https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2020-08-01
07:52:29 <cn3m[m]> 2 effect it and they are both moderate
07:52:42 <cn3m[m]> there is one high severity vulnerability in the kernel
07:52:45 <cn3m[m]> that was patched
07:52:53 <cn3m[m]> I have no idea if GrapheneOS kills these 3 or not
07:53:36 <zombieworld[m]> Thanks a lot
07:53:41 <theultron[m]> Merging the vendor from google would have fixed it right?
07:54:25 <zombieworld[m]> I was amazed when I ve seen 33 vulnerabilities for the SDM670 chipset in a month
07:54:37 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "Merging the vendor from google w"> yes they are fixed
07:56:05 <cn3m[m]> the pixel security bulletins is generally where I go
08:07:05 <zombieworld[m]> I have a second question. Because I cannot use Waze on Graphene, I will have to use a samsung s7 edge as a second phone, and I wish something as secure as possible on a samsung. I like PixysOS, can you recommend something better ?

08:45:26 <zombieworld[m]> hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3: its becouse you don t have Google sevices for push notifications I think. Signal uses that.
08:46:10 <cn3m[m]> Signal uses it if you don't download from the site
08:49:37 <robocat[m]> I got signal from Aurora store, it works fine and notifications work as well
08:55:38 <robocat[m]> Im currently on 69.2, so jo ig, im gonna update to 69.6
08:56:06 <robocat[m]> Auto updates arent really an issue if you have a routine check where u update all apps
09:01:58 <robocat[m]> But yes, under settins in aurora, then updates, you are able to enable automatic updates

10:44:07 <djee737ejdd[m]> But that is probably off topic
10:44:50 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Sans virtualization maybe

10:45:32 <cn3m[m]> <djee737ejdd[m] "Entirely depends what PC you're "> most vms are pretty weak compared to mobile security layers

10:48:48 <cn3m[m]> my iPad is essentially is running 2 kernels(Darwin and the master PPL) and using the CPU to enforce rules like KTRR to further isolation the system
10:50:24 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS of course has many layers of protection as well
10:50:36 <cn3m[m]> so you are looking at overall

10:58:39 <cn3m[m]> djee737ejdd: Qubes doesn't have verified boot. Also yes virtualization is better than not having it, but it doesn't make Qubes more secure than GrapheneOS

11:13:42 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Modify the boot control block + "> oh interesting
11:13:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> The recovery verifies what is being flashed next
11:13:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is also zero risk of bricking due to A/B
11:14:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> You always flash to the inactive slot
11:14:14 <theultron[m]> You built a custom recovery?
11:14:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
11:14:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> AOSP recovery is sufficient
11:14:32 <cn3m[m]> anupritaisno1: what is the threat model here?
11:14:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> None
11:15:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's safer because you don't have to rely on getting the fastboot tools at all
11:15:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Any adb works
11:15:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> As long as it isn't a dinosaur
11:16:12 <cn3m[m]> hmm interesting
11:16:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> In case of a failed install
11:16:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'll just boot back to the stock ROM
11:16:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also you download about 100-200 mb less than a fastboot image
11:17:40 <theultron[m]> Nice.
11:17:43 <cn3m[m]> interesting
11:19:37 <Autopsy[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Also you download about 100-200 "> So, for all intents and purposes, it's similar to just flashing an update?
11:20:17 <Autopsy[m]> Through recovery ^
11:23:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yep
11:24:32 <Autopsy[m]> Nice. If it works well, it may save people being confused with the current method
11:45:23 <cdesai> you'd still need fastboot to unlock, flash avb key, and the boot.img though
11:46:09 <cdesai> (and relock)
11:56:19 <djee737ejdd[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Running an easily bypassable hyp"> What makes you say that. There are well known security researchers working on the project.

12:01:18 <cn3m[m]> djee737ejdd: it is not at all designed with security in mind, the marketshare is plummeting, and the track record is poor. Sure the gold standard is something like Hyper-V which is frankly quite amazing. However, Xen fails to hold up even to KVM
12:41:50 <lovesausage[m]> Fingerprint unlock for my apps and stuff is great, however it is not so good for unlocking the phone for several reasons I'm sure you are aware of. There is the lockdown feature on graphene , however  I still need to remember to use it every time. Is there any chance of getting a  lockdown always on feature?
12:54:51 <dazinism> lovethere sausagetheres a feature in AOSP that is accessible for corporate device management apps, that achieves this.
12:55:46 <djee737ejdd[m]> <cn3m[m] "djee737ejdd: it is not at all de"> Do you have any source on that though? Its recommended a lot by actual cybersecurity experts and non just normies like r/privacy. Some well known researchers are working on it and GrapheneOS wants to work towards it.

13:09:01 <theultron[m]> Biggest market is with VMWare. I think it's greater than combined all other hypervisors.
13:09:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Eh I like hyper v
13:09:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> In my basic use I found it sufficiently secure
13:10:07 <djee737ejdd[m]> As Rotkowska said, its an non egocentric way of getting privacy and security.
13:10:07 <djee737ejdd[m]> Not everyone need to change to something you use. You can use the software other people use in a secure way.
13:12:35 <theultron[m]> Okay. VMWare market is share is close to 75%. They dominate the market.
13:12:57 <theultron[m]> Xen is at 2nd with close to 10%.

13:20:21 <lovesausage[m]> <theultron[m] "Just remove fingerprint unlock/f"> As I said using it for my apps is great for unlocking not so much. There is no way of doing this at the moment without root or device managers.

14:00:57 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Android 10 iirc also prevents apps reading non-resettable hardware identifier unless given READ_PRIVILEDGED_PHONE_STATE (not sure if that is the right one)
14:02:00 <dazinism> <lovesausage[m] "Great :) will submit it"> Actually, submitting a patch for 2 factor (fingerprint and pin) lockscreen unlock, allowing long passphrase to be needed for device boots, is what GrapheneOS really wants. Maybe this would also work for you?
14:02:50 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Every single device has closed source components like on firmware anyways, it just depends on how the isolation and mitigation is implemented.
14:02:50 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> I recommend reading grapheneos.org/faq as well

14:06:16 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Not sure if that answers everything, and forgive my tone. Just annoyed of black box crap, as if there is a device without a single component that is closed source

17:09:30 <nikitalita[m]1> arept: basically, if it's not the Verizon model, it's unlocked and the bootloader can be unlocked
17:10:13 <nikitalita[m]1> I don't know if the SKU is different between them
17:18:37 <spoonhoarder82[m> OK, update on WiFi calling: testing with friends SIMs (details above) and finding WiFi calling worked on Verizon, I bought a Verizon SIM.  It does NOT work with WiFi calling on GOS (have not tried stock yet). After many calls to tech support, they basically say it is googles fault for not including some of their required patches in stock image, which sounds like BS to me.
17:18:37 <spoonhoarder82[m> Tried friends SIM again and it works.  The only thing we can figure is that since his SIM was registered on a Verizon phone first, that might have something to do with it on Verizon's back end.
17:18:37 <spoonhoarder82[m> So be warned, WiFi calling on GOS doesn't work out of the box with Verizon. At least not in my case.  If there is anything devs can do (like the guy in the above linked github thread that got WiFi calling working on a Verizon reseller) I'd be very greatful.  Im not technical enough to help sadly.
17:20:19 <spoonhoarder82[m> With Verizon and AT&T getting ready to go VoLTE/WiFi calling only in the nearish future, that's going to be needed anyways. :(
17:29:57 <arept> so its only the verizon model? What do you mean with contract? Sim?
17:37:41 <arept> are the verizon models the only ones with locked bootloaders?

20:53:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Secure boot is good indeed
20:53:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> It prevents untrustworthy kernel code from running
20:53:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> However
20:54:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Your userspace must have additional verification
20:54:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> On grapheneos you are actually using both secure and verified boot
20:55:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is your responsibility to set up verified boot along with verity
20:55:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Secure boot only protects the boot code
20:56:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is not responsible for what that code does
20:56:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> That code must verify the rest of the system

21:48:24 <cn3m[m]> someone would likely have to preplan and make a fake before hand
21:50:02 <cn3m[m]> I don't think it is really easy to make a fake so 48 hours should be enough
21:50:09 <cop-piller[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "hmmm well i was gonna ask about "> You should find out if your local police can legally use your fingerprints without our consent. And also realize that cops frequently will do it anyway even if they know it's illegal, then measure your risks. In some juristictions they will legally force you to provide the fingerprint. Fingerprint also can be faked, so anyone who has a scan of your finger could
21:50:09 <cop-piller[m]> replicate the fingerprint.
21:50:41 <cop-piller[m]> As far as I know making fingerprint copies is fairly easy, I saw it done with clingwrap IIRC
21:50:50 <Jimmehh[m]> well the nation guard is the government lol
21:51:07 <Jimmehh[m]> so thats why i'm concerned
21:51:32 <Jimmehh[m]> another company(plasma donation) has my right middle fingerprint
21:51:46 <gofigga[m]1> Fingerprint readers in phones arent known for their accuracy anyway. Even iohones need something like a 78% match or so
21:51:48 <Jimmehh[m]> and i doubt they wouldn't not give it away if the government told them to
21:51:57 <gofigga[m]1> * Fingerprint readers in phones arent known for their accuracy anyway. Even iphones need something like a 78% match or so
21:54:24 <Jimmehh[m]> but maybe i'm just paranoid
21:54:33 <cop-piller[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "and i doubt they wouldn't not gi"> This can and will be done even if it is illegal. Your only defense is not have sensitive or incriminating information on there.
21:54:50 <Jimmehh[m]> i'm more so worried about the national guard and my index fingerprints
21:55:30 <Jimmehh[m]> hmm i suppose, i guess i don't plan on doing anything really besides browsing the web, playing chess, texting and calling, and listening to music
21:55:52 <Jimmehh[m]> i just don't like knowing they can get access to it like that
21:56:03 <Jimmehh[m]> just doesn't sit right in my stomach
21:57:00 <Jimmehh[m]> the 4a seems like the almost perfect phone(i realized its better than the se in every way besides soc) but having a finger print reader worries me a little
21:57:14 <Jimmehh[m]> at least a rear fingerprint reader
21:57:36 <Jimmehh[m]> but like i said maybe i'm just paranoid
21:57:46 <cop-piller[m]> Think more about your threat model
21:58:31 <Jimmehh[m]> yeah that's true, i can't really go into detail but one thing does worry me
21:58:50 <Jimmehh[m]> but in most situations my threat model is getting away from google and such
21:58:56 <cop-piller[m]> Then this is fine
21:59:12 <Jimmehh[m]> yeah that's true
21:59:14 <cop-piller[m]> Anyway they can beat you until you tell them the password. Even if you don't enable fingerprint.
22:01:49 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> yeah I dont see how fingerprint as biometric is inherently more dangerous than password/code, can someone tell me?
22:01:55 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> face ID? now thats another issue
22:02:00 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> if you are detained
22:05:55 <louipc> i guess thats better for offtopic discussion or no?
22:06:49 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> yeah lol
