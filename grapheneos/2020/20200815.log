00:41:59 <noptys> Is there some setting that turns off the screen when a call is active?  Been using grapheneos on my pixel 3 for months, but only now got around to sticking a SIM card in it. :P
00:42:44 <noptys> Even if I have debugging->keep screen on while charging, and I place an oubound call, as soon as the other end picks up blank screen, power button etc do nothing
00:43:27 <noptys> logcat seems to mirror what I'm seeing.  Most searches for this behavior talk about a Samsung proximity sensor which is obviously not relevant here.
01:00:37 <renlord[m]> <nij "The stock OS stuff you posted.. "> Stock OS is the original OS that shipped with the purchased phone.
01:17:06 <noptys> actually looks like it may be the proximity sensor.  it appears that this functionality can't be disabled?
01:41:41 <noptys> yup, that was the issue, totally embarassing newb-level issue cause too. :)

13:47:48 <alzxjm[m]> randomname: I get better battery on CalyxOS than I did on GrapheneOS. Same phone and same apps.
13:48:12 <alzxjm[m]> Graphene does not have a location provider so all location requests are GPS-only. That can't help.
13:48:23 <alzxjm[m]> Google Cloud Messaging uses less battery, I think.

15:37:17 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> I have a question, do I have to buy unlocked pixel phone to get grapheneos or should I just follow the steps in grapheneos.org/install ??
15:44:36 <nscnt> SECLUDED-M3[m]: Carriers often sell a carrier variant of the device. This disables carrier and bootloader unlocking. If you haven't bought a carrier variant of the phone, it should be unlockable and you're free to install GrapheneOS.
15:45:54 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> <nscnt "SECLUDED-M3: Carriers often sell"> Thanks!
15:50:52 <nscnt> No problem. :)
15:57:20 <nscnt> Not only carriers sell carrier variants. (Correction for myself)
15:57:49 <nscnt> For the protocol :D
15:59:53 <nscnt> {Whatever electronic shop popular in your country} could sell carrier variants, too.
16:08:11 <galyoninion[m]> hi,
16:08:24 <galyoninion[m]> I have questions
16:08:38 <galyoninion[m]> Does Vanadium prevent WebRTC?
16:10:40 <galyoninion[m]> I'm not sure if Chromium-based Vanadium will prevent WebRTC. I was worried when I saw the following sites. So I would like you to tell me if it is prevented properly. Also, please tell me if fingerprinting is also prevented.

16:11:56 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/10/patches/0037-most-private-WebRTC-IP-handling-policy-by-default.patch
16:13:24 <nscnt> galyoninion[m]: Read this for some information: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
16:13:45 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> https://github.com/bromite/bromite/commit/83e140c4f6c76c773f4233ed80d1cb974fda95c5
16:18:50 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> As far as I've used and tested it on Vanadium
16:19:20 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> There wasn't any leak
16:23:42 <strcat[m]> PreloadAL75: the channel does show message history since the point where it was enabled
16:24:34 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> I'm yet to fully understand the difference on these two patches
16:25:13 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: I doubt you get significantly better battery life on CalyxOS and your reasoning makes little sense
16:25:30 <strcat[m]> are you giving apps background location access that are supposed to be constantly accessing location? how is that going to make a difference>?
16:25:35 <strcat[m]>  * are you giving apps background location access that are supposed to be constantly accessing location? how is that going to make a difference?
16:26:06 <strcat[m]> the rest of your reasoning doesn't make sense either
16:27:11 <strcat[m]> + randomname comparing an older Pixel 3's battery life with a Pixel 4 does not make sense either
16:27:22 <strcat[m]>  * + randomname comparing an older Pixel 3's battery life with a Pixel 4 does not make sense either
16:28:31 <strcat[m]> Flowey the Flower: GrapheneOS changes the default to disable peer-to-peer WebRTC routing while not relying on legacy code / functionality marked for removal
16:28:53 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't break the ability for the user to configure it, it just changes the default
16:29:10 <strcat[m]> Bromite uses legacy code and breaks the implementation with an invasive way of doing it
16:29:24 <strcat[m]> I suggested that they do it properly but it wasn't adopted due to fear of changing what was already tested
16:29:55 <strcat[m]> in general, that's why Bromite patches are not simply adopted by Vanadium, because for Vanadium they need to be done properly in a way that's robust, does not interfere with other things and will be maintainable in the long term
16:30:19 <strcat[m]> and unfortunately there is not much interest from others in helping with that so assorted things are not ported over
16:33:32 <strcat[m]> SECLUDED-M3: the only bootloader locked variant of Pixels is the Verizon carrier variant, other carriers do not have a setup like that
16:34:01 <strcat[m]> there are the regional variants (for some devices) and then Verizon Pixels, there's nothing else
16:34:23 <strcat[m]> if it's not a Verizon Pixel, the bootloader can be unlocked, people suggesting otherwise are wrong
16:36:28 <strcat[m]>  * + randomname comparing an older Pixel 3's battery life with a Pixel 4 does not make sense either, especially with only the Pixel 3 with GrapheneOS running Signal, that's *hardly* a comparison between CalyxOS and GrapheneOS battery life
16:36:37 <strcat[m]>  * + randomname comparing an older Pixel 3's battery life with a Pixel 4 does not make sense either, especially with only the Pixel 3 with GrapheneOS running Signal, that's hardly a comparison between CalyxOS and GrapheneOS battery life
16:42:00 <nscnt> Ah, I didn't know the Verizon pixel was the only one. Good to know.
16:43:04 <nscnt> Why isn't it specified in the guide then?
16:43:48 <nscnt> Ye, mhh... No buying guide. Keeping it general, I guess.
16:46:54 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Avoid models that are Verizon
16:46:54 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Also, for precaution, avoid refurbished phones

19:54:23 <whywelive> hello guys what app do you use for navigation
19:55:14 <whywelive> i have 2 phones one graphene for private and one calyx os for work so in case any one saw me asking same question in their channel
20:03:01 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <whywelive "hello guys what app do you use f"> OsmAnd+ is the winner here: https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus
20:20:56 <whywelive> is using google maps in web browser a good idea
20:32:10 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <whywelive "is using google maps in web brow"> The answer is _maybe_, but I would still suggest using OpenStreetMap for reasons
20:32:39 <eveningbeetle[m]> Magic earth is a good option as well.
21:11:27 <nickcalyx[m]> <whywelive "is using google maps in web brow"> Its ok
22:56:49 <abff> the one downside to the search for a good map is that google is basically the only company with the data to make a map worth using.
22:58:33 <abff> osm is accurate georgraphically but you lose all of the locations by name, as well as driving and transit interop
23:29:32 <Terrel357> OsmAnd is definitely the winner and i have completely replaced Google maps Navigation it is accurate with navigation and of course you don't need a data connection for it.
