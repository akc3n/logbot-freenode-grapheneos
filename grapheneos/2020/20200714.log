01:37:26 <fomijafi[m]> Hi all, I'm new to both GOS and Android. It seems like the background connection for signal does not connect after a restart until I open the app for the first time. Is there a way to auto start that connection so I can disable the notification?
01:47:23 <cn3m[m]> javashin: the g7 line doesn't support custom verified boot last I heard
01:49:13 <defconanon010102> <fomijafi[m] "Hi all, I'm new to both GOS and "> Tell me is your goal to hide Signal?
01:50:08 <defconanon010102> If so how much or you just want the the push notification disabled completely?
01:50:24 <fomijafi[m]> No just to hide the always present notification. I find it obnoxious coming from iphone
01:50:58 <fomijafi[m]> But when its hidden I sometimes forget to open the app after a restart and miss a bunch of messagea
01:51:04 <fomijafi[m]> * But when its hidden I sometimes forget to open the app after a restart and miss a bunch of messages
01:51:54 <defconanon010102> fomijafi: Go into app settings by holding the app. An option should pop up. You should see notifications at the top and you can go from there.
01:52:20 <defconanon010102> down*
01:53:49 <fomijafi[m]> I know how to disable the notification. When it's disabled, I sometimes don't realize I have no background connection. Do I just need to grow up and live with the notification?
01:55:13 <defconanon010102> fomijafi: Um I have an idea. When you are on WiFi you can use put yourself in airplane mode. Shut down Signal completely cause it is uneeded.
01:55:30 <cn3m[m]> It is unclear what you want fomijafi:
01:55:42 <cn3m[m]> ELI5?
01:55:56 <javashin> cn3m[m], how
01:56:05 <fomijafi[m]> A process to automatically start the background connection after a restart
01:56:07 <defconanon010102> fomijafi: To clarify you can use WiFi with Airplane Mode.
01:56:54 <cn3m[m]> javashin: to have meaningful security on Android you want verified boot, remote attestation, rollback protection. All things you can only get a "stock OS"
01:57:02 <defconanon010102> fomijafi: You would have to live with the background connection notification when you use data of course.
01:57:04 <cn3m[m]> Pixels let you change the key so GrapheneOS is the "stock" OS
01:57:41 <defconanon010102> Using Airplane mode also turns off your radios.
01:58:34 <javashin>  /etc/init.mmi.hab.rc ?
01:59:03 <javashin> cn3m[m] well but i only want to patch the kernel
01:59:07 <fomijafi[m]> <defconanon010102 "Using Airplane mode also turns o"> That's a creative idea! Probably just as much trouble to remember to do that, though
01:59:07 <javashin> and be secure
01:59:13 <javashin> while using the phone
01:59:16 <javashin> with any rom
01:59:24 <cn3m[m]> javashin: you are by far more secure on the stock OS
01:59:38 <cn3m[m]> Unlocking the bootloader is not wise for security
01:59:56 <cn3m[m]> Unless your device supports custom verified boot keys
02:00:09 <defconanon010102> <fomijafi[m] "That's a creative idea! Probably"> It takes practice but you will get it in grained in your memory. I believing you. ^^
02:00:59 <cn3m[m]> The Motorola X4 is the only Motorola phone confirmed to do so and that was an Android One device. javashin: It is possible the G7 could support it
02:01:09 <cn3m[m]> it is not confirmed and there is no evidence
02:01:30 <cn3m[m]> in general you are best off with the stock OS for security

02:30:56 <javashin> oh gosh
02:30:59 <javashin> 4real
02:33:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> javashin: buy a supported device
02:33:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or find one that meets the requirements
02:34:09 <javashin> which are ?
02:34:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> The pixels
02:34:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Android one maybe in the future
02:35:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oneplus has support through glassrom
02:36:37 <BalooRJ> Pixel 3, 3a, and 4
02:36:51 <BalooRJ> 4 is in the works apparently. But just buy a 3 or 3a
02:37:13 <f8sai[m]> Or if you can wait for 4a
02:37:24 <f8sai[m]> (But not guaranteed will be supported that quickly)
02:37:58 <BalooRJ> I love my 3a with GrapheneOS, has worked great. It's going to be a diceroll now finding one with OEM Unlocking but its worth it
02:38:04 <BalooRJ> I bought mine at Best Buy brand new
02:38:45 <sphinxpy[m]> Same. Best buy was the only place i had luck with after trying a few from amazon and ebay

02:47:02 <cn3m[m]> It shouldn't be that hard

02:57:10 <cn3m[m]> looking
04:13:22 <botter_otter> if I ordered a Pixel 3a from Amazon that was labelled as unlocked, should it be OEM unlocked as well and not just carrier unlocked?
04:13:47 <f8sai[m]> <botter_otter "if I ordered a Pixel 3a from Ama"> Yeah
04:14:28 <botter_otter> good, ty. was kinda worried, looking in the chat log it seems like a few people have had trouble with that
04:14:53 <f8sai[m]> ask for pics
04:15:25 <CaptainPicard[m]> It should be. If you're buying second hand on there make sure that it's not a verizon model and you should be fine
04:15:29 <f8sai[m]> Ask them to update the Pixel, then check OEM unlock (this is the pic that you need)
04:15:46 <botter_otter> wasn't second-hand, looks like it went right from Google to Amazon
04:15:47 <f8sai[m]> <CaptainPicard[m] "It should be. If you're buying s"> Also, ask for pics on regulatory labels
04:16:17 <CaptainPicard[m]> If it's new just make sure it's an unlocked model and you should be fine
04:16:21 <f8sai[m]> For 3a, it shoudn't end in E
04:16:35 <CaptainPicard[m]> The important thing is know there's a difference between BOOTLOADER unlocked and CARRIER unlocked
04:16:41 <botter_otter> yeah
04:16:54 <botter_otter> model is labelled as unlocked so I kinda assumed it was both, didn't really think to check ahead of time
04:17:26 <botter_otter> at the very least it's definitely carrier unlocked
04:17:33 <rover1[m]> usually only refer carrier unlock
04:17:48 <rover1[m]> most dont know what bootloader unlock is
04:18:02 <botter_otter> dang
04:18:14 <botter_otter> I hope this refers to both since it's brand new and not second-hand
04:18:25 <botter_otter> ig I'll find out when it arrives
04:18:42 <CaptainPicard[m]> As long as it's not a verizon model I think it's fine. I guess just make sure you can get a refund if you don't trust the seller
04:20:29 <botter_otter> far as I can tell it should be a fully unlocked model
04:20:48 <botter_otter> ty guys for responding lol
04:21:45 <CaptainPicard[m]> No problem! Feel freee to hit us up with any other GrapheneOS related questions
04:22:29 <botter_otter> will do, ty
06:21:24 <jalb> Google ‘accidentally’ leaks the Pixel 4a in its own store. $350??? :-o https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2020/07/13/google-accidentally-leaks-the-pixel-4a-in-its-own-store/
06:22:58 <defconanon010102> jalb: There is a rumor going around saying that Google is not even going to make the Pixel 4a XL. Cause they want you to use Pixel 5 XL instead.
06:24:07 <jalb> defconanon010102, interesting, who knows
06:24:25 <jalb> Even a possible Pixel 3a 5G?... WTF
06:31:18 <wd40[m]> defconanon010102: I've read this. For marketing Google will wait for the 5 to release 5G
06:32:37 <wd40[m]> I guess they think that's clever. Not sure if that's solid
06:33:37 <defconanon010102> Pixel 4 doesn't even have a fingerprint scanner. Is Google taking a different security route for future devices?
06:33:42 <defconanon010102> It seems like it.
06:33:57 <wd40[m]> There is no 4 XL at the moment
06:34:28 <wd40[m]> 4a I would say
06:34:37 <cn3m[m]> there is a 4 XL
06:34:53 <wd40[m]> cn3m: correct

06:43:08 <defconanon010102> wd40: I used KeePass DX and haven't had this issue. Pretty interesting. Though I have used Auditor. I really wonder if Auditor bugs you if you haven't used it?

07:04:13 <defconanon010102> wd40: Really this depends on your threat model. You should trust Vanadium when it comes to security and read into Vanadium a lot more honestly if you are truly if afraid of listening to music through Vanadium.

08:43:05 <cn3m[m]> switch users
08:43:19 <pikey[m]> wow. didn't know switch users could be done before unlocked. brill, will have a fiddle with it thanks
08:43:22 <pikey[m]> (and the phone)
08:43:40 <wd40[m]> pikey: people have different issues and need their phones
08:44:31 <cn3m[m]> np
08:44:37 <defconanon010102> I think having multiple devices for different usage is a great strategy to have.
08:45:01 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon010102 "I think having multiple devices "> it is not
08:45:11 <wd40[m]> defconanon010102:agreed
08:45:12 <defconanon010102> cn3m: I disagree.
08:45:37 <cn3m[m]> random flipphones are very insecure
08:45:43 <pikey[m]> yeah i have other strategies, but i have a very specific need which i discovered the other night. I need my PIXEL to be able to be used by a dependant relative (for one example) just in event of emergency.
08:45:44 <cn3m[m]> that could be a constant tracker
08:46:17 <wd40[m]> Take the secondary batters out
08:46:38 <defconanon010102> cn3m: You can make a flip phone pretty secure. Also, yeah you can take out of the battery for one.
08:47:50 <pikey[m]> <cn3m[m] "it is not"> I agree. It's like linux. It CAN be secured, if run by someone very competent of all the vulns and exploits. But for a dumb user, Linux is not a wise move for security. Similarly, multiple phones give me (and people I know) many more ways to be tracked in ways I wouldn't even have the konwledge to understand. So for ME, Pixel running Graphene, puts all my security eggs in one basket, a basket weaved
08:47:50 <pikey[m]> by someone I can trust rather than home brewed by me (and my lacking knowledge). So for me, I argee, more devices equals more risks, of mistakes by me if nothingt else. Thanks cn3m. this looks a workable solution. :)
08:49:35 <pikey[m]> anyway, this was a specific OS question hence why i posted it here instead of off topic room. Got my answer, cheers all
08:50:09 <wd40[m]> Just flash then watch the battery activity. Learn it screen on time and you'll know what's happening
08:52:00 <wd40[m]> This is a  solid flash. Worst thing , flash again and fight back
08:54:43 <wd40[m]> Its a pain to park for an enemy to waste time . be prepared to reflash brothers and sisters.
08:57:05 <wd40[m]> My favorite flash isolated apk
09:00:57 <dazinism> theultron: some details of how to verify apps https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Verifying_apk_files_and_apps
09:01:29 <wd40[m]> I read that crazy shit about how thin argumentative man Dan did this cool shit. All you you guys have got me stoked. I'm lame so money is all I have to offer. All love devs
09:03:00 <pikey[m]> <wd40[m] "Its a pain to park for an enemy "> I don't think I have understood a single one of your messages! Have you joined the off topic room? I think your posts would be better placed there
09:03:05 <wd40[m]> Haha. I'm at a party trying to tell my bros why our privacy  is so important.
09:03:17 <pikey[m]> <wd40[m] "Haha. I'm at a party trying to t"> Figures.
09:03:51 <pikey[m]> https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
09:04:03 <wd40[m]> pikey: talking about bakers using base stations
09:05:21 <pikey[m]> cn3m: Glad you got me looking at user switching from lock screen! I just found Guest, I tapped on it and got a new user account, but in teh calls I could see all calls made and received from my main profile. Time to turn that shit off perhaps!! thanks - you're idea will work a treat. Its mainly for family to be able to call other family, but wkthout having to learn my crazy long pin or adding fingerprint.
09:05:37 <wd40[m]> These guys don't care at all
09:07:43 <wd40[m]> Yeah Bakers
09:08:53 <wd40[m]> Apps using permissions to exploit otherbapps and use side channels
09:09:00 <mxnorvak[m]> Any idea why so many well known apps in F-droid are described as unknown ?
09:09:39 <pikey[m]> wd40: This room is for dev and help with installs/usage of Graphene. They just set up https://riot.im/app/#/room/#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org to give GOS users a place to chat about other stuff, I recommend you shift over there
09:10:23 <pikey[m]> (Consider the devs who support Graphene, they have to skim through all of this every day to check for real support queries and bugs etc )
09:12:39 <wd40[m]> I'll. Exit was learning but im dumb. Love  you . thanks
09:21:00 <wd40[m]> Funny my band  is played  on  ClearChannel  and I promote this cause.
09:51:13 <pikey[m]> I set up a second user for family. I found that fingerprints can be setup, but with the obligatory passcode for first time use (which will be the one they use in emergency, so fingerprint not much use really). I am a bit concerned though, I found that the second user can view all SMS messages I have received and sent on main account, yet the phone call history is not shown (which is good). I doubt it but if there is any
09:51:13 <pikey[m]> way around that I would love to know.
09:53:48 <pikey[m]> I will have a very unsecure pin code for family which means my texts will be easily viewed, I may even have to stick a label on back of phone with that pin code which i hoped would only allow access to a fresh user account with no access to any data from my main account.
09:55:38 <pikey[m]> damn it also has access to all calls made/received
10:02:56 <dazinism> pikey: think you can maybe add a contact to emergency information then anyone can call them from your lock screen
10:03:00 <dazinism> I've never tried
10:03:55 <dazinism> Settings > about phone > emergency info
10:04:57 <pikey[m]> That's EXACTLY what I was wanting to do but didn't think you could. I dont need second accounts for others. Basically just wanted a way for someone like my friends kids to call not just emergency but my family if I fell off a bridge or something ilke that. I dont intend to of course :D. Something simple for a kid, i.e. not a complex password and second account etc. An added emergency number would be damn perfect!
10:07:30 <pikey[m]>  * That's EXACTLY what I was wanting to do but didn't think you could. An added emergency number would be damn perfect!
10:20:05 <pikey[m]> Daz, as usual, you're a diamond. That's working nicely thanks!
10:28:06 <strcat[m]> pikey: if someone has physical control of your SIM card they can send/receive calls and texts as you
10:28:33 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't do sensitive things via traditional calls and texts for other reasons because they are unencrypted and texts are stored by carriers / intermediaries
10:28:42 <strcat[m]> they could do the same for calls, they certainly do for all the metadata
10:29:03 <strcat[m]> they aren't end-to-end encrypted but not just that: there is no real semblance of privacy for traditional calls / texts
10:29:46 <strcat[m]> if you use multiple user accounts, the secondary accounts don't change which SIM card is inserted into your phone
10:29:55 <strcat[m]> you can see in the user configuration options there are related options for this
10:30:13 <strcat[m]> anyway someone can just take that out and put it in another phone
10:30:56 <strcat[m]> just stop thinking your traditional calls/texts are private, at the very least assume some nosy person at the carrier will misuse their access to look at people's conversations and pictures they send
10:31:13 <strcat[m]> don't have conversations with ppl via traditional texts
10:31:57 <strcat[m]> traditional calls / texts are a legacy feature for backwards compatibility not something you should use whenever not dealing with something like a government agency stuck in their ways
10:32:05 <SchismXL[m]> <strcat[m] "don't have conversations with pp"> Problem with the USA as a whole. When I lived there, everyone still loves using SMS.
10:32:24 <strcat[m]> if you're talking to a friend, family, your lawyer or whatever there is no reason you should be using traditional telephony texts / calls
10:32:38 <strcat[m]> SchismXL: maybe for people 30+
10:32:58 <SchismXL[m]> Shh, now you're showing my age!
10:34:52 <SchismXL[m]> But yeah, not sure about the young hip kids and their communication, but I assume it'd be other systems that can be snooped on. WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc.
10:35:14 <strcat[m]> WhatsApp is E2E encrypted
10:35:41 <strcat[m]> facebook said they're going to do E2E encryption for all their messaging systems so they can't moderate it and can save money
10:36:34 <strcat[m]> where people in the chat can still report something via the client (gives them decryption keys for that)
10:36:44 <strcat[m]> but they can't actively moderate it which I think is why they like E2E encryption
10:36:50 <strcat[m]> so they can absolve themselves of that responsibility
10:38:58 <strcat[m]> also they're merging all their chat clients into facebook to bypass regulation where they get in trouble for merging contacts / metadata across them etc.
10:39:00 <SchismXL[m]> Good to know about Facebook. Knew about WhatsApp, but there is an inherent distrust that I can't shake off. Such as the app being closed source and apparently reporting back metadata, such as who was communicating with who, where, when, how many times you open the app etc.
10:39:01 <SchismXL[m]> In the "wrong" hands, a picture could be built up of your communication methods and could potentially be used as evidence. Not that my memes would be cause for concern, but that's not the point
10:39:20 <strcat[m]> sure but the messages themselves are e2e encrypted
10:39:31 <strcat[m]> and not available to tons of carriers and people working for them
10:39:47 <strcat[m]>  * rather than not just metadata but also data being available to tons of carriers and people working for them
10:40:07 <SchismXL[m]> Yeah, gotcha
10:40:09 <strcat[m]> using SMS is way, way worse
10:40:19 <strcat[m]> the 'security'
10:40:28 <strcat[m]> of the traditional telephony system is non-existent
10:40:35 <SchismXL[m]> Which makes me laugh with 2FA using SMS
10:40:47 <SchismXL[m]> Some companies using SMS for 2FA*
10:40:51 <strcat[m]> lots of people can intercept your messages, send fake messages as you, obtain the logs
10:40:54 <strcat[m]> not just your carrier
10:41:15 <SchismXL[m]> Oh, absolutely
10:42:15 <SchismXL[m]> Stingray, whatever it is called is just one. Your carrier would be able to see all anyways.
10:47:55 <pikey[m]> <strcat[m] "pikey: if someone has physical c"> ha, I never even thought of that. Yes I get all of that about calls/texts being open. I am not having any sensitive calls/texts as such, I put all that through signal etc. But I still like to not have random people able to view my calls and texts, however few of them there are, they are still mine. Hence I didn't like the fact a guest accohut could be set up and view all
10:47:55 <pikey[m]> those calls, durations, times etc. It's not the end of the world, but would prefer not to have that available. I found that you can turn off the guest account which sorted that anyway :). I took a friend's kids somewhere the other day, rock climbing. It occurred to me that I was the only one with a phone, left in my bag. I wanted a way (for that situagtion and others simiar) for anyone to use my phone to make a call, but
10:47:55 <pikey[m]> not only to 911, also maybe to their parents or whatever. That's where this came from. Dazinism's suggestion sorted it nicely. I can add emergency contacts as and when needed which is very cool :)
10:48:36 <strcat[m]> guest account is off by default
10:49:46 <pikey[m]> I will never, no matter how long I live, use any product owned by Facebook! E2E means nothing when it's spoken by the likes of MS or FB. Even if it is 100% secure, at the very least I wont use it on principal of their business model and past history of snooping. Even if they stopped doing it, which I am certain they never will
10:50:25 <pikey[m]> <strcat[m] "guest account is off by default"> yes I must have turned it on when I was playing around after installation.
11:12:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> pikey: then you might as well not use grapheneos
11:12:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because parts of Linux are written by Facebook
11:12:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seriously. Such made up ad hominems don't really belong here
11:18:46 * pikey[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tMQkqbDVBiJtSggoTMEogrgY >
11:31:27 <pikey[m]> > <@byolog:matrix.org> May I ask whether it's safe or not to install some apps like Gboard from Aurora store without network permission in grapheneos?
11:31:27 <pikey[m]> > Thanks
11:31:27 <pikey[m]> I have heard of others installing that from Aurora so I know some consider it safe enough. I haven't tried it myself
11:37:55 <SchismXL[m]> As long as you don't have the network permissions switched on, @byolog:matrix.org, you should be fine.
11:40:57 <g65434-2[m]> default keyboard / Anysoftkeyboard are good enough though
11:45:10 <pikey[m]> whats better about gboard
11:45:38 <g65434-2[m]> more permissions to get tracked, probably
11:46:11 <f8sai[m]> > <@byolog:matrix.org> May I ask whether it's safe or not to install some apps like Gboard from Aurora store without network permission in grapheneos?
11:46:11 <f8sai[m]> > Thanks
11:46:11 <f8sai[m]> Mostly it's for missing languagues tbh
11:46:30 <f8sai[m]> <byolog[m] "I'm using it now without any per"> Nice
11:47:02 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tahaMiHLjjEKNkMbTJzUHnWh >
11:47:49 <f8sai[m]> Idk, fb-owned apps aren't really welcomed here.
11:47:49 <f8sai[m]> Contributions by them are quite inevitable due to open source nature of aosp
11:48:50 <f8sai[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "> <@pikey:matrix.org> is graphen"> Quite obvious lol, Google kills Google afaik
11:49:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just kill the network permission
11:49:39 <f8sai[m]> Probably, but inter-app communication may bypass that INTERNET (Network) permission
11:49:55 <f8sai[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Just kill the network permission"> But this is the best one can do
11:50:36 <g65434-2[m]> you can also avoid said app so you're sure you aren't getting tracked 🤔
11:51:14 <f8sai[m]> <g65434-2[m] "you can also avoid said app so y"> Or isolate it in one profile where you need it, unless you want it as main keyboard
11:51:40 <f8sai[m]> AOSP keyboard is good enough, idk what they are looking for besides the swipe
11:53:24 <dazinism> byolog: apps can still see stuff about the system they are running on
11:53:55 <dazinism>  https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/what-can-apps-see
11:54:44 <dazinism> And they can communicate with other apps
11:54:49 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/inter-app-comms
11:56:25 <dazinism> Its possible that they can reach the internet by another app. But both apps have to allow this
12:00:54 <f8sai[m]> Try again.
12:01:03 <f8sai[m]> Otherwise, reflasj
12:01:10 <f8sai[m]> <f8sai[m] "Try again."> if it still fails, reflash
12:01:57 <f8sai[m]> But it seems the date isn't synchronized?
12:02:10 <f8sai[m]> On both devices
12:02:31 <f8sai[m]> <gretai[m] "i did try many times, then i ref"> Do you have different pc? Or you may want to redownload
12:02:52 <f8sai[m]> (It could be that the flashed os is potentially compromised)
12:03:45 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "> <@pikey:matrix.org> is graphen"> I think I explained my position well enough to make that question purely rhetorical. I don't use the android created by google, i use the one which has passed through the hands of people I trust to remove the scary parts of google's OS, one which was given a new name and logo and is very different, which you of course know. I wouldn't use the one created by google
12:03:45 <pikey[m]> without such modifications, hence I use a thing called "Graphene OS", instead of stock Android OS. If Graphene didn't exist, I wouldn't be using Google's Android. I did clearly say "owned by" not "has a historical connection to".  Enough said I think.
12:04:24 <dazinism> Strange. Maybe try audit with another device or with attestation.app
12:05:16 <f8sai[m]> <gretai[m] "i verified with signify-openbsd "> Hmmm
12:09:41 <dazinism> gretai: may have to wait for strcat to turn up, they wrote auditor and best understand it.
12:09:58 <f8sai[m]> <gretai[m] "i tried another device, same pro"> (On attestation?)
12:10:13 <dazinism> Don't remember anyone else having this problem
12:10:26 <f8sai[m]> I'm willing to offer some help to scan your code if you need it
12:10:46 <f8sai[m]> (It has to be screenshot btw)
12:11:35 <f8sai[m]> (Kinda tested it on three devices, auditor, auditee and the channel of message)
12:12:22 <pikey[m]> I had a lot of problems getting attestation to work on one pixel, but not the other. I never confirmed the problem but its working now. I was using PIA VPN app and I think that was part of the problem (if not all of it). I changed ports a few times and its worked since then. Are you using VPN by any chance?
12:13:08 <pikey[m]> oh, don't you need to connect to submit the remote attestation?
12:13:25 <f8sai[m]> <pikey[m] "oh, don't you need to connect to"> For remote, connection is required ofc
12:15:02 <pikey[m]> <gretai[m] "booting now. do i immediately di"> i would
12:15:03 <f8sai[m]> Yes
12:15:11 <f8sai[m]> Don't connect to internet first ofc
12:15:24 <f8sai[m]> If local attestation would be done
12:15:51 <pikey[m]> wouldn't have thought that would prevent it checking the OS, but try adding it anyway
12:16:26 <f8sai[m]> <gretai[m] "do i need a screen lock?"> Not exactly
12:16:37 <f8sai[m]> It scans it whenever you have it or not on a normal attestation
12:17:05 <f8sai[m]> <f8sai[m] "It scans it whenever you have it"> Auditor scans it*
12:20:09 <f8sai[m]> Good luck ^^
12:21:47 <f8sai[m]> <gretai[m] "maybe the zip was corrupted when"> Probably
12:21:56 <f8sai[m]> I use winrar
12:23:00 <f8sai[m]> <gretai[m] "i only need to run flash-all.sh "> Afaik yes
12:24:46 <f8sai[m]> Alright
12:24:55 <f8sai[m]> Pm me
12:27:24 <dazinism> gretai: safest is to closely follow the install instructions on grapheneos.org for extracting the zip
12:28:17 <dazinism> ...well for the whole installation
12:30:05 <dazinism> Although if its booting with the bootloader locked, you pretty much are guaranteed to have the exact same OS as everyone else on GrapheneOS
12:30:56 <dazinism> Unless you've been exploited by a pro
12:32:55 <dazinism> given you've checked with signify
12:36:20 <dazinism> Dont recall there being any real problems with any version.
12:38:37 <dazinism> ???
12:39:39 <mrxx_0[m]> People using the 3 or 3XL with GrapheneOS, can you use both of the front camera ? The normal and the wide angle ?
12:39:39 <dazinism> That may do it. You need to see the yellow warning screen while it boots
12:39:51 <dazinism> mrxx_0: yeah
12:39:53 <pikey[m]> <mrxx_0[m] "People using the 3 or 3XL with G"> ha, i didn't know it had two!}
12:40:12 <dazinism> Maybe even three front cameras?
12:40:40 <pikey[m]> camera problems are one of the few persistent ones i have with Graphene. I can certainly live with it but would be great if that was solved at some point
12:41:10 <NorbertTretkowsk> <mrxx_0[m] "People using the 3 or 3XL with G"> Yes, but thb I only realized it once when doing a video call with Conversations, which is able to jump through all cameras.
12:42:11 <dazinism> On open camera you can cycle thru the cameras (it often crashes my 3xl doing this)
12:43:04 <NorbertTretkowsk> <dazinism "On open camera you can cycle thr"> Indeed! Never realized that... but it works.
12:43:53 <pikey[m]> <dazinism "On open camera you can cycle thr"> me too.
12:46:49 <dazinism> gretai: if you are seeing the yellow screen, I think that you can only have the GrapheneOS signing key stored, not the android 11 one. Thats flashed during flash-all.sh
12:51:47 <dazinism> gretai: its a weird issue and if you see the yellow boot screen (not the orange one)I think much more likely to be something to do with auditor than your installation
12:54:09 <dazinism> Possibly otherwise dodgy camera hardware?
12:54:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> dazinism:
12:54:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yellow means booting with a custom key
12:55:45 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: yeah exactly
13:12:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
13:13:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> gretai: make sure you verified your download
13:29:23 <dazinism> gretai: think if the GrapheneOS install worked you'll be on the latest firmware & that is just to ensure that all known bug fixes for flashing are in the device
13:30:25 <dazinism> I'm really grasping at straws,  but wonder if installing android 11 changed something that flashing GrapheneOS didnt change back
13:30:38 <dazinism> But feels unlikely
13:32:02 <dazinism> gretai: best bet is to wait for strcat to comment... or maybe open an issue on the auditor github giving all details
13:32:24 <strcat[m]> comment on what?
13:32:35 <strcat[m]> not reading scrollback
13:33:16 <strcat[m]> as you can see it failed to flash the bootloader
13:33:18 <strcat[m]> above
13:33:23 <strcat[m]> and then failed because it failed to flash the bootloader
13:35:25 <dazinism> strcat: apparently the device is booting and showing yellow screen but phone <>phone auditor is failing
13:35:46 <strcat[m]> makes sense if it's got the wrong firmware version
13:35:55 <strcat[m]> that boot screen shows you if the OS is verified
13:35:58 <strcat[m]> has nothing to do with firmware
13:36:03 <strcat[m]> I don't see anything weird
13:36:23 <strcat[m]> gretai: it's letting you know something is wrong, and something is wrong
13:36:56 <strcat[m]> I'd suggest flashing GrapheneOS and then trying to sideload the latest GrapheneOS OTA (corresponding to the version you flashed) two times
13:37:05 <strcat[m]> gretai: well in the output you can see it didn't flash properly
13:37:18 <strcat[m]> did you use fastboot by hand the first time instead of the flash-all script?
13:38:31 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you mean
13:38:49 <strcat[m]> what do you have installed?
13:39:08 <strcat[m]> sounds like you somehow how a screwed up inconsistent install
13:39:14 <strcat[m]> maybe you used an out-of-date fastboot? I don't know
13:41:29 <strcat[m]> flash GrapheneOS again
13:41:35 <strcat[m]> look at the output from flash-all.sh though
13:41:42 <strcat[m]> it's important to look at the output
13:43:20 <strcat[m]> it's possible your device just won't work properly until Android R stable is released and we move to it
13:43:45 <strcat[m]> if the bootloader can't be properly downgraded or it did some weird migration
13:43:50 <strcat[m]> maybe the Android R beta has a serious bug
13:43:55 <strcat[m]> maybe the device is just screwed over now
13:43:56 <strcat[m]> I don't know
13:44:40 <strcat[m]> dunno what you did
13:44:48 <strcat[m]> and I wouldn't recommend using the developer previews
13:46:25 <strcat[m]> if your device doesn't pass Auditor checks it has something wrong
13:46:45 <strcat[m]> firmware releases have a low-level rollback index that's irreversible
13:46:55 <strcat[m]> can't always roll back to arbitrary versions of firmware
13:47:07 <strcat[m]> there are rollback fuses for firmware
13:47:16 <strcat[m]> if you flash experimental firmware you're taking a risk
13:47:37 <strcat[m]> you need to flash the stable GrapheneOS release and show the output
13:52:41 <strcat[m]> now boot up recovery and sideload the GrapheneOS full OTA update package 2x
13:52:56 <strcat[m]> just to flash all the stuff again via the OS
13:52:59 <strcat[m]> in both slots
13:53:05 <strcat[m]> well
13:53:13 <strcat[m]> boot up recovery, sideload, then reboot into the OS
13:53:19 <strcat[m]> then boot up recovery and sideload again
13:53:23 <strcat[m]> hope that makes sense
13:56:18 <strcat[m]> like it's totally possible the beta had screwed up Titan M firmware and triggered some tamper thing
13:56:26 <strcat[m]> you didn't show the error you got from Auditor
13:56:36 <strcat[m]> it does show the error
13:56:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: most likely some kind of rollback index in titan itself?
13:58:09 <strcat[m]> perhaps, I don't know what happened
13:58:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> gretai: you can try formatting data in recovery?
13:58:21 <strcat[m]> if they had a serial debug cable they could get Titan M logs (there's a way to get them)
13:58:26 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "like it's totally possible the b"> Does flashing the os on your storage alter the titan firmware..?
13:58:26 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: they should follow my suggestion 1st
13:58:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: k
13:58:54 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: flashing GrapheneOS factory images is not just flashing the OS
13:58:58 <strcat[m]> it's flashing all of the SoC firmware too
13:59:03 <strcat[m]> Titan M firmware is uploaded by the OS
13:59:32 <strcat[m]> it can't necessarily be downgraded in certain cases where vulnerabilities are fixed even when unlocked
13:59:47 <strcat[m]> it's also possible whatever developer preview they flashed triggered some anti-tamper feature due to a bug
13:59:49 <strcat[m]> I don't know
13:59:54 <strcat[m]> they didn't post an error message from Auditor
13:59:56 <strcat[m]> I can only guess / speculate
14:00:08 <strcat[m]> I'm not psychic
14:01:35 <strcat[m]> I've seen 1 other person who had Auditor failing with the stock OS on Pixel 3 and it may be a similar situation where dev preview screwed something up
14:01:51 <strcat[m]> but I was unable to debug it since I don't have the device and debugging remotely through a non-developer doesn't really work
14:03:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: how to see titan M logs?
14:04:24 <strcat[m]> use debug cable
14:04:26 <strcat[m]> when unlocked
14:04:32 <strcat[m]> you may have to flip it backwards, forget
14:04:36 <blacklight447[m]> Ah right
14:04:37 <strcat[m]> it calls itself "citadel"
14:05:02 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the debug cable provides output from firmware, citadel and kernel but not necessarily in same mode
14:05:13 <strcat[m]> I don't know if the debug cables TheJollyRoger makes provide citadel output on Pixel 3 atm
14:05:15 <strcat[m]> but you can try
14:05:31 <strcat[m]> there may also be a fastboot oem command to run when unlocked
14:05:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> grep -i citadel?
14:05:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: possible you can get some output when locked too
14:05:50 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it won't be in the kernel logs, it will look different
14:06:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: does fastboot -w wipe titan M like recovery?
14:07:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> gretai: try a simple data wipe in recovery
14:07:34 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it gets wiped when locking/unlocking or doing factory reset - but wiped means wiping the regular persistent state
14:07:45 <strcat[m]> there are fuses that can't be wiped just like the firmware on the SoC
14:07:47 <strcat[m]> they can only be set, not unset
14:08:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> I mean you have 30 minutes anyway
14:08:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> gretai: don't care what's faster
14:08:34 <strcat[m]> he'll have to lock again to see if auditor works
14:09:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Locking from recovery doesn't need relock and tbh
14:09:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Stock OS seems to force a recovery wipe to downgrade to the best of my knowledge
14:10:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Wiping from recovery doesn't need relock and tbh
14:11:19 <strcat[m]> he needs to relock to test if Auditor works or he can't see if it's fixed
14:11:25 <strcat[m]> and I don't really think wiping is going to do anything
14:11:41 <strcat[m]> I don't think it will be fixable but it depends on what the Auditor error was - they didn't show that, so seeing it would be useful
14:12:03 <strcat[m]> maybe it just failed because the clock was set wrong - don't know why at this point without seeing the error
14:21:08 <dazinism> strcat: their auditor screen shot https://matrix.to/#/!omAJrepvwSfkXJrqbK:matrix.org/$15947280072134biZMs:librem.one
14:27:22 <strcat[m]> which says certificate verification failed
14:27:24 <strcat[m]> which is very strange
14:27:37 <strcat[m]> makes it seem like the device is either broken or compromised
14:27:49 <strcat[m]> it's not a failure based on the attestation data but rather the attestation certificate chain not validating
14:28:46 <strcat[m]> maybe some newer devices have a new attestation root but I haven't seen that myself
14:28:51 <strcat[m]> not much I can about it
14:28:55 <strcat[m]> I can't debug remotely
14:28:57 <strcat[m]> sorry
14:29:58 <strcat[m]> yes it appears that there's a new root certificate that they added
14:30:00 <strcat[m]> which we haven't whitelisted yet
14:30:04 <strcat[m]> that could be the issue

14:31:22 <strcat[m]> help wanted, Auditor isn't really actively developed atm
15:04:11 <strcat[m]> gretai: lock the device with GrapheneOS again
15:04:16 <strcat[m]> I have an Auditor build to install on both devices to test
15:04:17 <strcat[m]> can you do that?
15:12:11 <strcat[m]> I need someone impacted by this to test it or I can't resolve it
15:17:06 <strcat[m]> let me know
15:17:17 <strcat[m]> moving on to something else for now
15:19:08 <strcat[m]> gretai: flash GrapheneOS + lock bootloader again
15:19:15 <strcat[m]> and I'll have a new auditor version to test on both devices
15:27:54 <strcat[m]> working on it
15:28:14 <strcat[m]> gretai: can you submit a sample right now?
15:28:49 <strcat[m]> let me know when it's submitted
15:29:29 <strcat[m]> gretai: also which device do you have specifically
15:29:47 <strcat[m]> ok
15:30:10 <strcat[m]> ok
15:36:50 <strcat[m]> meh
15:36:51 <strcat[m]> I don't see what's wrong
15:37:54 <alex-resist> I'm not seeing gretai's messages. It's essentially a monologue by strcat[m]. Am I doing something wrong?
15:38:38 <strcat[m]> doesn't look like it
15:38:42 <strcat[m]> don't know why it's not working for you
15:38:59 <strcat[m]> gretai: it's an australian pixel right?
15:39:15 <strcat[m]> oceanic model or w/e
15:39:38 <strcat[m]> want to make sure I'm looking at the correct sample

15:40:29 <strcat[m]> yeah afaict the root is fine
15:40:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Test this on your pixel 4 xl it might fix half of the issue on the issue tracker
15:43:24 <strcat[m]> gretai: okay well
15:43:28 <strcat[m]> I took the submitted sample
15:43:31 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't pass verification
15:43:39 <strcat[m]> 07-14 11:42:59.346 10611 10611 E AttestationProtocol: Caused by: java.security.cert.CertificateException: error:1a000064:ECDSA routines:OPENSSL_internal:BAD_SIGNATURE
15:44:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> Is the Graphene off topic on matrix?
15:45:41 <strcat[m]> gretai: no
15:45:47 <strcat[m]> gretai: the TEE samples pass verification
15:46:00 <strcat[m]> StrongBox (i.e. secure element, which is the Titan M on a Pixel) does not
15:47:01 <strcat[m]> yes
15:47:02 <strcat[m]> there are 2 keystores, the traditional one is TEE
15:47:05 <strcat[m]> we use StrongBox on devices where it's available instead
15:47:11 <strcat[m]> on Pixels StrongBox is provided by the Titan M
15:47:37 <strcat[m]> gretai: so your device passes attestation checks with the TEE keystore but not the StrongBox keystore
15:51:36 <cdesai> alex-resist: I don't see them either, just a matrix irc bridge issue.
16:01:24 <strcat[m]> gretai: seems like a bug though
16:18:27 <strcat[m]> gretai: can you flash the stock OS and see if it fails there too?
16:18:30 <strcat[m]> since Auditor can also verify stock
16:18:33 <strcat[m]> that would be useful
16:19:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "gretai: can you flash the stock "> What if we just ship him with 11 firmware?
16:20:18 <strcat[m]> I don't know why it's failing
16:20:23 <strcat[m]> it seems like his Titan M is broken
16:20:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or he could flash just the firmware part from 11?
16:20:35 <strcat[m]> he flashed the firmware already
16:20:42 <strcat[m]> afaik it's the OS that updates the firmware on the Titan M anyway
16:20:45 <strcat[m]> it gets uploaded from the OS
16:20:51 <strcat[m]> yeah that's right, the OS does it
16:20:59 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't know what the issue is
16:21:11 <strcat[m]> but it seems like his Titan M has broken firmware
16:22:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: has he tried the recovery wipe that I suggested?
16:24:11 <theultron[m]> Is Android 11 based GrapheneOS already in the works?
