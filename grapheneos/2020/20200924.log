01:28:44 <javashin> hello
02:58:32 <brenneke[m]> <fomijafi[m] "My 2fa app (aegis) is failing ev"> Mine working fine. I don't see anything in Aegis settings for time.
03:13:52 <brenneke[m]> <uchihaitachi[m] "Did somebody try Cryptomator ?"> Yes I use it, no problems on GOS or Ubuntu.
04:30:18 <dukedom_k[m]> <uchihaitachi[m] "Did somebody try Cryptomator ?"> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org is the better place to ask questions not directly related to GrapheneOS.
07:35:30 <null[m]> <fomijafi[m] "I have it set to use network tim"> Well, does your phone's time match those other systems?
09:23:57 <ugphkew[m]> Hello and thank you Daniel and the dev for their hard work. I know that Waze is not Foss but I use this indispensable application for my daily travels. Since the last 2 versions ( I'm  testing the last beta on pixel4) the map is not visible (localization turned on. Is it possible to correct this without compromising security ? Thank you very much
09:25:20 <alzxjm[m]> ugphkew: Try installing Google Maps as well.
09:25:33 <alzxjm[m]> IIRC Waze relies on the Google maps API
09:26:09 <Lckdyspl7[m]> They've updated it to use google maps api correct
09:26:10 <ugphkew[m]> Thank you will try
09:26:29 <Lckdyspl7[m]> A few releases ago it wasnt, I noticed similar issues
09:27:05 <alzxjm[m]> I wish Apple would release an Android Apple Maps app like they did with Apple Music.
09:27:24 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Bing maps works fine
09:27:51 <Lckdyspl7[m]> But no app I don't think.
09:28:31 <alzxjm[m]> Google Maps in a browser without an account is my fallback.
09:28:52 <alzxjm[m]> OsmAnd+ and sometimes Magic Earth.
09:30:00 <ugphkew[m]> Have a nice day
09:34:38 <save2020[m]> ugphkew: you had Waze working on GrapheneOS???
09:38:09 <ugphkew[m]> Yes a   wile ago with the pixel 3a
09:39:16 <ugphkew[m]> Google map is working on the last beta but no map on Waze perhaps due to app isolation ?
10:37:14 <bejVau8MYNHfnMYv> just for getting familiar with the process -> do i have to commit changes using git before building ?
10:37:37 <bejVau8MYNHfnMYv> because after my last build, no changes were reflected in the output rom
10:38:55 <bejVau8MYNHfnMYv> are changes in the external folder also reflected ?
10:39:48 <res4[m]> <alzxjm[m] "I wish Apple would release an An"> Can't you use Apple Maps on DuckDuckGo?
10:44:54 <bejVau8MYNHfnMYv> how to put orbot as preinstalled into the build?
10:45:40 <bejVau8MYNHfnMYv> would be awesome to also have it preconfigured as VPN
10:54:01 <alzxjm[m]> res4: I'm not sure you can for turn-by-turn nav. Not sure though.
10:54:32 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Uhhhh... Why not just download it? Not everybody on GoS would want there data routed through tor. Depends on threat model.
10:56:23 <alzxjm[m]> res4: You can look stuff up with Apple Maps through DDG but it does not appear to have nav
10:59:52 <res4[m]> Ohhh, alright then. Too bad.
11:22:33 <res4[m]> <Lckdyspl7[m] "Uhhhh... Why not just download i"> Btw, I agree with this statement. If your downloads were already being monitored, installing any kind of VPN shouldn't really change anything about your situation. Whoever would be doing that kind of monitoring would either figure out you're using a VPN either way, or only have the ability to spy on your PC, in which case installing it on your device would actually be
11:22:33 <res4[m]> preferable. At least that's how I see it.
12:15:15 <moaaz> I've been trying to compile an old android 9 PQ3A.190801.002.2019.08.25.15 BRANCH of the grapheneos
12:15:47 <moaaz> it gets built and everything but the phone crashes after 5 secs of booting and loading the home screen
12:16:05 <moaaz> its for the crosshatch pixel 3xl
12:16:33 <moaaz> are there any different steps for old grapheneos branches ?
12:22:48 <louipc> moaaz: better ask in #grapheneos-offtopic. because i dont believe old versions are supported, that is considered insecure
12:26:25 <moaaz> okay
12:57:20 <nothankyou[m]> I'm having trouble on gclient sync on Vanadium
12:58:32 <nothankyou[m]> Getting the unstaged changes error
12:58:48 <nothankyou[m]> And I couldn't apply the patches on the latest Vanadium
13:34:02 <ham5urg> Is there a way to get access to the multiple front-cameras of a Pixel4?
13:36:21 <alzxjm[m]> I'm trying to understand the special SELinux domain for Gcam. Why can Open Camera take advantage of the Pixel Neural/Visual Core on flagship devices with Camera2 API without a special SELinux domain like Gcam does? Why does Gcam have that special domain?
13:36:36 <alzxjm[m]> Just asking for my own curiosity, really.
13:48:12 <ugphkew[m]> alzxjm: dont't know perhaps ask
13:48:12 <ugphkew[m]> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
13:48:41 <strcat[m]> ugphkew: has nothing to do with that app
13:48:55 <ugphkew[m]> OK sorry
13:49:10 <strcat[m]> that app just provides a non-functional, tiny subset of Play services API
13:49:36 <nothankyou[m]> Is updating version in Vanadium building supposed to start over at /83000?
13:49:49 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
13:50:03 <nothankyou[m]> If I had successfully built one already?
13:50:30 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't do an incremental build when changing the base version since there might be build system changes
13:50:30 <nothankyou[m]> And trying to bump version by https://grapheneos.org/build#browser-and-webview
13:51:01 <strcat[m]> you have to checkout the new tag from upstream, make sure gclient has run the hooks and reapply the patches
13:51:07 <strcat[m]> and do a clean build
13:51:24 <strcat[m]> if you're making a release build to actually use, it should really always be a clean build
13:51:28 <strcat[m]> incremental builds are for development
13:52:39 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: the OS has basic support for generic usage of the Visual/Neural core to combine multiple captured stills into 1 higher quality still image
13:52:49 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: it's very basic, generic support for doing that and that's all it can do
13:52:56 <strcat[m]> there is no functionality exposed to apps
13:53:05 <strcat[m]> if they use compatible settings it happens, otherwise it doesn't
13:53:25 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: Google Camera uses it for a bunch of different features it offers, it's not comparable
13:54:16 <strcat[m]> it used to use the Qualcomm DSP, that was what allowed them to start having 'zero shutter lag' for HDR+
13:54:20 <ham5urg> strcat[m], will the multiple cameras be accessible by grapheneOS, I'm curious why it is not possible to open the different cameras except the first.
13:54:30 <strcat[m]> ham5urg: yes, they are
13:54:48 <strcat[m]> don't confuse the capabilities an app chooses to expose with what the OS can do
13:54:59 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS has exactly the same camera functionality as the stock OS - nothing is missing
13:55:34 <alzxjm[m]> strcat: thanks very much for the explanation
13:56:09 <strcat[m]> camera should also work a lot better in Android 11 due to a bunch of upstream memory corruption bug fixes
13:56:22 <strcat[m]> we might be able to turn off the workarounds we had too
13:56:38 <ham5urg> strcat[m], I tried the camera-app which comes with grapheneOS and open-camera. I was unable to switch the cameras as described https://opencamera.sourceforge.io/help.html here under the keyword "Multiple cameras icon"
13:57:13 <nothankyou[m]> Thanks as well
13:57:14 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "camera should also work a lot be"> Better as in quicker or better quality?
13:57:37 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: as in not detecting memory corruption and forcing the camera services to abort / restart
13:57:51 <strcat[m]> because a lot of those bugs have been fixed
13:58:10 <strcat[m]> ham5urg: I'm sure it works the same as it does on the stock OS
13:58:15 <strcat[m]> all the cameras are usable
13:58:30 <strcat[m]> whether or not a specific camera app works properly is an issue with that camera app
13:58:33 <blacklight447[m]> Ah, neat
13:58:59 <ham5urg> Can you recommend a camera app?
13:59:04 <blacklight447[m]> How would you describe to porting to 11 when compared to 10
13:59:19 <blacklight447[m]> Would you call it better or worse ( or maybe the same?)
13:59:35 <strcat[m]> ham5urg: no
13:59:35 <blacklight447[m]> <ham5urg "Can you recommend a camera app?"> Opencamera is fantastic
13:59:38 <strcat[m]> all I can say is the OS functionality is the same as the stock OS and if you're using the Android 11 Beta it should work really well
14:00:03 <strcat[m]> any limitations would be limitations of the camera app, not the OS
14:00:13 <strcat[m]> it's the same functionality as the stock OS
14:03:51 <ugphkew[m]> strcat: thanks for clarifying. Do you know why there is no map in waze even if the Google GPS API is working with Google map ?
14:04:14 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
14:04:27 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound like a question about GrapheneOS
14:08:30 <alzxjm[m]> ugphkew: Waze is unfunctional without Google Play Services. As far as I can tell it doesn't even work with microG enabled. It probably has a hard dependency on Google Play Services.
14:09:14 <alzxjm[m]> ugphkew: I just tried it on CalyxOS with microG and it also failed to load the map or function at all. According to [Plexus](https://github.com/techlore-official/plexus/blob/master/src/data/Plexus.csv) Waze does not function. I think you can expect Waze to not work on GrapheneOS now or in the future.
14:10:03 <ugphkew[m]> alzxjm: OK thanks (sad)
14:12:08 <alzxjm[m]> ugphkew: Google Maps in a browser works fairly well, though I don't think turn-by-turn nav works. Google Maps works fine on GrapheneOS, though you necessarily cannot sign in to your Google account and access certain functionalities such as offline maps and saved locations.
14:17:39 <ugphkew[m]> I have a lot of car trips to work. And waze is the most efficient app because of user participation. It's a shame. Thank you very much for the answers. I'll avoid spamming in your dev room, maybe there is a room about the day to day use of graphene os ?
14:18:41 <ugphkew[m]> Keep up the great work
14:18:42 <alzxjm[m]> There is an off-topic room.
14:18:49 <alzxjm[m]> I forget how to invite on Matrix...
14:19:02 <alzxjm[m]> Maybe someone else in here can invite ugphkew to OT?
14:20:26 <V0inmygym[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
14:20:41 <ugphkew[m]> Thank you !
15:37:34 <duggalsu[m]> I tried using the auditor app. The first time it showed successful initial pairing and verification. However, if I go back and try again,  verification fails,  unless I clear auditor pairings. Is that expected?
15:46:32 <nothankyou[m]> Nope, not at all
15:49:07 <duggalsu[m]> Just to clarify,  if I go back,  i've to scan the bar code on the auditor again and then on the auditee evertime. Will that happen everytime?
16:13:24 <mastercakex[m]> <alzxjm[m] "ugphkew: Waze is unfunctional wi"> Waze works 10 out of 10 on GrapheneOS
16:22:32 <nothankyou[m]> <duggalsu[m] "Just to clarify,  if I go back, "> Yeah, you're supposed to scan it again?
16:22:53 <nothankyou[m]> I thought you failed the 2nd verification attempt
16:23:01 <nothankyou[m]> After the weak pairing
16:26:43 <duggalsu[m]> <nothankyou[m] "After the weak pairing"> I successfully scanned both the barcodes ( first on the auditor and then on the auditee ) and got a successful verification the first time.  The second time,  I scanned both the barcodes and then got a verification failure
16:42:39 <nothankyou[m]> Well that wasn't supposed to happen
16:42:46 <nothankyou[m]> If it's red on second time scanning
16:43:05 <nothankyou[m]> Probably reflashing it is a solution
16:50:28 <duggalsu[m]> Could it possibly be a bug in the app? I know its unlikely but just want to be sure.  This is on a Pixel 2
16:53:54 <nothankyou[m]> Not that I know of. Test it in remote attestation first perhaps
16:56:17 <d3uhd9238dh> hi, i'm really just getting familiar with the build process.. do i have to stage & commit changes to the tree before building ? because last time i built, no changes very visible
17:00:23 <duggalsu[m]> Ok
17:01:26 <duggalsu[m]> * Ok, thanks
17:09:12 <triplemister[m]> Hey there, is there any way to interact with a GOS Pixel without a screen?
17:10:19 <triplemister[m]> It is unbooted, hdmi out over usb-c didnt work pre auth if at all. External keyboard unknown as I havent yet had a way to even see output.
17:28:22 <crankycrawdad[m]> Has anyone here with pixel 3 XL phones had issues with battery swelling?
17:29:47 <triplemister[m]> Not yet
17:30:39 <crankycrawdad[m]> Gotcha, just ordered one yesterday and am just now seeing posts about swelling
17:31:24 <triplemister[m]> I know 3 people without significant problems using pixels.
17:32:14 <triplemister[m]> The fingerprint sensor of my 3a xl is wonky. But idc as I dont use it because apps using the fingerprint api are super wonky too.
17:33:10 <crankycrawdad[m]> Good to know, been using fingerprint on my current phone but plan to just switch to a full password on new phone, should have done it a while ago anyhow
17:33:33 <alzxjm[m]> I used a Pixel 3 XL for a year and didn't have any problems. Great phone, except for the unsightly notch.
17:33:54 <nickcalyx[m]> I never have any problems with the fingerprint reader on.pixels
17:34:14 <nickcalyx[m]> And never heard of battery swelling.so.far
17:34:16 <crankycrawdad[m]> Haha that's good, I know the notch won't bug me much, my phone before my current phone was a OnePlus 6
17:35:37 <blacklight447[m]> <triplemister[m] "It is unbooted, hdmi out over us"> Newer pixels dont support hdmi over usb c
17:36:19 <triplemister[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Newer pixels dont support hdmi o"> Not even on stock?
17:37:08 <crankycrawdad[m]> I'm currently on LineageOS and for whatever reason I can get media audio over Bluetooth just fine but call audio won't route over Bluetooth, has any seen any issues like this within Graphene?

17:39:34 <triplemister[m]> on gos and los on oneplus and pixel 3a xl
17:39:34 <deepthought[m]> Hi, short question, does the included browser Vanadium support DNS over TLS?
17:39:35 <triplemister[m]> gos obvs only on pixel
17:46:58 <triplemister[m]> <triplemister[m] "Did work for me with car audio i"> tested bluetooth phone and media positively with gos: ford european models, most generations. VW, most generations. renault/citroen/fiat/peugeot, most generations. Two different Audi models, 3 different hyundai/kia/thingy models, 2 or 3 mercedes models tested positive only on los.
17:47:51 <triplemister[m]> Bluetooth is very device dependent tho.
17:48:01 <triplemister[m]> As in which chip
17:48:23 <triplemister[m]>  * As in which chip on the phone and which drivers available

20:40:29 <res4[m]> No problem! I just wanted to give my two cents. Maybe I missed something in my explanation, but I'm generally against people getting too paranoid. Although I totally understand it.
21:52:34 <ham5urg_> My net just got disrupted, maybe someone posted already, idk.
21:53:11 <ham5urg_> Can I activate a Wifi-MAC-randomization with GrapheneOS?

21:58:00 <nickcalyx[m]> I think its automatically set to randomize by.default
22:02:23 <ham5urg_> Yes, great GOS is a great Android.
22:05:20 <ham5urg_> Your info could be placed into the FAQ. Maybe someone in the future will have the same question. Apple announced MAC-rand. recently, maybe more people will ask.
22:06:37 <ham5urg_> One suggestion I may enter is, to add a menu/shortcut to disable the GSM-modem. I know, I can disable it via plane-mode + activ. wifi + activ. bt
