00:02:01 <cynthiasakurai[4> Just so I know in advance, how's the pixel 4 xl with graphene? I'm planning to get one but it's apparently in experimental stages so I'm unsure if that means it's unstable or what specifically other than basically being an alpha test
01:35:21 <aeonsolution[m]> cdesai: what was the fix?!
01:38:29 <aeonsolution[m]> them upstreaming the fix is the best route, would an alternative been to pull it from google maven <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/aapt2#download_aapt2>?
02:25:05 <aeonsolution[m]> cynthiasakurai: the projected is severely understaffed with devs. strcat, anupritaisno1, and maybe 1 or 2 other people are trying their best to migrate the kernel patches from Android 10 to Android 11 for GrapheneOS. https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices. This alone is a lot of work and would be great. I encourage you and anyone else trying to see where the status of the project is to either check the
02:25:05 <aeonsolution[m]> logs https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos or review the changelog https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
02:26:01 <aeonsolution[m]> Everything is there and open for anyone to see. There is an enormous amount of interest from the community but not so much in help. We also lack dedicated testers.
02:26:29 <userrioter[m]> How can we help the project if we don‚Äôt know coding and can‚Äôt donate funds? If we‚Äôre bilingual can we do any translating work or anything else?

05:39:33 <cloudy> is any of that work reusable on GOS?
05:39:48 <jneplokh> If you really need to use MicroG, go with CalyxOS instead
05:40:33 <cloudy> perhaps you have a comparison matrix between all of these? im noticing even rattlesnakeos has a microg repo...
05:41:25 <jneplokh> I do not have such a comparison table, but generally everyone here only recommends GOS, CalyxOS, or iOS

05:48:44 <cloudy> im seeing calyx financial report...thats a lot of funding, not bad
05:49:00 <cn3m[m]> from weakening the sandbox, to removing verified boot, rollback protection, and usability of remote attestation
05:49:26 <cn3m[m]> They also have inaccurate patch levels
05:49:29 <cloudy> and rattlesnake then? not ready/deeppocketed/too few devs?
05:49:33 <jneplokh> <cloudy "i can search logs and find criti"> You sure can ;)
05:49:49 <cn3m[m]> cloudy: rattlesnakeOS is fine :)
05:50:25 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS and CalyxOS are generally the recommendation as they are more well rounded with strong dev teams
05:51:03 <cloudy> does calyx pay devs? the institute has a cool million
05:51:19 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS and iOS if you need maximum security and privacy features. CalyxOS and GrapheneOS if you need maximum freedom. iOS and CalyxOS for maximum compatibility

06:02:15 <cloudy> y not just cooperate on fewer "distros"
06:02:15 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS is focused on the out of the box experience which is important
06:02:43 <jneplokh> Huh never heard of Rattlesnake before, looks really cool
06:03:00 <cn3m[m]> <cloudy "y not just cooperate on fewer "d"> RattlesnakeOS is DIY project. CalyxOS is for people who need a respectful setup of them and might not be as tech savvy or anti google
06:03:28 <cloudy> or perhaps rattlesnake or GOS could (?) (no hate!) merge with/be acquired by calyx?
06:03:30 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is sort of the no compromises security and privacy turn it up to 11 experience
06:03:48 <cloudy> ah
06:03:54 <cloudy> but y no microg yet?
06:04:10 <cn3m[m]> microg is not ideal for security and privacy by GrapheneOS standards
06:04:23 <zxwayland> You mean Level 4000?
06:04:28 <cloudy> ...and privacy?!
06:04:36 <cloudy> what is used instead to avoid google
06:04:51 <cn3m[m]> <cloudy "...and privacy?!"> yes, some people don't like the connections to google and the google cloud messaging
06:05:00 <cn3m[m]> It minimizes Google usage
06:05:03 <jneplokh> Yeah, Calyx is the way to go for users who just want extra privacy and security, but not ready to take a huge plunge lol (and/or want more freedom than iOS)
06:05:41 <cn3m[m]> yeah iOS and CalyxOS are always at the top of my lists to recommend to family
06:05:53 <cloudy> i know microg is still wip, but does calyx-microg mostly just work, except for known issues, like people missing a good google maps alt, etc?

06:06:52 <cloudy> theres a bunch of tv providers here offering their service on essentially an android app, something on a tv box of their choice...
06:07:22 <cn3m[m]> microG is inherently reliant on Google it is just rebuilding Google Play Services open source and removing harmful features
06:07:25 <cloudy> anyone gotten such a tv/iptv app working...like something official, not bootleg, where major local channels are available for subscription/pay
06:08:03 <cloudy> ...like anywhere in the world...i need to have some hope to even buy a device/flash and try these apps myself

16:43:47 <applescruff_53[m> I bought the phone on 7/12/2020. It arrived on Tuesday the14th.
16:44:47 <applescruff_53[m> I went to Best Buy on Wednesday and got a sim card.
16:48:32 <applescruff_53[m> I've since canceled the T-Molile service and got service with FreeUp which uses AT&T, which I used with my iPhone.

16:51:44 <userrioter[m]> I‚Äôm a little concerned though on how someone mentioned yesterday that the V1 signatures that Graphene OS uses may be more vulnerable to spoofing and therefore may be a concern when using banking and password manager apps on the device

21:01:34 <nickcalyx[m]> that's the stock AOSP dialer so that's the expected behavior AFAIK
21:02:18 <tencarsb[m]> <userrioter[m] "So when possible, Aurora Store >"> Fdroid, always!
21:02:30 <nickcalyx[m]> I am sometimes in another room where we actually are modifying the dialer.   I don't know the answer to your question
21:41:37 <mrmanpants[m]> is there a way to set grapheneos so new apps have to ask for ALL permissions?  it seems they just get certain ones automatically, like network and sensors
21:49:40 <strcat[m]> mrmanpants: they do ask for all the regular permissions
21:49:54 <strcat[m]> network and sensors are special added permissions by GrapheneOS, not part of the normal permission model
21:50:36 <strcat[m]> they aren't disabled by default because that wouldn't retain compatibility with apps, which are not written specifically for GrapheneOS and don't know how to ask for those or otherwise handle them being disabled
21:51:13 <strcat[m]> mrmanpants:  apps cannot run before you have launched them, they start out in the force stopped state after being installed, you don't need anything special to be able to disable those before they can run, already how it works
21:51:34 <strcat[m]> BTW this has been discussed many times before here and on the subreddit
21:51:39 <strcat[m]> recommend searching first
21:57:30 <sushiman[m]> dont have GOS capability on my phone. I dont trust Stock OP rom very much, should I switch to LOS?
21:58:03 <sushiman[m]> Im already rooted and im not willing to unroot my phone so thats not a concern
21:58:43 <strcat> not on-topic

22:00:25 <userrioter[m]> <userrioter[m] "Does anyone know how I can fix T"> Does anyone know a possible fix? I tried looking up the error message but nothing and up
22:02:07 <strcat[m]> make sure to use the most recent release not whatever F-Droid has
22:04:21 <RiotElement[m]> <strcat[m] "make sure to use the most recent"> I tried both versions and even the Aurora version gives me the same error
22:04:35 <RiotElement[m]> Orbit won‚Äôt run either
22:04:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> RiotElement: fdroid -> enable include incompatible, antifeature and beta options
22:04:59 <RiotElement[m]> * Orbot won‚Äôt run either
22:05:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Install the beta release candidate
22:05:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> For orbot
22:07:12 <mrmanpants[m]> <strcat[m] "BTW this has been discussed many"> thanks for the info RE:permissions.  Not sure what you are referring to regarding the second reply though
22:07:59 <strcat[m]> mrmanpants: meaning many people have asked about this and it has been answered repeatedly, so if you search first you will find answers to questions like this without needing people to set aside more time to answer it again
22:10:34 <mrmanpants[m]> had to read it again.  your second reply was still referring to my permissions question i guess.  I thought you were refering to another question.  noted: will try searching reddit next time first
22:10:55 <strcat[m]> matrix can be searched too and there are logs of the IRC channel
22:10:59 <strcat[m]> mentioned in topic
22:13:34 <mrmanpants[m]> gotcha. new to matrix, thanks
22:37:07 <mrmanpants[m]> is there some trick to creating a new item on the built-in calendar app?
22:37:46 <cn3m[m]> don't use that app
22:37:47 <cn3m[m]> it is dead
22:37:50 <cn3m[m]> that's the trick
22:38:12 <mrmanpants[m]> oh, lol, ok.  recommendations for replacement?
22:38:28 <cn3m[m]> Etar
22:38:58 <mrmanpants[m]> thanks.  why is it included in the install if it's dead?
22:39:10 <strcat[m]> the built-in app is a sample app for viewing data from calendar backends
22:39:14 <strcat[m]> it's required for compatibility
22:39:22 <strcat[m]> we can't bundle Etar due to an incompatible license
22:39:44 <strcat[m]> we could potentially hide the sample calendar app launcher icon
22:39:57 <strcat[m]> there is an open issue, no one has stepped up to work on it or other similar issues about the sample apps
22:40:21 <RiotElement[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "RiotElement: fdroid -> enable in"> I tried that but it‚Äôs still giving me the same error message
22:40:30 <strcat[m]> it is necessary to make sure removing the launcher icons (or outright removing the apps) doesn't break compatibility
22:40:41 <strcat[m]> by making sure it doesn't cause Compatibility Test Suite failures
22:40:46 <strcat[m]> also has to be implemented of course
22:53:17 <mrmanpants[m]> makes sense
23:51:09 <nickcalyx[m]> <strcat[m] "we can't bundle Etar due to an i"> what's the issue with Etar's license ?
23:51:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> GPL 3
23:57:21 <nickcalyx[m]> Yeah but whats wrong with GPL3
