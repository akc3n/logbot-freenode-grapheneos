03:24:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> dazinism: dong buy sounds legit‚Ñ¢
07:53:39 <hitchhooker[m]> seems like 4A is available from Google now
08:01:20 <inrdrna[m]> Isn‚Äôt it available since two weeks now ?
08:07:04 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2020.09.10.05 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.10.05.
08:07:11 <strcat[m]> this is likely the final release based on Android 10
08:07:26 <strcat[m]> it still needs to be finished for the Pixel 4 and then our full efforts will be focused on the Android 11 migration
08:07:56 <strcat[m]> the work for the Pixel 4 is really Android 11 work since it involves finishing porting our changes for the kernel
08:08:06 <strcat[m]> since we're shipping the Android 11 GrapheneOS kernels for this final Android 10 release
08:08:23 <lickidysplit[m]> üòç
08:39:47 <strcat[m]> we need more help with the migration along with donations to cover costs
08:40:28 <strcat[m]> at the moment Pixel 4 kernel still needs to be finished to be able to finish tagging the release (Pixel 4 kernel repositories not tagged) and that means there's no manifest tag yet
08:40:39 <strcat[m]> and that's just to get out this final Android 10-based release
09:03:30 <dazinism> >Further help with bringing up support for the devices with Android 11 and porting over each of the GrapheneOS hardening features to it would be greatly appreciated. Donations are also extremely helpful. GrapheneOS has brought on another full time developer using donated funds and there are 3 part time developers helping with Android 11. We're also collaborating with CalyxOS and others in the AOSP Alliance to bring up
09:03:30 <dazinism> fully signed, production device support.

13:49:08 <wondercat> hello
13:49:49 <wondercat> i followed the steps for flashing graphene
13:50:21 <wondercat> but my friend is telling me not to flash because my phone updated to android 11
13:53:39 <wondercat> can i flash or no
14:03:41 <eccezioni> hello
14:04:25 <eccezioni> hi
14:05:36 <eccezioni> hi, I just bought two pixels that have android 9. I have not yet updated them to android 11 for fear of incompatibility with gprapheneos. Can someone help me?
14:12:03 <eccezion1[m]> hi
14:12:04 <eccezion1[m]> hi, I just bought two pixels that have android 9. I have not yet updated them to android 11 for fear of incompatibility with gprapheneos. Can someone help me?
14:12:53 <Autopsy[m]> Yes.
14:13:03 <Autopsy[m]> So, do you want to install GrapheneOS straight away?
14:13:10 <eccezioni> yes
14:13:14 <Autopsy[m]> If so, just update to 10 and flash GrapheneOS.
14:13:29 <Autopsy[m]> If you're on 11, you can downgrade to 10.
14:13:32 <eccezioni> and whit 11 is not possible?
14:13:41 <eccezioni> no, now have a 9
14:14:06 <Autopsy[m]> At the moment, GrapheneOS isn't on Android 11, so it probably wouldn't be recommended to install it over 10.
14:14:28 <Autopsy[m]> Update to Android 10, then flash GrapheneOS.
14:14:42 <eccezioni> ok, how i actualize to 10
14:14:50 <eccezioni> is no possible a update on air
14:16:05 <Autopsy[m]> You will need to sideload the factory image from Google
14:16:16 <Autopsy[m]> Or, one second...
14:16:54 <Autopsy[m]> What devices do you have?
14:17:50 <eccezioni> google pixel 3 xl
14:18:23 <Autopsy[m]> Okay, one second
14:18:36 <eccezioni> i have a 2 pixel
14:19:06 <Autopsy[m]> Tell me
14:19:07 <Autopsy[m]> What devices do you have?
14:19:42 <Autopsy[m]> <eccezioni "i have a 2 pixel"> Google Pixel 3 XL and a Pixel 2?
14:19:54 <Autopsy[m]> Be specific.
14:19:56 <eccezioni> i have 2 google pixel 3 xl
14:20:02 <Autopsy[m]> Oh okay
14:20:04 <Autopsy[m]> Right
14:20:12 <Autopsy[m]> So...
14:20:28 <Autopsy[m]> eccezioni go to this website https://flash.android.com/build/6578210?target=crosshatch-user&signed using Google Chrome and follow the instructions to install Android 10.
14:20:45 <eccezioni> i go
14:20:48 <Autopsy[m]> You will do it through Google Chrome.
14:20:57 <eccezioni> ok
14:21:07 <Autopsy[m]> This is the latest update, August 2020.
14:21:21 <Autopsy[m]> Android 10.
14:24:02 <eccezioni> oem unlocking is freeze
14:24:14 <eccezioni> is not possible to switch
14:25:51 <eccezioni> it'z ok
14:26:08 <eccezioni> now i need a internet connection for unlock a oem
14:33:24 <wondercat> when is graphene os with android 11
14:35:13 <strcat[m]> Autopsy: it isn't necessarily to downgrade
14:36:10 <strcat[m]> Autopsy: there's no point of flashing the stock OS back to Android 10, flashing the stock OS is not a different process than flashing GrapheneOS
14:36:17 <strcat[m]> and GrapheneOS is already partly based on Android 11 anyway, soon fully
14:36:20 <Autopsy[m]> Whilst I generally agree with that
14:36:51 <strcat[m]> our recommendation is to update the stock OS to the latest version before flashing GrapheneOS, if anything, and that still applies with the stock OS being updated to Android 11 (most people will not have gotten the update yet anyway)
14:36:57 <strcat[m]> (staged rollouts)
14:37:06 <Autopsy[m]> I have seen problems when people haven't updated to the latest.
14:37:28 <strcat[m]> yes but never problems when people are on the latest version that happens to be ahead of GrapheneOS temporarily
14:37:30 <strcat[m]> it's not a problem
14:37:36 <strcat[m]> the only problem is having firmware that's too old and buggy
14:37:40 <Autopsy[m]> <strcat[m] "our recommendation is to update "> Hence recommending August 2020 release.
14:37:43 <Autopsy[m]> Instead of Android 11.
14:37:47 <strcat[m]> and updating it is with unlocking / fastboot is pointless
14:37:59 <strcat[m]> the latest release is September (of both GrapheneOS and the stock OS)
14:38:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Autopsy: firmware is updated with every new build
14:38:18 <strcat[m]> and it is recommended as always to update the stock OS before installing GrapheneOS - definitely not mandatory, just recommended especially for new phones
14:38:26 <Autopsy[m]> Yes, I know it's updated with every new build
14:38:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> So you just need to update through the OTA updater
14:38:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or sideload
14:38:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> And you're good
14:38:43 <strcat[m]> the official advice is to update via the over-the-air updater to the latest releaser
14:38:47 <strcat[m]>  * the official advice is to update via the over-the-air updater to the latest release
14:38:57 <strcat[m]> then follow our instructions for installation
14:39:02 <strcat[m]> this month is NOT special in that regard, there is no reason to be concerned about this
14:39:10 <strcat[m]> it seems highly suspicious that this is now suddenly a topic
14:39:14 <Autopsy[m]> Fair enough
14:39:15 <strcat[m]> seems like someone spreading FUD to me
14:39:32 <strcat[m]> Android 10 just came out - how can people expect that we've already ported everything?
14:39:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: what about firmware for this month?
14:39:44 <strcat[m]> in pretty much a day we already ported over the kernels and got a release ready with Android 11 kernels
14:39:45 <Autopsy[m]> Exactly
14:39:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also you mean 11?
14:39:56 <strcat[m]>  * Android 11 just came out - how can people expect that we've already ported everything?
14:39:56 <Autopsy[m]> But that's people in general, strcat
14:40:01 <strcat[m]> typo
14:40:14 <Autopsy[m]> Of course people will ask for Android 11
14:40:32 <Autopsy[m]> People don't understand how long it can take to make the changes etc.
14:40:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Autopsy: sadly I was out for a bit today so things were a little slow
14:41:05 <Autopsy[m]> Dw, anu
14:41:42 <Autopsy[m]> It'll get done when it's done, simple as that
14:45:13 <strcat[m]> currently still working on the final Android 10 release with Android 11 kernels
14:45:24 <strcat[m]> some problems came up in testing and it had to be rebuilt with a fix
14:45:34 <strcat[m]> so that's why it's taking so long to reach beta
15:42:46 <alex-resist> Hey, this question has probably been asked a million times, but I don't know what to search for in the logbot. Will the upgrade from Android 10 to Android 11 be as seamless as other, within-version updates?
15:44:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> alex-resist: yes
15:44:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless you flashed one of the very early release builds
15:48:13 <alex-resist> Okay, thx!
15:56:47 <eccezioni> one question, is possible disable a phone app for use only signal private messenger for call?
16:11:23 <imsofrustrated[m> I followed the install setup step to step and everything worked but it doesn't work?I did everything exactly as in video tutorials and your tutorial on your website.
16:11:24 <imsofrustrated[m> Nothing troubled me, but then I start the device after locking the bootloader and it just starts as before with the normal android 10. No GrapheneOS symbol seen as there was in the videos I saw. I also don't have the background everyone has.
16:11:24 <imsofrustrated[m> Where can I see if I have it installed?
16:12:46 <eccezioni> hi installed a grapheneos in the first phone, but i have a second phone and this phone have a android aosp installed, and is impossible to install grapheneos. Can you help me?
16:15:01 <Autopsy[m]> <eccezioni "hi installed a grapheneos in the"> It's fine. Unlock OEM, flash the latest version of Android using the website I gave you earlier on, then install GrapheneOS.
16:16:57 <eccezioni> perfect
16:17:08 <eccezioni> can you help me for this questions?
16:17:16 <imsofrustrated[m> Autopsy: If my phone doesn't show GrapheneOS while starting it the install didn't work, right?
16:17:24 <eccezioni> is possible disable a phone app for use only signal private messenger for call?
16:18:30 <Autopsy[m]> <imsofrustrated[m "Autopsy: If my phone doesn't sho"> The boot goes... 1. Warning message. 2. Google logo. 3. GrapheneOS. If you don't have that, you didn't get through it correctly.
16:19:23 <eccezioni> perfect now have two phone whit graphene os
16:19:41 <imsofrustrated[m> Autopsy: But at what stage could it went wrong? I did exactly as the guide stated and nothing gave me an error
16:19:43 <Autopsy[m]> <eccezioni "is possible disable a phone app "> You cannot disable the phone app.
16:20:18 <eccezioni> pity, it would have been really useful
16:20:56 <Autopsy[m]> imsofrustrated any stage, tbh. Wanna go through it again?
16:21:07 <eccezioni> pity, it would have been really useful
16:21:17 <eccezioni> and much safer for governments who listen to journalists and whistleblowers
16:22:10 <Autopsy[m]> eccezioni just don't use the Phone app. Simple as. The person you're contacting will require Signal, anyways.
16:23:44 <eccezioni> yes, but we must think that most people are not experienced enough to understand a difference between signal and phone app. Think of people who are far from the IT approach and giving away a phone ready and simple to use just for secure communications would have been the best.
16:24:33 <Autopsy[m]> eccezioni this is off topic now.
16:24:47 <eccezioni> yes i now
16:25:01 <Ultron[m]> Join the off-topic chat.  #grapheneos-offtopic
16:25:08 <eccezioni> it was only a question
16:25:18 <Autopsy[m]> If you want to talk about that, jump over to #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
16:25:45 <Autopsy[m]> Ah, Freenode user. Follow Ultron's advice ^
16:45:58 <retry0x[m]> Which android app supports chat rooms like offtopic?
16:46:36 <alzxjm[m]> @retry0x:matrix.org: Element on F-Droid is good.
16:47:47 <retry0x[m]> I use it, always get "not yet implemented in element"
16:50:11 <retry0x[m]> Guess I need to join it on desktop first. Keep getting "not yet implemented, open non joined room"
17:32:39 <wondercat> when is the next graphene update and how to know if iam up to date

22:39:48 <adeus[m]> Any good privacy respecting Android MDM options?
22:40:05 <adeus[m]> Just to manage a small number of Graphene phones ... less than 5.
23:08:34 <strcat[m]> dunno but as long as they don't have a hard dependency on Play Services they'll work
23:12:22 <dazinism> adeus: theres flyve MDM on FDroid,  and I noticed other open source ones on github. Not looked at them in detail. Think you can run your own control infrastructure with them though.
23:22:09 <adeus[m]> <dazinism "adeus: theres flyve MDM on FDroi"> Good recommendation I‚Äôll check it out
