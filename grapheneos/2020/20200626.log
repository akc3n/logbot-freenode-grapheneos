00:48:55 <defconanon12[m]> If we have any users coming here and following Techlore tutorial. I know exactly what they did wrong. First off they installed portable minimal fastboot. It does run a service so they have to get that service to stop running to uninstall it. Techlore throws people off the original instructions.
00:49:28 <defconanon12[m]> I know cause I followed his guide and screwed up myself.
00:50:23 <alzxjm[m]1> Techlore tutorial? Do you have a link?
00:50:57 <strcat[m]> there's a fastboot version check now to make sure it's at least the minimum supported version
00:52:07 <defconanon12[m]> strcat: The one they downloaded is an outdated third party software.
00:52:11 <TheJollyRoger> I'm reaching out to Techlore now actually.
00:54:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> Good on ya, mate

00:55:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> Oh cool, there's experimental support for the Pixel 4 now
00:56:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> Its a gooby phone but it's good to see progress nonetheless
00:56:35 <icy-sprite[m]> Yeah
00:57:06 <strcat[m]> seems perfectly fine to me
00:57:07 <strcat[m]> just expensive
00:57:39 <concat[m]> So not perfect
00:57:51 <concat[m]> :P
00:58:35 <alzxjm[m]1> I have the Pixel 4 XL. I think it's a great phone. Can't wait to get Graphene or Calyx on it
00:58:52 <cn3m[m]> alzxjm: CalyxOS is already out
00:59:14 <cn3m[m]> For security you're better off with stock though
00:59:14 <alzxjm[m]1> <cn3m[m] "alzxjm: CalyxOS is already out"> I know. I just need to set aside time to back stuff up and flash it.
00:59:36 <icy-sprite[m]> Calyx for Pixel 4 is out??
00:59:59 <TheJollyRoger> Oh goodness. My CTS test is still running!
01:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> 26 hours later!
01:00:28 <cn3m[m]> Yes Pixel 4 has support for CalyxOS and technically GrapheneOS
01:01:52 <alzxjm[m]1> Back in the Copperhead days I got my Nexus 6P to work with Google Fi, though SMS was a little weird. T-Mo only and no wi-fi calling but it worked fine. Last year I tried to flash Graphene on my Google Fi Pixel 3 XL and phone calls were totally broken.
01:02:14 <alzxjm[m]1> I might try to see if I can get Google Fi to work on the 4XL with Graphene and fall back to Calyx if not.
01:02:25 <alzxjm[m]1> (or just stay on stock until my bill credit runs out and I can switch to a different carrier)
01:03:03 <faxing[m]> I can confirm that Mint Mobile works well on the 3a
01:03:14 <cn3m[m]> Google Fi is awesome for security
01:03:15 <faxing[m]>  * I can confirm that Mint Mobile works well on the 3a as well
01:06:03 <alzxjm[m]1> I think Google Fi is the only carrier that is immune to SIM swapping.

01:09:40 <alzxjm[m]1> From https://www.wired.com/story/google-differential-privacy-open-source/

01:36:40 <icy-sprite[m]> Google helping companies knowing less about you. Wtf?
01:38:56 <cn3m[m]> <icy-sprite[m] "Google helping companies knowing"> Some things Google is good about privacy on they are inconsistent
01:40:26 <cdesai> Google wants to know things about you, that's their business model, that's how they sell ads.
01:40:38 <cdesai> They don't really want others to know too much about you though
01:41:02 <cdesai> That's why you might see "Google doesn't sell data" - they still collect a lot of data (e.g. on stock), but use it themselves
01:44:57 <countermeasure> I currently set private dns to dns.adguard.com for ad blocking.
01:45:10 <countermeasure> Now I'm looking to set up an always-on VPN.
01:45:50 <countermeasure> I can't quite tell from the GOS FAQs, but it looks like I should not set the private DNS if I start using a VPN.
01:46:05 <countermeasure> Have I got that right?
01:52:10 <icy-sprite[m]> <cdesai "They don't really want others to"> Ofc, they want to have data monopoly. It's not like they''re being benelovent
01:52:37 <icy-sprite[m]> I don't trust Google. I'd rather keep my privacy and have control over my data.
02:00:55 <renlord> icy-sprite[m]: you dont trust googley to be able to keep your data more securely than you can?
02:01:15 <renlord> or you dont trust googley to not peek at your data while they keep your data securely for you?
02:01:18 <renlord> lulz
02:03:43 <j3ghprjfo[m]> What is secured information if it's being shared with whom ever pays enough for it?
02:06:02 <jknsec[m]> woah experimental Pixel 4 release branch
02:06:22 <jknsec[m]> Didn't notice that until today
02:07:32 <renlord> j3ghprjfo[m]: it is not being shared verbatim with whomever that pays for it if you bothered to read the ToS
02:07:47 <renlord> in that form, it is a liability to own the data anyways
02:08:17 <renlord> legislation has made it prohibitively expensive to store personally identifiable data

02:12:43 <cn3m[m]> It is forced by master password reset
02:13:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's fine to argue for the security of fully offline stuff, or to argue against the security of a web vault, but to call it evidence of malicious activity is far fetched.
02:14:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's a design flaw, sure. I'll give you that.
02:17:25 <jiibus[m]> That is certainly not great. I just honestly don't understand why you ascribe it to evil behavior.
02:17:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> A reset in the app would be more secure, and needs to be added.
02:17:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> 2FA settings need to be in the app too
02:18:48 <cn3m[m]> I think there's more than enough reasonable doubt then talking about the keys to your kingdom especially in this room
02:21:29 <jiibus[m]> I mean the concern is negated with self hosting. And if they were malicious, self-hosting wouldn't even be an option.
02:23:00 <j3ghprjfo[m]> renlord: the ToS is not a measure of anything, it would be foolish to treat it with any merit when Google and many other tech giants have demonstrated no regard for the jurisdictions they operate in. They mainly get away with doing this because they provide government entities with valuable information on population and individuals
02:23:14 <renlord> j3ghprjfo[m]: i dont think its foolish
02:23:43 <j3ghprjfo[m]> They literally built their business on people's personal information...
02:23:58 <renlord> and any corporations that dont play by the rules of a nation state clearly doesnt want to be in business for long
02:24:07 <renlord> look at standard oil previously
02:24:44 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Even if security is good, the privacy is not and therefore no point in security at all. You might as well drop all security and be an open book because that's what's happening
02:24:55 <renlord> j3ghprjfo[m]: you probably read too much from /r/privacy to be able to interpret the situation independently on your own accord
02:26:18 <j3ghprjfo[m]> I understand how Google operates and makes its money. Telling people to trust Google over themselves is not good advice in my opinion
02:27:06 <cn3m[m]> Google is trustworthy, they are extremely transparent about everything
02:27:23 <cn3m[m]> Their documention is best in class on privacy
02:27:32 <cn3m[m]> Documentation*
02:27:42 <jiibus[m]> I mean I'm as little a google fan as likely anyone here, but I'm pretty sure they don't hold PII. They aggregate and psuedo-anonymize to better sell targeted advertising.
02:28:49 <j3ghprjfo[m]> jiibus: exactly
02:29:26 <renlord> i dont see why is aggregating and anonymizing to sell targeted advertising is an issue
02:29:31 <jiibus[m]> One could well argue that de-anonymization is trivial with enough data, but that's separate from the argument.
02:29:39 <renlord> it is a service that people want and people pay for it
02:29:56 <renlord> if you have gripes with that, you should stop consuming any products that pay for targeted advertising
02:30:07 <renlord> then google will probably pivot to a different business model
02:31:03 <jiibus[m]> I'd personally argue that ad driven businesses are the cause of much woe in the world. I mean old style news is a goddamned cancer, but they make money because they've learned what keeps eyes glued.
02:31:47 <jiibus[m]> But people want free, so this is the cost.
02:32:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> I distrust entities that trade in information. Google is one of the least toxic, but also arguably the most pervasive.
02:32:38 <strcat[m]> old style news was / is still largely funded by advertising
02:33:36 <cyborgninjaneer[> If your business model pushes you to collect information about me to make money, and I don't like being watched, I'm not going to like you.
02:33:37 <jiibus[m]> Yea, for sure. That's what I mean.
02:34:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> A lot of people would pay for news if it were real news.
02:35:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> There's a sentiment that it just isn't worth any money.
02:35:50 <renlord> lol, "pay for news if it were real news"
02:35:58 <renlord> news that feeds your media bias?
02:36:06 <cyborgninjaneer[> Information presented is widely available elsewhere, and is often unreliable or incomplete. Basically clickbait without the clicks.
02:36:10 <renlord> that is not what news is for
02:36:11 <jiibus[m]> Idk about that. Traditional news papers are effectively gone now because people can get it free online. Of course places like the NYT, WSJ, et al. do a subscription to survive, but how much income is that compared to ads?
02:41:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> > news that feeds your media bias?
02:41:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> What? No, I want information.
02:41:50 <cyborgninjaneer[> Tired of clickbait. I quit clicking.
02:43:28 <cn3m[m]> ProPublica is good
02:43:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'll check it out.
02:44:10 <cn3m[m]> I think it's still an onion link too
02:49:24 <jknsec[m]> ICIJ and ProPublica are pretty solid from my experience. Sadly they're both pretty specialized and not really good for big "headline" events and stuff.
02:49:26 <jiibus[m]> Also, using newsboat on linux to get your news via rss is a solid option.
02:52:11 <countermeasure> If I start using an always-on VPN, does that mean I should no longer set a Private DNS?
02:52:58 <cn3m[m]> <countermeasure "If I start using an always-on VP"> It's complicated
02:53:28 <countermeasure> cn3m[m]: I'm starting to think that!
02:54:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> Propublica has somewhat selective coverage leaning toward one side of the political spectrum due to its funding, but has some useful information on the things that they do cover. Thanks.
02:54:58 <cn3m[m]> countermeasure: in a very privacy focused setup like Safari or Tor it can be harmful to block
02:55:19 <cn3m[m]> In less privacy focused setups it's generally good like Chromium and Firefox
02:55:46 <cn3m[m]> On Android in general VPN and blocking DNS
02:56:53 <countermeasure> At the moment, I've set private dns to dns.adguard.com just for ad blocking, per the FAQ.
02:57:35 <countermeasure> I also get the impression that setting a private DNS might not be a good idea when using a VPN though.
02:59:12 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's possible but complicated to use your DNS as another data point for fingerprinting.
02:59:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's probably more trouble than it's worth to most trackers, but it's at least worth knowing about I guess.
03:00:09 <countermeasure> From https://grapheneos.org/faq#custom-dns: "Private DNS takes precedence over VPN-provided DNS..."
03:00:39 <countermeasure> So from that I take it that there would be DNS leakage if using a VPN and setting private DNS?
03:00:53 <cn3m[m]> <countermeasure "I also get the impression that s"> It's incredibly minor fingerprint vector
03:00:54 <cn3m[m]> There's better ways
03:00:54 <cn3m[m]> I wouldn't do it on Safari and Tor that's it
03:03:20 <countermeasure> So a good approach would be for me to use an always-on VPN *plus* set private DNS to dns.adguard.com?
03:03:32 <cyborgninjaneer[> Bottom line, if you're on NordVPN or some crap it probably won't matter. It could, but probably not. It's more likely you'd get fingerprinted by your blocklist than by the DNS itself.
03:03:33 <countermeasure> I'm using Vandium as browser, by the way.
03:03:54 <cn3m[m]> Ideally you would use a VPN with blocking support natively
03:04:06 <cyborgninjaneer[> And it's hard to get a detailed view of your block list, so that's also fairly minor
03:04:12 <cn3m[m]> <countermeasure "So a good approach would be for "> That's generally the best easy option
03:04:47 <countermeasure> cn3m[m]: Could you recommend a VPN provider which gives you DNS blocking?
03:05:59 <cyborgninjaneer[> I heard Proton is working on it, but last I checked they don't have it yet and some privacy junkies don't like ProtonVPN for some reason. (Still haven't figured out why)
03:06:28 <countermeasure> cyborgninjaneer[: Sounds like NordVPN is a -1 :) Any you would recommend?
03:06:34 <cn3m[m]> <countermeasure "cn3m: Could you recommend a VPN "> Can't and won't I don't like VPNs
03:07:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> I dont like recommending specific VPNs or password managers because people tend to follow the recommendations instead of doing sufficient research.
03:08:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> Start looking into VPNs based outside the various groups of "eyes," look at reviews, check for audits, form your own opinion.
03:08:23 <countermeasure> cn3m[m]: I feel like I still have a lot to learn! Without a VPN, how do you deal with being watched by your ISP?
03:09:05 <TheJollyRoger> countermeasure: if it's the content of what you visit or your webtraffic, you use sites that have HTTPS
03:09:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> Generally, a VPN is useful if you can be reasonably confident it is more trustworthy than your ISP. Otherwise it's pointless to use one.
03:10:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> All it does is keep a list of sites you visit out of the hands of your ISP.
03:10:02 <TheJollyRoger> Even if you're in a coffee shop with public wifi that's unencrypted and has no authentication, the HTTPS is designed specifically to thwart hostile actors on your network and ensure your traffic between you and the remote server (or at the very least, their DDOS Mitigation service) is encrypted.
03:10:27 <countermeasure> cyborgninjaneer[: No worries. I have several candidate providers in mind.
03:10:38 <TheJollyRoger> cyborgninjaneer[ 's right; if you use a VPN, this simply transfers the list of the sites you visit (and the size of what you request or send to them) to your VPN service provider.
03:11:08 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you live under a government that gets info from your ISP and does questionable things with it, a VPN based outside of that country's sphere of influence is nice.
03:12:13 <TheJollyRoger> Of course, if it's to a shady company in Panama being run out of a post office box that spent all their security budget running slick commercials and has a toxic data spill that compromised all their account data...
03:12:18 <TheJollyRoger> This tends to be a bit chancy.
03:12:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> You're not safe if you're already a target, but it increases the cost (and factor of deterrence) for untargeted/dragnet surveillance.
03:12:21 <TheJollyRoger> OH TOO SOON!
03:12:44 <cyborgninjaneer[> Oooh snap
03:12:45 <countermeasure> cyborgninjaneer[: I do live under one of those governments :) Moving that data to a different jurisdiction is my goal.
03:13:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> Lol
03:13:36 <cyborgninjaneer[> It won't save you if they want your ass, but it makes the cost for watching you greater than zero, which is a good deterrent.
03:14:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> If your government wants your ass, you've got bigger problems than somebody knowing what hentai you watch.
03:14:28 <travankor_> cyborgninjaneer: i think it’s pretty hard to be worse than a company like say comcast
03:14:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> Well there you go, travankor (@travankor:matrix.org)
03:15:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> All it does is change the entity you trust.
03:15:43 <countermeasure> I'm not a target. I'm boring! I just want a bit of control over when my traffic is logged.
03:15:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> For most people, that's a decent improvement.
03:16:30 <travankor_> yeah, tor tries to solve the anonymity problem
03:18:50 <countermeasure> Thanks for the help and infornation, everyone.
03:18:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> In reality, tor may or may not help you hide from the "eyes" governments, but its good for circumventing network restrictions without being noticed, I.e. censored-to-hell college internet.
03:19:50 <travankor_> well, not everyone is a target of the NSA :p
03:20:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> In some countries, tor might paint a target on your back. Most likely not one anybody will bother shooting at, but still a target.
03:20:25 <countermeasure> cyborgninjaneer[: Yeah, I like Tor and Orbot, but I'm looking for something which don't make browsing quite as slow.
03:21:40 <cyborgninjaneer[> Nothing is a panacea for anonymity. You just choose the tool that fits your situation, or unplug the internet.
03:22:43 <travankor_> tor over webrtc seems promising
03:23:37 <countermeasure> cyborgninjaneer[: Agreed. You just have to keep selecting the least-worst options given your circumstances.
03:24:27 <cyborgninjaneer[> The issue is with governments (mostly the US government) hosting malicious nodes and sniffing the traffic. It just means you're not 100% guaranteed to be anonymous all the time. It really just depends on what you're after and who you are hiding from.
03:25:29 <countermeasure> cyborgninjaneer[: Are you talking about Tor nodes, or VPNs, or both?
03:25:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> Tor nodes. They can't see what's in the traffic, but may be able to correlate stuff and de-anonymize some connections some of the time. Just keep that in mind when deciding your use case.
03:26:16 <countermeasure> No drama. Cheers!
03:26:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> Exactly. No drama. Just factors to consider when choosing what tool to use.
03:27:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> Different tools are better at different things.
03:28:12 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you're hiding from the site you're visiting, tor is great. Mail-slotted browser and random-ass IP? great!
03:28:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> Boom. Site admins don't know who you are.
03:29:12 <travankor_> cyborgninjaneer: do the correlation attacks still apply to onion addresses?
03:29:27 <cn3m[m]> <countermeasure "cn3m: I feel like I still have a"> I use one I'm just not a fan
03:30:23 <cyborgninjaneer[> travankor (@travankor:matrix.org): I'm not 100% sure. I think it's harder to do since they don't have free info from the clearnet (from the site's ISP)
03:31:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> Meaning (if my understanding is correct) that they need more nodes to have a chance at correlating your connection to an onion site
03:31:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> I could be totally off key on that though. Best do some research of your own.
03:32:29 <countermeasure> cn3m[m]: I see. Any VPN best-practice tips to share? I'm thinking to use the WireGuard app via F-Droid, for a start.
03:32:51 <cn3m[m]> Correlation attacks are very hard against Tor
03:32:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> That is true.
03:33:15 <cyborgninjaneer[> Hard, bit possible. It's just a matter of how scared you are I guess.
03:33:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> Hard but possible*
03:33:39 <cn3m[m]> <countermeasure "cn3m: I see. Any VPN best-practi"> PTIO for recommendations and the0  might be able to weigh in on wireguard
03:33:45 <cn3m[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Hard but possible*"> Very possible
03:35:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> The main thing to keep in mind with tor is that it is not secure, so you don't want to bank over it for example. Malicious exit nodes exist. It's for anonymity, NOT for security.
03:35:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> A decent VPN is far more secure.
03:35:45 <countermeasure> cn3m[m]: What does PTIO mean?
03:36:05 <concat[m]> <countermeasure "cn3m: What does PTIO mean?"> https://privacytools.io
03:36:23 <countermeasure> concat[m]: Thanks.
03:36:27 <cyborgninjaneer[> IMHO, VPNs are far better for everyday use by normal people.
03:36:55 <travankor_> is anonymous banking / financial transactions even a thing?
03:37:11 <travankor_> everything i’ve seen so far is false advertising
03:37:17 <countermeasure> cyborgninjaneer[: That's me. I'm a normal people.
03:37:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you're trying to research a censored topic on college WiFi for a paper, either tor or a VPN will work, but tor is less noticeable and harder for paranoid network admins to block.
03:39:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you just want to keep your tentacle hentai sites out of the eyes of random government agencies and data brokers, a VPN is fine. If you're doing illegal stuff... Knock it off and get your life together.

03:53:45 <travankor_> also I remember Lindsey Graham and his shills saying that encryption is bad and American tech companies need to have backdoors for their products
03:56:35 <cyborgninjaneer[> Bill Barr too. He's going after corruption in Washington, but if our encryption becomes collateral damage from letting him run wild, it's not worth it.
03:58:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> The good news is, that's nothing new. There have been anti-encryption bills (including some sneaky ones) shot down several times. This has happened before and it will happen again.
04:00:23 <cyborgninjaneer[> If it worries you, call your senators. Buy a damn burner phone or use a pay phone if you have to.
04:02:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> Or just use your normal number and don't worry about it. Free country and all.
04:04:47 <travankor_> https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity
04:07:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yeah that. Start calling people.
04:08:35 <cyborgninjaneer[> Senators get a bunch of phone calls going "noooooo not my encryption!" and they're a lot less likely to vote in favor. That's normal.
04:09:33 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's one way everyday people can make a difference.
04:10:59 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not sure I should reveal this in a public channel but...
04:11:18 <cyborgninjaneer[> Up to you.
04:11:45 <TheJollyRoger> Something that tends to get a lot of politicians' attention is actually a handwritten letter, written in long hand.
04:12:38 <TheJollyRoger> I write a lot of politicians, and although usually E-mails and faxes usually get ignored or get a form reply from a secretary, handwritten letters actually tend to get a ton of attention.
04:12:51 <ruddo[m]> Thanks for the update strcat
04:13:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yeah, good point. Good point.
04:13:32 <cyborgninjaneer[> Oh hey I see the update here too. Thanks, Daniel. @strcat:matrix.org
04:13:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, ok, ok, I admit, I also write them on paper that's usually very heavy, and is often cream-coloured or that stands out or is a nonstandard size, but I get replies that aren't form generated much, much, much more often if I send those.
04:14:18 <cyborgninjaneer[> If Bill Barr pisses you off, I guess you could send Trump a handwritten letter.
04:14:27 <TheJollyRoger> Woah update already...?
04:15:01 <cyborgninjaneer[> Got some kernel changes in here, but I'm not up to speed on exactly what these do...
04:15:12 <TheJollyRoger> Oh cool! Awww yes, awesome, thank you s?trcat. As soon as Flame is off the Testing rig, Blueline is going back on it.
04:15:29 <TheJollyRoger> cyborgninjaneer[: well... I also tend to choose who I send handwritten letters to very carefully.
04:15:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> Lol
04:16:06 <TheJollyRoger> Although it may interest you to know that I've gotten hand-signed replies from no fewer than two different Prime Ministers of Canada.
04:16:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> Hey, that's not bad.
04:16:31 <TheJollyRoger> Which account for every single letter I've sent them.
04:16:48 <cyborgninjaneer[> Well that's a hell of a statistic
04:17:01 <countermeasure> TheJollyRoger: Good on you for the letter writing. This is how democracy works.
04:17:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Handwritten letters written on fancy paper, in a fancy, nonstandard sized envelope are the equivalent of dropping a tactical nuclear weapon when it comes to contacting a politician.
04:17:22 <TheJollyRoger> Short of meeting one in person and discussing with them.
04:17:22 <JTL> :D
04:17:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe X3.
04:18:17 <sourcream71[m]> "Dear bill Barr why did you let Flynn off the hook"
04:19:08 * TheJollyRoger grimaces uncomfortably.
04:19:33 <TheJollyRoger> You kinda do need to know who you're contacting though X(
04:19:47 <countermeasure> For people who use a VPN on GrapheneOS, do you prefer to use the VPN provider's app, or a generic app like WireGuard or OpenVPN for Android?
04:19:56 <travankor_> I’m kind of curious what TheJollyRoger’s handwriting is like?
04:20:38 <travankor_> like Declaration of Indepence? because I’d need to work on my handwriting 😅
04:20:42 <TheJollyRoger> Would you like to see it?
04:20:45 <TheJollyRoger> One moment.
04:21:08 <jneplokh> <countermeasure "For people who use a VPN on Grap"> I use WireGuard and then download their config
04:21:14 <jneplokh> And if I use OpenVPN, I do the same with the OpenVPN app
04:24:29 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger: That is awesome about Techlore. He seems like a great guy. I like how he talks about stuff that no one else really does. Really enjoy when he rips into Telsa.
04:25:08 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm totally going to use an AI botnet to track Jolly Roger down based on his handwriting, and leave a rubber chicken on his doorstep.
04:25:10 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: I should watch some of his videos then! I've been a bit behind on my youtube, ahaha.
04:25:45 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, ah cyborgninjaneer[ don't say that, ahahaha, it's gonna be too soon :P.
04:26:12 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I do have something, I usually write up a whole lot of these and then hand them out to other people I meet...
04:26:17 <TheJollyRoger> https://jollyrogers.ca/public/gpg-key.jpg
04:27:37 <TheJollyRoger> So, this is how my writing usually appears. Yes, I could slow down and take my time and make it look better, but this is about as "day to day" a sample of my writing as you're going to get because usually when I write these I write a few of them at a time.
04:28:20 <countermeasure> jneplokh: Thanks.
04:28:39 <TheJollyRoger> Then I dip the paper in coffee to artificially age it and if I'm feeling particularly creative I'll spray the paper with a solution of ordinary household ammonia, which will cause the ink to turn brown and become cracked as if it was written a long time ago.
04:28:56 <jneplokh> No problem!
04:29:06 <jneplokh> I mean at least it looks "fancy," my handwriting is awful haha
04:29:15 <TheJollyRoger> X3.
04:30:32 <countermeasure> cn3m[m]: Do you use a generic VPN app, your VPN provider's app, or some other option?
04:31:27 <LynnStephenson[4> <TheJollyRoger "https://jollyrogers.ca/public/gp"> Did you strip EXIF?
04:31:57 <LynnStephenson[4> * BuT diD yOu strip EXIF?
04:32:36 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha I hope it worked :P.
04:33:30 <LynnStephenson[4> Why not present as a text file?
04:34:37 <TheJollyRoger> LynnStephenson[4: travankor_ wanted to see what my handwriting looked like. I started to bring these "treasure maps" with me to meetups I go to.
04:34:52 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger: Telsa honestly reminds me the earlier days of Apple it is scary heh.
04:35:09 <LynnStephenson[4> Haven't used PGP in a while, is it entirely reliant on SHA-1 for the fingerprint? Or can you use SHA-256?
04:35:13 <cn3m[m]> <countermeasure "cn3m: Do you use a generic VPN a"> You could use the built in setup in Android too
04:35:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: just go into medicine once
04:35:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Your handwriting will be so shit
04:35:16 <LynnStephenson[4> <TheJollyRoger "Lynn Stephenson: travankor wante"> Oooh, that sounds neat.
04:35:22 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: Oh boy. I remember reading those "Yeah we'll just patch OpenSSL to ignore cert expiry date" posts.
04:35:34 <cn3m[m]> OpenVPN is fine
04:35:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> People will think you are saying arcane bs in arabic
04:35:42 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: oh noooooo X(
04:36:05 <TheJollyRoger> LynnStephenson[4: actually, at GPG the team are working on SHA-2 fingerprints for v5 keys. but that won't be out for a while.
04:36:25 <TheJollyRoger> I keep wanting to get back and finish the user's manual but... not enough time.
04:36:52 <LynnStephenson[4> Ah. Couldn't you get the raw PK and hash it with SHA-256 yourself?
04:37:15 <LynnStephenson[4> <TheJollyRoger "I keep wanting to get back and f"> Ah do you work on the project?
04:37:30 <LynnStephenson[4> Or do you mean finish reading the manual for yourself?
04:37:45 <TheJollyRoger> Unofficially? You can. But there wouldn't be much good in doing that at this moment, because it doesn't adhere to the RFC and nobody else would be doing it, but you.
04:38:31 <countermeasure> cn3m[m]: Both OpenVPN and WireGuard need an app though, right, because they're not built in?
04:38:42 <TheJollyRoger> LynnStephenson[4: I was working on volunteering to do a new handbook (since the current one we've got was written before the patent on the RSA Cryptosystem expired, which was in 1998!) with the support of the project and I still hang out there, but at this moment it's on hold.
04:38:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: BTW do you know how these cables work?

04:39:31 <LynnStephenson[4> <TheJollyRoger "Lynn Stephenson: I was working o"> Ah I see.
04:39:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> <TheJollyRoger "Lynn Stephenson: I was working o"> TheJollyRoger  FYI even without exif data, I was able to find your city and three possible addresses. Unless you scrubbed your info from data brokers you might want to be somewhat careful with your real name.
04:39:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> And why are they like really expensive for what they do (this one by oneplus sells for $10-15)
04:40:06 <cyborgninjaneer[> <cyborgninjaneer[ "TheJollyRoger  FYI even without "> Why did that randomly quote you? Damn riot bs
04:40:15 <travankor_> cyborgninjaneer: no mortal boatswain messes with The Jolly Roger and lives to tell the tale
04:40:21 <cyborgninjaneer[> And why did that quote me???
04:41:09 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: These USB Audio cables? I don't. I think there are several versions. I think the cheaper ones simply emulate an analog audio out device, and the Pixel 2s don't support them. The ones that ship with the Pixel 2 and later are digital and do it the proper way, because Google stopped supporting that kludgy workaround.
04:41:24 <TheJollyRoger> But unfortunately there isn't any way to tell short of plugging the device in.
04:41:39 <TheJollyRoger> cyborgninjaneer[: ah, there's my lousy opsec in action X(
04:41:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: wait so this stuff comes in the box?
04:42:01 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: there should be one in the box.
04:42:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. There should be one in the box... hang on a moment.
04:42:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Huh. Interesting
04:42:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oneplus had me spend on it separately in the store
04:42:55 * TheJollyRoger starts rummaging around.
04:43:01 <galyoninion[m]> hi
04:43:07 * TheJollyRoger turns the box upside-down and shakes it.
04:43:07 <galyoninion[m]> Ihave questions
04:43:09 <galyoninion[m]> ok?
04:43:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hey wait a minute, looks like they didn't include one for the 4.
04:43:24 <TheJollyRoger> galyoninion[m]: yep go ahead. What's up?
04:43:52 <defconanon12[m]> anupritaisno1: I have one of those cables. They came with a Chinese phone that I still have. It is a headphone adapter cable. Pretty sure. It has been a long time.
04:44:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You have to make sure it's the kind that supports digital though.
04:44:20 <galyoninion[m]> I want to use GrapheneOS, but I'm wondering if it should be used with Google Pixel 3a or 4. I heard from developers on Reddit earlier that Pixel 4 is not supported, but what about the reality? https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/dk0iho/pixel_4_support_will_not_be_considered_in_the/
04:44:20 <galyoninion[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/g6xvoo/pixel_4_and_pixel_4xl_support/
04:44:20 <galyoninion[m]> And if 3a is going out of support and Pixel4 is going to take mainstream support, what are the advantages and disadvantages of Pixel4? Is the Pixel 4 worth the price?
04:44:29 <TheJollyRoger> There's no way to tell by simply looking at it, you have to make sure the vendor claims it specifically supports the Pixel 3 and later.
04:44:53 <cyborgninjaneer[> TheJollyRoger: if you were the only one with that name, I could have mailed you a rubber chicken.
04:44:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> Lol
04:45:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "There's no way to tell by simply"> So how to tell this?
04:45:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Except plugging it in
04:45:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hi galyoninion[m] at this moment, whether the pixel 4 is worth the price is actually going to be up to you on this: I'll go into more detail in a sec...
04:45:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't think I have a way to accurately measure distortion
04:46:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> And that's the only way from what I know
04:46:26 <TheJollyRoger> cyborgninjaneer[: if you do, I'll mail you a box of my own home-baked cookies when the heatwave passes as a congratulations.
04:46:49 <TheJollyRoger> :)
04:47:27 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: I think the vendors usually should say it explicitly? I mean, on Amazon some sellers do say "Works with Pixel 2/3/4"
04:47:30 <cyborgninjaneer[> Hmm... That might be worth two wasted chickens.
04:47:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> And the other two would be going WTF...
04:47:57 <TheJollyRoger> cyborgninjaneer[: just don't do something stupid and eat three in the same sitting or you're going to make yourself extremely wired.
04:48:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> Nah I'd probably end up on another watch list.
04:48:07 <galyoninion[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi galyoninion at this moment, w"> Please explaing
04:48:11 <TheJollyRoger> (The secret ingredient to them is chocolate covered coffee beans)
04:48:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is because analog signals are like these continuous waves
04:48:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> They are more prone to distortion
04:48:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> On the other hand digital signals are discrete. They use concepts like V{OH,IH,OL,IL} to make them discrete and ∆V{I,O} tells them to be that way
04:48:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> (Noise margin)
04:48:34 <TheJollyRoger> (Eating one of those is like drinking an entire cup of coffee all at once)
04:49:08 <TheJollyRoger> galyoninion[m]: Right now as it stands, the Pixel 4 is roughly $800 USD, and the Pixel 3a is a little over half that.
04:49:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'd guess if you wanted to tell digital from analog just set the volume really high and look for distortion in analog?
04:49:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Holy shit
04:49:24 <TheJollyRoger> The 4 will have a longer lifespan than the 3a, but only by six months.
04:49:36 <sourcream71[m]> I think you mean a little less half of that?
04:49:45 <TheJollyRoger> Prices came down?
04:49:45 <defconanon12[m]> So Pixels that don't have headphone jack are going the adapter route eh?
04:50:10 <TheJollyRoger> Up here in Canada a Pixel 4 is $1000, and the 3a is $549, but that's Canadian dollars.
04:50:17 <TheJollyRoger> *$550
04:50:26 <LynnStephenson[4> They fluctuate. But still, expensive.
04:50:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
04:50:34 <JTL> Monopoly dollars /s
04:50:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lynn Stephenson: pixel prices are like stock market?
04:51:38 <TheJollyRoger> So is the Pixel 4 a good phone? Honestly, I'm going to say yes, it's a great phone. It's got a nice glass back, it has wireless charging, it's also got the convenience of facial recognition (which now will refuse to open if your eyes are closed) but at the same time I'm going to miss the fingerprint scanner and the headphone jack.
04:52:06 <cyborgninjaneer[> My advice is to buy used and local. Just run the IMEI before you buy and make sure it's not stolen. That protects both parties involved in the transaction.
04:52:11 <TheJollyRoger> It also has a better camera if that's a big plus for you and OpenCamera will bring the better camera to life; not as good or as feature rich as GCam, but still great.
04:52:11 <defconanon12[m]> Okay good news the reset button removed the rootkit luckily. I don't see those vulnerable ports anymore.
04:52:29 <TheJollyRoger> Is it the right phone for you? Honestly, I can't say.
04:52:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> defconanon12: what had a rootkit in it? One of your machines?
04:52:55 <TheJollyRoger> Because that'll depend on how much you want that better camera, that glass back, and are willing to give up the 1/8" headphone jack, and have that extra six months of support.
04:53:04 <TheJollyRoger> And how much those are worth to you.
04:53:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can people stop using glass backs?
04:53:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> For 5 minutes?
04:53:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Glass backs just make the phone slippery and force you to put a case on
04:53:33 <TheJollyRoger> Admittedly, yes X(
04:53:44 <TheJollyRoger> I ended up wrapping mine in tape because I ordered the wrong case by mistake.
04:53:51 <jneplokh> Not unless you live life on the edge ;)
04:54:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> Users: Glass backs suck.
04:54:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> Manufacturers: Haha wireless charging go brrrrrr
04:54:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> jacob: idk do you?
04:54:26 <defconanon12[m]> cyborgninjaneer: Yep. I had the works. PUPs and a rootkit. Never found the rootkit but I did find vulnerable ports randomly opened and my firewall logs were deleted.
04:54:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> cyborgninjaneer: but can you do wireless and wired together?
04:54:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> anupritaisno1: careful they might be listening for more bad ideas
04:55:07 <defconanon12[m]> Also, modified Discord client to spread even more malware.
04:55:18 <jneplokh> <anupritaisno1[m] "jacob: idk do you?"> Depends I guess, I have a case, but I use it less and less. I want to appreciate the design of the phone and it feels so nice. If I know I am going somewhere for a bit though, I put on a case
04:55:33 <jneplokh> <defconanon12[m] "cyborgninjaneer: Yep. I had the "> Yikes, what happened?
04:56:12 <LynnStephenson[4> <TheJollyRoger "So is the Pixel 4 a good phone? "> No fingerprint support?
04:56:23 <cyborgninjaneer[> A word to the wise: if you must use Discord, use it in the browser
04:56:30 <defconanon12[m]> On this particular machine downloaded shady files in the past and when I thought I was safe.
04:56:49 <jneplokh> Ah I see
04:56:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: digital audio is better though
04:57:02 <defconanon12[m]> Yeah I agree. The client sucks in all honesty if someone can take advantage of it that easily.
04:57:28 <cyborgninjaneer[> Dumbass program in browser sandbox >>> dumbass program running on silicon
04:58:02 <jneplokh> Yup, agreed. Plus, way more convenient should you have multiple accounts.
04:58:10 <TheJollyRoger> LynnStephenson[4 Pixel 4s do not have the fingerprint sensor. They instead have what I believe to be a laser infrared scanner for your face.
04:58:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Heh
04:58:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> Plus Discird sells data to who-knows-where. Pretty sure some of their customers are political hackjobs.
04:58:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixel 4: imma steal your face
04:59:19 <defconanon12[m]> If I was connected to the internet while it was running the script I would have been pwned.
04:59:30 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: yeah, digital is much better.
04:59:50 <cyborgninjaneer[> Anyway, just another snoopy, insecure program that shouldn't be trusted on your local machine.
05:00:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> defconanon12: it's a good job you spotted it before that happened.
05:00:58 <TheJollyRoger> Although when it came out, the Pixel 4's facial recognition was a little chancy (it could still "recognize" you if your eyes were closed) it's since been made much stricter now: the phone won't open if your mouth is covered, or if your eyes are closed.
05:01:31 <TheJollyRoger> After five attempts at reading the face are failed it gives up and simply falls back to the password.
05:02:34 <cyborgninjaneer[> I hate face unlock. Fingerprints are bad enough. Personal preference I guess. At least I can wipe prints off the sensor and lie about which finger it is and blame the sensor when it doesn't work.
05:03:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: this is why lineageos has a lockdown feature

05:03:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you hit that button
05:03:25 <JTL> Pretty sure AOSP has that too at this point?
05:03:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only the password can unlock it
05:03:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I think all Android has lockdown.
05:03:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
05:03:54 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: I remember LineageOS backported it to older Android versions?
05:03:55 <sourcream71[m]> Yeah they do, its not just linageos that has it
05:04:06 <TheJollyRoger> You do have to turn it on in preferences though...
05:04:15 <LynnStephenson[4> Yes it does.
05:04:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> GrapheneOS has it.
05:04:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos just uses an implementation where you scan a wrong finger a couple times

05:04:28 <sourcream71[m]> No
05:04:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's locked

05:06:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Huh. Interesting
05:06:26 <ruddo[m]> Not that I know of.  The lockdown option only appears on the power menu.
05:06:33 <TheJollyRoger> cyborgninjaneer[: yes there is. Tap and hold power button for one second and release.
05:06:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wasn't aware

05:11:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> What is riot doing? It keeps choosing a random weird thing to do almost every time I send a message
05:12:00 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: aaaaaaa, ahahaha XD
05:12:05 <TheJollyRoger> The feeling is real X(
05:13:31 <defconanon12[m]> cyborgninjaneer: Well it did a random update, rebooted my computer, and then all I had to do was click on it. So I did without internet. You would be surprised how many viruses need internet heh. I took a risk and turns out I was right.
05:14:21 <cyborgninjaneer[> What OS?
05:14:55 <defconanon12[m]> Windows 10.
05:16:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> Never did like sudden updates.
05:18:31 <defconanon12[m]> cyborgninjaneer: Oh when I mean update I mean my Discord client randomly updated.
05:18:45 <defconanon12[m]> Modified rather.
05:19:41 <sheruleeya[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "TheJollyRoger  FYI even without "> How though? What data should I scrub when taking pictures?
05:20:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> sheruleeya: don't post your real name anywhere or someone can probably find you in public records and narrow it down with clues.
05:20:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's different.
05:21:20 <sheruleeya[m]> I thought exif and revoke location permission can easily scrub pic data
05:22:04 <cyborgninjaneer[> As far as exif data, you could use something like Scrambled Exif when you post images on here or... Yep just shut off the permissions.
05:22:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yes - what he said. Technology is not a substitute for opsec.
05:22:46 <sourcream71[m]> The name wasn't in the metadata, it was literally written on the letter itself, thats what he's referring to
05:22:46 <TheJollyRoger> For instance - my github is quite plainly in my name. So is my E-mail address, and my GPG keys.
05:23:20 <TheJollyRoger> So that's not very opsec even if I was to reduce EXIF data.
05:23:32 <sheruleeya[m]> Alright. Not sure what will happen if it (real name) is already posted
05:23:33 <sheruleeya[m]> Any ways to scrub it (example, I want to remove my sibling"s real name)?
05:23:35 <cyborgninjaneer[> Unless your name is Joe Smith, there's always a risk of someone figuring out which one you are and getting your address or whatever. If your name is unusual, you really want to keep it secret because you're easy to find.
05:24:00 <sheruleeya[m]> Should I pay, or request or something?
05:24:38 <sheruleeya[m]> <sheruleeya[m] "Should I pay, or request or some"> If it is hypothetically posted already
05:25:23 <TheJollyRoger> I think some data brokers allow you to request a takedown... but for some of them, the takedown process is even more invasive than the information they post!
05:25:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> Depends on jurisdiction. If you're in the EU the sibling can make the site take it down and delete it.
05:25:39 <cyborgninjaneer[> Also, what TheJollyRoger said
05:26:24 <sheruleeya[m]> Will try to find it then. Sadly, we live on Asia
05:30:04 <cyborgninjaneer[> You might try to delete the account that posted the name.
05:31:16 <sheruleeya[m]> will do, thanks
05:32:18 <cyborgninjaneer[> The easiest thing is to delete the message or post, but it might be a good idea to get rid of the whole account and start over
05:32:34 <TheJollyRoger> If you guys ever want to know how I got my "pirate" gimmick, you can thank Google: I actually searched up myself a long time ago and found that I share the name of one of the most famous pirates in history who deserted the British Navy, and terrorized the coast from Ireland all the way to Spain back in the 17th century.
05:33:30 <TheJollyRoger> and plundered the Spanish treasure fleet returning from the New World, before fleeing to the New World as a very rich man.
05:34:14 <TheJollyRoger> There are urban legends that the real Peter Easton buried treasure someplace in the far north of Canada... but that's just an old folk tale.
05:41:29 <renlord> was peter easton involved in the fur trade?
05:51:10 <TheJollyRoger> renlord: hee hee, I don't think so but that would have been funny XD

08:38:29 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to have to start this one again.
08:38:51 <TheJollyRoger> Cripes, why, why, why xterminal, why did you have to crash...
08:39:07 <TheJollyRoger> (To clarify, this is not a fault of the CTS, this is a fault of the terminal emulator it was running in.)
08:39:17 <TheJollyRoger> (I hit "save buffer" and it crashed)
08:41:52 <TheJollyRoger> Going to restart this one and go back to sleep... dammit. I should not have done that.
08:50:29 <frenchieisverige> Is there anyway to speed up the process?
08:50:55 <frenchieisverige> 35 hours of compilation feels like you are using a pentium III
08:51:22 <TheJollyRoger> frenchieisverige: it's not compiling, it's running the CTS. The phone is doing the work, not the computer.
08:51:50 <frenchieisverige> OK. I see
08:52:29 <TheJollyRoger> Restarting it now. :(

11:37:06 <yolotro[m]> pixel 3a XL probably

11:38:14 <yolotro[m]>  * it got a 3700mah battery
11:46:23 <frenchieisverige> But the screen is bigger as the 3a. I wanted to know if the 700mah could compensate it.
11:46:40 <frenchieisverige> But apparently it does even better
11:46:42 <schnenhcs[m]> Yes I actually get 2-3 days on Graphene. Quite pleasant. Now I just need the time to code all the tings that are missing in Graphene...

12:03:19 <cdesai> Yeah, only by a little bit.
12:03:24 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "Pixel 4 has a smaller better tha"> smaller better?
12:03:30 <cdesai> No
12:03:48 <cdesai> Smaller in capacity, so it would last less
12:04:21 <cn3m[m]> Battery*
12:04:22 <sheruleeya[m]> The wording had me confused somehow
12:04:22 <travankor> the SoC is more efficient so it could be better
12:04:25 <cdesai> But it should still end up being better than stock
12:04:39 <cdesai> The display is also 90Hz negating some of that, and higher res (slightly)
12:04:52 <travankor> you can force 60Hz
12:05:23 <cdesai> Sadly afaict that Google isn't in aosp and may need to be enabled or added somehow.
12:05:46 <travankor> that
12:05:51 <travankor> that Google?

12:15:53 <alzxjm[m]1> <jknsec[m] "ICIJ and ProPublica are pretty s"> I like my local NPR station, The Intercept, Propublica, and Vox. The latter is fairly liberal but at the very least they do a huge amount of work in terms of researching and reporting on white papers, interviewing experts, and presenting super weedsy policy in a readable format.
12:25:09 <cdesai> travankor: typo, I meant that toggle*
12:26:00 <cdesai> Soli stuff isn't exactly oss but some might work, the face unlock bits do work, it wakes up the device in time
12:29:22 <travankor> that's a shame
12:29:30 <travankor> soli was the hyped feature for pixel4
12:29:50 <travankor> tbh i think they will mothball the soli tech
12:39:34 <privacy_based_li> Just got to know about CalyxOS, how does it stack up against GrapheneOS
12:47:07 <schnenhcs[m]> From the teasertext its verified boot enabled aosp with microg, fdroid, signal to and "duckduckgo browser"
12:47:22 <schnenhcs[m]> Half garbage choice. Ddg browser lol
12:53:00 <madaidan[m]> <privacy_based_li "Just got to know about CalyxOS, "> CalyxOS is nice. It's basically AOSP with a few apps preinstalled but it's not as good as GrapheneOS since it doesn't do the same hardening work.
12:55:09 <travankor> if grapheneos ever goes under, calyxos seems like the next best ROM
12:55:43 <privacy_based_li> <madaidan[m] "CalyxOS is nice. It's basically "> ohkay
12:57:08 <privacy_based_li> strcat: also, when the Copperhead thing happened, did we lose any progress/code in GrapheneOS
12:57:28 <alzxjm[m]1> <madaidan[m] "CalyxOS is nice. It's basically "> Is it as secure as stock Pixel Android? Presumably so, given that it's AOSP. The microG implementation seems reasonably secure as signature spoofing is restricted to only that app.
12:58:46 <madaidan[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "Is it as secure as stock Pixel A"> Yes, it preserves the security model (unlike most other ROMs).
12:59:21 <madaidan[m]> <privacy_based_li "strcat: also, when the Copperhea"> Yes, a lot of stuff still needs to be added back.
13:01:58 <privacy_based_li> So is that code owned by Copperhead? Caz i guess it was written by Daniel so cant we just paste it here?
13:05:12 <madaidan[m]> <privacy_based_li "So is that code owned by Copperh"> It is not owned by Copperhead. Daniel owns all of the code. Some changes are as simple as just cherrypicking the old commits but some need to be changed/fixed/tested/etc.
13:05:39 <madaidan[m]> E.g. slab canaries cause issues with modern Qualcomm SoCs that still needs to be fixed
13:06:06 <cx2[m]> <madaidan[m] "CalyxOS is nice. It's basically "> I think "not as good" is a relative statement.

14:22:00 <jiibus[m]> One of which is the bromite repo

14:25:12 <angtheephemeral[> My main issue was that it didn't block ads

17:57:11 <jiibus[m]> j3ghprjfo: it's not just your network that you gotta worry about if you're living in an apartment, for example.
17:57:44 <schnenhcs[m]> <jiibus[m] "You could check to see if your w"> I had over time a bunch of reasons for such:
17:59:03 <schnenhcs[m]> - Inability of either hw or sw to deal with multi ap setups.
17:59:03 <schnenhcs[m]>  (For exame same ssid, different bssids and no roaming handover configured. Most devices handled it fine, a bunch didnt.)
17:59:56 <schnenhcs[m]> - Once I a device didnt like my sequential bssids' vendor part. When I set it to a different vendor part it worked.
18:00:20 <jiibus[m]> Yea, there's lots of reasons for wifi issues, it just helps to eliminate the easy potential causes first.
18:02:33 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Ok so my 2.4hz is not crowded, I'm not in a population dense area. I do have ddwrt router that has 2.4ghz and 5ghz on the same network ssid
18:03:00 <jiibus[m]> worldwideworld: you're trying to move into a directory that doesn't exist. Type the full path to the folder with your `cd` command.
18:03:26 <overheadscallop[> worldwideworld: which folder did you unzip it to
18:08:24 <overheadscallop[> that looks right
18:14:02 <AdventureCommuni> You can install graphene from windows?
18:16:14 <TheJollyRoger> AdventureCommuni: yes. It's one of the supported operating systems for installation.
18:35:57 <defconanon12[m]> Anyone having issues with Signal after the latest update?
18:36:31 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: No issues here.
18:40:48 <privacy_based_li> <faxing[m] "Use Vanadium if you're looking f"> How about Vanadium with Orbot?
18:44:08 <privacy_based_li> <defconanon12[m] "Anyone having issues with Signal"> what kind of?
18:45:17 <faxing[m]> <defconanon12[m] "Anyone having issues with Signal"> I'm not having any on their APK. If you're having problems, please report them to the developers of the application.
18:46:22 <faxing[m]> <privacy_based_li "How about Vanadium with Orbot?"> It's the setup that I use and I've found it to be the best balance of privacy, security, and anonymity - but that's just because of how I utilize my phone, it may very well not be the best solution for you.
18:48:34 <maneo[m]> is it safe to use the same browser for PWAs and regular browsing?
18:51:05 <privacy_based_li> <faxing[m] "It's the setup that I use and I'"> Vanadium with Orbot would combine strong security and anonymity
18:55:46 <faxing[m]> Don't do it
19:01:01 <privacy_based_li> <faxing[m] "Don't do it"> what?
19:18:58 <faxing[m]> Use PWAs with Brave
19:19:10 <faxing[m]> or even Chrome if the PWAs are already awful for privacy like if you're doing a PWA for twitter
19:19:14 <faxing[m]> It sent way late
19:19:33 <faxing[m]> I was responding to maneo
19:19:42 <faxing[m]> But it didn't send for a long time
19:20:35 <maneo[m]> i use bromite for my browsing, is it fine to use pwas with that or will they be able to access any cookies or cached data from my other browsing
19:21:06 <defconanon12[m]> Mainly having a problem sending messages even after verifying who I am.
19:21:17 <faxing[m]> I'd say use another browser for PWAs if you have the ability to
19:21:35 <jneplokh> https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tobykurien.webapps/
19:21:38 <jneplokh> Would this app on fdroid be fine?
19:21:46 <privacy_based_li> <faxing[m] "I'd say use another browser for "> hows webapps app from fdroid, it uses the system webview
19:22:30 <privacy_based_li> <jneplokh "https://f-droid.org/packages/com"> yeah thats exactly what I was talking about
19:22:44 <faxing[m]> Webapps is my favorite way to isolate pwas if you don't have any other browser options really
19:23:32 <jneplokh> It's also nice to have it in one app, easy to access, but that is just about convenience
19:23:53 <faxing[m]> WebApps retty secure, pretty private, pretty simple - but if you have the option to use a good browser that has stronger privacy and security protections for PWAs then it is a better option imo
19:24:08 <faxing[m]> * WebApps is pretty secure, pretty private, pretty simple - but if you have the option to use a good browser that has stronger privacy and security protections for PWAs then it is a better option imo
19:25:07 <faxing[m]> * WebApps is pretty secure, pretty private, pretty simple, pretty convenient, but not outstanding with category other than convenience really - if you have the option to use a good browser that has stronger privacy and security protections for PWAs then it is a better option imo
19:26:59 <cn3m[m]> <faxing[m] "WebApps retty secure, pretty pri"> It's more complicated than that
19:27:03 <cn3m[m]> WebView has worse sandboxing, but better mitigation
19:27:05 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium is the only option that's purely just better
19:27:07 <maneo[m]> thanks for the advice, i'll use chromium for pwas and bromite for everything else until i can switch to grapheneos
19:28:26 <cn3m[m]> Bromite is the most secure on non GrapheneOS systems
19:34:21 <alzxjm[m]1> Stupid, but kinda-related question. How to browsers in general (and Vanadium in particular) handle cookies? I imagine lots of the interest in using PWAs in this context is to avoid having to download and sign into stuff like Google Maps or Twitter. If I am using Vanadium for Google Maps and also for Facebook, can Facebook access metadata about my Google account, say?
19:41:06 <strcat[m]> cookies are scoped by origin
19:41:54 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: sites can never access each other's cookies, not how it works
19:42:57 <strcat[m]> although if a site includes JavaScript from another party whether on their server or on the client then they're trusting that JS obviously
19:43:00 <strcat[m]> doesn't have to happen on the client obviously
19:43:14 <strcat[m]> sites are increasingly moving towards server-side middleware
19:43:24 <strcat[m]> i.e. stuff like an apache/nginx module from the advertiser
19:43:48 <strcat[m]> especially to work around GDPR like what the nytimes is going to be doing now
19:44:12 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: no, sites can't reach each others cookies
19:44:42 <strcat[m]> if you connect to example.com and it sets a cookie, only example.com can read/write that, they're scoped by site
19:44:57 <strcat[m]> if example.com includes an image from foo.com and that sets a cookie, only foo.com can read/write that
19:45:35 <strcat[m]> cookies are set for an origin, other origins can't access them, that's always how it works
19:46:04 <strcat[m]> a 'third party cookie' according to browsers is a weird concept
19:46:07 <strcat[m]> not what you would expect
19:46:19 <strcat[m]> lets say you have visited foo.com before and it ALREADY set a cookie previously
19:46:30 <strcat[m]> now you visited example.com and it includes a connection to foo.com
19:46:36 <strcat[m]> that foo.com cookie from before is sent
19:46:54 <strcat[m]> disallowing third party cookies does not disallow that because browsers defined that setting in a weird way
19:47:08 <strcat[m]> the way they defined it is that a third party connection in the client cannot set a new cookie
19:47:10 <strcat[m]> anyway as I explained above
19:47:27 <strcat[m]> sites can work with third parties server-side and you're worrying about the wrong things
19:48:46 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: visit https://www.qubes.com/
19:48:49 <strcat[m]> look at cookies in developer console
19:49:24 <strcat[m]> (I know that's not qubesos it's just some random thing I typed)
19:49:48 <ruddo[m]> If you want to block cookies, use uMatrix.  This lets you prohibit cookies being set by third parties using tracking pixels and other HTTP resources.
19:49:58 <ruddo[m]> Nothing else works correctly.
19:50:02 <strcat[m]> ruddo: not really for the reason I just showed
19:50:04 <strcat[m]> doesn't work
19:50:09 <strcat[m]> go connect to that site and look at cookies
19:50:44 <strcat[m]> __cfduid is not a cookie set by the people hosting that site but it's a first party qubes.com cookie
19:50:44 <ruddo[m]> I am on mobile right now, please stand by for me to go back home and shown you video.
19:51:36 <strcat[m]> __cfduid is set by Cloudflare for sites using it for hosting and it's first party because they are doing it server side
19:51:39 <strcat[m]> it's not a third party cookie
19:51:52 <strcat[m]> but this does not require that they use a third party as a load balancer / reverse proxy
19:52:00 <strcat[m]> a third party can set first party cookies via middleware
19:52:16 <strcat[m]> ruddo: thinking you can block third party involvement in the client is wrong and misguided
19:52:59 <strcat[m]> a sensible approach is having everything keyed by origin
19:53:50 <strcat[m]> we can enable that earlier than when it ships upstream, there's a configuration option
19:55:00 <strcat[m]> people have really misguided ideas on how the web works and how privacy works
19:55:10 <strcat[m]> my suggestion is ignore what nearly everyone says about it including people trying to push their extensions
19:55:22 <strcat[m]> because they are ignorant and often dishonest
19:55:31 <strcat[m]> and they are pretending to give you privacy that they are not giving you
19:55:58 <strcat[m]> and they've misguided you into thinking that the friction added by their addons and all the choices / toggles you are dealing with are making you more private
19:56:07 <strcat[m]> and it's appealing to think that because you're putting in that effort you have more privacy
19:56:11 <strcat[m]> but it's totally wrong / backwards
19:56:53 <alzxjm[m]1> strcat: Fascinating explanation. Thanks for that response. I'm no longer sorry I asked; more confusing than I expected. Stuff like that is why the matrix channel is so cool. Per the advice of cn3m I uninstalled all those extensions a few days ago.
19:57:23 <strcat[m]> privacy is obtained through proper scoping of state (or avoiding state), anti-fingerprinting and using a VPN/Tor so that you can't simply be tracked based on your IP
19:57:40 <strcat[m]> and that stuff cannot be done via extensions
20:18:47 <defconanon12[m]> Alright Signal works just had to enable a setting. Has anyone got it to work while in airplane mode with WiFi on or is that restricting the Signal app too much?
20:23:29 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: yes Signal works for me on with WiFi on and Airplane mode On.
20:29:13 <wreck[m]> does anyone here use graphene in an enterprise work environment? my company uses o365 and slack, and zoom, which are obviously all tied to google cloud services for push notifications and apps in the play store... is the solution simply "don't use those services" or are there known workarounds that people do by using sandboxed webapps and stuff?
20:29:52 <wreck[m]> how much of my life would be relegated to doing work on my computer instead of my phone, basically
20:31:40 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger: It doesn't for me at all.
20:33:15 <TheJollyRoger> defconanon12[m]: Huh, very strange! When I toggle on Airplane Mode I have to switch WiFi back on afterward but it works after I do.
20:33:55 <TheJollyRoger> wreck[m]: You're in luck, Zoom app as of last month would actually run on GrapheneOS! I haven't used it since though.
20:34:07 <TheJollyRoger> I can't vouch for the others though.
20:34:12 <jknsec[m]> defconanon12 Works for me little to no issue as long as WiFi is on.
20:35:03 <cn3m[m]> Strcat is a saint at explaining things
20:35:24 <jknsec[m]> The apk version runs fine in airplane mode so I'm not sure what the problem is.
20:36:43 <defconanon12[m]> Could it be a Graphene problem? I am running the latest beta release.
20:38:46 <TheJollyRoger> I honestly don't know. I have extremely potato-tier WiFi because my router isn't all that great, but it works.
20:39:43 <jknsec[m]> My only problem with GrapheneOS is that my banking app doesn't work because they're a shit bank and their website keeps me in an infinite loop to force me to use their app, and I can't really use Tor on mobile because Tor Browser security and the fact that Orbit has been "incompatible" for the past month.
20:40:13 <jknsec[m]> Then again I usually only use For through Tails/Whonix anyway
20:40:23 <strcat> I don't know what you mean by incompatible
20:40:27 <jknsec[m]> *Tor
20:40:33 <nickcalyx[m]> jknsec just use the previous version of orbot
20:40:46 <jknsec[m]> I tried and it never worked
20:41:14 <jknsec[m]> Previous repos never successfully downloaded
20:41:40 <jknsec[m]> And wouldn't let me install if they did throwing me the same error
20:41:49 <jknsec[m]> Fucking F-Droid
20:42:34 <alzxjm[m]1> <cn3m[m] "Strcat is a saint at explaining "> I feel bad distracting him from more important things but that cookies explanation was very enlightening.
20:44:31 <jknsec[m]> Plus I have stuff like Newpipe which doesn't work over Tor. And for Orbot to be effective you pretty much need to have everything be over Tor, right?
20:44:58 <jknsec[m]> Plus Vanadium over Tor is highly fingerprintable
20:46:17 <defconanon12[m]> If you already have a desktop setup unless you have the mobile OPSEC down pat I wouldn't worry about browsing Tor on a phone. Imo. I also find it less secure myself compared to on desktop.
20:47:22 <jknsec[m]> Mostly worried about non-browsing activity such as app activity
20:47:59 <jknsec[m]> For the most part I just stick with desktop, yeah.
20:48:36 <nickcalyx[m]> > Plus I have stuff like Newpipe which doesn't work over Tor. And for Orbot to be effective you pretty much need to have everything be over Tor, right?
20:48:36 <nickcalyx[m]> No? You can pick and choose as you like
20:49:05 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to desktop security model, I'm not sure what metrics that's by; the desktop has a largely perimeter-based security model and assumes that any code the user executes in their account is trusted with full access to all processes and files within that account.
20:50:06 <madaidan[m]> The desktop security model is non-existent.
20:50:12 <dazinism> Theres a fair bit to consider with tor on mobile.
20:50:27 <TheJollyRoger> The Android security model assumes that each app needs to be kept within its own space, both in terms of memory/process space, and its own storage space, in order to mitigate exploits, distrust or at the very least compartmentalize the source of the application, and ensure that should that process turn out to be bad, it can't simply invade the others.
20:50:46 <dazinism> The Guardian Project folks advice is not to send everything over tor
20:51:09 <TheJollyRoger> Well that's the golden rule of "Don't mix the modes of anonymity."
20:52:04 <jknsec[m]> I mean all these thing were once used over clearnet so I should not use them over Tor at all, really.
20:52:48 <dazinism> Think its probably always a good idea to select 'isolate destination address' in orbot settings
20:56:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): I have a question. How do Safari and Vanadium measure up against each other in security and in privacy? And will this change significantly as Vanadium is further developed?
21:00:16 <dazinism> The orbot builds on github use the same signatures as those from the Guardian Project Fdroid repo
21:00:22 <dazinism> Can update to them
21:00:25 <dazinism> https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/releases
21:00:54 <dazinism> Think it was the universal one I use,  and  that works
21:02:21 <dazinism> Think something messed up with their Fdroid repo with the last update. Can't remember the exact details.
21:02:42 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: has been discussed extensively before
21:04:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> Oh, sorry. Is it posted somewhere or is it just in the scrollback?
21:08:03 <strcat[m]> it's a topic that has been discussed regularly here, the subreddit and elsewhere
21:09:14 <soliquid> This channel is logged. See channel description, you can search there
21:09:24 <strcat[m]> it is only recently logged
21:31:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> I think I have a goof picture of the privacy situation, which looks pretty good for Safari, but I don't really know where security stands.
21:33:43 <jcpicard32[m]> My understanding is that for anonymity Tor>Safari>Vanadium (due to much few pixel users than iPhone) and for security Vanadium>Safari>Tor but if someone knows better go with what they say.
21:35:14 <strcat[m]> that's based on the false premise that the Tor browser can hide the hardware
21:35:16 <strcat[m]> it can't with JavaScript enabled
21:40:08 <cyborgninjaneer[> Tor is probably most useful on an iPhone.
21:41:08 <interceptingfist> Is safari really that good on privacy?
21:41:19 <interceptingfist> I always use  ddg
21:41:34 <interceptingfist> And vanadium on my gaphene phone
21:47:18 <cyborgninjaneer[> Safari runs on highly homogeneous hardware and has built in tracking protection.
21:47:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's good because it foils common tracking methods without increasing your fingerprint.
21:49:27 <jcpicard32[m]> strcat: Good to know. Thank you for the correction
21:54:24 <cn3m[m]> Safari is the least identifiable to web servers and Tor is the least identifiable to global network adversaries. A little different. Vanadium is going for the Safari route right now, but GrapheneOS does a few different performance metrics that can make it stand out from Pixels running Chrome
21:54:30 <cn3m[m]> There's likely to never be a perfect solution
22:01:14 <cn3m[m]> It's also worth noting Pixels have 1/50th the market share of iPhones in the US so it's a little harder to blend in with Pixels and Chrome in general
22:01:17 <cn3m[m]> This is all rather moot as fingerprinting is too slow and not practical if you are trying to make money with a site. It's a good conversation to have, but fingerprinting isn't a real world threat at this point
22:10:59 <cn3m[m]> It's also worth noting that Vanadium offers a little better security than Safari which in turn completely dominates Tor Browser in security. Vanadium has a reasonable approach to fingerprinting(not as robust as the other options), but it has excellent security. All things considered it's likely to be better at protecting your data
22:12:01 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium is very carefully designed to suit the needs, realities, and threat models of GrapheneOS
22:18:42 <r4pr0n> what does the "experimental" for pixel 4 mean? is it possible that it might just brick or are there just some things that may be inconvenient (some gui bugs or similar)
22:27:10 <strcat> it means it's experimental and not intended for production usage
22:27:46 <strcat> it doesn't mean something as specific as what you seem to think
22:28:02 <strcat> it is experimental in general, not in a specific way
22:29:48 <r4pr0n> what I mean is if it is like beta-grade software or just indented for developing-purposes
22:30:14 <r4pr0n> because well I'm not sure if you would call using it on your private phone "production usage"
22:33:15 <strcat> you can decide yourself if you want to use something marked experimental
22:33:21 <strcat> it doesn't mean something as specific as you want
22:34:04 <jknsec[m]> Can't wait for GrapheneOS core apps like an improved camera and gallery once we get some app devs and maintainers so we don't have to download weird third-party apps and thus increase the attack surface.
22:35:15 <jknsec[m]> r4pr0n It's pretty much exactly what it says. It's experimental. It's an experiment. Probably has bugs. Use at your own risk.
22:36:38 <r4pr0n> how does downloading a third party camera app increase attack surface?
22:49:33 <jknsec[m]> r4pr0n Think of it this way. Ideally you want the user to have as little responsibility over managing and maintaining their own system as possible, especially when it comes to core functionality. A user is theoretically far more likely to introduce or be vulnerable to malicious exploits (even if the general nature of the OS negates most threats) when installing third-party apps in general, and as such it would be better
22:49:33 <jknsec[m]> for apps pertaining to core functionality to ship with the OS versus just being there to insure system functionality.
22:50:43 <jknsec[m]> I didn't explain it well but in general the less apps the better
22:51:02 <wreck[m]> <runnit27[m] "If one was to use grapheneOS as "> i strongly question the user-friendliness of this particular type of app. i would bet the best way to get a ride somewhere would be to call a cab using the phone.
22:51:23 <wreck[m]> ride-share apps are inherently third-party companies that you're sharing your location data and travel information with
22:51:38 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <r4pr0n "how does downloading a third par"> Any additional code installed and able to be activated on your device = attack surface
22:51:48 <jknsec[m]> ^
22:52:01 <jknsec[m]> What I said but concise
22:52:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Third-party stuff that you haven't/nobody has audited can exfiltrate data, and send it out, or tag-team with other apps to do so
22:52:56 <r4pr0n> well if you can exploit the camera app on grapheneos, then something in the os is flawed since that shouldn't be possible, and then there might as well be the as much of a security vulnerability in the grapheneos provided camera app as in the third-party one
22:53:14 <jknsec[m]> Hence why GrapheneOS ships with a PDF viewer and browser as those are relevant to the threat model and are very easily exploited.
22:55:02 <r4pr0n> well I guess I don't really agree in general with the whole grapheneos security concept, disallow the user root access because he could do something stupid reminds me more of the apple style "the user is too dumb to do anything" attitude
22:55:26 <r4pr0n> e.g. root can have security advantages, like you can enable auto updates in fdroid to get security patches faster
22:58:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: more like root solutions just can't get their shit straight
22:58:34 <jknsec[m]> The reason why root access is disabled is because a user with root access is able to do a lot more damage that one that is not. People are very much liable to make mistakes and as such for a device to be secure you want the user to be responsible for handling as little as possible. It's much harder for an adversary to exploit an OS itself then  it is for them to exploit the user using/administrating the OS.
22:59:53 <jknsec[m]> Why pay for a remote code exploit when you can achieve the same goal via phishing email or malicious browser extension.
23:00:21 <r4pr0n> well I don't argue for giving root access to arbitary apps
23:00:34 <r4pr0n> if you could at least give do some root stuff via adb I'd be happy
23:01:10 <r4pr0n> anupritaisno1[m]: i actually never has any problem whatsoever with root access on my phone
23:01:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: just because you didn't have a problem didn't mean problems don't exist
23:01:56 <cn3m[m]> <r4pr0n "e.g. root can have security adva"> No this is always false
23:02:03 <schnenhcs[m]> <jknsec[m] "The reason why root access is di"> Thats what I never got.
23:02:07 <r4pr0n> jknsec[m]: but the attitude of saying you can't trust the user of the device to have actual power over it is the one that created all those ios walled gardens and such
23:02:29 <cn3m[m]> Root never helps security and shorts hurts
23:02:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> SuperSU is long dead and nobody wants to do a fraction of the work to get it right
23:02:51 <cn3m[m]> <r4pr0n "jknsec: but the attitude of sayi"> Walled gardens are much better for privacy and security
23:02:54 <r4pr0n> cn3m[m]: yeah good argument, your point is wrong because it can't be right
23:03:20 <jknsec[m]> Changing things on the OS level is not recommended simply because everything is preconfigured to be at it's most secure. Changing settings yourself is a horrible idea because it could potentially completely ruin the security of your device.
23:03:39 <r4pr0n> no it's not
23:03:47 <r4pr0n> just take the example I already told you
23:03:49 <r4pr0n> fdroid auto updates
23:04:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Magisk uses ridiculously stupid ways to debug the system just to pass safetynet which we can't allow on grapheneos since the same calls have had proven exploits in the pastr4pr0n
23:04:12 <schnenhcs[m]> For example Graphene is incomplete. I cant turn of Camera sounds.
23:04:12 <schnenhcs[m]> In Lineage releases not providing the option I just deleted the soundfiles for it. Quick fix, efficient, real world use. I only escalated the included Terminal App.
23:04:28 <Kurai> r4pr0n That’s a terrible example to be honest
23:04:33 <r4pr0n> anupritaisno1[m]: well that's not magisk's fault imo but google's for creating that stupid safetynet
23:04:39 <r4pr0n> Kurai: why's that?
23:04:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: you're just stupid aren't you?
23:05:01 <schnenhcs[m]> Removing Camera sound has sometimes a very big impact on my real world security.
23:05:25 <r4pr0n> anupritaisno1[m]: yeah just start insulting, good job arguing there 👏
23:05:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Magisk uses non standard system calls and behaves like xposed and obviously google is at faultr4pr0n
23:05:53 <r4pr0n> schnenhcs[m]: not sure if you are serious, but if not this the most strawmany argument I have ever heard
23:06:03 <schnenhcs[m]> Recording power abuse secretly saved my ass a bunch of times.
23:06:04 <j3ghprjfo[m]> If you want root build from source and include magisk. You won't get root from grapheneos
23:06:13 <r4pr0n> anupritaisno1[m]: google is at fault that magisk has to do that to work around their safetynet
23:06:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not to add magisk causes undefined behavior and breaks systems
23:06:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: no
23:06:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a way to do this without the dangerous call
23:06:48 <Kurai> updates are already delayed on fdroid and being able to auto install apps doesn’t help, it’s just easier for the end user
23:07:00 <r4pr0n> no there is not
23:07:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> But out of laziness this method isn't used by magisk
23:07:09 <r4pr0n> because you should be able to have administrative powers over a device you own
23:07:10 <schnenhcs[m]> The thing is that IT Security is not an end in itself.
23:07:12 <r4pr0n> it's as simple as that
23:07:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes there is
23:07:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Magisk can literally read the syslog
23:07:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Implement a parser for the syslog
23:07:43 <jknsec[m]> r4pr0n People usually get rude/short during these kinds of arguments because they deal with these kinds of thing constantly and no longer have the energy to explain the same concept over and over to someone who will not change their mind is infuriating.
23:07:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> You avoid the ptrace call altogether
23:07:52 <r4pr0n> Kurai: delaying the updates is a tradeoff that also helps security by ensuring the integrity of source to binary, if they had more resources it would be faster
23:07:55 <strcat> r4pr0n: app-accessible / persistent root access is a serious security problem without the user ever doing it or doing something 'stupid'
23:08:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also magisk breaks systems with it's absolutely shitty module implementation
23:08:25 <schnenhcs[m]> Magisk provided real value too in enabling Xprivacy. Which essentially made it possible to use Apps that are forced on you by normies in a way that is less privacy invasive.
23:08:36 <strcat> r4pr0n: verified boot is totally useless aside from strengthening factory reset if the OS has app-accessible/persistent root access
23:08:45 <strcat> and it totally screws up the security model and adds massive attack surface
23:08:48 <r4pr0n> jknsec[m]: well I'm sorry but you don't have to argue with me, then just let it be if you are that frustrated about it, but starting insulting is not the way to go then
23:08:57 <strcat> you really show that you have very little knowledge about security when you say stuff like that
23:08:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since /data is mounted last magisk must kill almost your entire system, load modules and then restart all services
23:09:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> It never does this properly
23:09:07 <schnenhcs[m]> Sure its not perfect and weakens security apparently. But its a huge tradeoff.
23:09:08 <r4pr0n> anupritaisno1[m]: I don't say that magisk is perfectly good whatsoever
23:09:13 <strcat> usually only a tiny amount of userspace has root access and the UI / application layer is not trusted
23:09:17 <strcat> and persistent state is not trusted
23:09:23 <strcat> init, vold
23:09:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: neither is phh
23:09:43 <strcat> r4pr0n: you have administrative control over the device, you can flash another OS
23:09:48 <strcat> if you don't like having a secure / hardened one
23:09:50 <strcat> why are you even here?
23:09:54 <strcat> just trolling?
23:09:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lineagesu has known vulnerabilities and they dropped it on Q for good
23:10:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nah
23:10:24 <jknsec[m]> where are the privacy sliders, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?
23:10:33 <schnenhcs[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: What are you currently working on?
23:10:39 <r4pr0n> strcat: well that's not my point, just because I want to be able to have root privileges, doesn't mean I don't want to have the security provided by grapheneos
23:10:47 <strcat[m]> why
23:10:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> These are people who think they can share opinion and improve things without even knowing the subject they're opinionated about
23:10:55 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: you can't have both, doesn't make sense
23:10:57 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: read what I wrote
23:11:04 <r4pr0n> yes you can?
23:11:08 <strcat[m]> here's a suggestion: when you don't know much about a topic, you should listen, not talk
23:11:14 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: read what I wrote
23:11:31 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: you can't have meaningful verified boot if you have app-accessible/persistent root access - that's stating the obvious
23:11:31 <r4pr0n> I did
23:11:42 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: if the OS trusts the application / UI layer
23:11:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just an FYI on my Linux box about 5 processes run as root r4pr0n
23:11:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Compare that to the typical rooted custom ROM running 80+ processes at root
23:11:49 <strcat[m]> that's a massive increase in root / system attack surface
23:11:54 <r4pr0n> well you are not secured for the things you do as root, you have to be careful then
23:12:01 <r4pr0n> I never said you should give root to the ui layer
23:12:05 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: no that is not what it means
23:12:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> You only need root to update your system on Linux
23:12:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise you do not need it
23:12:19 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: if it's possible to grant root access via the UI layer
23:12:20 <schnenhcs[m]> Hmm what would be a good way to enable safe but reasonably fast changes while not violating the image based system + verification idea?
23:12:27 <jknsec[m]> r4pr0n Why do you think the desktop secure model is so absolutely fucked?
23:12:27 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: that means the UI layer is trusted with root access
23:12:34 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: do you not see what you're saying?
23:12:50 <strcat[m]> how can you trust the UI / application layer and persistent state with root access while not massively expanding the attack surface
23:12:52 <strcat[m]> it obviously does thzat
23:12:53 <r4pr0n> anupritaisno1[m]: yes, I do, that's an oversimplification, there are a lot of things that you need root for
23:12:58 <strcat[m]>  * it obviously does that
23:13:08 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: like what
23:13:09 <jknsec[m]> "Need"
23:13:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: no you don't
23:13:25 <r4pr0n> strcat[m]: I didn't say you should do it that way either
23:13:25 <strcat[m]> developers can implement features properly instead of via lazy hacks
23:13:30 <strcat[m]> and they can stop lying to users about what's required
23:13:32 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "r4pr0n: like what"> like making your security model worse
23:13:44 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n:  okay well persistent / app-accessible root access is not possible within the security model
23:13:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> This ^
23:14:07 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: you cannot have the security of GrapheneOS with that - fundamentally not possible, and it's really obvious why
23:14:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "and they can stop lying to users"> Thanks BTW
23:14:21 <strcat[m]> persistent state needs to be trusted LESS not MORE
23:14:28 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS works on IMPROVING security not REDUCING it
23:14:36 <strcat[m]> we work on IMPROVING verified boot by REDUCING trust in persistent state
23:14:38 <r4pr0n> are you intentionally misunderstanding me?
23:14:46 <strcat[m]> we work on IMPROVING the OS security model by REDUCING TRUST in components
23:14:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: we don't need root
23:15:13 <strcat[m]> if you want app-accessible / persistent root access
23:15:16 <strcat[m]> you don't want the security of GrapheneOS
23:15:20 <r4pr0n> there are problems like fdroid auto updates for which you need root access to grant; I never said you should have or give root access in/via the ui/application layer
23:15:27 <strcat[m]> if you want root in adb shell, you want a less secure userdebug build, not a production build
23:15:33 <strcat[m]> the only use I can think of for it is development
23:15:42 <r4pr0n> yeah
23:15:44 <r4pr0n> then
23:15:45 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: F-Droid doesn't ever use / need root access
23:15:55 <r4pr0n> how do you do fdroid auto updates in stock grapheneos
23:15:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: again fdroid does prompt you to update manually
23:15:58 <r4pr0n> tell me
23:15:59 <strcat[m]> it NEVER uses root access for anything, the privileged extension is NOT root access
23:16:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: build it yourself
23:16:13 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: you don't because we don't include the privileged extension because F-Droid is insecure / buggy
23:16:15 <r4pr0n> you need root access to activate it?
23:16:18 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: but that has nothing to do with root access
23:16:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> With the privileged extension
23:16:25 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: nope root access has nothing to do with the F-Droid privext
23:16:42 <r4pr0n> well yes, you can rebuild grapheneos and then install fdroid in that
23:16:43 <strcat[m]> privext does not have or use root access
23:16:45 <r4pr0n> but then you lose all ota
23:16:54 <cn3m[m]> <r4pr0n "there are problems like fdroid a"> Apple iOS has a secure store with no need for root. It's doable on secure operating systems
23:16:57 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: again, privext does not use or involve root access
23:17:00 <r4pr0n> if you want to add it in runtime you need root
23:17:04 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: no
23:17:07 <strcat[m]> you cannot
23:17:09 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: one more time
23:17:12 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: privext does not use or involve root access
23:17:39 <r4pr0n> so how did I install the extension on my magisk rooted phone without recompiling the os then?
23:17:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> <r4pr0n "if you want to add it in runtime"> Keep dreaming
23:17:42 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: root access does not let you persistently modify the OS either
23:17:52 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS doesn't have any root and it has priv ext built in
23:18:06 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: if you had magisk
23:18:12 <strcat[m]> your OS would be magisk + some bits of GrapheneOS
23:18:13 <strcat[m]> not GrapheneOS
23:18:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: again magisk is NEVER going to come in a secure by design ROM
23:18:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is because it triggers undefined behavior
23:18:32 <r4pr0n> no I have graphene on one device and had magisk on another
23:18:38 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: you fundamentally cannot have magisk with grapheneos because that would mean replacing the CORE of the operating system with something insecure
23:18:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's basically impossible to be secure when your system has undefined behavior
23:18:52 <r4pr0n> anupritaisno1[m]: again I don't argue for magisk, it's just an example for a root
23:18:59 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: yeah well again privext does not use / involve root access and you can't use root access to modify the OS
23:19:08 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: nope it's just you not understanding the topic
23:19:10 * schnenhcs[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/yVDqqBFkqsIrCLDHEdYZLsNi >
23:19:18 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS has lower security standards than GrapheneOS so including the priv ext makes a lot of sense. Again iOS does the same thing. Stock Pixels have privileged Play Store. None of these have root
23:19:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not to mention flag 4000
23:19:40 <cn3m[m]> 3 examples of secure OSes with app auto updates
23:19:43 <cn3m[m]> No root needed
23:19:44 <strcat[m]> cn3m: if F-Droid wasn't buggy with a lot of security issues and low priority for security
23:19:51 <schnenhcs[m]> The xda community gives a lot of workarounds and features but the release security practices are utter shit.
23:19:56 <strcat[m]> then we wouldn't mind including the privext with our own build of F-Droid (aside from licensing)
23:20:10 <strcat[m]> automatic app updates are good
23:20:17 <r4pr0n> it's not just about fdroid though
23:20:22 <r4pr0n> there are often small things
23:20:22 <strcat[m]> granting an insecure, buggy app with a ton of attack surface the ability to AUTOMATICALLY install apps in the background
23:20:24 <schnenhcs[m]> And people doing security right are occupied with that apparently.
23:20:24 <strcat[m]> is not a good idea
23:20:36 <r4pr0n> e.g. a few days ago, I wanted to have root to be able to read out my wifi passwords
23:20:37 <cn3m[m]> Exactly GrapheneOS needs its own store
23:20:38 <cn3m[m]> Much like iOS
23:20:40 <r4pr0n> but I couldn't
23:20:47 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: privext does not require/involve root - that's a fact
23:20:52 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: okay and that doesn't require root to support either
23:20:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "Exactly GrapheneOS needs its own"> No
23:20:54 <cn3m[m]> The CalyxOS solution is not good for this project
23:20:55 <strcat[m]> so another example of not needing root
23:20:58 <r4pr0n> I'm not talking about privext anymore
23:21:08 <cn3m[m]> <r4pr0n "e.g. a few days ago, I wanted to"> Use the new system for that
23:21:18 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: supporting showing wifi passwords also doesn't require root access
23:21:20 <cn3m[m]> That's a built in feature of Android now
23:21:35 <r4pr0n> it is?
23:21:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "Use the new system for that "> Android basically lets you see the password rootless now
23:21:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
23:21:46 <strcat[m]> either way implementing it
23:21:49 <strcat[m]> never required root access
23:21:50 <strcat[m]> makes no sense
23:21:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just hidden in the WiFi settings
23:22:06 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier
23:22:08 <r4pr0n> yeah because the config was only root readable strcat[m]
23:22:12 <r4pr0n> not sure how it is now
23:22:13 <strcat[m]> developers are often really lazy and take insecure shortcuts
23:22:16 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: nope that's untrue
23:22:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> r4pr0n: bullshit
23:22:31 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: it was never only root readable
23:22:31 <jknsec[m]> I mean GrapheneOS should ideally have it's own app store, yeah.
23:22:35 <cn3m[m]> Even if it wasn't there are some features you will lose since you use a non rooted device, but 99% of people live like that you'll be fine for vastly better security
23:22:36 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: never ever true
23:22:46 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: just stop making up BS about stuff you don't know about
23:22:52 <r4pr0n> yes it was
23:22:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> It was readable by wpa_supplicant
23:23:01 <r4pr0n> the wpa supplicant config was root readable
23:23:02 <strcat[m]> r4pr0n: no, it was never only readable by root
23:23:04 <strcat[m]> and look
23:23:07 <strcat[m]> that was your last chance
23:23:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> <r4pr0n "yes it was"> Never
23:23:18 <strcat> no more spreading FUD / misinforamtion here
23:23:22 <jknsec[m]> Lol
23:23:24 <strcat> if people want to repeatedly spread misinformation
23:23:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sure it was root readable
23:23:29 <strcat> they will be banned
23:23:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it was not root "only" readable
23:23:41 <schnenhcs[m]> Oh cool, where is the wifi pw readable?
23:23:41 <schnenhcs[m]> Didnt find it in settings.
23:23:41 <schnenhcs[m]> Btw I am in main graphene and the share wifi by qrcode only shows a black square.
23:23:41 <jknsec[m]> "Reason r4pr0n"
23:24:08 <strcat> I am not interesting in having clueless people make endless false claims
23:24:12 <strcat> interested*
23:24:14 <strcat> really
23:24:17 <strcat> it's so tiring
23:24:33 <strcat> people who have no clue what they're talking about should just stop trying to have a 'debate' where they just falsify facts
23:24:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: this is a common annoyance in my groups too
23:24:44 <jknsec[m]> "omg you're so rude"
23:24:45 <strcat> I don't know why people think they can engage in a debate by bullshitting endlessly
23:24:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like why the hell am I supposed to supoort magisk. Shouldn't it be the other way around?
23:25:41 <jknsec[m]> "Kicks people that disagree with him, what an asshole. I'm gonna write a Reddit post about in now."
23:25:47 <proof_jr> anupritaisno1: people see root as way to get new features, most don't know or don't think security aspect
23:26:46 <strcat> making up misinformation is not disagreement
23:26:53 <cn3m[m]> People don't understand this is a support room for GrapheneOS and discussing development. We talk about other things, but if it gets in the way that needs to pause
23:27:33 <strcat> I will just set +m and it can be like the subreddit where posting requires approval
23:27:58 <jknsec[m]> strcat Agree with you of course just being sardonic.
23:28:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys let's change the topic now
23:29:06 <jknsec[m]> But yeah it's a mostly a support channel not "endlessly argue with the developers over something completely nonsensical".
23:30:01 <strcat> I am not interested in 'arguing' with dishonest, ignorant people who make up their own facts repeatedly
23:30:13 <strcat> I am not sure why people now think that facts are something they get to make up to fit their own reality
23:31:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW there goes sleep schedule :D
23:31:32 <strcat> makes no sense at all to claim that the privileged extension or showing wifi passwords requires root
23:31:38 <strcat> just nonsense
23:32:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> @overheadscallop
23:32:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wanna come test that pr?

23:35:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> I also need to fix a couple of overlays for euicc
23:40:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: BTW what are your thoughts on serving OTAs over http?
23:40:34 <strcat[m]> why would you?
23:40:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Assume zero trust is present and the client verifies what it's downloaded
23:40:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: it's just temporary
23:41:01 <madaidan[m]> Defense in depth is important
23:41:03 <strcat[m]> just use https it's not hard
23:41:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Running the update server off 127.0.0.1
23:41:29 <strcat[m]> our update server is just a static web server
23:41:38 <strcat[m]> you could host them on github pages
23:41:42 <strcat[m]> or anything
23:41:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> No I'm just hosting a temp server locally to test
23:42:14 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the update system checks the signature and does downgrade protection
23:42:24 <strcat[m]> but it doesn't currently enforce the release channel via a signature
23:42:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay
23:42:37 <jiibus[m]> Is FAT32 the only filesystem that graphene can R+W to for a USB drive?
23:43:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> jiibus: yes
23:43:54 <strcat[m]> jiibus: until exFAT is supported some day
23:43:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> jiibus: what device btw
23:44:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is
23:44:15 <jiibus[m]> Bummer.
23:44:15 <jiibus[m]> anupritaisno1: 3a XL
23:44:34 <strcat[m]> exFAT will eventually be supported
23:44:35 <strcat[m]> it landed upstream
23:44:40 <jiibus[m]> Oh nice
23:44:46 <strcat[m]> on newer devices I mean
23:44:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nope not going to do much for that onejiibus
23:44:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry
23:45:07 <jiibus[m]> Ah, so pixels 4+ then?
23:45:38 <strcat> jiibus[m]: no, later
23:45:51 <jiibus[m]> Very well
23:45:54 <strcat> wouldn't even expect pixel 5 to have it
23:45:59 <strcat> would have to check which kernel version is next
23:46:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> jiibus: well there's a driver that does work
23:46:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's called sdfat

23:46:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> It works mostly well
23:46:43 <strcat> the linux 5.4 driver was experimental / low quality
23:46:47 <strcat> they replaced it in linux 5.7
23:46:50 <jiibus[m]> Oh I'm on 5.7 on my desktop. Good to know
23:47:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sdfat mostly acts as a drop-in replacement for vfat, exfat and fat
23:47:14 <strcat> https://www.kernel.org/
23:47:22 <strcat> the newest LTS is 5.4
23:47:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> jiibus: tell.you what
23:47:48 <jiibus[m]> hwhat?
23:47:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> When I'm free might just drop you a kernel with that one driver
23:48:00 <strcat[m]> > Linux 5.4 was released on 24 November 2019
23:48:10 <strcat[m]> so I'd guess there will be another LTS around the end of 2020
23:48:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not now though
23:48:23 <strcat[m]> so maybe the 2021 devices will have the new exFAT driver
23:48:29 <jiibus[m]> Oh rock on, much appreciated anupritaisno1:
23:48:38 <strcat[m]> maybe
23:48:44 <strcat[m]> also possible it won't be til 2022
23:49:03 <strcat[m]> and I have a feeling it's not a good idea to use the Linux 5.4 staging exFAT driver
23:49:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> jiibus: be aware that sdfat won't be in grapheneos
23:49:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's not backwards compatible with vfat at all
23:49:13 <jiibus[m]> I hadn't looked into android Linux kernel versions, didn't realize it was up to 5.4
23:49:27 <strcat[m]> jiibus: I'm talking about the upstream LTS versions
23:49:32 <jiibus[m]> Ah
23:49:34 <strcat[m]> android uses the upstream LTS kernel branches
23:49:47 <strcat[m]> when a new SoC platform is developed they use the newest LTS branch
23:49:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> And if you don't patch the fstab it throws a couple warnings at boot. Mostly harmless
23:50:04 <strcat[m]> unless it was just released and isn't that stable yet
23:50:11 <strcat[m]> there is an LTS branch every year
23:50:45 <strcat[m]> SoC platform drivers probably take a year to develop
23:59:52 <jiibus[m]> So with FAT32 having a file limit of 4GB, is it possible that the seed vault backup size could exceed that?
