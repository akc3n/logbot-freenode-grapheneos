00:05:05 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
00:12:34 <qyo3462572445[m]> <dazinism "qyo3462572445: Theres this page "> Thank you.  I'll take a look.
00:24:38 <renlord> cdesai: the fix you linked still does not work
00:24:42 <renlord> getting URL not found
00:24:58 <renlord> and i think the cookie file does not even get changed despite ToS being accepted
00:25:16 <renlord> diffing the backup and the supposedly 'sed-ed' copy returns 0
00:25:51 <renlord> just wanna confirm if its the same for other people or my copies are broken
00:26:34 <JTL> > fix issue with new acknowledge prompt on google images page
00:26:37 <JTL> yay google serverside changes /s
00:28:06 <renlord> ya i applied those fixes, no difference
00:28:16 <renlord> they must be cracking down hard
00:28:18 <renlord> lol
00:30:21 <renlord> oh whoops
00:30:29 <renlord> the patch does work
00:30:36 <renlord> coppied the ota string twice
01:17:50 <renlord> strcat: there's actually a good number of other libraries that are required to build grapheneos
01:17:55 <renlord> that arent included in the prebuilt
01:18:17 <renlord> and also not sure if its something we want to do, its to refactor android-prepare-vendor to use bsdtar as oppose to unzip
01:18:19 <renlord> and zip
01:19:33 <renlord> why does building require ncurses5 baffles me
01:19:43 <renlord> i dont even see it used anywhere.
01:20:28 <renlord> i'll just build with a container
01:36:02 <strcat[m]> renlord: I know a bunch of other libs are needed
01:36:11 <strcat[m]> renlord: ncurses is needed by clang
01:38:47 <strcat[m]> renlord: I forget what exactly needs ncurses5
01:41:02 <renlord> apparently can do this -- LLVM_ENABLE_TERMINFO=OFF
01:41:04 <renlord> to disable that requirement
01:42:00 <renlord> but gotta rebuild the clang prebuilt
01:42:03 <renlord> meh, so much effort
01:42:20 <renlord> i'll just stick everything inside a container
01:44:38 <strcat[m]> renlord: I'm testing it atm
01:44:51 <strcat[m]> maybe ncurses5 isn't required now that gcc is avoided
01:44:54 <strcat[m]> it might be gcc that uses it
01:44:57 <strcat[m]> let me figure it out
01:45:04 <renlord> clang is the one that uses it
01:45:16 <renlord> based off this
01:45:18 <renlord> https://github.com/android/ndk/issues/574
01:48:35 <strcat[m]> renlord: clang doesn't seem linked against it anymore
01:48:41 <strcat[m]> I think the issue was GCC which may no longer be an issue
01:48:44 <strcat[m]> I'll test
01:48:52 <strcat[m]> cause I avoided GCC fully for the kernel
03:15:29 <strcat[m]> renlord: yeah still needed
03:15:30 <strcat[m]> prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86/clang-3289846/bin/clang.real: error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
03:15:39 <strcat[m]> renlord: I guess they fixed for the NDK clang but not AOSP clang? dunno
03:16:15 <strcat[m]> I could fix it
03:20:28 <strcat[m]> renlord: ah
03:20:31 <strcat[m]> renlord: the main AOSP clang is fine
03:20:42 <strcat[m]> it's the renderscript clang that's using this
03:21:20 <strcat[m]> renlord: renderscript is using an older clang snapshot in prebuilts/clang
03:21:25 <strcat[m]> clang-3289846
03:21:38 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UpwTxywBsQNetJKRGCFWnfTq >
03:21:58 <strcat[m]> I could rebuild it
03:31:45 <strcat[m]> probably fixed by Android R
03:31:49 <strcat[m]> we should just wait
03:34:49 <renlord[m]> Replacing zip with bsdtar?
03:35:22 <renlord[m]> So sick of Pacman nagging Everytime I update.
03:36:40 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/jferris/dotfiles/blob/master/aliases.local
03:37:04 <aeonsolution[m]> some aliases i like for pacman :D
03:45:29 <aeonsolution[m]> my favorite part is when im checking packages is the useless reinstall prompt; net size upgrade: 0 Y/n
03:47:39 <M1eyejack[m]> i believe someone talked about Genode - Sculpt OS here, What's the difference with this and Qubes? I currently run Arch i was contemplating moving to Qubes because of how great GrapheneOS is. Any help on what to move to would be much appreciated
03:54:45 <joshman[m]> There's more downsides to that. I am staying on Arch
03:56:01 <joshman[m]> One thing Qubes is better than others is sandboxing VMs. The rest is just good ol Linux crapKernel
03:56:19 <aeonsolution[m]> You'd have to learn how to use Debian, Fedora, and Whonix
03:56:52 <aeonsolution[m]> you can also spin up a Windows vm
03:57:17 <aeonsolution[m]> Qubes is super cool, its takes a lot of getting used too
03:57:39 <M1eyejack[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "You'd have to learn how to use D"> ls there much to learn in Debian & Fedora coming from Arch? i though Arch is more harder to set up then those
03:58:26 <joshman[m]> Nothing hard to learn about buggy Debian. The question is why?
03:58:29 <M1eyejack[m]> Specially when you are using Intel and nvidia
03:58:32 <aeonsolution[m]> Debian and Fedora are two different families of linux
03:58:53 <aeonsolution[m]> so the package managers, setting up things to be identical
03:58:57 <aeonsolution[m]> isnt always possible
03:59:04 <M1eyejack[m]> yeah but i though the only thing that changes was the commands to instal Ppkg
03:59:06 <joshman[m]> Forget Nvidia in Qubes you have no GPU
03:59:13 <M1eyejack[m]> the rest is bash or fish zsh
03:59:38 <M1eyejack[m]> i have both intel and nvidia graphics
04:00:12 <M1eyejack[m]> Lenovo p52
04:00:21 <TheJollyRoger> I was actually quite surprised to find that back when I first started out on Qubes, I had an NVIDIA 770+ card, and it was supported out of the box. All four monitors ran. Of course, there was no 3D acceleration and I think this is by design to avoid GPU passthrough and the attack surface of that.
04:00:24 <M1eyejack[m]>  * the rest is bash or fish or zsh
04:00:40 <M1eyejack[m]>  * yeah but i thought the only thing that changes was the commands to install pkg
04:00:53 <TheJollyRoger> I think someone I met on the internet was able to get GPU passthrough to work, but didn't recommend it because of that.
04:02:05 <M1eyejack[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I was actually quite surprised t"> wow thats good to know, and really why the need for 3D in qubes
04:03:06 <joshman[m]> Why need for Qubes in the first place? It is no panacea
04:03:06 <M1eyejack[m]> > <@aeonsolution:matrix.org> You'd have to learn how to use Debian, Fedora, and Whonix
04:03:06 <M1eyejack[m]>  * ls there much to learn in Debian & Fedora coming from Arch? i thought Arch is more harder to set up then those
04:04:03 <joshman[m]> Run tails of a USB. Same Debian, same holes
04:04:44 <TheJollyRoger> Oh no not really. Just to update Fedora it's "dnf update && dnf upgrade" and on Debian the analogue is "apt update && apt upgrade" and that's it. Debian and Fedora really are far down the "baby-proof everything for user convenience" path.
04:04:44 <M1eyejack[m]> i'm more interested in Sculpt OS though. but i only just learnt about it. so wanted to see why its  recommend over Qubes
04:05:10 <TheJollyRoger> I unfortunately know nothing about SculptOS, sadly.
04:06:21 <M1eyejack[m]> yeah Arch took me a few weeks to setup but what a learning curve it was. now i have amazing looking bspwm arch that runs both graphic cards, and sometimes i can even play games on it ;)
04:06:35 <TheJollyRoger> Nicely done!
04:07:40 <M1eyejack[m]> but recently switching to GrapheneOS made me really want to care more about Security and privacy. As someone stated linux is not all that. I was even surprised to find out bsd is not that secure :(
04:08:18 <M1eyejack[m]> so now im at this cross roads
04:08:26 <M1eyejack[m]> what is secure and what is not
04:08:38 <TheJollyRoger> Well... to be perfectly honest, right now I think everyone kinda is!
04:09:01 <M1eyejack[m]> windows with its patch tuesday because they can never get anything correct with updates lol
04:09:15 <M1eyejack[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Well... to be perfectly honest, "> to true
04:09:21 <TheJollyRoger> Endpoint security never sort of really became a big deal until somewhat recently, all things considered.
04:10:04 <TheJollyRoger> Now suddenly, it's almost like we just got a "RING RING WAKEUP CALL!" and it only became obvious in hindsight.
04:10:48 <joshman[m]>  security is not only OSes problem. Hardware is vulnerable as well
04:11:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yep; concern over hardware security's only cropped up even more recently than endpoint security, even.
04:11:25 <joshman[m]> Modern OSed try hard to keep up with Android and iOS provided years ago
04:11:39 <M1eyejack[m]> yeah thats true, also i think with everyone moving to E2EE, and decentralize systems, self hosting, it more important then ever. wish there was some clarity with it
04:12:11 <TheJollyRoger> Well, heh... with respect to "self host and decentralize" I've actually got something of a fairly laconic view on it, although that's mostly political and I don't relish discussing that here unless asked.
04:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> I like to think about 2014 being the year of security in transit, 2015 being the year of end to end encryption, and 2017 as the year of hardware security entered public consciousness. Not sure what we'll see next moving forward.
04:14:37 <TheJollyRoger> *the year of hardware security entering
04:15:28 <M1eyejack[m]> 2021 the end of freedom lol
04:15:40 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows just thinking of that.
04:15:47 <zaxxa[m]> Lol
04:16:53 <M1eyejack[m]> im just happy humans created alcohol,
04:17:11 <TheJollyRoger> Me *hic* too Sh-shipmatesh!
04:18:01 <zaxxa[m]> Im interested to see arm on laptops
04:19:08 <renlord[m]> Pinebook is an arm laptop

05:04:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> How does the OTA updater work?
05:04:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> I mean where does it look for the link to the manifest?
05:05:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> *metadata

05:26:51 <izymandias[m]> TheJollyRoger: is it possible to harden the linux kurnel over time? or is it not something that can be fixed this late?
05:29:48 <TheJollyRoger> Hi izymandias[m], before I go on I should stress I am definitely not an expert on this, I can't program, can't read computer code (yet!) and only I've been able to investigate as far as what some figures in the security community have written down.
05:31:24 <TheJollyRoger> So, please understand this before I say that I think that based on what's going on right now that the situation isn't getting better.
05:31:54 <TheJollyRoger> The design of a Monolithic Kernel assumes that everything inside the kernel forms a part of the trusted codebase.
05:32:30 <TheJollyRoger> This means, simply put, that driver required to use your WiFi?
05:32:53 <TheJollyRoger> If there's a bug in it, or an exploit, that exploit is in the heart of your operating system itself, with ultimate privilege.
05:33:12 <TheJollyRoger> And it's probably contributed by a third-party vendor.
05:33:47 <TheJollyRoger> Increasingly, a lot of these contributions end up being like "Ok, we've opened our driver source code. It's your problem now."
05:34:52 <TheJollyRoger> That's what a Monolithic Kernel is. That's the philosophy of it: stuff in kernel space can (in some cases) be run faster.
06:14:27 <zaxxa[m]> What other kernel types are there?
06:19:25 <TheJollyRoger> Well, there's the concept of the Microkernel, with the idea being that the drivers might not be a part of the kernel itself. But the devil's in the details. What will ultimately decide the security of the kernel is going to be its design, and whether or not the kernel will be designed with distrusting the driver in mind. That's about as much as I know though.
06:20:44 <zaxxa[m]> I saw on wiki just now a useful picture:
06:20:44 <zaxxa[m]> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel#/media/File%3AOS-structure2.svg
06:23:39 <strcat[m]> the userspace equivalent to a monolithic kernel is putting every application and OS component into init, pid1
06:23:46 <strcat[m]> running as root, no address space isolation or anything
06:23:51 <strcat[m]> no privilege separation / sandboxing
06:23:55 <strcat[m]> that's how the Linux kernel is designed
06:24:04 <strcat[m]> rather than a 10-30k LOC core kernel it's 5 million LOC
06:24:12 * TheJollyRoger winces.
06:25:30 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. I just had a flashback to when I used to just use the default account since I didn't know any better.

14:26:54 <blacklight447[m]> That and the lack of firmware patches
14:27:30 <madaidan[m]> <blacklight447[m] "So we have no user debug builds "> Nope. It uses verified boot and ordinary user builds.

15:16:33 <dazinism> Kinda it just about does
15:18:20 <dazinism> Its broken, but IIUC user data encryption is tied to it, so if you suddenly cant decrypt your user data, it may be that someone has modified the operating system
15:18:53 <dazinism> Similar situation on the Fairphone 3
15:19:24 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/verified-boot
15:20:02 <madaidan[m]> I'm aware of OnePlus' broken verified boot. That's irrelevant to Glassrom.
15:20:22 <dazinism> > Similar situation on the Fairphone 3 (possibly)
15:20:53 <MadCamel> Speaking of user data.. What's a good method to backup? I used to use titanium backup + syncthing but without root on graphene I'm sort of lost. Apps can't access eachothers data right?
15:21:14 <Nikos[m]> @madaidan.:matrix.org:
15:21:14 <Nikos[m]> GlassROM! Never heard of it before! Will check if I can use it for my zl1!!

15:25:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hi madaidan called me here
15:25:37 <madaidan[m]> <dazinism "madaidan.: not completely irrele"> No.
15:25:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Glassrom is very easy to build

15:26:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pre-2015 devices are the absolute limit
15:26:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> If your device is older than that it can't run the ROM
15:27:10 <Nikos[m]> Even if it has LOS17.1 port?
15:27:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> If your device doesn't have at least android 8.0 on the stock ROM it can't run glassrom
15:27:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
15:27:32 <dazinism> MadCamel: look in settings > system > backup
15:27:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even if you have lineageos as official
15:27:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'll know why when it throws the build error
15:28:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pre-2015 devices have an extremely weak selinux policy and glassrom doesn't ignore this
15:28:34 <Nikos[m]> Ok, I have an zl1 that came with android 6 as stock and a s5neo that's even older so :(
15:28:41 <dazinism> Disappointing that it appears that pretty much no current phones, except Pixel have proper implementation of verified boot
15:28:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> It doesn't matter what the device came with
15:28:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> The device should be on 8.0 on the stock ROM as a minimum, now if that came through an update it's fine
15:28:56 <MadCamel> dazinism: nice, thanks
15:29:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> How do you build it exactly?
15:31:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well you sync lineageos down and run the glassrom patch script https://github.com/GlassROM/glassrom-landing/blob/master/patch-glassrom.bash
15:31:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> At least disable RROs in your boardconfig
15:31:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Build lineage but breakfast <device> user or directly clone down GrapheneOS' scripts and call them to build it after the breakfast command is done
15:31:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> And an obligatory warning
15:31:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like grapheneos, glassrom has only been tested on current generation devices
15:32:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just because it's easy to build doesn't mean stuff won't break
15:32:20 <MadCamel> Yikes. Seedvault seems to support backups but not restore. As in there's no real way to restore should the phone be lost and replaced with a new one.
15:32:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> It will and you will have to find and fix it yourself
15:33:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> However glassrom has been able to boot off a 2011 Sony device with very little effort in the past
15:33:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> So it's also a matter of luck
15:34:34 <BrokenCog> hello, when 'Generating release signing keys' is it normal for the "avbtool extract_public_key --key avb.pem --output avb_pkmd.bin
15:34:53 <BrokenCog> " step to produce an error: "../../external/avb/avbtool: Error getting public key: unable to load Public Key" ??
15:35:18 <Nikos[m]> Thanks for the info @anupritaisno1:m.apex.to
15:38:25 <dazinism> MadCamel: theres a setup wizard that handles restoring data to a new device
15:41:38 <dazinism> *implementation of verified boot that supports an alternative OS
15:44:16 <MadCamel> hmm ok. yeah I see it in seedvault's source code. It's just concerning that there's no UI I can find to restore. If it's built into the initial setup wizard then how can I install syncthing to get the backups onto the phone's storage for restore? Argh.
15:45:04 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: guess having Auditor app support GlassROM would help alleviate some of the OnePlus verified boot brokenness.
15:46:12 <dazinism> MadCamel: currently use usb storage, or Nextcloud
15:46:39 * MadCamel squirts milk out of nose at the mention of nextcloud in a security-related channel
15:46:51 <dazinism> Also less ideally could maybe shuffle it across with adb before the wizard runs
15:47:22 <MadCamel> yeah I'm playing with activitylauncher, maybe I can find another way into the UI
15:48:09 <MadCamel> yep, works. thanks for the pointers
16:02:32 <dazinism> MadCamel: backup data for an app is also restored automatically when you install the app. If the backup file is available to the device at that time.
16:22:30 <nickcalyx[m]> Madcamel you could probably get better answers in #seedvault
16:25:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> dazinism: I will leave that up to the maintainers to decide
16:25:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Personally I'm all for adding it on my builds
17:54:07 <TheJollyRoger> MadCamel: the easiest way to restore is to simply save your seedvault backups to a USB drive, and then plug that in when you first launch your new phone. That's how I got my settings and such back.
17:54:57 <TheJollyRoger> MadCamel: Seedvault backups have the data encrypted (and the APKs are signed, as always), so it shouldn't matter if you store them on your AWS Glacier.
17:55:41 <MadCamel> yep, but ehh. I still think there should be a way to access the restore UI post-setup.
17:59:38 <MadCamel> I made an issue on seedvault's github ( https://github.com/stevesoltys/seedvault/issues/85 )  and a contributor is saying it's up to the OEM(Graphene) to configure. It's not a huge deal though.
18:01:48 <MadCamel> My first instinct with any backup system is to validate the restore process so this threw me for a loop.
18:03:49 <TheJollyRoger> Oh I see.
18:03:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, pragmatic!
18:15:28 * yekip[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/oJDQqWtpTxYTRXBcEhGEOgqd >
18:44:17 <headgas[m]> Selling my pixel 4xl so I can get a 3xl and put graphene os on it. So if anyone devs want it to work on graphene os. I tried to use it after removing gapps and everything and I can't see contacts in messages it's just numbers and I have no idea how to fix that. It just tells me in contacts that other apps can see them. So im selling it cus I can't deal with that.
18:48:04 <nickcalyx[m]> I might be interested. Where are you
18:48:25 <nickcalyx[m]> Send me a private msg
18:54:05 <headgas[m]> Not sure how lol
18:54:26 <headgas[m]> Im in Cali
19:03:08 <jalb> Do you know if it's necessary to give internet access to Vanadium webview?, and if Bromite needs Bromite webview or it could use Vanadium webview too?
19:03:47 <jalb> Maybe it's only the browser needing internet access and not webview... IDN
19:10:56 <dazinism> jalb: bromite works fine and is independent of any webview. Bromite webview has to be added when the OS is built. It isnt added to GrapheneOS, as it uses Vanadium for webview.
19:11:32 <dazinism> *which use Vanadium
19:13:44 <dazinism> *which uses
19:17:56 <jalb> dazinism, thanks!, but does it need internet access or only the browser?
19:18:21 <jalb> I mean about vanadium webview
19:18:59 <jalb> I see that it only works well without internet access
19:22:10 <dazinism> anupritaisno1:  Auditor needs some work so that more devices can be added, if you got any spare time. Think this is the first bit that needs solving.
19:24:05 <dazinism> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/issues/64
19:25:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dazinism "anupritaisno1:  Auditor needs so"> I'd be more than happy to contribute
19:26:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw
19:26:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Is there a way that works with just an attestation server?
19:26:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> No 2 devices stuff
19:32:40 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: yeah, the auditor of your device can be another device running Auditor app or the attestation server.
19:34:17 <dazinism> Can set up to have the attestation server audit you and/or any android device that was launched with Oreo (or later)
19:34:28 <dazinism> Thats got auditor app
19:34:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well I can submit samples from a oneplus 7 pro
19:35:51 <dazinism> A device can have multiple auditor devices that it links with
19:36:28 <dazinism> *that it has set up to be able to audit it
19:37:58 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: think theres a backlog of device samples that need manually processing so that they can be added.
19:39:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> What about self hosting? Sounds like a plan
19:40:52 <JTL> That's doable
19:41:00 <JTL> (probably)
19:57:35 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: self hosting should be possible, you'd have to make a build of Auditor app with your own server details.
20:08:05 <dan-v[m]> anupritaisno1: it's a pretty giant hack at the moment, but i deploy my own custom auditor app and server. you could browse the build script to get a general idea how to do it: https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack/blob/10.0/templates/build_template.go#L356
20:08:19 <TheJollyRoger> dan-v[m]: wow!
20:09:04 <dan-v[m]> the server part is aws specific as it runs on elastic beanstalk, but you could swap that out easily.
20:09:21 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. Now I'm wondering if I could run it on Integricloud O_O.
20:09:49 <dan-v[m]> yeah you could run it anywhere really
20:10:24 <TheJollyRoger> "Yo dawg, I heard you liked remote attestation, so we put your remote attestation on a cloud service provider that supports remote attestation so you could have remote attestation for your remote attestation, dawg."
20:10:49 <dan-v[m]> haha
20:12:52 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. I just thought of something maybe I should look into doing, you reminded me of it with AWS.
20:26:19 <jalb> So, anyone knows about my question about vanadium webview and internet access?
20:26:30 <jalb> Thanks
20:26:50 <JTL> 13:10 <@TheJollyRoger> "Yo dawg, I heard you liked remote attestation, so we put your remote attestation on a cloud service provider that supports remote attestation so you could have remote attestation for your remote attestation, dawg."
20:26:52 <JTL> Love it
23:16:50 <BrokenCog> anyone every encountery repo sync giving errors:
23:17:10 <JTL> Which error?
23:17:22 <BrokenCog> lol, one sec ... copying:
23:17:23 <BrokenCog> platform/external/deqp-deps/SPIRV-Tools:
23:17:24 <BrokenCog> fatal: unable to access 'https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/deqp-deps/SPIRV-Tools/': Failed to connect to android.googlesource.com port 443: Connection refused
23:17:38 <BrokenCog> and, no, not just that project.  everything.
23:17:47 <BrokenCog> s/project/reop/
23:17:58 <JTL> I get it
23:18:10 <JTL> Checking now
23:20:18 <JTL> Not seeing issues here, must be a local network issue?
23:20:31 <BrokenCog> seperatley, on: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest/releases are the tag's for the repo init for release branches, but, what is the actual tag??  QQ2A.200501.001.B3.2020.05.05.02 for instance, the latest, is "no refs found"
23:20:51 <BrokenCog> I don't think it's a network issue:  I can create a new directory, repo init, and start a blank sync and it works fin.
23:20:56 <JTL> repo init https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest.git -b refs/tags/QQ2A.200405.005.2020.04.14.23
23:20:59 <JTL> Does this help at all?
23:21:13 <JTL> (that's an older tag, but you get the point)
23:21:24 <BrokenCog> agg I only used tags/... didn't put refs/tags ... thanks.
23:22:02 <JTL> > 16:17 <BrokenCog> fatal: unable to access 'https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/deqp-deps/SPIRV-Tools/': Failed to connect to android.googlesource.com port 443: Connection refused
23:22:04 <JTL> This lead me to believe it was a network issue, usually reinit and sync should fix you up. Pay attention to other errors though
23:23:13 <BrokenCog> I did a new init, and then sync.  I get the same connect refused.
23:23:20 <JTL> Strange
23:23:49 <JTL> does curl -v https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/deqp-deps/SPIRV-Tools/ work?
23:24:05 <JTL> Should get HTTP 200 and a bunch of HTML if it does
23:24:26 <JTL> Connection refused lead to me to believe it was a network issue
23:25:06 <BrokenCog> I get the HTTP page text using the curl.
23:25:16 <JTL> Hmm
23:25:21 <JTL> I'll look at it later if you don't find anything
23:25:37 <JTL> my repo sync is still going with no issues
23:26:30 <BrokenCog> I don't know what else to look at.  I'll start a new repo sync I guess.
23:28:41 <BrokenCog> and, just for additional info it doesn't seem to matter which tag.  previously I had sync'd to the development branch, 10.  I've tried the latest refs/tags/QQ... just now and get the same error.  in a clean directory on either breanch though it syncs.
23:29:00 <JTL> I'll see if I can find anything for you test in a bit
23:29:25 <BrokenCog> okay.
23:39:09 <JTL> BrokenCog: Just tried removing platform/external/deqp-deps/SPIRV-Tools from my local tree and recloning it, worked
23:39:11 <JTL> heh
23:50:40 <BrokenCog> it's not just that repo.  it's ALL repaos.
23:52:28 <BrokenCog> and, also, for me it's under "platform/external" not "external" ?
23:53:16 <BrokenCog> sorry ... it's NOT under platform/external.  It IS under external/...
