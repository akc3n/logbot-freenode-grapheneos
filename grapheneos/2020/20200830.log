00:58:55 <nickcalyx[m]> We could really use help documenting seedvault. I registered seedvault.app as the domain for a website
00:59:13 <nickcalyx[m]> I have designers to help with the site
00:59:36 <nickcalyx[m]> The main seedvault Dev would answer any questions
00:59:46 <nickcalyx[m]> Just throwing this out there
01:00:35 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> thx nick, im a complete noob
01:49:23 <aeonsolution[m]> helping out with documentation is good way to help out and get more comfortable with contributing more in other areas
02:09:59 <ohbeejay[m]> Hi all - I figured out the issue why I wasn't getting text messages from fellow android users on my graphene os phone device, but was able to send messages to them. I had to deregister my phone number from RCS chat - I was directed to https://messages.google.com/disable-chatâ€™ and followed the steps to deregister my device. Now I'm getting texts from everyone!
02:12:03 <bson989[m]> I will give this a try
02:13:01 <ohbeejay[m]> <bson989[m] "I will give this a try"> Cool was just about to tag or message you. Supposedly you can also do this on the "old phone's" messaging app to turn off chat features, which disables RCS.
02:13:04 <nickcalyx[m]> I once had that problem with.iPhones
02:13:35 <nickcalyx[m]> I switched to android but other iPhone users messages kept going to the old iphone
02:14:50 <blueuser[m]> hey sorry for offtopic but i registred my mom ipad with one of my phone number, will she receive imessages from iphone user if they try to send me a message??
02:15:38 <blueuser[m]> i saw that you are speaking about imessage
02:17:21 <bson989[m]> <ohbeejay[m] "Hi all - I figured out the issue"> FAR OUT! It worked. You're the man!
02:46:00 <Autopsy[m]> <ohbeejay[m] "Hi all - I figured out the issue"> Nice one. I did mention it earlier ;)
02:47:57 <Autopsy[m]> Glad you got it sorted though :)
04:21:15 <Guest73981> Hi. Bumble App isn't working. States it can't connect. Have tried both wifi and data and
04:21:49 <Guest73981> just want to know if app works with GOS
04:22:03 <strcat[m]> probably depends on Play services
04:22:07 <strcat[m]> doubt it will work
04:22:14 <Guest73981> okay
04:22:16 <strcat[m]> unfortunately many apps like that have hard dependencies on Play services
04:22:35 <Guest73981> thank you for yourvhelp/reply
04:22:42 <strcat[m]> some of them may work with a stub Play services that doesn't really implement Google services but we haven't implemented support for that yet
04:22:53 <strcat[m]> others actually depend on Google services and wouldn't work anyway
04:23:03 <strcat[m]> and push notifications wouldn't work if they do them via FCM
04:23:20 <strcat[m]> but it may be possible to get a lot of apps working with the plans to make a stub Play services without actual Google services
04:24:27 <Guest73981> FCM?
04:25:08 <Guest73981> that's okay, might try in browser. Thanks for the info

12:20:31 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Somehow offtopic, but I need help if should I give 100GB to home partition or... Can it be a separate ext4 for building GrapheneOS
12:20:36 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Installing Arch atm
12:23:02 <cn3m[m]> @d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix.org: most definitely on topic
12:23:03 <cn3m[m]> one sec
12:23:25 <cn3m[m]> check the AOSP setup
12:23:34 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Planning to do 12GB on /swap due to lack of RAM
12:24:06 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Problem is not sure if I'd just separate partition for security reasons
12:25:09 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> I am partly aware of Linux kernel and desktop OS issues
12:26:32 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Not sure if there should be any config restrictions on root too, but for now I'd opt for usual install in Arch
12:40:40 <jfbourdeau> Hello all. Most of my Apps, needing to use LOCATION/GPS are having problems.  I didn't have problem before but now do.  They are configured as allow location when used or ALWAYS allow...  ANy idea what could cause the location/GPS issue ?  Example, one of the App I use is TESLA, Summon ( to move my car) and now it can't see my location anymore, even if it was working before.... I don't know if it's one of the last updates that created that issue.  Any
12:40:40 <jfbourdeau> help or GUESS would be appreciated
12:47:06 <renlord> jfbourdeau: when you use location services, you need a clear line of sight to gps satelites for it to be effective
13:23:06 <Autopsy[m]> <renlord "jfbourdeau: when you use locatio"> Does GrapheneOS use a different GPS service to stock?
13:29:03 <jfbourdeau> tks renlord
13:32:36 <renlord> Autopsy[m]: grapheneos does not have a cellular location provider.
13:33:19 <renlord> stock uses both cellular location and gps to resolve your location
13:33:33 <renlord> via the Google Location Services API
13:41:23 <Autopsy[m]> Ta, was just wondering just in case!
14:36:43 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Can I DM anybody for installing Arch for GrapheneOS/Vanadium building?
14:37:20 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Currently installing linux-hardened
15:13:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> @d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix.org: message me
15:13:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> And don't install Linux hardened for building android
15:14:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> If anything it will slow your build down and break the build sandbox
15:14:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> And in some cases break the build
15:18:25 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Oh, will redo
15:18:55 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> It didn't install anyways for odd reason
15:19:34 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Messaged right now

17:50:32 <Vappy[m]> Does a modded version of gcam work on grapheneOS?
17:51:37 <theultron[m]> <Vappy[m] "Does a modded version of gcam wo"> It will work with this. https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
17:51:59 <theultron[m]> But why you need the modded app as Pixels already support the official app?
19:26:37 <frenchieisverige> <theultron[m] "But why you need the modded app "> Even under graphene OS? I thought it needs some g services
19:51:37 <Autopsy[m]> <Vappy[m] "Does a modded version of gcam wo"> Yes.
19:51:46 <Autopsy[m]> <theultron[m] "But why you need the modded app "> Because they add extra functionality.
20:03:02 <nickcalyx[m]> What extra?
20:26:28 <save2020[m]> nickcalyx: its a big difdrence in quality looks and options
20:26:28 <save2020[m]> * nickcalyx: its a big difference rence in quality looks and options
20:26:28 <save2020[m]> * nickcalyx: its a big difference in quality looks and options
20:48:33 <nickcalyx[m]> Ok
20:52:20 <jpds> The normal gcam app (no mod) works fine in GrapheneOS, assuming you install that gcam services provider
20:53:36 <jpds> Given it's closed-source, I'm not even sure how you'd mod it
21:56:15 <ace> Hey. What the most highend phone you managed to run grapheme
21:57:11 <ace> Hey. What the most highest end phone you managed to run graphene on?
21:59:09 <dmatrixs[m]> Only pixels supported and I'm having a great time on my 4xl
23:15:01 <blueuser[m]> <jpds "The normal gcam app (no mod) wor"> is Top Shots working as well?
23:17:25 <overlycomplicate> Hey guys, I hope all of you have had a blessed Sunday today. I'm extremely new to riot, and I'm wanting to know if this is the main chat room. I only see one other message right above me from 'blueuser'.
23:18:29 <blueuser[m]> yea the feature to see history for new user have been turned off it's normal
23:18:42 <blueuser[m]> no one spoke since you joined
23:19:02 <overlycomplicate> Oh okay! does that eventually go away so that I can be a part of the community?
23:19:45 <blueuser[m]> it's just when you join the room, you don't see the history, but once you joined you will see it
23:20:29 <overlycomplicate> How do i check if I am joined at this moment? Or does it automatically join me?
23:20:45 <blueuser[m]> you can see the history here https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos, but it's kinda buggy and sometimes messages from users don't get logged
23:22:32 <blueuser[m]> <overlycomplicate "How do i check if I am joined at"> it's ok you are in the room
23:24:08 * blueuser[m] uploaded an image: hii.jpg (25KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/SxPILUlyHpsbJfidLngPeEHs/hii.jpg >
23:26:26 * overlycomplicate sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/iiyIjNhcinvLttftjaicnXsk/message.txt >
23:27:09 <overlycomplicate> I guess it doesn't quite make sense to me, and I would just like an explanation of the technical details of this, because it seems kind of contradicting.
23:28:52 <blueuser[m]> it's the software which is intrusive, not the hardware
23:30:11 <blueuser[m]>  * it's their software which is intrusive, not the hardware
23:31:34 <overlycomplicate> But the hardware can absolutely be compromised. If the hardware is compromised, the OS doesn't really matter. A prime example is the IME in modern intel laptops/computers.
23:32:46 <overlycomplicate> The IME in say for example, lenovo laptops cannot be disabled in nearly all newer models to use something more privacy focused like libreboot
23:34:49 <overlycomplicate> I know that's a really extreme example, but it would be similar to if i plugged in a keylooger via usb to your computer. The encryption could be easily defeated because I know know the password for those encryption keys
23:35:33 <blueuser[m]> intel ME is something that enterprises use to manage their park of computer, not some spy program
23:35:37 <cn3m[m]> overlycomplicated: the IME is not malicious and it is not even remotely a large attack surface
23:35:39 <cn3m[m]> that is FUD
23:35:47 <cn3m[m]> you install libreboot is fucking up your secrutiy
23:35:57 <cn3m[m]> they don't ship critical security updates
23:36:11 <blueuser[m]>  * intel ME is something that enterprises use to manage their park of computers, not some spy program
23:37:51 <overlycomplicate> https://www.wired.com/story/intel-management-engine-vulnerabilities-pcs-servers-iot/
23:37:51 <overlycomplicate> Now, this article seems to suggest the contrary, but that's why Im asking about it. Im in no way trying to argue about it.
23:38:22 <overlycomplicate> It allowed for remote access to those devices, from wht I took away from it.
23:38:23 <cn3m[m]> overlycomplicated: everything has bugs
23:38:27 <overlycomplicate> what*
23:39:25 <cn3m[m]> IME is not ideal, but it is minuscule as far as attack surface goes
23:39:32 <overlycomplicate> But isn't a bug something that is non-intentionally placed there by mistake? It allowing remote access seems like to me a more deliberate action.
23:40:36 <overlycomplicate> Again guys, Im not trying to argue about it, but theres not many people I can talk to about this that can actually give me an answer or even relate to what Im talking about.
23:42:40 <cn3m[m]> overlycomplicated: there was a zero click exploit against AOSP on Google Pixels recently. All open source
23:42:47 <cn3m[m]> exploits can do a lot of damage
23:43:08 <cn3m[m]> IME is not immune to exploits, but it has historically held up really well
23:43:20 <cn3m[m]> IME is probably one of the most secure pieces of your PC
23:43:31 <cn3m[m]> it also has useful attributes
23:43:35 <cn3m[m]> that is how Qubes does anti evil maid for instance
23:45:24 <blueuser[m]> <overlycomplicate "But isn't a bug something that i"> if you are worried about the nsa being able to hack your phone or something like that you should not use a phone in first place
23:46:54 <overlycomplicate> I 100% agree with that. My main i guess "concern" was for the sake of privacy and security. What makes Google devices specifically more secure that grapheneos has only dedicated strictly to that? Ill admit that mobile devices aren't my field specifically (I'm working towards my masters in cybersecurity, but more in forensics), I just haven't quite understood what makes the pixel that much more secure that
23:46:55 <overlycomplicate> Graphene can only be installed on *those* devices.
23:46:56 <cn3m[m]> <blueuser[m] "if you are worried about the nsa"> technically a phone is far more resilient
23:47:12 <cn3m[m]> for people with extremely high threat level a phone is likely your best bet
23:47:14 <overlycomplicate> cn3m: 100% correct
23:47:28 <blueuser[m]> i mean any device, but he was speaking about pixels phones
23:47:55 <overlycomplicate> Phones are incredibly secure, far more than a pc running windows. Id never argue against that for a second.
