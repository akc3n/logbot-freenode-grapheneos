06:00:08 <smartkick> hello guys
06:00:31 <smartkick> is there an app similar to anon surf
06:00:35 <smartkick> fro mobiles
06:00:40 <smartkick> for mobiles
06:03:47 <renlord> smartkick: use tor
06:04:26 <smartkick> would tour make the whole phone annoymus
06:04:34 <smartkick> or just the browser
06:39:40 <dmatrixs[m]> Just the browser. Orbot would route your other traffic through tor
06:40:16 <smartkick> so orbot is like anon surf
06:40:41 <smartkick> it doesn't come preinstalled
06:42:01 <dmatrixs[m]> I'm not sure what anonsurf is. Orbot just acts like a vpn on your phone that uses Tor
06:42:28 <smartkick> anonsurf is a linux app that route all the laptop connection
06:43:38 <smartkick> Anonusrf uses TOR iptables to anonymize the whole system
09:11:45 <djee737ejdd[m]> <hqoojynvef7fts6h[m] "Hi. I recently installed Graphen"> Someone might give you an better answer. But Google Pixel 4 has screen problems with 90hz. Probably hardware fault. You can disable it via adb
09:12:11 <djee737ejdd[m]> Not sure if that's the reason for your problem though
09:17:07 <smartkick> i  know you can
09:17:09 <smartkick> but not how
09:17:15 <smartkick> let's wait for some better than me

11:50:25 <citypw> https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/8/14/569
12:56:20 <pikey[m]> i just heard about Pixel 4a release. Does anyone have a best guess as to when Graphene might support it? It's a few months before I could even get one, but wondering whether to save and wait, or switch to 3a now as i have a spare of those. thanks
13:10:58 <theultron[m]> <pikey[m] "i just heard about Pixel 4a rele"> Make a search in this room for "pixel 4a support" and you will get your answer.
15:20:51 <Btcboss> Hello how can I install apps in guest mode?
15:20:59 <Btcboss> I cant find the way
15:21:36 <Btcboss> The idea is have not useful apps in the guest mode and the sensitive one in the owner mode
15:22:21 <Btcboss> Is possible to set a password between modes?
15:22:28 <Btcboss> Thanks
15:23:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> <theultron[m] "Make a search in this room for ""> Can you search on Element Android?
15:29:52 <Quan7um> <Btcboss "Hello how can I install apps in "> Use the File Managee
15:30:07 <Quan7um> Make sure it's set to see the internal storage.
15:30:25 <Quan7um> Navigate to the folder where the APK is located and run from there.
15:31:52 <Blockware> I need to install apps in guest mode is possible?

16:08:51 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <Blockware "I need to install apps in guest "> Nope afaik
16:20:10 <theultron[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Can you search on Element Androi"> I don't know. I use Element on Desktop. You can also search here. https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/
18:03:31 <spoonhoarder82[m> I also have the screen flicker issue on pixel 4 described above.  Supposedly due to google using PWM dimming.  Not sure if refresh rate will matter.  Please let me know if it works for you!
18:05:18 <tve> I'm trying to get started with GrapheneOS (on a pixel3a) and am a bit stumped... I've installed and booted, so far so good, but now what? Do I really have to sideload f-droid to get anything else installed?
18:05:53 <tve> Also several of the pre-installed apps start with a warning that they were built for a previous version of the OS. What's up with that and how do I updated them?
18:06:09 <tve> I have the feeling I overlooked some getting-started doc?
18:07:56 <nikitalita[m]1> tve: yeah, the pre-installed apps are the placeholder apps from AOSP; they're mainly bare bones reference implementations and they haven't been updated in a while
18:08:13 <nikitalita[m]1> You definitely wanna start by sideloading f-droid, yeah
18:09:54 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Or Auroradroid/Foxydroid
18:10:02 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah
18:10:14 <nikitalita[m]1> I find Aurora droid to be better personally
18:11:08 <tve> OK. Looks like a long hill to climb before I have a usable phone...
18:11:24 <nikitalita[m]1> eh, it's not too bad
18:11:33 <nikitalita[m]1> I had everything I needed in a couple of hours
18:11:35 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Not that much, just few apps to install at best
18:11:38 <tve> Now off to figuring out where to get an aurora-droid APK to sideload...
18:12:22 <nikitalita[m]1> tve: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.adroid/
18:13:08 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> https://auroraoss.com
18:13:26 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <tve "Now off to figuring out where to"> https://auroraoss.com/downloads.php
18:13:35 <nikitalita[m]1> oh yeah
18:13:37 <nikitalita[m]1> that's a bit clearer
18:14:00 <tve> thanks!
18:16:07 <nikitalita[m]1> btw: Aurora Store is a way to install apps from the play store, Aurora Droid is a F-Droid client that uses the F-Droid repositories
18:16:25 <nikitalita[m]1> the branding is kinda confusing imo
18:16:40 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Droid came from F-Droid
18:17:06 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Well, either way, Aurora Store has also preconfigured other repo that you may or may not need
18:17:15 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Although Riot repo is empty now
18:34:22 <tve> Oops. Very first app I install (after side-loading aurora store) requires GPS :-(
18:34:48 <tve> Can I just install micro-g as a bridge until I figure out which non-GPS alternative to use?
18:36:28 <tve> (The app is https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenalp.realtimetracker2&hl=en_US and I use it daily for safety while out on the ocean)
18:36:40 <tve> (The app is https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenalp.realtimetracker2&hl=en_US and I use it daily for safety while out on the ocean)
18:41:03 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <tve "Can I just install micro-g as a "> It'll not work as expected iirc
18:41:18 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Consider checking out CalyxOS if it is a deal breaker
18:41:25 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> to have microG
18:42:36 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <tve "Can I just install micro-g as a "> On non main user profile you can test though
18:42:43 <tve> I took a look. I didn't find any community forum/chat/irc/anything. That's a non-starter for me, I don't want to spend hours figuring everything out on my own.
18:44:47 <kickstart> hi
18:44:59 <kickstart> do you recomend using orbot all the time
18:52:59 <nikitalita[m]1> tve:  you may want to check out osmand+
18:54:30 <tve> thanks!
18:55:13 <tve> yes, that's what I had on my list.
18:56:01 <tve> Does Haystack work to get the signature patching spoof onto the pixel3a to enable micro-g? Or is that not sufficient?
18:56:49 <nikitalita[m]1> as for location sharing, I can't seem to find anything
18:56:52 <tve> I may just have to go back to a goolag system and first get used to non-GPS app alternatives... I was hoping to use micro-g as a bridge...
18:57:34 <nikitalita[m]1> there's not a lot of open-source location sharing apps because, well, location sharing is generally a giant privacy hole :P
18:57:40 <nikitalita[m]1> although there are many good uses, such as your case
18:58:24 <tve> for the location sharing I have my own map and track server anyway, so I can feed osmand data into it. But I can't implement all that in a day...
18:58:25 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <kickstart "do you recomend using orbot all "> Yes, as Tor can circumvent censorship that your ISP may apply. Although, it might cause problems with non-free software, Cloudflare, and other stuff that are anti-Tor
18:58:40 <nikitalita[m]1> ah, interesting
18:59:36 <nikitalita[m]1> tve: what map and track server do you use?
18:59:40 <tve> I don't mind sharing my location with specific companies as long as I get to decide what and when it's being shared.
19:00:16 <cn3m[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Yes, as Tor can circumvent censo"> Cloudflare is not anti Tor they do a lot to support something that looks like spam. Their business is to stop spam
19:00:19 <tve> it's not an off-the-shelf solution... I used node-red for home automation and there's a world map plugin
19:00:30 <nikitalita[m]1> oh, cool
19:01:34 <nikitalita[m]1> <tve "I don't mind sharing my location"> definitely; unfortunately, that's rarely been the case for most of these services
19:02:56 <nikitalita[m]1> hmmm
19:04:04 <nikitalita[m]1> https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-web-worldmap
19:04:14 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, this looks cool
19:04:26 <nikitalita[m]1> tve: how do feed data into this?
19:04:35 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <cn3m[m] "Cloudflare is not anti Tor they "> Their "anti-DDoS" Service as a Software Substitute is trash
19:06:46 <nikitalita[m]1> eh
19:06:57 <nikitalita[m]1> it's a lot better than something like recaptcha
19:10:26 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <nikitalita[m]1 "it's a lot better than something"> I would rather not use neither anti-DDoS nor CAPTCHA, both are annoying. Honeypots seem to be a better idea: https://projecthoneypot.org
19:10:44 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, i think so too
19:11:24 <nikitalita[m]1> but at least cloudflare doesn't do shit like screenshot your browser and collect your cookies like google recaptcha does
19:12:22 <kickstart> can i ask if their any good privacy at least neutral smart watch
19:12:40 <nikitalita[m]1> ehhhh
19:12:47 <nikitalita[m]1> not really
19:12:52 <nikitalita[m]1> I liked the pebble time
19:13:05 <nikitalita[m]1> But they've discontinued the pebble line
19:13:14 <tve> Re: how to feed data into node-red's worldmap -- I will need to implement that. I forget what osmand+ supports, probabaly periodic https posts...
19:13:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "Cloudflare is not anti Tor they "> Yes it is
19:13:54 <nikitalita[m]1> tve: if you do, it would be awesome if you documented it and put up the source code somewhere
19:13:54 <kickstart> does the phone have mac adress like the laptops and if so how to hide it or change it
19:14:25 <Autopsy[m]> <kickstart "can i ask if their any good priv"> What do you want a smart watch for? Something like Apple Watch or Samsung watch, or a fitness tracker like FitBit?
19:14:43 <nikitalita[m]1> kickstart: yes, for wifi and bluetooth. GrapheneOS automatically randomizes those
19:15:01 <kickstart> i want to be apple not to miss my calls
19:15:41 <kickstart> and messages , leave the phone far from and if it's not urgent i don't answer like that , some basic step count and stuff
19:16:22 <kickstart> nikitalita[m]1 thanks for the info
19:18:04 <Autopsy[m]> <kickstart "and messages , leave the phone f"> Xiaomi's Amazfit Bip. You can use Gadgetbridge to update the firmware, so you don't need the proprietary Chinese app. Connect via Bluetooth to get SMS, Calls etc. Also has health stuff, including basic step count.
19:18:15 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <nikitalita[m]1 "but at least cloudflare doesn't "> Actually, I wouldn't trust Cloudflare in them not doing that.
19:19:00 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <kickstart "can i ask if their any good priv"> I think AsteroidOS (https://asteroidos.org) could help
19:19:22 <kickstart> Autopsy[m] that's really nice project for me will do it
19:19:29 <nikitalita[m]1> it's not really in cloudflare's interests to do invasive tracking like that; they're a hosting company, not an advertising company like google
19:19:44 <nikitalita[m]1> cloudflare is bad, sure, but in their own special ways :P
19:20:24 <BlackWinnerYoshi> I still want to hunt down Cloudflare sites to send them this
19:20:42 <BlackWinnerYoshi> I mean, *websites using Cloudflare
19:21:37 <nikitalita[m]1> I dunno about that; cloudflare may have become inadvertently very useful for anonymous browsing
19:22:53 <nikitalita[m]1> there was recently a defcon talk about how, using tls 1.3 with ESNI, you can do domain-fronting on steroids with cloudflare
19:24:34 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <nikitalita[m]1 "I dunno about that; cloudflare m"> You mean like their DNS? 1.1.1.1

19:34:39 <Autopsy[m]> That's a solid recommendation tbh.
19:34:41 <aeonsolution[m]> that's not even factoring the bad advice and misinformation on those topics either, just read and be critical of all information, but do the work and research before forming opinions

20:05:25 <aeonsolution[m]> Autopsy: you should check the logs from the past two days, they might of spoken on this there
