01:06:26 <nhkays> is there a full specsheet for all of the security features in the Pixel 3a, 4 etc? things like IOMMU, and other features found?
01:07:32 <strcat[m]> no
02:30:54 <lev[m]> huh, there wasn't an update today was there?  I got a patch earlier, or at least my phone asked me to restart (I was talking to someone, so I just complied without looking too closely)
02:31:15 <lev[m]> but I can't find an annoucement/notes for something more recent than 10/1
02:35:44 <strcat> lev[m]: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.10.01.23 is the most recent update
02:35:51 <strcat> check what version you're on, I'm sure that's the upgrade you got
02:36:06 <strcat> don't confuse the date of the release with the date it is pushed out via the Stable channel (or the Beta channel)
02:36:19 <lev[m]> yeah that's what my current version says
02:36:20 <lev[m]> ahh okay
02:36:45 <lev[m]> I thought I'd applied that patch on the first, but I must be misremembering
05:37:22 <glaverna[m]> Hi there,  has anyone else been unable to screenshot any screen since the android 11 update? I didn't see an issue posted to github but I wanted to be sure it wasn't a known issue with a simple fix before I submitted a formal issue.
05:39:41 <inthewaves[m]> glaverna: there's a fix for it for the next release: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/2f062429c4d9e57fbc7a574be52924fc9addd750
05:39:41 <inthewaves[m]> for now, you'll have to press both power button and volume down at the same time to take screenshots, or use a different gesture mode from 2-button navigation and take screenshots from the recents menu
05:44:01 <glaverna[m]> Ah fantastic thank you so much :) I was actually using the hardware  buttons (power and volume down) but was getting the error that screenshots are not allowed by my app or organization, even on the launcher. Will wait for the next build and update if it's still not working. Thanks again!

05:55:48 <save2020[m]> Why on Pixel 3 I cannot change Work Notifications settings?
05:57:42 <save2020[m]> Also at Pixel 3a there is an option: "Show Lockdown Option" which Pixel 3 does not has it
05:58:24 <save2020[m]> They are both updated with the same version of GrapheneOS

08:02:22 <Sellerie> Whats the status of grapheneos for sunfish? In the build guide it says "still in development"
10:25:51 <mrxx_0[m]> <Sellerie "Whats the status of grapheneos f"> No official port of Graphene on the 4a at the moment. So it's still in development.
10:33:48 <fll[m]> Sellerie: if you have a 4a, anupritaisno1 is looking for people who want to flash test builds onto their phones
11:36:35 <dazinism> The last two stable updates  began to download (saw in notifications ) but never happened,  theres been no attempt to download again, even after tapping on 'check for updates' in system update settings
11:36:50 <dazinism> Im on 3XL
11:38:44 <dazinism> Tried 'check for updates' a few times in the last days
11:39:12 <strcat[m]> dazinism: can you get logcat output
11:39:54 <dazinism> strcat: bug report has what you need?
11:41:31 <strcat[m]> should
11:41:47 <dazinism> I'll do that now
13:59:39 <wdnsdy[m]> hi does anyone know if fdroid works fine on grapheneOS 11 (cause of v1 signature) , if it doesn't , is there a recommended alternative to get apps?
14:00:18 <anupritaisno1[m4> [dazinism](https://matrix.to/#/@DzzzzzzR:matrix.org)
14:00:23 <anupritaisno1[m4> I'll have a look at your logs in private
14:01:09 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: its sorted thanks. Just needed a reboot.
14:01:30 <anupritaisno1[m4> Oh yeah
14:01:50 <dazinism> I hadn't done so as I wanted to maintain the state in case there was an issue logs could help with
14:01:56 <anupritaisno1[m4> If you already installed one update and try to install another that can happen
14:02:03 <dazinism> Daniel had a look
14:03:44 <kopolee11[m]> <wdnsdy[m] "hi does anyone know if fdroid wo"> F-Droid works on the latest stable version of GrapheneOS. However some apps won't work. In general it seems recommended to get apps from the Aurora Store whenever possible, because they tend to be updated faster and have higher API levels than F-Droid.
14:04:17 <kopolee11[m]> * F-Droid works on the latest stable version of GrapheneOS. However some apps from the F-Droid repo won't work for the reason you listed. In general it seems recommended to get apps from the Aurora Store whenever possible, because they tend to be updated faster and have higher API levels than F-Droid.
14:06:25 <wdnsdy[m]> <kopolee11[m] "F-Droid works on the latest stab"> is there an easy way to know which apps aren't working ? thanks for the answer btw , appreciate it !
14:07:30 <dazinism> Think my problem was that the updater app didn't display or keep the reboot notification.
14:09:31 <kopolee11[m]> I'd search the logs and check F-Droid, but basically it's apps that were targeted using API level 30 but still using v1 signature, which Android 11 doesn't allow. (At least as I understand. Again, check the logs for more detailed explanations)
14:09:58 <dazinism> wdnsdy: https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues/2162
14:10:29 <anupritaisno1[m4> <dazinism "Think my problem was that the up"> Not the updater's issue
14:10:31 <wdnsdy[m]> Thanks for both of you
14:10:54 <anupritaisno1[m4> Lineage updater has the same problem
14:11:36 <dazinism> kopolee11: don't think fdroid builds of apps have lower API levels (target SDKs) unless they haven't been updated to the same version as the build on Play
14:12:10 <alex-resist> I haven't run into any F-Droid apps that don't work on GrapheneOS. All the usual suspects seem to work fine and I can recommend using them
14:12:21 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: interesting what causes it?
14:13:37 <anupritaisno1[m4> <dazinism "anupritaisno1: interesting what "> What I know may be outdated by now
14:13:42 <dazinism> alex-resist: the fdroid apps that fail on Android 11 (with a target SDK 30 and only v1 signatures) are very few now.
14:13:52 <anupritaisno1[m4> Will need to look at the update engine code again on R
14:14:45 <alex-resist> dazinism: can you give an example? I would actually like to try one of those apps out, to see how they behave
14:14:46 <dazinism> My 3XL has been suffering from severe lagging at times since moving to 11
14:15:11 <kopolee11[m]> <dazinism "kopolee11: don't think fdroid bu"> Yea, my bad. What I meant to say is Google Play enforces a higher API level than F-Droid so you can avoid getting really old apps. And since higher API levels generally mean more privacy and security, you're generally better off going with the Aurora Store. Not universally true, but seems like a good guideline.
14:16:16 <dazinism> alex-resist: think NetGuard, although there may have been a release in the last day that fixes it. Try the previous version if so
14:16:52 <anupritaisno1[m4> <dazinism "My 3XL has been suffering from s"> When
14:17:09 <dazinism> Just randomly

14:17:48 <kopolee11[m]> <alex-resist "dazinism: can you give an exampl"> Check this issue link he sent above.
14:17:55 <anupritaisno1[m4> That's not good
14:17:59 <dazinism> I havent been with a PC, so took a bug report and sent it to Daniel
14:18:12 <anupritaisno1[m4> Do you know anything specific that can trigger it?
14:18:26 <dazinism> Not really
14:18:38 <dazinism> Just random
14:18:54 <dazinism> Sometimes it keeps happening, then clears
14:18:58 <anupritaisno1[m4> How frequently is this random
14:19:51 <dazinism> Sometimes can be a day+ without, other times happens again after a few minutes
14:20:11 <dazinism> I'll grab another bug report/logcat if it happens again.
14:21:00 <dazinism> I've just moved to the 9-29 release
14:21:22 <alex-resist> travankor I tried 3 of those apps and only NetGuard is causing problems. The other ones work fine. But anyway, now I've seen how the problem looks like, thx :)
14:24:34 <dazinism> anupritaisno1 at least one other person mentioned issues with lots of lagging on a P 3 (IIRC)
14:33:04 <timmothy[m]> I thought of switching to goggle pixel
14:33:24 <timmothy[m]> Will the goggle pixel 5 be supported with graphene os?
14:33:58 <darkharbingeroft> I think so
14:34:44 <alex-resist> Maybe those questions for Pixel 4a/5 should be answered above, in an FAQ section next to the channel rules. Then not so many people would constantly ask the same questions
14:44:59 <timmothy[m]> Where is that Channel? I never used this messanger
15:04:15 <Sheru[m]> If somebody needs to check the faq, it's here: grapheneos.org/faq
17:10:17 <pikey[m]> I just had a prompt to update newpipe. I clicked to update and it opened a git page where it downloaded installer but I can't run it. I get this quite often. I go to the apk in Files app and run with package installer but nothing happens. Any ideas please?

18:03:09 <alphabit[m]> Hello all, im experiencing an error in the auditor app after install
18:03:09 <alphabit[m]> I saw something related to my issue but there was never any final resolution made available

18:30:12 <strcat[m]> alphabit: it's a real problem that the app is detecting, not a security issue, but a real issue nonetheless
18:30:20 <poisonoushydra> I have been using F-Droid since the grapheneOS update to Android 11 and have not encountered any issues.
18:30:26 <strcat[m]> alphabit: update to the latest release of Auditor, which is bundled with the latest release of GrapheneOS, so you can just update the OS
18:54:56 <alphabit[m]> Ermergerd ty!!!!! T.T
18:55:10 <anupritaisno1[m4> <timmothy[m] "Will the goggle pixel 5 be suppo"> It will be a while
18:59:11 <kastel> When trying to check for updates, the Seamless Update Client keeps stopping for me, after a reboot as well. I'm running the 9.29.20 update on Sargo .
18:59:43 <mrxx_0[m]> <timmothy[m] "Will the goggle pixel 5 be suppo"> It will when we have aosp source for it, and if people are stepping up to maintain it on the long run
18:59:46 <kastel> Can I flash the ota update zip the same way as I installed gos originally to update instead?
19:22:05 <ruddo[m]> the updater is crashing on me about halfway of the download
19:22:13 <ruddo[m]> was there something released after 29th update?
19:22:51 <ruddo[m]> oh there is
19:22:54 <ruddo[m]> okay will try again
19:26:25 <kastel> what are you trying?
19:27:02 <ruddo[m]> check for updates
19:27:06 <ruddo[m]> I just tried it several times.
19:27:18 <ruddo[m]> the seamless update UI always crashes or disappears from the screen
19:27:22 <ruddo[m]> it looks like I'm screwed for some reason
19:27:40 <ruddo[m]> Imma reboot.
19:27:41 <kastel> yeah that's the same problem I'm having then
19:29:55 <anupritaisno1[m4> [ruddo](https://matrix.to/#/@ruddo:matrix.org)  [kastel](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_kastel:matrix.org) pm me

19:31:29 <anupritaisno1[m4> Please record the approximate time the issue occurred as well by looking at your status bar
19:31:44 <anupritaisno1[m4> And once you have reproduced the crash
19:31:58 <anupritaisno1[m4> Use CTRL-C to abort the log
19:32:00 <anupritaisno1[m4> Or just disconnect your device
19:32:29 <anupritaisno1[m4> Please disconnect your device soon after the issue is reproduced so we can find the issue right at the end of the log. It is faster for us too
19:32:46 <anupritaisno1[m4> If this is too complicated please take a bug report and send it to me in private
19:32:52 <anupritaisno1[m4> Do not upload your logs publicly
19:33:51 <anupritaisno1[m4> The generated log will be in a file called log in the same directory
19:34:02 <kastel> ah sure, give me a few minutes then, thanks
20:36:05 <crsc> Hello.
20:42:59 <anupritaisno1[m4> I resolved [kastel](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_kastel:matrix.org) issue BTW
21:13:26 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: what was it? Sounded a bit like what was happening for me
21:14:31 <anupritaisno1[m4> Same as you
21:14:38 <anupritaisno1[m4> I just replied here late
21:21:48 <dazinism> Device hasn't lagged since the move to 9-29. Guess a bug fix in chromium or webview could of made the difference. Also may just not of happened yet
21:23:12 <strcat[m]> there were hardly changes in the recent Chromium releases
21:23:20 <strcat[m]>  * there were hardly any changes in the recent Chromium releases
21:38:26 <Biv[m]> no search function it seems so has anyone had luck with seedvault on next cloud?
21:50:53 <portage[m]> Does graphene sandbox apps?
21:51:23 <critic[m]> Keep sand away from your mobile devices at all time! The salt content will ruin your device!
21:51:55 <dazinism> Biv: think theres currently an issue with it not working reliably with Nextcloud.
21:52:17 <dazinism> Certainly is with the last release of seedvault
21:52:47 <anupritaisno1[m4> <portage[m] "Does graphene sandbox apps?"> AOSP does
21:53:14 <dazinism> Which was in March. Not sure if Graphene is using that or is building its own version with some of the bug fixes made since
21:53:18 <anupritaisno1[m4> <critic[m] "Keep sand away from your mobile "> OT
21:53:56 <dazinism> Biv: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
22:07:54 <Biv[m]> Oh thanks
22:14:00 <Biv[m]> that works great
23:15:28 <strcat[m]> btw next release will re-enable the screenshot action in the power menu
23:15:40 <strcat[m]> aka global action dialog
23:15:53 <strcat[m]> it's just disabled by default in Android 11
23:16:08 <strcat[m]> if you enable gesture navigation there's a screenshot button in recent apps list UI anyway
23:24:31 <strcat[m]> also showing the logout option for secondary profiles by default
23:24:41 <strcat[m]> so you can logout instead of switching
23:25:29 <strcat[m]> logout is only an option for secondary profiles since the owner account is the system account and needs to be logged in for basic functionality to work (other profiles depend on it being logged in)
23:26:23 <strcat[m]> so best practice is using a secondary profile for regular usage and treating owner as the administrator account (not much administrator that is needed though other than creating / deleting user profiles)
23:27:28 <strcat[m]> rebooting is how you logout of the owner profile, essentially
23:37:18 <dazinism> Oh, nice 😃
