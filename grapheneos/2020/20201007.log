01:55:25 <strcat[m]> need feedback on the latest beta so I can decide if it's ready for stable

02:00:33 <JTL> > reject received unix timestamps before build unix time for https-based network time implementation
02:00:35 <JTL> Very sensible mitigation. I was thinking the same
02:01:46 <nuudul[m]> im planning to buy a pixel phone, a pixel 2 will probably be enought for me. are there any cons of having legacy support?
02:02:22 <renlord> nuudul[m]: pixel 2 is EOL and wont be receiving vendor firmware updates anymore soon
02:02:42 <renlord> i.e. insecure to use
02:02:53 <nuudul[m]> <renlord "nuudul: pixel 2 is EOL and wont "> ok
02:03:25 <nuudul[m]> when will pixel 3* reach eol?
02:03:45 <renlord> nuudul[m]: maybe in a year?

02:04:46 <nuudul[m]> <poisonoushydra "https://support.google.com/nexus"> thx
02:28:45 <strcat[m]> nuudul: our recommendation is a Pixel 4 atm - or once it's supported, a 4a, but we don't have a timeline for that
02:28:50 <strcat[m]> need people to step up and help with 4a support
02:35:36 <alex-resist> quick reminder that Pixel 4a is still not available in many parts of the world, including Germany
02:35:56 <alex-resist> Once it's available here, I might buy one just for testing purposes
02:38:08 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.10.06.02
02:38:17 <strcat[m]> anyone using Beta channel?
02:38:22 <strcat[m]> need feedback on the latest release
02:38:25 <strcat[m]> everything works fine?
02:39:01 <skwisgaar[m]> strcat: I’m on the beta on a 3 XL - when switching profiles or ending a session, maybe 1 in 10-15 times the phone lags for about 15 seconds, and the wallpaper disappears. The issue resolves itself but I thought I would mention it.
02:39:34 <skwisgaar[m]> I use profiles regularly and haven’t seen it before
02:39:57 <strcat[m]> ending session wasn't supported before
02:39:58 <strcat[m]> though
02:40:27 <skwisgaar[m]> Yeah but it also occurred a couple times just when switching between profiles
02:41:06 <skwisgaar[m]> I had to try multiple times to reproduce it so it is uncommon
02:46:10 <skwisgaar[m]> Honestly having trouble getting it to happen again
02:47:09 <alex-resist> strcat[m] do you have any preference which model should be beta tested more? Or is the fact that any beta testing at all happens more important at this point?
02:49:52 <strcat[m]> skwisgaar: it didn't break horribly tho right? was just a UX issue
02:49:56 <strcat[m]> temporary annoyance
02:50:10 <strcat[m]> setting unique wallpapers per user
02:50:14 <strcat[m]> might make it clearer what happens
02:52:32 <strcat> alex-resist: not really a preference
02:52:45 <strcat> alex-resist: but a 4 or 4a (once it's supported) would last longest
02:53:01 <strcat> 2 or 2 XL testing not very helpful anymore since they'll *likely* be gone by next year (don't know)
02:53:53 <skwisgaar[m]> strcat: yeah exactly, it was only temporary
02:54:48 <alex-resist> Currently, I could help with 3a and 3a XL. 4a once it's released. I think I will skip 4/4 XL, doesn't make much sense for me
03:03:47 <anupritaisno1[m4> <skwisgaar[m] "strcat: I’m on the beta on a 3 X"> Yes this is present on the stock ROM too
03:03:55 <anupritaisno1[m4> Switching user profiles is extremely slow
03:07:26 <mlonjozos[m]1> Hello everyone, just got installed GrapheneOS into my pixel3XL
03:07:26 <mlonjozos[m]1> Anybody know how I can get superuser privileges to install busybox so i can install xposed installer and xprivacylua? Thanks
03:11:43 <critic[m]> anupritaisno1:  If 4a ever gets added, can someone please make a super simple guide for adding a new device along with some commit IDs so you can see what it takes to add a new device? Adding it to something like https://grapheneos.org/build
03:11:44 <critic[m]> I ask this because so many new pixel devices are coming out. I'm personally interested in the 4a 5g and I don't wanna beg you guys to support it, but at the same time it's just daunting not knowing what to do.
03:11:44 <critic[m]> Even if we could get some commit IDs or a fake branch/PR that has all the commits or even a simple git patch that show you what it took to get the new 4a (or another device) working would go a really long way for me :(
03:12:37 <pech1019[m]> Just installed today's beta release on my 4XL. So far so good!
03:12:51 <strcat> critic[m]: ot'
03:12:56 <strcat> it's not a simple process
03:13:43 <critic[m]> Yea I figured, but some basic steps on what's needed would be nice. That is, if it's possible to generically describe the process.
03:17:09 <strcat[m]> critic: android-prepare-vendor support + port device repository changes + port device sepolicy changes + port kernel changes
03:17:21 <strcat[m]> involves 4 repositories, nothing outside them, there is not a specific process for adding it
03:17:35 <strcat[m]> have to figure it all out
03:17:56 <strcat[m]> and then that's just the beginning of device development / maintenance work
03:18:03 <strcat[m]> it is a long-term, difficult project
03:18:40 <renlord> do we still need 3a maintainers since the kernels are all centrally managed in crosshatch?
03:19:09 <renlord> and why not also merge sunfish and coral like the 3X series
03:19:16 <renlord> strcat[m]: ^
03:21:53 <strcat[m]> yes still need 3a maintainers
03:22:01 <strcat[m]> stuff is different in userspace and the kernel is different just built from same sources
03:22:10 <strcat[m]> renlord: it creates work if we merge it downstream
03:22:17 <strcat[m]> renlord: it would be nice if they did it upstream
03:28:33 * mlonjozos[m]1 sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YtiuXmQwCPokOtreWiGcpAdp/message.txt >
03:29:00 <renlord> mlonjozos[m]1: no superuser privilege at all
03:29:09 <renlord> it is the anti-thesis of how to use a mobile os
03:30:21 <renlord> if a user wants root, they clearly dont want a secure mobile os and should just ask about using a completely different OS in a different channel
03:33:25 <strcat[m]> mlonjozos: GrapheneOS doesn't have those things, if you forked the OS to include them it wouldn't be GrapheneOS anymore
03:33:46 <strcat[m]> also, client-side enforced security checks are insecure and don't work
03:33:55 <strcat[m]> they can be trivially bypassed
03:34:01 <strcat[m]> that's just privacy/security theater
03:34:06 <mlonjozos[m]1> Okay I see thanks for the responses. How do i go about installing xprivacylua then? Any clue?
03:34:14 <mlonjozos[m]1> Or is there a non-root alternative?
03:34:18 <strcat[m]> mlonjozos: it's not part of GrapheneOS, and it's insecure anyway
03:34:24 <strcat[m]> mlonjozos: there is already a strong sandbox and permission model
03:34:32 <strcat[m]> which unlike xprivacy lua doesn't rely on insecure client-side checks
03:35:20 <strcat[m]> code injected into an app is under the control of the app
03:35:48 <strcat[m]> and it can trivially bypass assorted inserted checks for Java code... they don't even apply to native code in the first place, they are just client-side checks for the common code paths in Java
03:36:00 <strcat[m]> it's not actually doing something that works
03:36:24 <strcat[m]> apps can trivially bypass the injected hooks and often do so by accident just by accessing the information other ways like native code
03:36:35 <strcat[m]> client side checks don't work, a check under the control of the adversary doesn't work
03:36:41 <strcat[m]> they can remove the check
03:36:43 <strcat[m]> security 101
03:37:28 <strcat[m]> checks need to be performed by the server not the client that's supposed to be having restrictions placed upon it
03:37:34 <strcat[m]> it's one of the most common novice security mistakes
03:37:59 <strcat[m]> doing stuff like client-side validation in the app / browser instead of checking it on the app server but the same thing applies to OS security
03:38:01 <strcat[m]> and privacy
03:39:11 <mlonjozos[m]1> Hmm I see thank you so much for the detailed responses strcat i appreciate you
03:40:47 <strcat[m]> mlonjozos: what xprivacy lua does is use a hooking framework (xposed) to inject checks which just isn't secure in general, unless they are injecting them into the server-side code only, which is not how it works
03:44:31 <strcat[m]> pushing out latest release to stable channel
03:44:40 <strcat[m]> no problems reported other than that minor UX issue with logout
03:45:05 <alex-resist> strcat[m] that means available immediately?
03:45:29 <strcat[m]> yeah it's available now
03:45:36 <alex-resist> Yeah, installing already
03:45:37 <strcat[m]> the updater only automatically checks around once every 4 hours
03:45:39 <alex-resist> Seems to be super small
03:45:41 <strcat[m]> you can trigger a check now if you want
03:45:51 <strcat[m]> the update should be tiny as long as you were on the most recent past release
03:46:00 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: as long as you stay up-to-date then you get updates as delta updates
03:46:17 <strcat[m]> we release a full over-the-air update (able to update from any past version to current) which is the full OS
03:46:24 <strcat[m]> and delta update from past version -> current
03:46:40 <alex-resist> I know, but this didn't even show any download activity, it took less than 1 second or so
03:46:40 <strcat[m]> it takes ridiculously long to generate deltas so we don't generate them for people further behind
03:46:51 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: well it's like 6M or something
03:47:01 <strcat[m]> and we have a fancy new update server with 2Gbit bandwidth now
03:47:06 <alex-resist> It immediately started installing. With 6MB that makes sense :)
03:47:46 <alex-resist> Does that also mean not many security updates from upstream? Or are they usually tiny?
03:48:06 <strcat[m]> security updates are almost always very small
03:48:23 <strcat[m]> many are ~5-10 lines of code changes each
03:48:28 <strcat[m]> others are 50-100
03:48:35 <strcat[m]> few are longer - some are, but not most
03:48:37 <alex-resist> That sounds good. I sometimes install Graphene for other people and they are usually afraid that updates are enabled via LTE
03:48:57 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: well if they always stay up-to-date they are almost always tiny
03:49:04 <strcat[m]> if they fall behind 1 version the update will be huge
03:49:18 <strcat[m]> since we don't generate deltas for older releases - we could, but it's too time consuming

03:50:14 <alex-resist> Ok, that is indeed acceptable, even with a small data plan
03:50:28 <strcat[m]> here is the previous release, which didn't have upstream changes:
03:50:31 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LIrYeOQYPvOWmCoiYdfLslPT/message.txt >
03:50:42 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: sometimes they'll be a lot bigger, it depends on what we changed
03:50:56 <strcat[m]> if we change C / C++ compilation options that impact tons of code in a significant way then it's going to be far larger
03:51:19 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: an update that is just a fresh build with little changed is maybe 1-2M
03:51:47 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: because it's shipping deltas, i.e. changes
03:51:52 <strcat[m]> it calculates deltas - it takes ages
03:52:02 <strcat[m]> tries to be quite efficient
03:52:03 <alex-resist> Rebooting now...
03:52:13 <strcat[m]> could probably make it take even longer to make them smaller but it's already insane
03:52:45 <alex-resist> Oh oh, bootloop...
03:52:50 <alex-resist> Now there's smoke
03:52:57 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: really? which device
03:53:02 <alex-resist> j/k everything's working fine, as usual :)
03:53:08 <strcat[m]> lol
03:53:08 <anupritaisno1[m4> <alex-resist "Now there's smoke"> OT
03:53:49 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: if it does fail to boot nice thing is that it just rolls back after ~3 attempts (varies by device)
03:54:36 <alex-resist> I'm using a 3a XL, which has extreme battery life, and so far no problems at all
03:54:46 <strcat[m]> once it successfully boots it can't roll back anymore (for very important reasons, and not just security, old versions often can't handle the data of new versions - pretty much guaranteed they can't for major releases)
03:54:59 <strcat[m]> new versions know how to migrate data from old ones, ofc can't do that the opposite way
03:55:11 <alex-resist> I have one question regarding the update process
03:55:32 <anupritaisno1[m4> <alex-resist "I have one question regarding th"> Don't ask to ask
03:56:09 <alex-resist> I understand that the operating system exists twice, in a and b. Say we're currently running a, then the update will be installed on b in the background, right? And on the next boot, it will switch to b. When will it update a? Installing an update before the reboot can take a couple of minutes, but after the reboot, there is not much activity
03:56:44 <anupritaisno1[m4> <alex-resist "I understand that the operating "> It will update a after the slot is marked as successful if required
03:56:57 <anupritaisno1[m4> We don't ship such updates though
03:57:44 <alex-resist> So if the other slot is never updated, do phones usually have version x in one slot, and x-1 in the other slot?
03:57:53 <anupritaisno1[m4> So it will never touch a
03:58:05 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: yes but once it boots successfully it disables the other slot from being bootable
03:58:10 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: there is an active slot, and the concept of a slot being bootable
03:58:17 <strcat[m]> lets say you are on slot a initially
03:58:34 <strcat[m]> you get an update, it writes it out to the slot b partitions, it verifies that it was written out correctly and didn't get corrupted
03:58:52 <strcat[m]> it runs post-installation stuff like compiling third party apps for the new OS
03:59:02 <strcat[m]> when it's done it marks the new slot bootable and asks you to reboot
03:59:20 <strcat[m]> if it boots successfully, once it gets to late boot, it marks the previous slot (a) as unbootable
03:59:22 <anupritaisno1[m4> <strcat[m] "you get an update, it writes it "> BTW missed a step
03:59:42 <anupritaisno1[m4> Before the install slot is marked unbootable
03:59:54 <strcat[m]> well it marks current as good
03:59:57 <strcat[m]> but I'm simplifying it
04:00:25 <alex-resist> I see
04:00:36 <alex-resist> so the previous system is marked unbootable until the next update appears
04:01:20 <strcat[m]> yes and then it's only made bootable after it has successfully installed the new update and verified that it was written out correctly
04:01:28 <strcat[m]> it hashes each of the partitions after writing them out and makes sure they match
04:01:31 <alex-resist> Is that not occupying a considerable amount of storage space? Or is the added reliability considered worth it?
04:02:00 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: the OS images are not really that big and space no longer has to be reserved per partition statically
04:02:13 <strcat[m]> because it uses 'dynamic partitions' where OS partitions can be removed, added and resized by updates
04:02:25 <strcat[m]> it has a slot a and slot b partition table
04:02:28 <strcat[m]> essentially
04:02:42 <alex-resist> I see, that is actually quite clever
04:02:43 <strcat[m]> so when it updates slot b it can write out the new slot b partition table
04:02:52 <anupritaisno1[m4> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) BTW for A-only it doesn't verify after applying by default right?
04:03:08 <strcat[m]> dunno what you mean
04:03:16 <strcat[m]> the normal update_engine update process always verifies
04:03:32 <anupritaisno1[m4> <strcat[m] "dunno what you mean"> Iirc there's a --verify option for devices without slots
04:03:38 <anupritaisno1[m4> That's disabled by default
04:03:41 <alex-resist> Is there a place where one can read up on these mid-level technicalities? Is the Android documentation covering all this?
04:03:42 <strcat[m]> well, I'm only talking about devices with slots
04:03:53 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: also the whole process is designed to be atomic
04:03:56 <anupritaisno1[m4> <alex-resist "Is there a place where one can r"> Yes
04:04:02 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: so you can cut power (pull out battery, whatever) at any point
04:04:08 <strcat[m]> and it won't corrupt the firmware / OS install
04:04:22 <strcat[m]> because when it changes the modes on the slots that is atomic
04:04:26 <anupritaisno1[m4> <strcat[m] "alex-resist: so you can cut powe"> Oneplus: yeah go ahead, try it
04:04:37 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: you can happily reboot while Updater is installer
04:04:40 <strcat[m]>  * alex-resist: you can happily reboot while Updater is installing
04:05:04 <strcat[m]> next boot, when it checks for an update again, it'll just start installing again from scratch
04:05:20 <strcat[m]> if what it already downloaded is still the newest, it will verify it and won't download it again
04:05:27 <strcat[m]> also we resume partial downloads
04:05:43 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it doesn't matter since it's writing the update to inactive slot
04:06:07 <strcat[m]> so that's the main point of it: it can update in the background without disrupting stuff or having the risk of horrible corruption and bricked device if it's interrupted
04:06:16 <strcat[m]> doesn't need to have scary warnings telling you not to interrupt it
04:06:28 <strcat[m]> I guess some users might think they can't interrupt it but it's totally safe to reboot halfway through an update is installed
04:06:33 <alex-resist> That is so much more user friendly than what I'm used to from years of teaching people how to update LineageOS
04:06:34 <strcat[m]> it'll just start over next boot
04:06:38 <strcat[m]> after it checks for an update again
04:07:07 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/ab
04:08:08 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/ab#life-of-an-a-b-update
04:08:53 <alex-resist> Super good, thank you so much. I should read those pages more often
04:09:17 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: the reason there is no 'optimizing apps' after booting anymore is because A/B updates mount the new system partition and do that in the background before considering the update done
04:10:16 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: verified boot + A/B updates provides a lot of reliability
04:11:17 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/avb/+/master/README.md explains the OS verified boot (firmware verified boot is per-device, this is how the late stage bootloader verifies the OS + hands off verification to the OS though)
04:12:01 <strcat[m]> essentially there's a vbmeta image, which is a small signed image and has hashes of everything else and a rollback index
04:12:07 <strcat[m]> vbmeta is what's signed with the verified boot (avb) key
04:12:35 <strcat[m]> bootloader verifies vbmeta signature, verifies stuff it references via hash and boots up the kernel from that
04:12:44 <strcat[m]> and then the kernel verifies the large partitions via dm-verity dynamically as they are read
04:13:17 <strcat[m]> so on a Pixel
04:13:34 <strcat[m]> the Titan M is the main place that a custom AVB key is stored along with vbmeta rollback indices
04:13:46 <strcat[m]> the rollback index is normally set to the security patch level
04:14:02 <strcat[m]> as a timestamp
04:14:38 <strcat[m]> it will refuse to boot an OS version with a lower rollback index, so an attacker can't gain root via exploitation and then write out an older OS version with more vulnerabilities that they can easily exploit next boot
04:15:23 <strcat[m]> can also have chained vbmetas if you want to update things independently of the main vbmeta but that's useless for us
04:15:25 <alex-resist> Sounds like a very solid design. Much more solid than the recent GNU/Linux approaches
04:15:37 <strcat[m]> it's so you can do something like using a Google system image, a Qualcomm vendor image, an OEM product image with OEM vbmeta
04:15:46 <strcat[m]> and chained vbmeta for system/vendor
04:15:48 <strcat[m]> or other setups like that
04:16:04 <strcat[m]> for a single vendor providing updates, like us, we just need 1 vbmeta
04:16:11 <strcat[m]> don't need the chained ones
04:16:12 <alex-resist> Is there any research how well the recent Pixel models resist Cellebrite devices?
04:16:43 <strcat[m]> cellebrite mostly requires that you unlock the device and grant access via USB file transfer and/or adb
04:17:01 <strcat[m]> it's mostly just a tool to deal with that for people...
04:17:14 <strcat[m]> they have exploits for some firmware / OSes
04:17:30 <alex-resist> I mean, if a device refuses USB connections and does not have any weak "recovery" modes, it should be pretty safe?
04:18:04 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: if you are talking about profiles that are not currently logged in then exploiting the OS doesn't get data anyway
04:18:40 <strcat[m]> if there is a profile logged in but locked, then exploiting the OS would obtain data in that profile that isn't protected by the keystore
04:19:06 <strcat[m]> apps can use the keystore to protect data when the screen is locked based on the lock method
04:19:55 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: we disable adding new USB peripherals after booting when the screen is locked, to reduce attack surface
04:19:55 <adeus[m]1> Wire app is not working with GraphOS download latest apk directly from Wire website
04:20:01 <adeus[m]1> The GUI is all messed up
04:20:09 <strcat[m]> what about it is messed up?

04:20:43 <strcat[m]> i.e. in Wire
04:21:00 <alex-resist> strcat[m] if such simple measures make a device pretty safe from Cellebrite attacks, why are they so successful? Are older Androids that much weaker, i.e. do they accept USB connections regardless of state and have sufficient vulnerabilities?
04:21:15 <adeus[m]1> It keeps vibrating like that all double icons and fuzzy

04:21:38 <strcat[m]> adeus: is that updated to Android 11?
04:21:40 <adeus[m]1> I apologize I see I am running older. Version on android
04:21:49 <adeus[m]1> <strcat[m] "adeus: is that updated to Androi"> No it’s 10
04:21:57 <strcat[m]> adeus: Google does 'staged rollouts' of updates where it takes weeks before they prompt you to upgrade
04:22:01 <strcat[m]> unless you manually upgrade asap
04:22:03 <adeus[m]1> Again I apologize for not being more thorough
04:24:34 <strcat[m]> adeus: they are probably doing something really weird like using private APIs despite all the obstacles they put up to discourage that and make it super clear it's wrong
04:24:57 <strcat[m]> and then their weird hacks broke in Android 11
04:25:02 <strcat[m]> happens with some apps
04:25:18 <strcat[m]> I haven't seen many cases of apps breaking due to actual backwards incompatible changes
04:25:30 <strcat[m]> other than apps targeting the new API level before they are really ready for it
04:25:55 <strcat[m]> adeus: a major issue is that since most phones barely get major version upgrades and get their super late
04:26:05 <strcat[m]> adeus: most app developers don't have Android 11 other than in the emulator if they use it
04:26:22 <strcat[m]> shrug
05:03:01 <anupritaisno1[m4> <strcat[m] "*shrug*"> What this mean btw
05:14:12 <pencildeek> When logged in to a second profile I saw the exit profile option on the home screen and logged out of the profile completely. I can't get that dialogue to appear again
05:14:32 <anupritaisno1[m4> <pencildeek "When logged in to a second profi"> Log in again
05:17:01 <pencildeek> I did. Like 15 times
05:18:01 <pencildeek> Not sure if it's a bug
05:18:49 <pencildeek> I really like not having to reboot my device to shut the second profile down

05:30:26 <anupritaisno1[m4> <mrxx_0[m] "Beta feedback : 3a xl all good"> How?
05:30:34 <anupritaisno1[m4> Test everything
05:35:15 <pencildeek> I'm on a 3a and I can't get that dialogue to reappear. Rebooted a few times as well
05:36:18 <strcat[m]> pencildeek: it's in the power menu
05:36:34 <strcat[m]> I don't know what causes the lockscreen option to appear
05:36:40 <strcat[m]> but the main option is in the power menu (global actions)
05:39:13 <pencildeek> Thanks Daniel. The weird thing is it popped up in a rectangle box on my home screen when I first switched to the second profile without touching the power button
05:39:50 <pencildeek> Gotcha
05:40:19 <pencildeek> This is a real cool update. Thanks
05:45:52 <pencildeek> The only other thing I'm noticing is that I have my font set to large and when I return to the administration account I have repeat widgets all over the screen and it returns to regular size except the toggle is still set to large?

05:52:40 <strcat[m]> duggalsu: so I'd suggest trying to reset network settings in the Settings app as another thing to try
05:52:48 <strcat[m]> and just deal with connecting to wifi networks again
05:52:50 <strcat[m]> duggalsu: or perhaps
05:52:59 <strcat[m]> duggalsu: change the preferred radio mode
05:53:02 <strcat[m]> duggalsu: before trying that
05:55:21 <strcat[m]> duggalsu: and yeah probably worth triggering an update before investigating even though I doubt there are any related fixes
05:59:22 <duggalsu[m]> Thanks!  The issue was that I had changed the network type from LTE (preferred) to LTE only
06:06:36 <strcat[m]> duggalsu: we probably don't support VoLTE with your carrier yet
06:06:50 <strcat[m]> duggalsu: or they don't support VoLTE (without a carrier phone at least)
06:06:55 <anupritaisno1[m4> [duggalsu](https://matrix.to/#/@duggalsu:matrix.org) what carrier
06:07:01 <strcat[m]> we need to add some more carrier configuration stuff

13:58:34 <q9f[m]> Thanks. I have read this carefully. My question is, will it make a huge difference to have a sunfish or bramble device? I'm not sure how Graphene considers/adds new devices.

15:22:27 <save2020[m]> I ve just installed GrapheneOS on a Pixel 3 XL and I do not have the fingerprint setting in security. Do you have any ideea if it's from GrapheneOS or from my phone? I havent tested the fingerprint before GrapheneOS.
15:25:59 <q9f[m]> understood.
15:26:13 <q9f[m]> Might just get a 3a then.
15:40:18 <Sheru[m]> Why not 4? Face unlock can be set just for apps, unlike fingerprint
15:40:58 <Sheru[m]> (Also cannot be easily spoofed as it scans the face through infrared/3D? With longer support time too?)
15:51:43 <q9f[m]> The 128GB version of the Pixel 4 is sold out and the 4a features a headphone jack which the 4 doesn't have. Missing headphone jack is certainly the biggest annoyance with the Pixel 2 I have.
15:52:44 <q9f[m]> On long road trips I either can listen to music or charge the phone but not both. Google engineers must be stoned when they designed a phone with only one output.
15:54:08 <q9f[m]> I know that the 4 generally has the better features. It's just so painful to see that I would have to upgrade my entire stack (car, headphones, etc.) to bluetooth just to be able to conveniently use the phone again. And don't get me started on bluetooth lol ...

17:56:10 <luna> Let me know if you need some more information in some area.

18:15:04 <mastercakex[m]> Do you also get calls in your left earbud only?
19:25:13 <burningdaemon[m]> Do you use Tor (Orbot) with VPN and if yes, what kind of Apps should be routed through VPN
19:36:39 <alex-resist> I use Orbot and it makes sense to route all apps through Tor that send or receive information that could be used to identify you
19:36:45 <alex-resist> (If anonymity is your priority)
19:37:23 <burningdaemon[m]> Also the Apps with linked Accounts?
19:38:04 <alex-resist> Yes, those definitely, plus maybe podcast apps, OsmAnd, transportation apps etc.
19:38:21 <alex-resist> Those that contain information about you that is not absolutely trivial and not the same for every user
19:39:53 <alex-resist> In principle, I would like to route the entire phone through Orbot, but then captive portals (which are necessary to use many public WiFis) no longer work, and I really like to use public WiFis with Graphene
19:40:22 <burningdaemon[m]> Ah OK thx
19:40:22 <burningdaemon[m]>  
19:40:22 <burningdaemon[m]> So I tried to use an other DNS like adguard. But the DNS don't work very well with Orbot VPN.
19:40:48 <alex-resist> No idea about that. Not sure if that combination makes sense, maybe someone else can answe rthat
19:40:52 <burningdaemon[m]> Does someone know how to block effective Ads on Graphene
19:42:33 <alex-resist> You could use Bromite, which is a decent clearnet browser that includes ad-blocking
19:43:59 <burningdaemon[m]> OK. I should use it more often. Thx
19:46:12 <Knull[m]> blockada offers the DNS stuff but idk about their VPN.. Seems the only option to route traffic of any kind is to use Android's VPN function. So 1 app at a time can control that. So you'd need something like blokada but with a vpn that's more notable plus DNS control all in 1 place. idk anything like that
19:47:54 <alex-resist> burningdaemon[m] Bromite + Orbot is also a possible combination
19:49:08 <burningdaemon[m]> Ok
19:49:18 <burningdaemon[m]> I will try it out
19:49:48 <Knull[m]> for browser, yeah. Phone-wide though..
19:50:53 <alex-resist> For better anonymity, you should make sure that Orbot uses different circuits for different target addresses. You can do that in Orbot's settings, idk why it's not enabled by default.
20:00:35 <strcat[m]> esmspwdcesmrcbttbcobosldtsbaeige: there are multiple ways that it defends against brute force attacks, suggest reading past discussions / posts
20:16:49 <alex-resist> Is there any way Orbot could be used as a full-device VPN but with captive portals still working?
20:17:11 <burningdaemon[m]> <alex-resist "For better anonymity, you should"> Oh man. Thank you. That makes it even more anonymously.
20:21:15 <alex-resist> Perhaps an option could be added: "Allow captive portals to bypass full-device VPN"
20:22:04 <impostoroftheven> <alex-resist "Perhaps an option could be added"> They already afaik
20:22:32 <impostoroftheven> I've tried airport WiFi a couple times with VPN
20:22:33 <alex-resist> No, at least for me it hasn't worked so far
20:22:43 <impostoroftheven> Captive portal does work for me at least
20:22:56 <alex-resist> That's interesting. Is that new with Android 11?
20:23:01 <impostoroftheven> Well that's definitely a good thing
20:23:16 <impostoroftheven> No
20:23:57 <strcat[m]> VPNs can choose to pass through certain traffic
20:24:01 <strcat[m]> like local network traffic
20:24:08 <strcat[m]> and they can choose to implement their own captive portal functionality
20:24:12 <strcat[m]> Orbot doesn't do that stuff
20:24:22 <impostoroftheven> Yeah that's most likely it
20:24:24 <alex-resist> strcat[m] okay, than Orbot is the problem here
20:24:29 <alex-resist> *then
20:25:30 <alex-resist> It would be so nice to have a fully randomized MAC + full-device Orbot, but with captive portals still working. Worry-free public WiFis
20:27:59 <strcat[m]> captive portals working requires it to pass through those connections or implement that itself
20:28:06 <strcat[m]> not much we can do about it
20:28:26 <strcat[m]> it seems like a good thing to me that the VPN is in control of all OS traffic above the low-level stuff
20:28:55 <alex-resist> strcat[m] thx for the explanation. I had hoped the OS could detect captive portal traffic before it passes through the VPN, but it makes sense that a full-device VPN stays a full-device VPN
21:48:42 <madaidan[m]> <alex-resist "For better anonymity, you should"> Can be quite expensive for your device and the network depending on how you use it.

23:48:40 <strcat[m]> we assume people are on Windows 10
23:48:49 <strcat[m]> if you're on an earlier version you won't have curl
23:49:07 <strcat[m]> you could download it manually
23:49:19 <strcat[m]>  * you could download it with your browser or another command
23:49:56 <strcat[m]> we stick to writing instructions for current generation OSes because it's far too complicated and messy otherwise
23:50:53 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to use Invoke-WebRequest instead of curl.exe for Windows before 10
23:51:06 <entry1[m]> I'm on Windows 10 actually
23:51:09 <strcat[m]> but we like using curl in the instructions to match other operating systems and because we're familiar with it
23:51:20 <entry1[m]> Windows 10 pro
23:51:22 <strcat[m]> entry1: should have curl if it's up-to-date then
23:51:34 <strcat[m]> entry1: up-to-date?
23:51:45 <strcat[m]> it was bundled over a year and a half ago in one of the updates
23:51:57 <strcat[m]> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/tar-and-curl-come-to-windows/ was the preview of it before it was stable
23:52:14 <strcat[m]> Windows 10 version 1803
23:52:14 <strcat[m]> has curl
23:52:22 <strcat[m]> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-information/status-windows-10-1803
23:53:04 <entry1[m]> Let me check real quick, my other computer worked doing it a while back. Got a new phone now and am using an older Windows 10 laptop.
23:53:26 <entry1[m]> Thx for responses in advance
23:54:02 <strcat[m]> probably need to update the laptop
23:54:03 <strcat[m]> and then it will work
23:54:09 <strcat[m]> also a good idea to get fixed USB drivers etc
23:54:28 <strcat[m]> fastboot driver comes from Windows
23:54:31 <entry1[m]> Ah. I'm on v1511 Windows 10 pro
23:55:08 <M0xC0ncord[m]> >1511
23:55:08 <M0xC0ncord[m]> holy crap
23:55:13 <M0xC0ncord[m]>  * >
23:55:13 <M0xC0ncord[m]> 1511
23:55:13 <M0xC0ncord[m]> holy crap
23:55:13 <strcat[m]> Google makes a fastboot driver that's integrated into Windows and Windows keeps it up-to-date
23:55:18 <strcat[m]> well Microsoft may work on it too
23:55:37 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Imagine being 5 years behind on Windows updates
23:55:53 <HagbardCeline[m]> The google toolkit is really pretty good
23:56:08 <entry1[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "Imagine being 5 years behind on "> Lol, just bought this Thinkpad
23:56:09 <strcat[m]> seems like 3 years
23:56:15 <entry1[m]> Didn't even bother checking
23:56:28 <strcat[m]> just needs to be updated a few times
23:56:35 <strcat[m]> probably has to go through multiple major updates
23:56:41 <strcat[m]> dunno if they update directly to latest
23:57:55 <M0xC0ncord[m]> I think Windows 10 these days will install "cumulative rollups" which are basically the feature updates stacked on top of each other
23:57:59 <HagbardCeline[m]> Did I see someone talking about a Bluetooth audio issue?
23:58:14 <entry1[m]> Thx a ton. Worked before on another Win10 computer I installed grapheneos on so that's most likely the issue. Will post a confirmation if it installs correctly so people who have the same issue will know
