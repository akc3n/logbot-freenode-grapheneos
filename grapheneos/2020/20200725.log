00:56:25 <aeonsolution[m]> entry1: they all are, but they need to be unlocked and that is beyond the scope of the project. the only model you should avoid, is buying an unlocked Verizon Pixel 3a

01:31:18 <switchdominion[m> Just finished installing GOS on my Pixel 4. Given the information I've been seeing recently of faults with F-Droid, does anyone here have other package managers / app stores to recommend? I saw someone mentioned Aurora.
01:35:32 <LinusArchTips[m]> Aurora Droid is nice, gives you the option to use many non F-droid repositories
01:35:33 <switchdominion[m> entry1:  I would use the F-Droid app for some package management on my previous device. I only used the website to download the F-Droid apk.
01:44:03 <switchdominion[m> entry1: My understanding is that they aren't very timely in publishing updates for apps in the store and have apps that are targeted for old versions of Android but can still be installed on a device that has newer software which can be a security risk. Is that different on the website? I would find that a bit odd.
02:37:24 <izymandias[m]> I have a question guys...What the hell is a Windows secure core PC?
02:37:58 <renlord> izymandias[m]: have you read the microsoft marketing material?
02:38:24 <renlord> the laptops sold under this branding goes thru a vigorous certification program with Microsoft
02:39:04 <izymandias[m]> renlord: is it just laptops?
02:39:21 <renlord> izymandias[m]: yep, just laptops only
02:39:46 <izymandias[m]> will this be coming to PC's?
02:39:57 <renlord> izymandias[m]: no and my guess is that it would be impossible
02:40:26 <renlord> unless you happy to buy integrated builds with PCs
02:40:31 <aeonsolution[m]> hey renlord, are you helping with the kernel patches for Android 11 by any chance
02:40:38 <renlord> aeonsolution[m]: no
02:40:45 <aeonsolution[m]> kk thanks
02:42:38 <renlord> anyone know if there are actually apps that break if sensors permission was revoked?
02:42:42 <renlord> besides google maps
02:42:53 <renlord> or other maps that provide navigational assitance.
02:45:47 <izymandias[m]> renlord: will it be coming to PC's?
02:45:54 <renlord> izymandias[m]: no
02:46:02 <renlord> never desktop PCs
02:46:08 <renlord> not in its current state/form
02:46:43 <renlord> could possibly come to those dell workstations, but definitely not enthusiast builds
02:46:47 <izymandias[m]> renlord: are they going to get more secure?
02:47:21 <renlord> izymandias[m]: i dont want to speculate on desktop pc security and it is offtopic in this channel
02:47:41 <renlord> lets end on the fact that is less secure than mobile OSes
02:48:06 <izymandias[m]> renlord: that sucks
02:48:26 <renlord> it is hard to secure flexibility.
02:48:43 <grindlefang[m]> Hello, I have previously been able to build Vanadium and GrapheneOS many times successfully but it appears for the last 1-2 weeks the Vanadium build is broken. I came here last week and was told the Vanadium build was broken but it's a problem with upstream. Today strcat told me Vanadium build is not broken and hasn't been.
02:48:55 <grindlefang[m]> I'm compiling with python 2.7.13 as it was suggested to make sure its python 2 . After running "ninja -C out/Default/ trichrome_webview_64_32_apk trichrome_chrome_64_32_bundle trichrome_library_64_32_apk " it gets to step 78838/82828... then crashes:

02:49:36 <izymandias[m]> renlord: another question. Is the game valorant safe to play?
02:49:45 <renlord> izymandias[m]: dont know
02:50:06 <faxing[m]> <izymandias[m] "renlord: another question. Is th"> No, their anticheat is basically glorified spyware
02:50:20 <renlord> TIL ^
02:50:25 <renlord> lulz
02:50:41 <faxing[m]> It also broke a ton of people's computers because of how deeply embedded it is into the system and it had a few problems
02:50:43 <renlord> i dont know how else can anticheat works besides spying on you
02:50:59 <izymandias[m]> faxing: is it different from other epics and steams anticheat?
02:51:13 <grindlefang[m]> renlord I tried to take a look at build changes to Vanadium or the grapheneos build page but it didn't seem there was anything major and I am following the build guide commands
02:51:23 <faxing[m]> Anonymously collecting open processes and comparing them and their function to a list of known cheat software without keeping logs
02:51:37 <faxing[m]> That's how you build an anticheat that doesn't spy on you
02:51:52 <renlord> fuck this matrix bridge
02:53:02 <grindlefang[m]> strcat: take a look at my above messages about Vanadium build problems when you have a chance cheers
02:53:09 <faxing[m]> <izymandias[m] "faxing: is it different from oth"> VAC is complicated and not something I'm familiar enough with, though from my knowledge it is much less invasive. Epic doesn't really have an antichat per say, but they do use EAC (Easy Anti Cheat) for their games like Fortnite
02:53:21 <aeonsolution[m]> grindlefang: there isn't any problems with Vanadium builds
02:53:23 <renlord> grindlefang[m]: what are your gn args configs
02:53:34 <grindlefang[m]> Sure all post my args.gn one sec
02:53:40 <grindlefang[m]> I'll*

02:54:25 <aeonsolution[m]> post the errors in the chat and let us help you out, no need to ping strcat for things the chat can help with
02:56:16 <grindlefang[m]> I did post the error in chat
02:56:18 <grindlefang[m]> https://pastebin.com/1hewxrqU
02:56:21 <izymandias[m]> faxing: so Epic games' anticheat is spyware too?
02:57:24 <grindlefang[m]> I changed enable_reporting = false
02:57:34 <renlord> pls take the anticheat discussion offline
02:57:37 <renlord> it is off-topic
02:57:49 <grindlefang[m]> Because I saw the comment in Vanadium args.gn about the build being broken and it was breaking with a different error before
02:58:56 <grindlefang[m]> I'm building on ubuntu . I can still build GrapheneOS just not Vanadium since a couple weeks ago
02:59:31 <aeonsolution[m]> you're probably missing dependencies that aren't listed in the building instructions
02:59:38 <aeonsolution[m]> can you show the error you're getting
02:59:48 <grindlefang[m]> https://pastebin.com/mfxu10vV
03:00:40 <grindlefang[m]> Just to clarify... changing "enable_reporting = false" was a good move right? I can change it back and build again to show you the other error it was giving me when it was set to true, if that helps
03:01:12 <aeonsolution[m]> either or should work, what is breaking ninja is probably missing dependencies
03:01:41 <renlord> grindlefang[m]: when you changed enable_repoting = false
03:01:55 <renlord> did some stuff rebuild?
03:02:01 <renlord> or it proceeded to link anyways?
03:02:22 <renlord> have you tried a clean build again when you changed
03:02:53 <grindlefang[m]> I just did a clean build no . Setup a fresh environment, synced the code from scratch, and built from scratch with enable_reporting = false
03:02:59 <grindlefang[m]> now*
03:03:38 <izymandias[m]> faxing: valorant isnt on epic games. Its riot games
03:04:23 <grindlefang[m]> What OS / environments are you guys building on ?
03:05:15 <overheadscallop[> Ubuntu 20.04
03:05:20 <overheadscallop[> no problems
03:05:25 <grindlefang[m]> I just don't understand why a dependency issue would cause that specific error in the Chromium source to manifest itself
03:05:43 <aeonsolution[m]> ninja uses python
03:05:51 <grindlefang[m]> <overheadscallop[ "Ubuntu 20.04"> you're building vanadium from source?
03:06:31 <overheadscallop[> yes, clean build syncing to latest stable 84.0.4147.89

03:09:56 <faxing[m]> I'm aware that it's on Riot Games
03:11:02 <aeonsolution[m]> grindlefang: can you try starting over, i'll be here if you have questions
03:11:10 <izymandias[m]> faxing: sorry just confused. are you saying epic games' anticheat is spyware like valorants?
03:11:30 <renlord> izymandias[m]: faxing[m]: pls take it offline
03:11:35 <renlord> ffs
03:13:24 <grindlefang[m]> Sure.. I'm going to try on debian buster
03:13:29 <grindlefang[m]> is running
03:13:31 <grindlefang[m]> build/install-build-deps-android.sh
03:13:31 <grindlefang[m]> gclient runhooks
03:13:50 <grindlefang[m]> Still necessary to install chromium build dependencies? I've been doign that and it seems to be working fine but wondering if that could be interfering with things
03:14:33 <aeonsolution[m]> yes, some of those tools are used to complete the build
03:14:48 <aeonsolution[m]> its just safer to have it even if its not all used
03:14:56 <grindlefang[m]> Ok
03:15:00 <aeonsolution[m]> because figuring out whats missing wastes so much time
03:16:11 <grindlefang[m]> it would be amazing if there was a grapheneos dockerfile. I think that could seriously help development
03:16:31 <grindlefang[m]> Anyways thanks for your help so far guys I'll tinker around and let you know if I have any other questions
03:19:02 <grindlefang[m]> One last question: is deleting the out/ directory enough for a new clean Vanadium build? Don't want to have to delete the whole src dir and download the source again
03:19:31 <aeonsolution[m]> just delete the out/Default if your ninja build added stuff in there
03:19:35 <aeonsolution[m]> everything else can stay
03:19:55 <grindlefang[m]> Cool, thanks
03:20:24 <aeonsolution[m]> you didn't edit any other files or directs under src/ right?
03:20:38 <grindlefang[m]> Nope
03:20:38 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] you didn't edit any other files or directories under src/ right?

03:34:44 <grindlefang[m]> renlord: are you able to post it? It could be helpful in setting up a build env for devs or sorting out dependencies issues like mine
03:39:50 <renlord> im testing the latest version for vanadium
03:39:54 <renlord> are you still having issues
03:41:23 <grindlefang[m]> Yeah just doing another build now on debian buster
03:42:40 <faxing[m]> <izymandias[m] "faxing: sorry just confused. are"> Epic Games doesn't really have an anticheat like I said. It's just that their top games (i.e. Fortnite) use EasyAntiCheat (EAC), but that is not "Epic Games' Anticheat" as much as it is just an anticheat that they make use of for some of their more popular titles
03:43:06 <faxing[m]> Also it's still very invasive but not to the extent of Valorant's
03:43:16 <renlord> zzz
03:44:19 <renlord> 3-strikes, you have been asked to cease offtopic discussions.
03:52:11 <cn3m[m]> faxing: stop talking about anti cheat man
03:52:16 <cn3m[m]> it's off topic you got told
03:53:43 <switchdominion[m> faxing: Just private message or take it to #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org

04:03:06 <izymandias[m]> faxing: thanks for responding anyway. i didnt know either
04:04:15 <izymandias[m]> how comes graphene doesnt use Face ID? is it lacking the camera or is Face ID insecure?
04:04:52 <aeonsolution[m]> izymandias: we need more developers to work on these features, please feel to help out
04:06:28 <cn3m[m]> <izymandias[m] "how comes graphene doesnt use Fa"> you mean it is not working on your Pixel 4?
04:07:00 <switchdominion[m> With regards to US law, Face ID and fingerprinting is insecure as those can be subpoenaed, to the best of my knowledge.
04:08:10 <cn3m[m]> <switchdominion[m "With regards to US law, Face ID "> on the other hand bio-metrics pretty much kill shoulder surfing and
04:08:23 <switchdominion[m> From what I've read about Face ID and facial recognition software in general, there are false positives that could allow someone to access your device.
04:09:33 <izymandias[m]> switchdominion: Oooo I see. so the technology itself isnt insecure, its just that the government can force you to unlock your device with your face
04:10:02 <switchdominion[m> <cn3m[m] "on the other hand bio-metrics pr"> Agreed. It all depends on which attack vectors an individual is most susceptible.
04:10:33 <cn3m[m]> yeah face is especially strong(with require attention)
04:10:58 <cn3m[m]> since someone can't do it when you are sleeping
04:11:55 <switchdominion[m> <izymandias[m] "switchdominion: Oooo I see. so t"> With fingerprinting, yes. But when I tested out Face ID, which was years ago, granted, I was able to access another persons device using my face.

04:13:52 <switchdominion[m> <izymandias[m] "switchdominion: o really. was th"> It was on Android. LG Stylo 2 or 3, if I recall correctly.
04:14:19 <switchdominion[m> Granted, my experience and research with Face ID is likely outdated.
04:14:33 <cn3m[m]> Yeah FaceID is far far stronger
04:14:37 <cn3m[m]> and Pixel 4 got a great patch
04:14:45 <cn3m[m]> I think it is just as good now
04:15:03 <renlord> does it work with a mask on?
04:15:04 <renlord> hehe
04:15:21 <izymandias[m]> does the Pixel 4's match IOS's ?
04:16:10 <switchdominion[m> <cn3m[m] "Yeah FaceID is far far stronger"> That's good. Though I would still warn those in certain countries that allow a subpoena, such as the US, for biometrics to use them based on their need.
04:16:14 <izymandias[m]> is it the same tech. infrared?
04:17:39 <cn3m[m]> izymandias: Yeah, iirc you can even use the infrared camera for photos
04:18:11 <nickcalyx[m]> at the data center where I have my servers, I have to do finger print and then later face scanning, as well as rfid, and talk to a person, then rfid again and rfid a third time and then a combination lock
04:18:29 <nickcalyx[m]> its quite the security theater
04:18:49 <cn3m[m]> Trusted Face in Android is not nearly as good
04:18:58 <nickcalyx[m]> oh and I understand they now put another rfid check in the elevator, so it will be 4 rfid checks
04:18:59 <cn3m[m]> nickcalyx: xD

04:27:09 <cn3m[m]> :)
04:27:37 <cn3m[m]> biometrics have some notable advantages
04:27:44 <Knull[m]> If face scan unlocked a pin screen that you still need to enter,  great. Face alone, no

04:29:33 <Knull[m]> Or have a complex enough password that a simple shoulder surf cant remember
04:29:46 <cn3m[m]> could be recorded
04:29:56 <switchdominion[m> <cn3m[m] "https://www.reddit.com/r/Graphen"> I read a bit of that earlier and I'll take a closer look now. Mostly I was wondering what you meant by Face ID and/or biometrics being "stored fuzzed in the Titan or SEP."
04:31:57 <Knull[m]> Recorded though? Probably a little outside most ppl's threat models
04:32:03 <renlord> grindlefang[m]: i have no issues building

04:34:33 <cn3m[m]> Anything iPhone/Pixel Finger/Face is good
04:35:24 <Knull[m]> That's great, paired with a pin/ password
04:36:26 <Knull[m]> In the two -factor model, even if recorded, they need your finger
04:36:57 <cn3m[m]> it is very easy to lockdown the device to not accept biometrics
04:36:57 <grindlefang[m]> I just tried on debian buster again and its failing at the same spot complainging about CrossOriginEmbedderPolicyReporter
04:37:06 <cn3m[m]> I think the advantages outweigh the drawbacks
04:37:09 <cn3m[m]> they time out too
04:37:15 <Knull[m]> And the other way around.. maybe they got ur cold dead finger, but dont know your pin
04:37:21 <cn3m[m]> Pixel is 48 hours for example
04:37:34 <cn3m[m]> to fake biometrics it could take a while

04:40:09 <renlord> grindlefang[m]: you might just want to reclone depot tools
04:40:13 <renlord> and try again
04:40:31 <renlord> between my old chromium build and this most recent one, depot_tools was completely broken
04:40:32 <cn3m[m]> I would recommend biometrics for most people. My password has been recorded a few times thinking back
04:40:34 <grindlefang[m]> Also that ubuntu 18 only ubuntu 20 is officially supported? I just tried from  debian stretch and buster but no go... which is supposed to be officially supported. I'll try from ubuntu 18.04 now like the dockerfile
04:40:45 <Knull[m]> Maybe something that will come unique to graphene
04:41:00 <grindlefang[m]> I'm doing a clean build everytimerenlord:
04:41:12 <renlord> depot_tools is separate

04:42:06 <cn3m[m]> Just lockdown your phone or ideally reboot
04:42:07 <cn3m[m]> it is qucik
04:42:19 <cn3m[m]> do it before bed and in any situation you might have your phone taken
04:42:51 <Knull[m]> No fingerprint reader on 4xl it seems though 😕
04:42:55 <grindlefang[m]> cn3m: that is a very bad recommendation. fingerprints do not have anywhere near the same level of security or legal rights as a password. You can clone artifical fingers that bypass fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos of a hand
04:43:25 <cn3m[m]> <grindlefang[m] "cn3m: that is a very bad recomme"> I said facial recognition. Fingerprinting is legacy tech at this point
04:43:42 <grindlefang[m]> ok just replace fingerprints with biometrics what i said still stands
04:43:49 <cn3m[m]> fingerprint you can still lock out and it is very effective against recording or shoulder surfing
04:43:55 <izymandias[m]> I've seen videos of people recording their interaction with police only for their phones to be snatched out of their hands suddenly. Then i wonder how many were actually snatched and the footage deleted. if graphene had a feature that could use video recording while the phone was in lock or is put lock once the phone is snatched would be awesome.
04:44:06 <cn3m[m]> <grindlefang[m] "ok just replace fingerprints wit"> someone has to do it before the time out
04:44:11 <cn3m[m]> that is some serious commitment

04:45:10 <grindlefang[m]> not really... in most emergency or high-stress situations people are often on their phones to call for help or let their loved ones know what is going on
04:45:20 <grindlefang[m]> you're basing your security on the hope your timer runs out... seems risky
04:45:43 <cn3m[m]> Well they could just wait for an AFU exploit and see how long they can keep your phone alive
04:46:05 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS and iOS both have very robust protections against this, but not perfect ofc

04:51:14 <cn3m[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "yeah rip no facial recog on 3a"> unfortunately 4a looks like it won't since holepunch
04:51:27 <izymandias[m]> Knull: dont think you would even need a physical button. maybe have a mode in the camera that requires you to have your finger on the record button and is locked once released. and have a feature that allows you to start recording again if you were to accidently release the finger from the screen. dont know how it would be done

04:58:07 <switchdominion[m> The top prize is for a “full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence” of the dedicated security chip. On top of that, there’s an additional 50 percent bonus if a security researcher is able to find an exploit on specific developer preview versions of Android, resulting in a potential prize of $1.5 million.
04:58:15 <cn3m[m]> renlord: I rather take the $250k
04:58:21 <renlord> the one i recall is not zerodium though

04:59:17 <cn3m[m]> to think so few people actually have a phone you need a zero day for
05:03:08 <cn3m[m]> Any iPhone in the last 7 years, Samsung Galaxy S series for the past 3 years(the 4th doesn't count as it is quarterlies), Any Pixel in the past 3 years. Not even a quarter of phones
05:11:16 <aeonsolution[m]> does anyone know the reasoning behind migrating the kernel patches to R-Preview-4 instead of R-Beta-2?
05:35:48 <aeonsolution[m]> i got the answer everyone, thank you for reading my gripes lol
05:38:00 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "i got the answer everyone, thank"> What is the answer if you don't mind?
05:40:51 <aeonsolution[m]> since the commits can be rebased using git, it is not as important where you start because you can add missing commits later
05:41:34 <aeonsolution[m]> but its not an excuse to be sloppy either
05:42:33 <aeonsolution[m]> the order of the commits still need to make sense
06:32:34 <grindlefang[m]> renlord: do you have the full list of commands you're using for Vanadium? The build guide is a little ambiguous . I'm still getting the same error. Just to clarify as well... enable_reporting = true ? Because that is not mentioned in build guide but seems to be a necessary temporary workaround

08:32:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even LDAC for some of my files hardly comes close
08:33:25 <ojkuiyln> but do you keep charging those old jack headsets or just don't use noise canceling?
08:34:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have a phone that still does analog
08:34:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Noise cancelling not so much
08:58:03 <cdesai> grindlefang[m]: yeah you need to enable reporting check the vanadium args.gn
08:58:19 <cdesai> Need to file an upstream bug about this and check on master
09:50:45 <marlow11[m]> I'm having an issue with the camera. Most of the time the button is greyed out and it won't take a picture. I can eventually take one if I close the app and reopen a bunch of times. Then sometimes I'll press the button and it will take up to 10 seconds to actually take the picture. Is this a known issue? I'm pretty sure it just started recently
11:04:28 <testingtesting12> Does anyone have experience using WhatsApp on GrapheneOS? I know it works, just wondering about notifications though
11:05:15 <testingtesting12> Reading some conflicting information. Some say you don't get notifications, some they're iffy and some say you do
11:43:13 <renlord> grindlefang[m]: following the build guide verbatim is sufficient
11:43:24 <renlord> with the docker image
11:44:11 <renlord> didnt need `enable_reporting = true`, mine was set to false
11:44:38 <renlord> and enable_remoting = false too
11:50:07 <rickza[m]> Good day all, could anybody give me some assistance in sorting out my remote verification ? I keep on getting emails stating that the attestation has failed

12:26:46 <dreth[m]> <testingtesting12 "Does anyone have experience usin"> The only thing you dont get is google drive backups but you probably don't want those if youre considering installing grapheneos because theyre not encrypted.

13:44:13 <justchill[m]> <dreth[m] "The only thing you dont get is g"> Don't the notifications on Whatsapp use Google's push notifications service?
13:45:43 <justchill[m]> I did see https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_openpush/ recently but I don't know the current status of the project.
13:52:13 <LinusSexTips[m]> I have WhatsApp in a separate user profile
13:52:36 <LinusSexTips[m]> And I still get notifications despite just getting it from the Aurora Atore.
13:52:45 <LinusSexTips[m]> * And I still get notifications despite just getting it from the Aurora Store
15:54:39 <grindlefang[m]> renlord: I'm not sure what you're building from then, the default args.gn has enable_reporting = true https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/10/args.gn#L27 t . I have built with enable_reporting = false and It's giving me the same error.
15:55:58 <grindlefang[m]> I'm following the vanadium build guide and chromium build guide verbatim and it's not working, I've tried on debian stretch, debian buster and ubuntu 18. Seems strange also it only suddenly happened about 1-2 weeks ago. I'll keep investigating...
15:57:03 <grindlefang[m]> The fact it is complaining about the same lines every time seems a little weird too.

15:59:16 <steve9> nick demonMachina
16:01:04 <demonmachina[m]> Close....Jake.
16:04:07 <grindlefang[m]> The grapheneos vanadium build instructions are really ambiguous as well.. it just links to chroimiums android build instructions for fetching dependencies, telling you to get dependecies before syncing.. but the chromium page says you should sync before fetching dependencies
16:06:42 <grindlefang[m]> renlord: your dockerfile had a lot of unnecessary steps in it as well for example calling install-build-deps.sh before calling install-build-deps-android.sh even tho install-build-deps-android.sh calls install-build-deps, and apt installing the same packages multiple times. However I'll try to use that as a base for an environment and hopefully I can guess the right commands needed to build Vanadium
16:14:09 <aeonsolution[m]> <grindlefang[m] "The grapheneos vanadium build in"> Vanadium is just Chromium with hardening patches, strcat adapted the build rules for Vanadium development. In general, external links are for reference material. Not for steps to follow as part of the install.
16:15:46 <aeonsolution[m]> There are a lot of steps it so it does feel overwhelming at first but I can gurantee you the steps there will help you succesfully build Vanadium.
16:17:35 <aeonsolution[m]> Anything from the Chromium page is just for reference. If you want to dive into that and see how it relates to how Vanadium gets built for GrapheneOS, you should definitely jump in. It'll definitely help you with development.
16:18:35 <interceptingfist> Why is my terminal sayingfastboot is too old?
16:19:04 <aeonsolution[m]> What instructions did you follow interceptingfist?
16:19:07 <interceptingfist> I'm on 30.0.3
16:19:26 <interceptingfist> Hated one
16:19:43 <interceptingfist> But he didn't explain the flash all part
16:19:59 <interceptingfist> He only mentioned how to flash all on windows
16:20:26 <aeonsolution[m]> As a general rule, don't use instructions that aren't from the Official Website <https://grapheneos.org/>.
16:20:43 <interceptingfist> I'm also using thosr
16:20:55 <interceptingfist> They are already pulled up
16:21:35 <aeonsolution[m]> Right, but if someone else gives you directions that don't verbatim stick to these instructions. You'll get that error.
16:21:53 <grindlefang[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "Vanadium is just Chromium with h"> I have built Vanadium many many times. It's not that the instructions are overwhelming.. .it's that they are incomplete and ambiguous
16:22:03 <interceptingfist> No,sometimes it's easier to see the process
16:22:05 <aeonsolution[m]> interceptingfist: https://freenode.logbot.info/?ch=grapheneos&q=fastboot
16:23:57 <aeonsolution[m]> In the logs, you'll see that error you get is always from people watching videos.
16:24:01 <grindlefang[m]> renlord: Judging from what you said about enable_reporting seems you are building from QQ3A.200705.002.2020.07.06.20 and not the 10 branch which is the latest
16:24:07 <grindlefang[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/QQ3A.200705.002.2020.07.06.20/args.gn
16:24:21 <aeonsolution[m]> Let's try to figure it outinterceptingfist. Close all your windows, and start from step 1.
16:24:24 <grindlefang[m]> You can see this is the previous version of chromium "83.0.4103.106" which was also building fine for me
16:24:29 <aeonsolution[m]> We'll narrow down the issue from there.
16:25:25 <grindlefang[m]> I can see also there is a lot of active development under the 10 branch in the last week that is not in the tagged version
16:25:31 <aeonsolution[m]> grindlefang: the issue are the packages with Ubuntu not so much that the instructions
16:25:55 <aeonsolution[m]> if you have successfully built Vanadium and have suggestions to improve the install process, please make a pull request
16:26:00 <grindlefang[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "grindlefang: the issue are the p"> Yeah.. I have built on debian buster, sid and ubuntu and all are giving the same error. I used the same dependencies mentioned
16:26:12 <grindlefang[m]> I am, the build is broken
16:26:21 <aeonsolution[m]> we don't have enough people building Vanadium on Ubuntu and Debian to lend their insight
16:26:35 <aeonsolution[m]> most of us use Arch based OSes
16:26:43 <grindlefang[m]> Ubuntu and Debian are supposed to be officially supported
16:26:50 <grindlefang[m]> Arch is not
16:27:22 <aeonsolution[m]> Arch gives us the packages to avoid the problems you are having with dependencies
16:27:48 <grindlefang[m]> Well then looks like the build instructions are incorrect
16:28:00 <grindlefang[m]> If they say to use debian and ubuntu not arch
16:28:11 <aeonsolution[m]> who is they?
16:28:26 <grindlefang[m]> The build instructions friend
16:28:27 <grindlefang[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies
16:29:06 <aeonsolution[m]> Arch is the first one
16:29:19 <aeonsolution[m]> ?
16:29:25 <grindlefang[m]> Right, and ubuntu and debian are next
16:29:34 <aeonsolution[m]> the devs that work on GOS and Vanadium use Arch
16:29:50 <aeonsolution[m]> if you have suggestions to improve Ubuntu and Debian development
16:29:55 <aeonsolution[m]> please create a pull request
16:30:09 <grindlefang[m]> It doesn't build on officially supported environment and builds, I would suggest that is a problem with your build instructions not the developer ;)
16:30:41 <aeonsolution[m]> Debian and Ubuntu are supported by Google to do Android testing
16:30:52 <aeonsolution[m]> and development
16:31:00 <grindlefang[m]> I will setup a new environment in arch to build Vanadium and GrapheneOS, altho AOSP does not support arch
16:31:40 <dazinism> switchdominion: entry1 for apps and appstores (and even app repos) have a look at https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
16:31:49 <aeonsolution[m]> you need to figure out the dependencies to build Vanadium and if you have suggestions to improve the process please make a pull request
16:32:07 <interceptingfist> Nothing mentions the error that see
16:32:19 <interceptingfist> Thanks though
16:32:34 <grindlefang[m]> Also.. I am starting to doubt it's a dependency issue as there are no complaints when installing the dependencies and it manages to get 95% build complete and complains about the same CrossOrigin error on all 3 OSes
16:32:48 <interceptingfist> If only grapheme could make a install video

16:35:14 <LinusSexTips[m]> I found one that worked perfectly for me
16:35:19 <LinusSexTips[m]> Using Ubuntu
16:35:35 <grindlefang[m]> Well that's a little dismissive, like I said your build guide is broken and I have "figured it out" many many times before with identical set of commands that built Vanadium. The 10 branch is broken and significantly different than the QQ3A.200705 version of Vanadium
16:35:44 <interceptingfist> Linux pop
16:36:07 <interceptingfist> I'm platform tools was downloaded from google lmao
16:36:17 <interceptingfist> It's not out of date
16:36:29 <interceptingfist> I also have a windows machine going to try it
16:37:03 <LinusSexTips[m]> https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=oO0UFZjuotg
16:37:07 <LinusSexTips[m]> That's what I used
16:37:18 <LinusSexTips[m]> Should be fine on Pop!_OS
16:38:18 <aeonsolution[m]> grindlefang: I can't help diagnose and issue on a distro, I don't use. The advice I am offering is based on my previous experiences building Vanadium. I was trying to led you to that understanding. I'm not being dismissive.
16:39:21 <aeonsolution[m]> interceptingfist: did you set up your environment variables correctly?
16:39:53 <aeonsolution[m]> if you close powershell, the path to fastboot gets lost
16:41:56 <interceptingfist> I don't think I closed it
16:42:17 <aeonsolution[m]> what command step are you on?
16:43:26 <interceptingfist> Where you do flash all
16:44:07 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, lets start from the beginning, let me pull the instructions
16:44:16 <aeonsolution[m]> open a new powershell window
16:45:04 <interceptingfist> Terminal is new
16:45:26 <interceptingfist> I'm on 3a
16:46:17 <aeonsolution[m]> `cd .\Downloads\`
16:46:52 <aeonsolution[m]> after that run the curl command
16:47:19 <aeonsolution[m]> for windows
16:47:36 <aeonsolution[m]> i know we are doing it all over, but its to help find the issue
16:47:46 <aeonsolution[m]> working backwards from the last step doesn't always work
16:48:31 <aeonsolution[m]> because i don't know what changes accidentally/intentionally were made

16:51:23 <interceptingfist> Ok
16:52:03 <aeonsolution[m]> cool when that is done
16:52:48 <aeonsolution[m]> we need to set the path the platform-tools so run `$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"` afterwards
16:54:13 <aeonsolution[m]> then run `fastboot --version afterwards` to check if your path is set to fastboot
16:54:33 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] then run `fastboot --version afterwards` to check if your path is set to find fastboot
16:57:55 <aeonsolution[m]> if your phone is OEM unlocked, you can then unlock the bootloader
16:58:14 <aeonsolution[m]> by running: `fastboot flashing unlock`
16:58:22 <aeonsolution[m]> using the same powershell window
16:58:46 <aeonsolution[m]> make sure you are booted in the bootlader
16:59:11 <interceptingfist> Ok
16:59:22 <aeonsolution[m]> since you already downloaded the images
16:59:23 <interceptingfist> I'm step by stepping the instructions for linux
16:59:38 <aeonsolution[m]> ?
16:59:42 <aeonsolution[m]> aren't you on window
17:00:06 <interceptingfist>  I'm trying to get either one to flash
17:01:00 <aeonsolution[m]> thats a really important detail to leave out
17:02:11 <interceptingfist> Well neither does anything for the flash part
17:02:12 <aeonsolution[m]> leaving your shell or powershell untouched
17:02:26 <aeonsolution[m]> please move the factory images
17:02:27 <interceptingfist> I'm on the Linux right now 1 minute left on the dl
17:02:54 <aeonsolution[m]> oh ok, you are downloading the images again
17:03:17 <aeonsolution[m]> are you using a USB A to USB C cable?
17:08:14 <interceptingfist> C
17:08:26 <interceptingfist> Yea a to c
17:09:06 <aeonsolution[m]> nice, did you download and unzip the images already
17:09:21 <interceptingfist> Unzipping
17:09:34 <interceptingfist> Yep
17:10:08 <interceptingfist> All that's left is flash command
17:10:17 <aeonsolution[m]> cool run `./flash-all.sh` afterwards, make sure the phone is plugged in and that you are in the bootloader still
17:11:06 <aeonsolution[m]> use the USB port closest to the motherboard
17:11:54 <interceptingfist> No such  fi
17:14:02 <aeonsolution[m]> is it flashing?
17:16:07 <interceptingfist> No
17:16:12 <interceptingfist> And this riot froze up on me lol
17:16:45 <aeonsolution[m]> nice
17:16:54 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, what are you trying to do now
17:17:43 <interceptingfist> Trying to make sure its all connected
17:17:58 <interceptingfist> And just try one more time I guess
17:18:18 <aeonsolution[m]> you changed the directory to the sargo right
17:18:31 <interceptingfist> Ya
17:18:51 <aeonsolution[m]> kk
17:19:16 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah run the flash script
17:19:18 <aeonsolution[m]> hopefully now you dont get fastboot error
17:19:22 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting
17:19:38 <aeonsolution[m]> Here's this for if you get other common errors related to Linux
17:25:04 <aeonsolution[m]> if you close the shell, your path gets reset so the fastboot commands wont work until you update your path again just fyi
17:27:06 <interceptingfist> Redownloading it
17:27:17 <interceptingfist> When I do export path it doesn't show anything
17:28:45 <aeonsolution[m]> why did you run export path again?
17:29:04 <aeonsolution[m]> do you still have the shell we used for the initial steps active?
17:34:16 <aeonsolution[m]> if you do, use that shell to run the commands
17:34:35 <aeonsolution[m]> the steps are setup in a way where you can do everything in one shell
17:34:50 <aeonsolution[m]> if you use different shells, the paths will not match up
17:35:00 <interceptingfist> I'm started over from scratch
17:35:13 <aeonsolution[m]> kk
17:35:14 <aeonsolution[m]> you're almost there
17:35:22 <aeonsolution[m]> i think we figured out that issue
17:35:39 <aeonsolution[m]> fastboot problems are usually path problems
17:35:51 <aeonsolution[m]> or downloading third part stuff not in the instructions
17:36:00 <aeonsolution[m]> party*
17:36:29 <interceptingfist> It still says nonsuch directoru
17:36:47 <interceptingfist> No such directory
17:37:42 <interceptingfist> I don't understand why it fails to try to flash
17:39:49 <aeonsolution[m]> lets do this
17:39:57 <aeonsolution[m]> cd $HOME/Downloads
17:40:07 <aeonsolution[m]> then run ls
17:40:39 <aeonsolution[m]> you should see platform-tools and the factory-images(unzipped) and the factory-images(zipped)
17:41:42 <aeonsolution[m]> if you don't then you had the paths wrongs when you switched to Linux without mentioning it to me
17:42:27 <aeonsolution[m]> if you do see all this
17:42:42 <aeonsolution[m]> use the fastboot --version command
17:42:56 <aeonsolution[m]> and see if you path is still up to date
17:42:58 <aeonsolution[m]> if it is not
17:43:27 <aeonsolution[m]> run `export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"`
17:43:35 <aeonsolution[m]> and the try fastboot again
17:44:00 <aeonsolution[m]> if you get the correct version as a response
17:44:07 <aeonsolution[m]> now change into the unzipped directory
17:44:14 <aeonsolution[m]> and run ls
17:44:45 <aeonsolution[m]> you should see the flash-all scripts
17:45:52 <aeonsolution[m]> if you directories you move into should be the sargo one
17:45:58 <aeonsolution[m]> not the one in the examples on the website
17:46:51 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] the directory you move into should be the sargo one for the pixel 3a
17:47:47 <interceptingfist> <aeonsolution[m] "cd $HOME/Downloads"> Nothing happens
17:48:14 <interceptingfist> Nvm
17:48:22 <interceptingfist> I hit wrong letter
17:49:18 <aeonsolution[m]> progress is progress, you are almost there
17:50:41 <interceptingfist> I'm on downloads directory bit its waiting forna command
17:50:59 <interceptingfist> Its not showing me anything after downloads
17:54:11 * interceptingfist uploaded an image: IMG_20200725_135342.jpg (2292KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/KRhOKGqyYpilgEUoxPRqDOHO >
18:15:51 <aeonsolution[m]> thats because the files didnt get downloaded there
18:16:00 <aeonsolution[m]> you downloaded them somewhere else
18:16:40 <aeonsolution[m]> wait did you run `ls`
18:17:57 <aeonsolution[m]> if there is nothing there
18:18:06 <aeonsolution[m]> you need to do the steps all over again
18:18:19 <aeonsolution[m]> and do all the commands using that shell you are using
18:18:25 <aeonsolution[m]> dont open new ones
18:56:38 <interceptingfist> <LinusSexTips[m] "https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=o"> This video is the way the truth and the life
18:57:55 <interceptingfist> <aeonsolution[m] "thats because the files didnt ge"> Thanks for you help
18:58:39 <aeonsolution[m]> did you get it up and running
19:03:55 <interceptingfist> Yea mann
19:04:05 <interceptingfist> :)
19:04:33 <aeonsolution[m]> awesome, persistence pays off
19:04:43 <interceptingfist> Yea
19:04:56 <interceptingfist> Do you use a VPN?
19:05:51 <aeonsolution[m]> i do, but im not using GOS as a personal phone right now, its just testing and development stuff for now; you can ask the group for specifics on that if you're curious
19:06:22 <aeonsolution[m]> the logs might have gold in there too
19:31:31 <nickcalyx[m]> <interceptingfist "Do you use a VPN?"> if you install f-droid there are a couple of free VPN's.. riseup VPN and calyx VPN
19:38:10 <nickcalyx[m]> some people use orbot as a vpn too, to push traffic over Tor
19:41:41 <nickcalyx[m]> the problem with Tor though is it only handles tcp but not udp
20:16:01 <interceptingfist> <nickcalyx[m] "the problem with Tor though is i"> Thanks
20:35:11 <nickcalyx[m]> Did you know that getting the same app from @fdroidorg instead of Google Play can mean it won't track you?   https://twitter.com/t_grote/status/1279779673128534016
21:01:53 <SchismXL[m]> Right, I've "fixed" the 90hz flickering on my device. I used adb.
21:02:07 <SchismXL[m]> I've basically forced the display to always be at 60hz
21:02:34 <SchismXL[m]> adb shell settings put system peak_refresh_rate 60
21:02:34 <SchismXL[m]> adb shell settings put system min_refresh_rate 60
21:07:55 <SchismXL[m]> I wonder if an app could be made for that? I know nothing about Android development (or any type of dev work for that matter), but it doesn't seem like too much of a "challenge" to make an app that could toggle those settings, using adb? I dunno. Just a thought!
21:09:34 <SchismXL[m]> Rebooted and the adb command is persistent, yay. I can't tell you how much this has made me happy lol
21:10:10 <nickcalyx[m]> I never understood the 90hz thing, it seems silly IMO
21:11:40 <SchismXL[m]> It does look smoother when scrolling through the UI and whatnot, but it isn't a game changer
21:11:48 <SchismXL[m]> Well, maybe for games
21:14:56 <SchismXL[m]> <SchismXL[m] "It does look smoother when scrol"> A little smoother*
21:28:54 <mrsenshi[m]> Good evening.
21:29:03 <mrsenshi[m]> Brilliant project.
21:29:55 <mrsenshi[m]> Might I ask: What difficulties prevent other ROMs from allowing the bootloader to be relocked, as is the case with GrapheneOS?
21:32:01 <mrsenshi[m]> Secondly, if there were to be an implementation rootless theming along the lines of Android 8 (requiring ADB), would this pose any security risk?
21:42:50 <cn3m[m]> <mrsenshi[m] "Might I ask: What difficulties p"> hardware and interest. Pixels and OnePlus(OP has had a rocky history at best) devices support it across the line. Most roms don't support it on Pixels or OP since lack of interest largely due to people wanting to root(which breaks it).
21:43:21 <cn3m[m]> <mrsenshi[m] "Secondly, if there were to be an"> ADB is not recommended for security reasons
22:38:27 <nickcalyx[m]> <SchismXL[m] "It does look smoother when scrol"> It reminds me of that scene in 'this is spinal tap'. . But this one.goes to 11 !!!
22:51:31 <helpimaloser> Hey im trying to install graphenos on my second pixel and i get this error:
22:51:31 <helpimaloser> https://gyazo.com/9a07c61ce0a1a1ab310140e73cb0b7d5
22:51:41 <helpimaloser> I got this error with my first pixel and someone just told a code
22:51:44 <helpimaloser> and it fixed it
22:51:57 <helpimaloser> But i dont know any coding someone who might knows
22:52:02 <helpimaloser> I have the latest fastboot
22:52:43 <overheadscallop[> Are you following the official guide?
22:52:47 <overheadscallop[> and you should be using powershell
22:54:08 <helpimaloser> Mind private messaging me?
22:54:15 <helpimaloser> I'll pay u for helping me out im not that techy
23:19:07 <renlord> helpimaloser: you are not flashing correctly
23:19:57 <renlord> you have not installed fastboot yet
23:40:59 <geckoflip> Sup guys
23:41:27 <geckoflip> Got my first install of graphene on pixel 3 thru
23:42:11 <geckoflip> theres lot under the surface in terms of features but wondering the similarity and lack of interactive privacy features
23:42:23 <geckoflip> similarity to android 10
23:42:59 <geckoflip> and some system apps remainin even though most removed
