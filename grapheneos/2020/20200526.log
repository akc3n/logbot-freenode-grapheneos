01:27:36 <brenneke[m]> OK thanks.
02:28:06 <rwarr627[m]> strcat: can you explain a slot in the context of hardened_malloc?
02:28:47 <strcat[m]> a slot in a slab for a slab allocation
02:28:53 <strcat[m]> which are tracked by bits in the bitmap
02:28:56 <strcat[m]> 1 bit per slot
02:29:16 <strcat[m]> so for example 16 byte allocations are in 4096 byte slabs
02:29:17 <strcat[m]> so that's 256 slots
02:29:31 <strcat[m]> you can see the table showing the size classes with the # of slots and slab sizes
02:29:33 <strcat[m]> in README
02:35:38 <rwarr627[m]> Okay, so is the information stored in the bitmap used to determine an upper bound for an object's size from a pointer?
02:36:06 <rwarr627[m]> Assuming it can be checked to see if it's free or not
02:36:26 <rwarr627[m]> that is, checking each slot in the slab

04:09:48 <gervarouge[m]> <renlord "is there a way to have a secure "> QubesOS
04:10:50 <gervarouge[m]> macOS has reasonable secure keyboard entry for "sensitive" things. Only remotely close thing I can think of.
04:22:43 <joshman[m]> How come Gcam apk is not on Aurora? I thought they are mirroring GPS
04:24:14 <JTL> I assume because the APK is extracted from device images or something?
04:24:18 * JTL shrugs
04:26:47 <cyredanthem[m]> madaidan.: Just tried Firefox with Fission and strict CFG runs great
04:26:48 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm surprised they aren't working harder on this
04:26:53 <cyredanthem[m]> > I assume because the APK is extracted from device images or something?
04:26:53 <cyredanthem[m]> It's on the store
04:27:49 <cyredanthem[m]> All Firefox needs is to fix that media player and Windows could be very secure. I feel like their priorities are off
04:28:47 * joshman[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QwnFCDXNWzWvieObclXZfjXe >
04:32:40 <cyredanthem[m]> shrug idk where
04:34:32 <Arhu> How about FF on macOS? I really like the Temporary Container extension. Chromium profiles and the Self-Destructing Cookies extension don't offer the same level of usability.
05:02:26 <cyredanthem[m]> > How about FF on macOS? I really like the Temporary Container extension. Chromium profiles and the Self-Destructing Cookies extension don't offer the same level of usability.
05:02:26 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox is only anywhere decent on Windows and iOS
05:04:43 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox on Windows is solid if you force strict CFI and turn on Fission. iOS almost all browsers are the same, but Firefox lacks important privacy features
05:05:18 <cyredanthem[m]> However neither are tested to be stable and it still has way too many win32k calls due to the stupid media player
05:20:13 <joshman[m]> Ok. Gcam has no fails whatsoever unlike Open Camera. Pics are def better due to better HDR handling. And above all - I finally have Slowmo camera to catch best moments
05:20:35 <Arhu> Don't you mean it lacks security features? Outside of the security issues, privacy on FF can be quite good, maybe even te best if you configure it properly and with the right extensions
05:20:58 <Arhu> FF for iOS is just a skin for the Safari webview
05:23:00 <yolotrolo[m]> > However neither are tested to be stable and it still has way too many win32k calls due to the stupid media player
05:23:01 <yolotrolo[m]> i'm going to try to setup firefox with remoteapp in windows sandbox, that should be a pretty  solid setup
05:23:39 <yolotrolo[m]> note sure if remoteapp is working in windows sandbox, going to check that
05:24:23 <cyredanthem[m]> > Don't you mean it lacks security features? Outside of the security issues, privacy on FF can be quite good, maybe even te best if you configure it properly and with the right extensions
05:24:23 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox privacy features are far from practical or proper. It spies more than Chrome
05:26:52 <cyredanthem[m]> Arhu: Firefox on macOS can hardly be called a sandbox
05:27:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox: iOS > Windows > Linux > Android > macOS
05:33:40 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox Sandbox Level 3 is lacking "microphone, access to various system services, windowserver, named sysctls and iokit properties, and other miscellaneous items"
05:40:31 <cyredanthem[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Firefox Sandbox Level 3 is lacki"> Protections for*
05:47:09 <renlord[m]> <joshman[m] "Ok. Gcam has no fails whatsoever"> How do you get gcam
05:48:17 <renor> renlord[m]: https://github.com/LumenReaper/Gcam-Services-Provider/releases
05:48:53 <renlord> thanks
05:52:02 <renor> fomijafi[m]: I don't think that it is needed to install in a separate profile as the app itself has no permissions at all... Also you can remove Network permission from Gcam and it still works.
05:55:34 <matic_nick[m]> What do you guys think of this https://spectrum-os.org/
05:56:57 <joshman[m]> Google Fotos app is also confirmed working great with network access disabled
05:57:36 <travankor_> is there a wiki page for apps compatibilty/recommendations/tips?
05:58:25 <cyredanthem[m]> > What do you guys think of this https://spectrum-os.org/
05:58:25 <cyredanthem[m]> Linux based system so probably pretty bad
05:58:33 <cyredanthem[m]> ChromeOS is still suffering from Linux woes security wise
05:58:54 <cyredanthem[m]> Android is doing pretty well, but it's had around 13 years of solid progress
05:59:18 <renlord> joshman[m]: renor do you guys have problems with previewing photos in the app?
05:59:58 <renor> Nope, all working good so far
06:00:06 <renlord> hmm
06:00:12 <renlord> not for me :/

06:01:41 <cyredanthem[m]> <matic_nick[m] "> <@cyredanthem:synapse.travnewm"> matic_nick: Qubes is not hard to use since it's awkward, it's hard to use since it's slow
06:02:07 <renlord> qubes is hard to use and also hard to use correctly
06:02:10 <matic_nick[m]> Trade performance for security?
06:02:23 <renlord> if your opsec is bad inside a templatevm, you are equally screwed
06:02:49 <renlord> one vm per application is also very wasteful
06:02:53 <renor> renlord: where did you get the app?
06:02:59 <renor> The Gcam app
06:03:04 <cyredanthem[m]> matic_nick: the best solution is to use ChromiumOS since it has comprehensive design
06:03:07 <renlord> renor: apkmirror?
06:03:26 <cyredanthem[m]> Qubes the security model is very easy to screw to
06:03:28 <cyredanthem[m]> Up*
06:03:43 <matic_nick[m]> <renlord "one vm per application is also v"> On a decent desktop not so much of an issue I think
06:03:44 <cyredanthem[m]> It's a weird solution of bolting on one really good thing onto a series of terrible things
06:03:58 <renlord> matic_nick[m]: it is a very profound issue
06:04:05 <renlord> even on a decent lapto
06:04:12 <renor> > renor: apkmirror?
06:04:12 <renor> Yes, me too. Latest version? I think from Jan 27
06:04:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 and ChromeOS highlight much more reasonable security models imo
06:04:25 <renlord> renor: my variant is from Mar 19, 2020
06:04:31 <renlord> 60092239
06:04:50 <cyredanthem[m]> Linux is a lost cause
06:04:53 <renor> I've got 56485809
06:05:04 <renlord> win10's base offering nowadays is really good
06:05:12 <renlord> they also ship a type 1 hypervisor for free
06:05:23 <renlord> so you dont have to use virtualbox if you want to do linux stuff
06:05:37 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 also can force CFI in any app
06:05:42 <cyredanthem[m]> Even Firefox runs well with it
06:05:46 <renlord> dont even know how the fk they make money from win10
06:06:03 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): uR dAtA
06:06:15 <renlord> maybe subscription and support
06:06:35 <renlord> cyredanthem[m]: meh, you can turn off most if not all the telemetry and reporting
06:06:39 <renlord> it is a very good offering IMO
06:06:49 <renlord> i'd tell people to use win10
06:06:51 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): who does though?
06:07:09 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 is probably the most secure OS right now they just do almost everything right
06:07:09 <matic_nick[m]> <renlord "cyredanthem: meh, you can turn o"> My main gripe with it honestly
06:07:17 <cyredanthem[m]> I might leave macOS over it
06:07:37 <cyredanthem[m]> I do have verified boot though which rocks
06:07:49 <cyredanthem[m]> The secure keyboard entry and rootless app installs are nothing to scoff at

06:08:44 <cyredanthem[m]> travankor: they don't require gapps
06:08:58 <cyredanthem[m]> They are yes, but they don't need to install with privilege
06:09:30 <cyborgninjaneer[> Just got the update. Thanks, @strcat:matrix.org
06:10:00 <cyredanthem[m]> I got it too
06:10:10 <renlord> apple walled garden is a very big tradeoff
06:10:27 <renlord> not much of an issue on macos
06:10:39 <renlord> but they're likely to merge ios and macos families very soon
06:10:58 <cg_droid> Updated!! Thanks strcat[m] 🙂
06:11:11 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Normally macOS security is worth"> I'm pretty agnostic security/privacy wise but I there are some things the way Apple do I don't fully agree with
06:11:11 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): that's a good thing if they merge them imo
06:11:17 <cyredanthem[m]> If they do it right
06:11:21 <joshman[m]> <renlord "60092239"> Where do you see app version
06:11:43 <renlord> on the apkmirror site
06:11:55 <renlord> 7.3.021.300172532
06:11:56 <cyredanthem[m]> matic_nick: Apple strikes a good balance in everything I think they don't really stand out for anything besides iOS which is amazing
06:12:00 <renlord> is the actual vername
06:12:32 <joshman[m]> Yes. This is what I have
06:13:14 <joshman[m]> It's weird there's no Gcam apk on Aurora. I got it from Aptoide
06:13:17 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): what's your browser setup on Windows?
06:14:20 <renlord> i just use the stock edge browser now
06:14:32 <cyredanthem[m]> For virtualization?
06:14:34 <renlord> since it runs inside the win10 appcontainer
06:14:41 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "matic_nick: Apple strikes a good"> Yeah which is why I think running macos besides mac devices is pretty pointless thus leads me to open alternatives
06:14:48 <renlord> i try to use the UMP win10 applications
06:15:03 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10S at some point would be your goal to run?
06:15:06 <renlord> *uwp
06:15:21 <cyredanthem[m]> If they improve it enough
06:15:55 <renlord> will have to see what's the feature set
06:16:01 <renlord> for example, i need hyper-v
06:16:13 <renlord> there are some things for productivity reasons i still need to do on linux
06:16:20 <joshman[m]> It's so funny how allegedly bad was windows years ago everyone was switching to Linux. Here we are in 2020 folks going Linux 2 Windows again. Who knew
06:16:23 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "If they improve it enough"> On my desktop "I just want to be left alone" which isn't very Windows thing
06:16:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Do you set custom hardening rules in Windows 10 Defender Security settings?
06:16:49 <renlord> cyredanthem[m]: i turn on core isolation and memory integrity stuff
06:16:53 <cyredanthem[m]> matic_nick: that's a MacOS thing which is appealing
06:16:54 <cyredanthem[m]> It just werks to quote true memes
06:17:08 <cyredanthem[m]> I set custom rules per app
06:17:13 <cyredanthem[m]> Like Tor browser strict CFG
06:17:22 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "matic_nick: that's a MacOS thing"> Again back to Apple being Apple on hardware
06:17:38 <renlord> cyredanthem[m]: i might just use a whonix VM for anonymous stuff
06:18:18 <cyredanthem[m]> That's a good idea on Hyper-V?
06:18:29 <renlord> yeah, on hyper-v
06:18:54 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 and GrapheneOS are the perfect pair I think since they both have excellent hardening and they both run Chromium as it should be run
06:19:44 <joshman[m]> Ok. Gcam still fails very rarely. Upstream bug is still a thing though it's less annoying
06:20:46 <renlord> still cant get photo viewing to work
06:21:30 <matic_nick[m]> Our Windows devices are the ones making most noise on our network so I personally wouldn't run it privacy wise.
06:22:21 <matic_nick[m]> <matic_nick[m] "Our Windows devices are the ones"> Their telemetry is obnoxious
06:22:51 <cyredanthem[m]> Mine running Ungoogled Chromium is almost silent
06:22:52 <cyredanthem[m]> I do turn everything off though
06:23:29 <renor> renlord, joshman[m]: The version I'm using has no problems, from Jan 27
06:25:55 <matic_nick[m]> No firewalling or privacy modding stopped it so I just gave up
06:26:15 <cyredanthem[m]> How?
06:27:16 <renlord> what?
06:27:35 <renlord> matic_nick[m]: you have a lot of misunderstandings it seems
06:28:00 <renlord> what does privacy modding even mean
06:28:19 <joshman[m]> <renlord "still cant get photo viewing to "> You need to install fotos apk
06:28:27 <renlord> there are options to opt out of more or less everything
06:28:33 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows you can easily opt out of all telemetry at least on recent versions. Turning off the smart screen and that stuff is the part I always forget
06:28:35 <matic_nick[m]> <renlord "what does privacy modding even m"> wrong word I guess
06:28:36 <cyredanthem[m]> That really helps
06:28:42 <renlord> joshman[m]: google photos?
06:28:49 <joshman[m]> Correct
06:28:54 <cyredanthem[m]> The diagnostics you can't fully turn off, but it's nothing that fancy
06:29:00 <renlord> joshman[m]: ok thanks
06:29:11 <joshman[m]> It's Google Fotos not Photos btw
06:29:32 <joshman[m]> Don't forget to disable network access
06:29:55 <cg_droid> Windows is a nightmare in updates in many ways, sometimes they can even break your system, I think they must change that
06:30:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 LTSC might be for you
06:30:20 <joshman[m]> <cg_droid "Windows is a nightmare in update"> Wanna hear about Arch updates?
06:30:20 <cyredanthem[m]> Zero bloat at all
06:30:32 <matic_nick[m]> I used to do mitm on our windows devices and manually block connections that trace to their telemetry, it was awful
06:30:44 <renlord> joshman[m]: there is no Google Fotos
06:30:54 <cyredanthem[m]> matic_nick: how?
06:31:00 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], good point, never tried it
06:31:20 <cg_droid> joshman[m], never used... a pain in the ass? 😀
06:31:30 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 LTSC is pretty baller. No Windows Sandbox though
06:31:30 <renlord> matic_nick[m]: do you also block the update check?
06:31:35 <cyredanthem[m]> No virtualized Edge
06:31:38 <renlord> so you become more vulnerable to 0-day CVEs?
06:31:53 <renlord> ping home == always bad huh?
06:31:55 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], :-o without sandbox???
06:32:00 <matic_nick[m]> <renlord "matic_nick: do you also block th"> No

06:33:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 is so much better now
06:33:02 <renlord> which i did anyways
06:33:16 <renlord> i didnt even like halo
06:33:18 <renlord> ffs
06:33:59 <Arhu> Firefox by default has a shitload of telemetry but it can be turned off
06:34:25 <matic_nick[m]> <Arhu "Firefox by default has a shitloa"> That too
06:34:42 <matic_nick[m]> Fuck Fennec such bullshit
06:35:47 <Arhu> How many years ago did Mozilla get taken over by the privacy hostile forces?
06:38:54 <cyredanthem[m]> Fuck Waterfox and fuck Gecko
06:38:58 <cyredanthem[m]> Some old things should just die
06:39:01 <renor> renlord, joshman[m]: I'm not running Google Photos yet it is working
06:39:10 <cyredanthem[m]> WebKit Firefox would be exciting
06:39:14 <Arhu> cyredanthem: it's too bad the sandbox feature is from after the latest LTSC and the next release will be in the end of 2021
06:39:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Don't be another chromium copy team up with your ally
06:39:31 <matic_nick[m]> <Arhu "Firefox by default has a shitloa"> I think there's still some telemetry even if you turn it off, supposedly
06:39:35 <cyredanthem[m]> Arhu: yes that's true
06:39:40 <cyredanthem[m]> matic_nick: that's true
06:39:56 <Arhu> Enterprise had everything you want but comes with bloat
06:40:01 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox even has Google telemetry you can't turn off
06:40:18 <renlord> renor: well i needed google photos
06:40:26 <renlord> im guessing its related to a gallery provider
06:40:31 <renlord> i had gallery disabled for leafpic
06:40:44 <renlord> and then when i re-enabled gallery, it still didnt work
06:40:53 <cyredanthem[m]> Can you remove stuff from a Windows ISO?
06:40:57 <renor> Could be, I'm using system default gallery
06:41:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Modified enterprise would be awesome
06:41:01 <renlord> so my guess is that leafpic does not have a proper gallery implementation.
06:41:17 <renlord> anyways, stock gallery is really shit
06:41:22 <renlord> i'll just use google photos for now
06:41:58 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 custom hardening settings are the bomb.
06:42:09 <renlord> thank you friends who told me about that stub api implementation
06:42:10 <Arhu> cyredanthem: FF has Google telemetry you can't turn off with user.js?
06:42:12 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows let's you control everything it's awesome
06:42:39 <renlord> microsoft actually decided to listen to customers
06:42:39 <cyredanthem[m]> You can in there
06:42:54 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Windows let's you control everyt"> It's very exposed to user which is nice
06:43:52 <cyredanthem[m]> > microsoft actually decided to listen to customers
06:43:52 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 is so appealing now and looks excellent as always
06:49:23 <matic_nick[m]> I haven't done intensive research into the current Windows situation yet but I still get creeped out on Windows 10's constant home-phoning like every hour it does some random dns related to telemetry, even when the device is on standby
06:50:08 <cyredanthem[m]> Every OS has some connections home
06:50:35 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows isn't that bad it's very honest about how much info is given away checking for updates and considers that basic telemetry when the others don't
06:50:45 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 might be the most honest about privacy
06:51:12 <xabierd[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Some old things should just die"> Webkit/blink are also pretty old
06:53:54 <renor> https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/cstark27/gcam-cstark27s-google-camera-port-for-google-pixel-1-2-3-camerap3/gcam-cstark27s-google-camera-port-for-google-pixel-1-2-3-camerap3-7-2-014-278150624-release/gcam-cstark27s-google-camera-port-for-google-pixel-1-2-3-3a-4-camerapx-7-2-014-278150624-2-android-apk-download/
06:53:54 <renor> I'm using this gcam moded version, and has some more interesting options
06:53:58 <Arhu> It's unfortunate that they're basing Spectrum OS on Linux (for now) instead of ChromiumOS, since they eventually want to use crosvm. An ungoogled ChromiumOS would be awesome, and a ChromiumOS based Qubes clone would be god tier
06:54:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Gecko is old since it never adapted
06:54:35 <cyredanthem[m]> Honestly shouldn't base anything on Linux right now
06:55:16 <cyredanthem[m]> If I made an OS I would likely take Darwin and port waycool to it build a sandboxing/mac system from the ground up and add a Linux binary compatibility layer
06:56:23 <renlord> lol why darwin?
06:56:32 <renlord> why not build on top of seL4
06:57:00 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Every OS has some connections ho"> It's worse when actively using it though.
06:57:11 <renlord> i wonder if you can port services that come with the Mach kernel to run as userspace OS services on top of seL4
06:57:19 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): seL4 for a desktop?
06:57:23 <Arhu> ChromiumOS is probably lower hanging fruit because the crosvm and wayland stuff is already there, an maybe easier to eventually move to Zircon/Fuchsia
06:57:23 <renlord> assuming those services are implemented securely
06:57:30 <cyredanthem[m]> I would run Darwin until Zircon was ready
06:57:40 <renlord> cyredanthem[m]: yeah
06:57:43 <renlord> it can run on x86
06:59:25 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes, I am sure seL4 could be an option. I'm not sure about hardware compatibility though. It's an issue with both though
06:59:33 <cyredanthem[m]> That's why Linux is so popular
06:59:43 <Arhu> Why is it that there are no serious projects based on ChromiumOS? Darwin I can understand, but for now ChromiumOS seems like the most functional solid base
07:00:10 <cyredanthem[m]> ChromiumOS is not as secure as ChromeOS since no verified boto
07:00:12 <cyredanthem[m]> And it's very limited
07:00:39 <cyredanthem[m]> GrapheneOS probably wouldn't exist without devices with custom verified boot keys(thankfully there will always be Qualcomm reference devices)
07:01:11 <Arhu> Limited in which way? You'd run everything in a crosvm anyway
07:01:50 <cyredanthem[m]> That's not a good idea for the reasons @renlord:matrix.org and I highlighted
07:01:53 <cyredanthem[m]> It defeats the purpose
07:01:55 <Arhu> Google Pixelbooks don't support a similar thing?
07:02:40 <cyredanthem[m]> seL4 as a hypervisor for Qubes would be interesting running Windows 10 as guests?
07:02:42 <cyredanthem[m]> > Google Pixelbooks don't support a similar thing?
07:02:42 <cyredanthem[m]> No Google doesn't like it
07:02:52 <cyredanthem[m]> Qualcomm supports it and Google leaves the bootloader stock
07:03:03 <cyredanthem[m]> Google has no interest in custom verified boot is my take
07:03:24 <cyredanthem[m]> Which means Pixels might drop it when they go custom chips
07:03:40 <Arhu> It seems trivial for them to disable it for Pixel phones
07:03:49 <renlord> lol, they are long way from custom chip
07:03:54 <renlord> many hardware people left
07:04:01 <cyredanthem[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Which means Pixels might drop it"> Arhu: that's not the ethos
07:04:03 <cyredanthem[m]> They want to go stock
07:04:22 <cyredanthem[m]> Qualcomm is stock
07:04:32 <cyredanthem[m]> Pixels are the Android experience
07:04:33 <cyredanthem[m]> All in all
07:04:38 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): thankfully
07:04:47 <cyredanthem[m]> In this one instance
07:07:45 <Arhu> I don't follow. If they don't like custom verified boot, it's super easy for them to disable it on their Pixel phones. You're staying they just don't do that because it's not stock Qualcomm? Their Titan M chip isn't - that's already a divergence from Qualcomm
07:08:18 <cyredanthem[m]> If they liked it they would add it to Pixelbooks
07:10:14 <renlord> my guess is that they probably wotn bend over backwards just to support custom verified boot
07:10:20 <renlord> but if its along the way, sure.
07:10:50 <cyredanthem[m]> That's probably most accurate
07:11:10 <cyredanthem[m]> They obviously are a fan of GrapheneOS so who knows
07:12:56 <cyredanthem[m]> Is KeePass still the only sane Password Manager?
07:13:22 <matic_nick[m]> Talking about custom chips, how much does it benefit mac users in the future?
07:13:57 <cyredanthem[m]> > Talking about custom chips, how much does it benefit mac users in the future?
07:13:57 <cyredanthem[m]> For security and trust? A lot
07:14:01 <Arhu> Hopefully some other vendor would make a phone with hardware so identical to the pixels it can run AOSP with minimal modifications. I really don't understand why they make it so difficult for themselves with keeping up with the Android implementation for their phone, and they always push non-stock shit that nobody wants. They're making their money from selling devices, no?
07:14:12 <renlord> matic_nick[m]: cyredanthem[m]: you also have to trust apple completely
07:14:22 <renlord> that they do correct things at the HW and SW level
07:14:42 <cyredanthem[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): which is better than trusting a bunch of hardware companies competely
07:14:53 <renlord> cyredanthem[m]: i dont necessarily agree with that
07:15:11 <cyredanthem[m]> I have to trust Google, Qualcomm, and GrapheneOS on my phone. An iPhone is pretty much just Apple unless I'm missing something
07:16:04 <Arhu> With most iPhones you're trusting Qualcomm or Intel too
07:16:30 <renlord> cyredanthem[m]: at least google/qualcomm/grapheneos develops software independently and check/validate correctness when interfacing with each other
07:17:10 <cyredanthem[m]> That's very true renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org) they keep each other in line as they all care a lot
07:17:31 <renlord> who knows if apple internal politics can get in the way of doing things correctly?
07:17:39 <renlord> the problem here is that tehre is no public accountability
07:17:58 <cyredanthem[m]> That's true iPhone is placing a lot of trust in one party
07:18:06 <renlord> and hobbyist researchers need to bendover backwards to scrutinise apple devices.
07:18:38 <cyredanthem[m]> Which is better than trusting 12 random parties all making sketchy drivers and firmware on an old laptop, but lot different than GrapheneOS trust wise
07:19:07 <Arhu> I don't think the other companies can keep Qualcomm from putting a vulnerability or backdoor in their baseband chips
07:19:28 <cyredanthem[m]> Apple and Google are the only ones with sane trust models
07:19:34 <cyredanthem[m]> Imo
07:24:20 <Arhu> Does the Apple T2 chip offer security advantage for running Windows? You don't have to lower the security settings to install Windows with BootCamp
07:25:35 <cyredanthem[m]> > Does the Apple T2 chip offer security advantage for running Windows? You don't have to lower the security settings to install Windows with BootCamp
07:25:35 <cyredanthem[m]> No Windows 10 is not designed for it
07:26:14 <cyredanthem[m]> It's much like ChromiumOS can actually do some decent verification with Secure Boot alone, but it's useless on Windows and Linux. It's bad on ChromiumOS too, but still
07:27:04 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows and Linux aren't designed for immutability
08:07:50 <cn3m[m]> link?  @cyredanthem:synapse.travnewmatic.com
08:07:52 <cyredanthem[m]> @analogpathy:synapse.travnewmatic.com: help me out here I lost the link
08:08:06 <cn3m[m]> oop
08:08:46 <analog[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "@analogpathy:synapse.travnewmati"> For?
08:10:34 <cn3m[m]> I'm asking for the secure boot stuff
08:11:39 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes, I can't find it again but you and dong mentioned it
08:12:00 <cn3m[m]> I can just look back in the group
08:24:13 <cg_droid> After the update, in Pixel 3a, some apps give a warning about maybe not working and contact the developer: Messages and Conversations in my case. But the apps works great anyway 🙂
08:24:40 <cg_droid> After the update, in Pixel 3a, some apps give a warning about maybe not working and contact the developer: Messages and Conversations in my case. But the apps work great anyway 🙂
08:24:56 <cyredanthem[m]> cg_droid: I'll check it out
08:25:27 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], once you start these apps I'm not receiving again that message
08:25:44 <cg_droid> I've tested both apps and they work ok
08:25:55 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], thanks
08:32:24 <cyredanthem[m]> I couldn't see anything testing
08:32:35 <cyredanthem[m]> cg_droid: anytime good find though
08:33:03 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], with Pixel 3a?
08:33:19 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes
08:33:26 <cg_droid> Messages is the defafult app, and I don't know if you use xmpp or Conversations
08:33:42 <Connie[m]1> Can anyone please explain what does "sensor" app permission do? Thanks!
08:33:50 <cg_droid> The rest of the apps I can't see this warning
08:34:27 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], but no problem as I said: they both work ok
08:35:04 <cyredanthem[m]> > Can anyone please explain what does "sensor" app permission do? Thanks!
08:35:04 <cyredanthem[m]> @cn3m:privacytools.io
08:35:38 <Connie[m]1> I got that warning as well when i open the message app
08:36:03 <cn3m[m]> sensor permissions can be used to listen to crude audio recordings, they can determine age and gender, they have even been somewhat linked to location, they were also used to steal lockscreen passwords(now impossible)
08:36:09 <cn3m[m]> they can be a little scary
08:36:14 <cg_droid> Connie[m]1, it's only that time, not anymore when I reopen it
08:36:31 <cyredanthem[m]> 👍
08:37:25 <Connie[m]1> Wow thanks. So basically I should keep it "deny" for all apps?
08:37:36 <Connie[m]1> > Connie 之蛙, it's only that time, not anymore when I reopen it
08:37:36 <Connie[m]1> Yes same for me
08:37:56 <cyredanthem[m]> Probably not a bad idea Connie 之蛙
08:38:16 <Connie[m]1> Thanks alot 🙏🏻
08:38:31 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], which apps do you allow in Sensors?, in my case Telephone, my camera app, Gestual Navigation Bar, GOS launcher and system layout
08:38:39 <cn3m[m]>  @conniesfrog:matrix.org I dunno it can make you stand out more browsing iirc
08:38:46 <cn3m[m]> it's complicated I could write a book on it
08:38:47 <cg_droid> I don't know if they are even necessary or not...
08:39:05 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "cn3m, which apps do you allow in"> none of those need it
08:39:13 <fujita_[m]> I just allow for all the default app
08:39:15 <cn3m[m]> I don't care enough to turn it off
08:39:26 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], oh thanks!, So what's the point in that permission?
08:39:31 <fujita_[m]> would turning that off affect navigation
08:39:42 <cg_droid> I thought that maybe Camera and Telephone need some sensor
08:39:55 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "cn3m, oh thanks!, So what's the "> it's for gyroscope and such
08:39:59 <cg_droid> Or gestual navigation..
08:40:04 <cn3m[m]> many things
08:40:06 <cg_droid> Can I deny them?
08:40:07 <fujita_[m]> I think daniel did explain on reddit
08:40:15 <cn3m[m]> you can try it
08:40:21 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], thanks
08:40:24 <cn3m[m]> I don't see why not
08:40:38 <cn3m[m]> I don't turn sensors off on anything, but I also don't run any untrustworthy apps
08:43:28 <xabierd[m]> I think that the toggle is more useful for apps from google crap store than free alternatives
08:43:34 <cg_droid> Me neither but it's something there I can disable if I don't need it, we don't know but could happen
08:43:53 <cg_droid> Yes, camera and telephone works ok without Sensor permission, tested
08:45:38 <fujita_[m]> How does Gnu Icecat & Iridium compare to ungoogled chromium in terms of security
08:46:25 <cn3m[m]> <fujita_[m] "How does Gnu Icecat & Iridium co"> GNU Icecat is bad for security
08:46:51 <cn3m[m]> Iridium and Ungoogled are tied, but UC has a better patch history
08:52:32 <cg_droid> fujita_[m], thanks, I'll find that post from Daniel about Sensors
08:53:35 <travankor> any device maintainers working on pixel 4a
08:53:52 <cn3m[m]> <travankor "any device maintainers working o"> doesn't exist yet
08:54:15 <travankor> well it's "leaked" everywhere :p
08:54:51 <cn3m[m]> doesn't help devs
08:55:00 <cn3m[m]> pixel 4 isn't even supported which is the prereq
08:55:06 <travankor> really?
08:55:18 <travankor> 4a depends on 4
08:55:23 <travankor> ?
08:56:01 <cn3m[m]> it's a good foundation to work on the 4a from
08:56:38 <EssentialChaos[m> cn3m: I think 4a would be much easier
08:56:44 <travankor> they're completely separate devices, except for the name
08:56:45 <EssentialChaos[m> It has less features
08:56:48 <cn3m[m]> that's wonderful, but not reality
08:56:51 <travankor> afaik
08:57:08 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_travankor:matrix.org that's not at all true
08:58:01 <travankor> i'm not super familiar with android dev, so would appreciate some links/info
08:58:22 <cn3m[m]> They share a lot of technical details code wise. I could go into it, but there's a book to write
08:58:30 <cn3m[m]> I mean it's just simple, a series is not that different
09:01:39 <travankor> you guys think daniel and co will skip 4/4a for pixel 5?
09:03:12 <cn3m[m]> it's not impossible
09:03:24 <cn3m[m]> he said people need to step up and add the devices themselves
09:03:47 <cn3m[m]> he doesn't own a Pixel 4 iirc
09:07:07 <travankor> honestly, i don't like the pixel 4, either
09:36:43 <xabierd[m]> it would be nice the next grapheneos phone to have 5g, but more than happy with what we have right now
09:39:41 <joshman[m]> Since today (after I got working gcam) grapheneOS became my absolute weapon of choice in the OS department
09:40:14 <joshman[m]> Bluetooth fixed. Camera fixed. I don't need anything else. Graphene is perfection
09:40:57 <xabierd[m]> It was nice to know that even my banking apps work on grapheneOS, some custom roms with passed safetynet failed
09:41:00 <cn3m[m]> as someone who uses GrapheneOS and iOS side by side (Pixel 3a and iPad Pro) I definitely like both for different reasons
09:41:20 <cn3m[m]> I will prefer GrapheneOS for sure after Android 11
09:41:22 <joshman[m]> Gcam, fotos and Gboard are only Google products I use and they all work with network settings disabled.
09:42:02 <EssentialChaos[m> cn3m: Generally or is there something specific in Android 11
09:42:07 <EssentialChaos[m>  * cn3m: Generally or is there something specific in Android 11?
09:42:10 <joshman[m]> I use to use my spare iPhone 11. Which is now officially a dust collector
09:42:25 <joshman[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "cn3m: Generally or is there some"> Security hardening
09:43:17 <cn3m[m]>  @essentialchaos:tchncs.de so I worked in adtech and I broke Android and tried to break iOS for a living
09:43:29 <cn3m[m]> the 3rd party privacy is huge for me
09:43:34 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 is finally catching up
09:43:51 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has always done things much better than Android normally
09:44:22 <cn3m[m]> it's all about the privacy this release
09:45:12 <EssentialChaos[m> Android: it's all about the privacy this release
09:45:13 <EssentialChaos[m> Xiaomi: yeah, might skip this one
09:45:25 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QeqKxqLwNSqXfDOObxtRyUgG >
09:46:51 <cn3m[m]> Google Apps totally wreck anything good about Android 11 privacy, but on degoogled OSs it's very close to iOS.
09:47:50 <cn3m[m]> iOS still does a lot of things in a more sane way for 3rd party privacy, but first party privacy is better on AOSP. You have settings to change on iOS to get there
09:48:43 <travankor> first party as in what apple collects from you
09:49:13 <cn3m[m]> @freenode_travankor:matrix.org yes
09:49:23 <cn3m[m]> in all fairness they collect less than Firefox ha
09:49:28 <travankor> heh
09:49:54 <cn3m[m]> however Android is getting very competitive on privacy when normally I consider it to be a freedom choice
09:49:59 <travankor> my last straw with firefox was when they started shipping ad-bait/shitty ads on startup
09:50:46 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_travankor:matrix.org yes it sucks now it's unexcusable
10:38:10 <yekip[m]> Sounds like all my learning about using Firefox privately is turning out to be a waste of time :D
10:38:13 <yekip[m]> Is Firefox frowned on now?
10:38:23 <cn3m[m]> 100%
10:38:27 <cn3m[m]> it's a sham
10:42:23 <yekip[m]> shit
10:42:34 <yekip[m]> 'thanks' :D
10:42:53 <yekip[m]> in case it makes a diff, i am only talkin about firefox
10:43:16 <yekip[m]>  * in case it makes a diff, i am only talkin about desktop browser
10:46:01 <cn3m[m]> Firefox sucks on all platforms
10:46:25 <cn3m[m]> Windows you can tweak and use testing features to do okay..
10:46:53 <cn3m[m]> it's still bad
10:49:01 <yekip[m]> no windows here. only mac. so i should be looking to change. christ, that wont be fun. :D
10:49:11 <yekip[m]> will add another post it note to my desk!
10:49:38 <cn3m[m]> macOS is solid
10:49:51 <yekip[m]> is it possible to use Chromium (if that's the alternative you recommend) with extensions to block trackers and stuff like in Firefox? I use quite a few, plus first party isolation in configs. is that sort of thing possible with Chromium?
10:50:02 <cn3m[m]> Firefox sucks on it
10:50:19 <cn3m[m]> I mean yeah Chromium can be comparable for privacy
10:51:03 <yekip[m]> macOS is a privacy nightmare too when you get into it, which I stupidly did recently. monitoring all connections. Icloud bull shit turned off, still making connections constantly, days of learning what i can block without screwing up normal operation. ok, Windows is an abomination by comparison, but I despise Apple equally these days, having been something of a devotee for many years now. I just don't have the knowledge
10:51:03 <yekip[m]> to take on a full move to Linux, but its coming
10:51:38 <cn3m[m]> did you check it with MITM?
10:51:45 <cn3m[m]> I had one for work
10:52:15 <yekip[m]> check what with what?
10:52:40 <cn3m[m]> as long as diagnostics were off it was always update checking or checking the time or something
10:52:49 <cn3m[m]> <yekip[m] "check what with what?"> man in the middle
10:53:05 <cn3m[m]> decrypt the packets
10:53:08 <yekip[m]> i know thats what MITM means, but dont know what you mean by your question
10:53:10 <cn3m[m]> number of connections isn't the issue, content is
10:53:19 <yekip[m]> yeah i am not up to packet inspection at this point
10:53:20 <yekip[m]> i use litle snitch
10:53:24 <yekip[m]> so i just get to see what is dialling to where, and when.
10:53:26 <cn3m[m]> oh that's not super helpful for that, but talk to cyre
10:53:27 <yekip[m]> i am aggressive in blocking, then unblock when absoluely necessary
10:53:29 <cn3m[m]> he's the Mac privacy guy
10:53:33 <cg_droid> Linux is privacy without security, so it's like no privacy
10:53:40 <yekip[m]> oh he's a guy?
10:53:48 <yekip[m]> i thought there were quite a few men in the middle :D
10:53:52 <yekip[m]> no doubt some ladies too :D
10:54:38 <yekip[m]> <cg_droid "Linux is privacy without securit"> agreed, but at this point i would sooner learn that, that learn how to fight with the bastards who sold me this machine, for my own privacy. facial analysis of all my photos, automatically, without consent, and without (as far as I can tell) ANY way to turn the damn thing OFF. Thats one of about 100 serious gripes i have
10:54:50 <cn3m[m]> macOS is the most privacy friendly consumer OS
10:55:09 <yekip[m]> deliberate blocking/obfuscation of VPN usage with many Apple apps... the list goes on and one
10:55:10 <yekip[m]>  * deliberate blocking/obfuscation of VPN usage with many Apple apps... the list goes on and on
10:55:22 <cn3m[m]>  @yekip:privacytools.io a lot of what you are talking about is local processing
10:55:26 <cg_droid> yekip[m], you won't find a perfect operative system in this world
10:55:35 <cn3m[m]> facial recognitions and everything is all local
10:55:36 <yekip[m]> <cn3m[m] "macOS is the most privacy friend"> that's just comparative. I agree. But it's far from BEING a privacy friendly OS.
10:55:44 <yekip[m]> <cn3m[m] "facial recognitions and everythi"> so "they" say
10:55:45 <yekip[m]> then I see a shit load of connections out
10:56:08 <yekip[m]> and not the point. I don't want facial fucking proicessing, local or remote. I do not want it!
10:56:10 <yekip[m]> but can't seem to stop it
10:56:38 <yekip[m]> so I am moving away from things like iTunes, Photos app, obviously Facetime etc
10:56:56 <cn3m[m]> you can verify they do stuff offline
10:56:56 <yekip[m]> i know
10:57:04 <cn3m[m]> MITM
10:57:09 <travankor> yekip[m]: sounds a lot like "the grass is greener on the other side"
10:57:37 <yekip[m]> <travankor "yekip: sounds a lot like "the gr"> dont understand that
10:57:38 <yekip[m]> which side?
10:57:56 <yekip[m]> i am on Mac. I am staying on Mac for foreseeable future, as I am stuck with it for now. But locking it down as much as possibhle is something I am doing, and not without a fight from Apple in many ways
10:58:12 <yekip[m]> how do I find this MITM?

10:59:05 <dazinism> cg_droid: the warning added with the latest update. Its because the app uses a target apk earlier than 28.

11:00:01 <cn3m[m]>  @yekip:privacytools.io yeah Mac was awesome when I used it
11:00:05 <cn3m[m]> nothing violated my privacy at all
11:00:15 <cn3m[m]> great security model
11:00:37 <dazinism> Apps having a target SDK of 28 or higher adds significant security benefits
11:00:50 <cg_droid> Real privacy doesn't exist, you can avoid some ads from websites and not being tracked a lot, nothing more.
11:00:51 <cn3m[m]> though I get the not liking the local processing
11:01:05 <cn3m[m]> the root of trust on the web is toast
11:01:35 <dazinism> cg_droid: Pix Art Messenger, which is a fork of conversations targets SDK 29
11:01:38 <yekip[m]> <travankor "yekip: i mean mac is not necessa"> It beats Windows for privacy, by a country mile. It beats Linux for security, by a country mile. That's why I am on it. But learning to improve my privacy by blocking Apple's bull shit, is an improvement process, ongoing
11:02:04 <cn3m[m]>  @yekip:privacytools.io turn off diagnostics and iCloud
11:02:12 <cn3m[m]> that's all you need

11:03:16 <yekip[m]> <cn3m[m] " @yekip:privacytools.io yeah Mac"> That's the point really. IT has always been nothing short of awesome in my view, UNTIL more recently. Rapidly going downhill as they need to keep shareholders happy and this means monetising things they never needed to before. like upsells and traps and shit. Just pisses me off. But yes, its the the best overall choice STILL. But its going downhill fast for me. Said as someone

11:05:08 <blacklight447[m]> <cn3m[m] "its possible"> I assume we cannot use desktop mode on graphene as of now
11:05:36 <cn3m[m]>  @blacklight447:privacytools.io There's an app I haven't tried it though
11:05:56 <yekip[m]> <cn3m[m] "I can definitely confirm everyth"> Sorry, I can't agree there. Maybe in the past. I have been watching connections and doing all sorts of shit for weeks now as I am setting up an entire new office basically. From scratch. Fresh OS, no migration of user accounts of data, everything set up manually. I have lost count of the smelly things I have found. But it depends what bothers you, which may be different to
11:05:56 <yekip[m]> what bothers me. For instance, i doubt it bothers you that your photos are facially analysed, if kept local. It bothers me though. I have turned off icloud and diags, but it still conects to a shit ton of servers related to icloud, it still tries to use icloud in some apps even though icloud is turned off.... its not quite as simple as you say there. I wish it was, but expeirence has shown me it isn't.

11:22:28 <yekip[m]> gotta shoot here. but if you're up on MacOS (security and privacy) then I may have to nudge you with a few questions some time (in Spite)

11:34:12 <cyredanthem[m]> Try it
11:34:19 <cyredanthem[m]> GrapheneOS bug
11:37:59 <renor> Can apps communicate with each other on AOSP? I mean, can (say) a malicious app without the network permission use another installed app to get to the internet? Or can a malicious app get any internal files if it has Storage permission?
11:37:59 <renor> In my head this doesn't make sense since AOSP has sandboxing between apps, but I was thinking about it and I want to make sure.
11:39:01 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes it definitely can
11:39:07 <cyredanthem[m]> renor (@freenode_renor:matrix.org): use profiles
11:39:21 <renor> How?
11:39:34 <cyredanthem[m]> What do you mean?
11:39:44 <cyredanthem[m]> You're exactly right
11:40:58 <blacklight447[m]> <renor "Can apps communicate with each o"> If you grant an app access to storage, then it gets accessed to the shared storage
11:41:07 <renor> I mean, a malicious app without network permission can get to the internet through another app?
11:41:18 <cyredanthem[m]> They can also talk directly and an app with no internet or any permissions can leak to another
11:41:24 <cyredanthem[m]> For example I have Google Keyboard
11:41:36 <cyredanthem[m]> It could talk to my Google Camera(I don't have that)
11:41:41 <cyredanthem[m]> It can then leak
11:41:43 <blacklight447[m]> It cannot however reached into apps own private storage
11:42:02 <renor> Bur apps need to be from a same "ecosystem" ? Say Google apps
11:42:13 <cyredanthem[m]> <blacklight447[m] "It cannot however reached into a"> renor (@freenode_renor:matrix.org): no
11:42:23 <cyredanthem[m]> They don't need to be the same dev
11:42:42 <cyredanthem[m]> Practically speaking it's more likely
11:43:03 <renor> I don't get how this is possible. Where can I find info about this?
11:43:26 <blacklight447[m]> See it like this, all apps can store stuff in two ways
11:43:33 <cg_droid> renor: I think that's why it's better to use profiles
11:43:44 <blacklight447[m]> Their own private storage, and the more public shared storage
11:43:59 <renor> Then Network permission makes no sense if it can be bypassed
11:44:03 <cyredanthem[m]> renor (@freenode_renor:matrix.org): use an app that shows your own list like apktrack, extractor, any store
11:44:26 <renor> blacklight447[m]: Ok, I think this is solved with the next API version
11:44:29 <cyredanthem[m]> > Then Network permission makes no sense if it can be bypassed
11:44:29 <cyredanthem[m]> That's why there's a huge disclaimer on the site
11:44:34 <cyredanthem[m]> Everyone needs to read the site
11:44:37 <blacklight447[m]> Private storage can ONLY be accesed by the app it belongs to (or you d need to root your phone) the shared storage can be reached, but only with the storage permission
11:44:58 <cyredanthem[m]> > blacklight447: Ok, I think this is solved with the next API version
11:44:58 <cyredanthem[m]> We still don't know what that will look like
11:45:28 <blacklight447[m]> <renor "blacklight447: Ok, I think this "> You mean with scoped storage?

11:46:46 <blacklight447[m]> <renor "blacklight447: How can I know wh"> If you can see it in your file explorer, then its shared storage
11:46:53 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes
11:47:06 <cyredanthem[m]> Read grapheneos.org in it's entirely
11:52:12 <renor> I did, but I didn't read anything about this
11:52:20 <renor> Now I'm trying to find it
11:53:11 <cyredanthem[m]> Usage guide or FAQ
11:53:14 <cyredanthem[m]> Can't remember
11:55:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Never mind he doesn't mention bypasses
11:55:18 <renor> GrapheneOS adds a user-facing Network permission toggle providing a robust way to deny both direct and indirect network access to applications. It builds upon the standard non-user-facing INTERNET permission, so it's already fully adopted by the app ecosystem. Revoking the permission denies indirect access via OS components and apps enforcing the INTERNET permission, such as DownloadManager. Direct acces
11:55:18 <renor> s is denied by blocking low-level network socket access.
11:55:52 <renor> I think it's the other way around and it has mitigations to avoid what you were mentioning
11:56:33 <cyredanthem[m]> There's gotta be a way to test
11:57:11 <cyredanthem[m]> Yeah it doesn't break intents
11:57:30 <cyredanthem[m]> The firewall is bypassable
11:57:57 <cyredanthem[m]> Shove it in a profile if you want the firewall to work
12:06:00 <xabierd[m]> there is a script that disables intents, "disablefucksercives" it would be nice that graphene could do something like that
12:50:35 <dazinism> renor: theres the possibility that some apps, that arent well written can leak info to other apps. The tightening in the app sandbox for apps that have a target apk of 28 or higher closes this leak.
12:50:37 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Target_SDK
12:50:56 <dazinism> Thats from their own private storage.
12:51:04 <dazinism> Not shared storage.
12:52:11 <dazinism> There are various ways apps can communicate with each other
12:52:14 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/inter-app-comms
12:53:40 <dazinism> About storage
12:53:42 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/storage
13:09:46 <cg_droid> dazinism, reading what renor posted maybe it's not possible, is it?. Or you mean that other apps could leak to internet some information from an app that hasn't enabled the Network permission?
13:11:37 <joshman[m]> How can something be leaked if I have Gboard Gcam and Fotos app. All are with network disabled
13:12:03 <dazinism> Unfortunately its possible for apps with network permission to leak info to network from apps without network permission
13:12:17 <renor> are you sure about this?
13:12:47 <cg_droid> dazinism, :-o
13:12:58 <joshman[m]> I don't think it's possible for Android 10 not to mention 11
13:13:40 <joshman[m]> * I don't think it's possible for Android 10 let alone 11
13:14:24 <Arhu> Is it going to be an enormous operation to get GrapheneOS at Android 11?
13:14:34 <dazinism> It depends on apps with network permission checking to see if other apps have network permission before they handle an request to do something over network
13:14:57 <dazinism> Arhu: its always quite a lot of work, yes
13:16:01 <dazinism> The monthly security update has always been delayed by some days/weeks porting to the new android version
13:16:32 <cg_droid> dazinism,  is it because what it's posted in the link you sent?: apps with shared storage and also apps targeting SDK 28 or later?
13:16:48 <cg_droid> dazinism,  is it because what it's posted in the link you sent?: apps with shared storage and also apps NOT targeting SDK 28 or later?
13:16:54 <dazinism> Ideally a lot more people, with the necessary skills, would be on hand to help with this work.
13:17:56 <dazinism> cg_droid: the network thing? Its just that any app with network can use the network. Also any app can communicate with any other app.
13:18:19 <dazinism> Its up to the app with network permission to do things correctly
13:18:58 <cg_droid> dazinism, and then what about isolation in the apps?, is it a different thing?
13:19:13 <dazinism> Ideally they check to see if the other app has network before performing a network operation for that app
13:19:14 <cg_droid> SO, it's allowed the communication between apps...
13:19:40 <cg_droid> And what if it hasn't Network permission?
13:19:42 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/inter-app-comms
13:21:10 <dazinism> An app without network can not directly connect to the internet, only via another app that lets it do so.
13:21:43 <cg_droid> And it's possible then...
13:21:48 <dazinism> There's a notable example of this that strcat has given in the past
13:21:55 <cg_droid> This is terrible!
13:22:08 <dazinism> Not sure if it still is possible
13:22:15 <cg_droid> I mean. I hope it will be solved in android 11
13:22:31 <cg_droid> Ok thanks dazinism
13:23:23 <dazinism> chromium  (possibly vanadium? ) will perform a http get request for another app on request,  without checking if that app had network permission
13:24:09 <dazinism> I think the way this works(or worked, if it is no longer possible)
13:24:20 <cg_droid> Ok
13:24:38 <dazinism> An app sends an intent to chromium/vanadium
13:25:13 <dazinism> Then chromium becomes the forground/ focused app and opens the url
13:26:21 <dazinism> The URL could be https://some_spy_site/some_very_long_string_with_your_private_data
13:26:47 <dazinism> So you would see if this had happened
13:27:14 <cg_droid> So, as apps can communicate with other apps, that app can send that intent to Chromium
13:27:33 <joshman[m]> <dazinism "I think the way this works(or wo"> This is possible. Inside gcam settings if I tap Help, Vanadium opens Google's website
13:27:35 <dazinism> I was looking at the services/broadcast receivers in vanadium trying to figure out which would allow this
13:27:50 <cg_droid> In that link you posted there are some interesting tools/apps, but I think Net Monitor doesn't work anymore in Android 10
13:28:11 <dazinism> cg_droid: no it doesnt work on 10
13:28:55 <cg_droid> I'll test the others, thanks
13:30:49 <cg_droid> So, Network permission is not something like God-network in GOS
13:31:14 <cg_droid> I didn't know about this... scared
13:31:18 <dazinism> josh.man: wonder if intent intercept app  allows you to see/block that intent?
13:33:29 <dazinism> cg_droid: the network toggle does not give a complete defense, but it can help a lot.
13:33:49 <cg_droid> dazinism, I see
13:34:37 <cg_droid> dazinism, maybe many people (like me) thought it was a complete defense avoiding internet communication
13:35:38 <dazinism> Guess nothing is a complete defense. strcat has been clear in the past that it is possible for apps to work around it.
13:35:48 <dazinism> I think pretty unlikely though
13:45:56 <dazinism> To my knowledge no other AOSP forks have network permission as a dangerous (means it had a toggle) permission
13:46:40 <dazinism> Think Lineage has/had a way to block network connections for apps but it worked in a different way.
13:48:24 <cg_droid> ok
13:50:58 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: you should read what I've written about it
13:51:15 <strcat[m]> the Network permission disallows the app from connecting to the network or using APIs requiring the INTERNET permission
13:51:33 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: you understand apps within a profile can mutually consent to communication?
13:52:00 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: if you give Contacts permission to an app, it can decide to give the information to another app within the profile, send it over the network, or whatever - you get that right?
13:52:30 <strcat[m]> an app can choose to take a permission and expose an API based on it and it is the responsibility of the app you gave the permission to enforce the rules for it
13:52:40 <strcat[m]> you are trusting the app with the permission - it can do whatever it wants with it
13:52:59 <strcat[m]> browsers require the INTERNET (Network) permission
13:53:26 <strcat[m]> they CHOOSE to expose the ability to open URLs (HTTP GET requests) to other apps and they don't do the permission check
13:53:36 <strcat[m]> this is going to be addressed in Vanadium - we can't do anything about third party browsers / apps though
13:53:45 <strcat[m]> this applies in general, it should not be a surprise
13:53:58 <dazinism> strcat: thanks for the update, and best wishes for yesterday.
13:54:01 <strcat[m]> there is an issue open for implementing this feature for Vanadium - feel free to work on it
13:54:10 <strcat[m]> everything has been clearly explained / documented I think
13:55:21 <strcat[m]> it is as simple as the fact that apps within a profile can communicate with mutual consent
13:55:50 <strcat[m]> if you trust an app with a permission, you trust it not to expose it to other apps without enforcing the permission check - that is part of trusting an app with a permission
13:56:00 <strcat[m]> think about the fact that apps can communicate (with mutual consent)
13:56:14 <strcat[m]> that is part of the fundamentals of how things work
13:56:25 <strcat[m]> so much stuff you rely on depends on that
13:56:49 <strcat[m]> and this is one of the reasons profiles are useful - apps cannot share data or communicate between them
13:57:14 <strcat[m]> API 28+ apps can't share data aside from via stuff they are granted by the user, but  they can communicate (within a profile)
13:57:32 <strcat[m]> I think this is clearly documented - I don't understand the confusion
13:59:05 <strcat[m]> there is a feature open about implementing a toggle for disallowing apps to communicate with non-system apps - that would be a new feature
14:01:10 <cg_droid> strcat[m], thanks a lot for your answer!
14:02:04 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: basically apps (including Chromium) are not doing their part in enforcing INTERNET
14:02:16 <strcat[m]> we can fix this in Vanadium
14:02:37 <strcat[m]> in general, apps can screw up and not do proper permission checks
14:03:11 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: an example is that camera apps expose intents for other apps to take pictures through them - and of course they require the user to actually choose to take a picture, they don't allow the app to take a picture without consent
14:03:27 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: but a camera app could fuck this up and expose a way to automatically take the picture while forgetting to check the CAMERA permission
14:03:31 <cdesai> this could be fixed through the link opener app selection dialogue too.
14:03:32 <cdesai> you can set defaults, but I imagine it still goes through the system where it checks for the default, so it'd be one more check for the permission.
14:03:33 <strcat[m]> camera apps have had problems like this before
14:03:35 <dazinism> strcat what the difference between sharing data and communicating for apk28+? Open for any app to grab vs. A direct communication?
14:03:51 <strcat[m]> dazinism: for API 28+ apps can only communicate via intents
14:04:07 <strcat[m]> they can't do anything like chmod 777 their data directories / files or whatever to share them anymore
14:04:17 <strcat[m]> they can ONLY communicate via intents (or side channels, w/e)
14:04:42 <dazinism> All non 'approved' IPC is blocked effectively?
14:04:44 <strcat[m]> dazinism: or stuff you grant them access to ofc (like giving 2 apps access to the same directory, or contacts, or w/e)
14:04:46 <strcat[m]> dazinism: yes
14:04:56 <strcat[m]> dazinism: IPC has to go through the OS and it has the ability to filter / monitor it
14:05:06 <cg_droid> strcat[m], interesting, I didn't know 🙂
14:05:18 <strcat[m]> so we can implement a toggle to disallow apps to communicate with each other or whatever now
14:05:34 <strcat[m]> since it all has to go through the intent handling stuff
14:05:37 <strcat[m]> so we are in control of it
14:05:56 <strcat[m]> before they had ways of communicating without going through that
14:06:14 <strcat[m]> API 28+ addresses that by using a unique security domain for every app instance
14:06:24 <dazinism> strcat: so it blocks all what I've listed as 'other IPC' here? https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/inter-app-comms
14:06:30 <strcat[m]> before: every app has a per-profile-per-app uid/gid and runs in untrusted_app with a per-profile MLS level
14:06:41 <cg_droid> In my ignorance I thought there were no communication between apps :(
14:06:47 <strcat[m]> every app has a per-profile-per-app uid/gid and runs in untrusted_app with a per-profile-er-app MLS level
14:06:53 <strcat[m]>  * every app has a per-profile-per-app uid/gid and runs in untrusted_app with a per-profile-per-app MLS level
14:07:02 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: how would stuff like sharing and so on work
14:07:09 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: apps providing services to each other
14:07:16 <strcat[m]> there's a ton of functionality that uses this which you regularly use
14:07:26 <cg_droid> That's true...
14:07:50 <strcat[m]> there would be real usability issues with implementing the option of restrictions - still worthwhile
14:08:08 <strcat[m]> but you lose functionality or have to deal with a lot of prompts, etc.
14:08:17 <dazinism> cdesai : its possible for an intent to be aimed at a particular app though, which would stop that working?
14:08:19 <cg_droid> Yes, I imagine
14:08:40 <strcat[m]> and if we do have the option to enable prompts for each intent then you definitely need some way to whitelist permanently or it breaks doing anything where the user didn't trigger the action
14:08:56 <strcat[m]> dazinism: yes
14:09:03 <cdesai> dazinism: I should've said one of the ways. It'd be a lot more generic than doing it for just vanadium then
14:09:35 <strcat[m]> dazinism: the chooser is only when there is ambiguity
14:09:48 <cg_droid> strcat[m], so that's why profiles help a lot, I guess
14:09:50 <cdesai> strcat[m]: it must be checking the system for defaults too though
14:10:31 <strcat[m]> yes but you can communicate with a specific app ofc
14:10:33 <strcat[m]> with intents
14:10:36 <strcat[m]> and you can signature check
14:10:51 <strcat[m]> this is how the security model for IPC works
14:10:56 <strcat[m]> apps often signature check what they are sending to
14:11:01 <strcat[m]> or receiving from
14:11:24 <strcat[m]> instead of just allowing anything to fulfill it they can require a specific app id and/or signature
14:11:34 <strcat[m]> and they can do permission checks
14:11:43 <strcat[m]> apps can also invent their own permissions for this stuff
14:12:14 <strcat[m]> you can invent your own runtime permission for a capability your app exposes
14:12:29 <strcat[m]> instead of just exposing it to everything
14:13:05 <strcat[m]> apps decide who is allowed to communicate with them - app ids, signatures, permissions
14:13:52 <strcat[m]> Android 11 is making it so that IPC APIs need to be more explicitly exported though
14:21:40 <strcat[m]> we can do w/e we want in terms of making a UI to control communication betweeen apps
14:21:51 <strcat[m]> just bear in mind it'd be extremely annoying / unusable if you actually had to authorize each thing
14:22:02 <strcat[m]> and it'd be pretty confusing to users if it didn't have an exception for system components
14:22:07 <dazinism> strcat just to confirm, the conversation got a bit hectic, apk28+ blocks all the stuff I'd listed as 'other IPC'. Other than guess can still share data through storage that both apps have been granted access to by user
14:22:11 <strcat[m]> so I think it should only apply to communication between third party apps
14:22:32 <strcat[m]> dazinism: yes and stuff like contacts could be considered storage in that regard
14:22:36 <strcat[m]> but you need to grant them both access
14:22:40 <strcat[m]> or grant both access to same file, etc.
14:22:54 <strcat[m]> for first party apps like Vanadium we can just add the permission checks we want
14:23:07 <strcat[m]> like requiring Network to open URLs automatically rather than giving a prompt to the user
14:23:22 <strcat[m]> for other apps we can make a system for users to control it
14:23:29 <strcat[m]> i..e. communication *between * third party apps
14:24:05 <dazinism> That is a nice improvement then. Time to dump all those lagging apps. Was surprised conversations is still on an old target, thought the dev was pretty on the case.....
14:26:47 <dazinism> Also time for me to update that IPC page
14:27:00 <cg_droid> Great lesson here...
14:27:16 <cg_droid> Thanks a lot
14:29:00 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "so I think it should only apply "> Wouldn't it be better to have 2 toggles to reduce attack surface? One for third party apps. One for third party apps and system components.
14:37:42 <renor> Does Work profile act as user profiles?
14:38:03 <strcat[m]> renor: kind of
14:38:11 <strcat[m]> renor: work profiles are owned by a profile owner app
14:38:17 <strcat[m]> as opposed to your profile which normally you own
14:38:25 <strcat[m]> you don't own the work profile - the app you use to manage it does
14:38:28 <strcat[m]> it sets it up how it wants
14:38:36 <strcat[m]> it can choose if apps inside it can communicate with apps outside it
14:38:51 <strcat[m]> normally... they wouldn't be able to, but this is up to the app managing it to decide
14:39:00 <strcat[m]> work profiles are for enterprise device management
14:39:04 <strcat[m]> so a device management app runs them
14:39:12 <strcat[m]> they are not intended as a way for users to divide things up
14:39:20 <strcat[m]> that's why there can only be one per profile and why it works the way it does
14:39:44 <strcat[m]> the OS implements it but an app is granted control over it by the user
14:40:32 <strcat[m]> renor: there are apps for managing your own work profile - it's just kinda weird, and not how it's intended to be used
14:40:49 <strcat[m]> useful? sure, weird tho
14:40:54 <renor> Any recomendation for an app to manage it?
14:41:16 <strcat[m]> I think you should mostly use user profiles since you aren't limited to just 1 and don'
14:41:30 <strcat[m]>  * I think you should mostly use user profiles since you aren't limited to just 1 and don't need to rely on a third party app
14:41:42 <renor> Ok, thanks
14:41:47 <madaidan[m]> https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/gqw16l/did_anyone_see_this_seems_a_little_farfetched_to/
14:41:54 <madaidan[m]> Does this guy never give up?
14:42:00 <madaidan[m]> 3 accounts he's used now
14:42:04 <madaidan[m]> Ridiculous
14:42:42 <renor> Oh, here we go again
14:43:20 <strcat[m]> ok well fair game to post personal info about Mozilla employees and direct the same hatred towards them when they provide a platform for this
14:43:29 <strcat[m]> and talk about their dishonest / manipulative behavior
14:43:44 <strcat[m]> they chose to support this, give cover to it and give platforms for it
14:46:21 <cg_droid> Sounds already like a coordinate attack...
14:46:30 <strcat[m]> it is one
14:46:41 <strcat[m]> it's a coordinated misinformation and harassment campaign coordinated by Mozilla
14:47:00 <strcat[m]> I receive dozens of inappropriate emails / messages from the people they direct towards me with this every day
14:47:12 <strcat[m]> and they doxxed me and are sharing my address
14:47:23 <strcat[m]> and look at how they provide a platform to do this
14:47:28 <madaidan[m]> Do you've evidence it's Mozilla doing this specifically or not just some guy?
14:47:42 <renor> strcat[m]: Do you know if Google apps like Gcam respect the permissions between apps? How can one know if an app is respecting them?
14:47:43 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: you can see Mozilla employees are active there, supporting and giving cover to it
14:47:52 <strcat[m]> they allow and support posting misinformation / character assassination, etc.
14:47:56 <strcat[m]> you can see what they say in their IRC channel
14:48:07 <strcat[m]> they are fully involved in it and enabling it to happen
14:48:21 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: you can see Mozilla e"> Sure, I can see that but that doesn't mean they're actually the ones doing this
14:48:33 <strcat[m]> they are the ones giving a platform for it and the cover it needs to continue
14:48:38 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "you can see what they say in the"> Any logs somewhere?
14:49:22 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: providing a platform for it, supporting it and giving cover to it
14:49:25 <strcat[m]> makes them the ones doing it
14:49:38 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't be much of a problem if it was just some lone lunatic harassing me and trying to post misinformation
14:49:48 <strcat[m]> but they are supporting it and are involved in the threads
14:50:03 <strcat[m]> they make sure not to refute all this misinformation being posted and they are 100% okay with the character assassination / harassment
14:50:06 <strcat[m]> they are fully complicit with it
14:50:11 <strcat[m]> it would not be able to happen without their involvement
14:50:28 <strcat[m]> so those Mozilla security engineers and other employees are involved and responsible for this
14:50:35 <strcat[m]> and it should be remembered this stuff started with them
14:50:53 <strcat[m]> they were originally the ones doing it - I don't care if it has now become other people doing it on their behalf with their support / cover
14:50:58 <strcat[m]> doesn't change much
14:51:28 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: this was their way of operating back when I was involved in Rust, doesn't change much for it to now be people they support doing it instead of themselves
14:53:29 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: and again they are doing ALL this because I have posted a factual, accurate paragraph describing the state of their mobile browser as part of GrapheneOS documentation
14:54:30 <strcat[m]> https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/gokcis/firefox_is_insecure_refuted/
14:54:40 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: can see there Mozilla employees, etc. are involved
14:54:43 <strcat[m]> and people they work with
14:54:44 <strcat[m]> 100% on them
14:54:50 <strcat[m]> and will be a serious response from me to this
14:56:12 <strcat[m]> I will defend myself from them including listing the people doing it and similar information as what they share about me which they use to harass me
14:56:53 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they are fully capable of just not providing a platform to harass me or countering what's happening and de-escalating it, I haven't done anything beyond posting a paragraph of technical information, the only thing I could do to stop being harassed is stop doing my technical work / documentation
14:57:56 <strcat[m]> what exactly am I supposed to do? not defend myself and let them spread false claims / attacks on me with no one contesting it? is that de-escalating?
14:58:39 <strcat[m]> I could blacklist their app ids / app signatures and just stop working around the incompatibilities or needing to think about it as part of my work
14:58:56 <strcat[m]> remove the info about it
14:59:15 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: anyway fun way to spend a birthday, being harassed by Mozilla people all day
14:59:43 <blacklight447[m]> I already responded there aswell to point out that its a brand new account
14:59:54 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: need a lot more than that
15:00:20 <strcat[m]> and also they locked the previous thread but kept it up so I can't refute all the shit people said about me there
15:00:25 <strcat[m]> they are actively helping them
15:00:35 <strcat[m]> you can see what that moderator did too
15:00:40 <blacklight447[m]> Reported the account as well
15:00:43 <strcat[m]> giving cover for it and legitimizing it
15:00:45 <strcat[m]> and he's involved with Mozilla
15:00:52 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "blacklight447: need a lot more t"> I am aware
15:01:00 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: it won't accomplish anything, they will keep harassing me across platforms with sockpuppets and spreading misinformation
15:01:26 <strcat[m]> Mozilla is going to keep doing this just like they did to me before
15:01:46 <strcat[m]> I had to retire from involvement in the project, remove my own commit access and pretty much never speak of it again to avoid this
15:03:47 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: what have I even done
15:03:52 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "blacklight447: it won't accompli"> Luckly atleast im in a spot where my reddit account has more credibility behind it
15:04:05 <blacklight447[m]> Especially when compared to a 1day old account
15:04:05 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
15:04:08 <strcat[m]> this is what they have a problem with
15:04:26 <TheJollyRoger-M> Sheesh
15:04:50 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: anyway really shows a lot about the lack of ethics, empathy and honesty of Mozilla employees including their security engineers
15:04:56 <strcat[m]> that they use this kind of tactic
15:05:12 <strcat[m]> and yes, they are using it, by being involved / aware of it, active in these threads and conversations about it
15:05:12 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: anyway fun way to spe"> That sucks :(
15:05:18 <strcat[m]> giving it a platform, giving it credibility, giving it cover
15:05:21 <TheJollyRoger-M> Yeah...
15:05:21 <strcat[m]> it is them doing it
15:05:24 <TheJollyRoger-M> Fuck.
15:05:48 <strcat[m]> it is irrelevant whether the sockpuppet accounts are actually theirs - it is still a tool being used by them either way
15:06:08 <strcat[m]> if they don't support it they are free to refute it, stop giving a platform for it, stop giving it cover
15:06:20 <strcat[m]> saying ohhh this sockpuppet account is not us we swear
15:06:23 <strcat[m]> doesn't change anything
15:06:47 <strcat[m]> and they have not said that - and they can't really, because they have a bunch of employees including some who have done stuff like this before
15:07:25 <strcat[m]> I don't even see any of them disavowing involvement in it / refuting it or anything
15:08:06 <strcat[m]> when stuff like this happens and people barely do anything to help that also hurts
15:08:21 <strcat[m]> I am not some robot that's just going to keep doing work on the project while shit like this keeps happening and people don't help
15:12:07 <blacklight447[m]> https://reddit.com/comments/gqw16l/comment/frvimdo
15:12:55 <blacklight447[m]> Look at that, our old friend anonymousjoker is here as well
15:14:20 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: I just need Mozilla to stop giving them a platform for this and to refute misinformation like I do when people make false claims about stuff here
15:14:25 <strcat[m]> but ofc
15:14:28 <strcat[m]> they are not going to do that
15:14:49 <strcat[m]> because this is something they support and are actively participating in and helping
15:14:51 <strcat[m]> it's how they operate as a culture
15:17:14 <madaidan[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Look at that, our old friend ano"> I loathe that guy
15:17:24 <madaidan[m]> Such a prick
15:18:47 <TheJollyRoger-M> My god.
15:19:13 <cg_droid> Can that be evidence to sue them?
15:19:25 <cg_droid> Mozilla I mean
15:19:31 <cg_droid> Maybe it's the only solution
15:20:04 <madaidan[m]> strcat has too much legal shit already going on to be suing mozilla
15:20:17 <cg_droid> ok
15:20:48 <pmn369[m]> Hi all! I've run GrapheneOS on Pixel 4 XL and it works well. You can also try it with my repos https://github.com/paintedman/device_google_coral, https://github.com/paintedman/script and https://github.com/paintedman/android-prepare-vendor
15:21:22 <pmn369[m]> I've also prepared monolithic kernel with patches as like in crosshatch, but I build it separately from OS and I still need to fix something before I will upload it to github. You can use stock kernel with modules from https://android.googlesource.com/device/google/coral-kernel/
15:21:51 <cg_droid> :-o
15:23:44 <blacklight447[m]> Lmao madaidan.  This guy is thick
15:24:04 <madaidan[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Lmao madaidan.  This guy is thic"> I realised that a long time ago
15:24:56 <madaidan[m]> It'd be best if everyone just banned him from everywhere
15:25:12 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: these ppl don't have just 1 account
15:25:16 <madaidan[m]> He always follows me to spread more bullshit
15:25:24 <strcat[m]> what did I even do to deserve them targeting me like this
15:25:37 <strcat[m]> I don't even participate outside the GrapheneOS communities except when I'm targeted like this
15:26:13 <madaidan[m]> Facts + dishonest charlatans always results in disasters
15:26:14 <TheJollyRoger-M> pmn369: woah wow!
15:26:17 <strcat[m]> I don't see any Mozilla employees or anyone else actually disputing the accuracy of what I say
15:26:45 <strcat[m]> all they did is pick one tiny thing I said unrelated to the main topic in response to the OP going off on unrelated tangents
15:26:52 <TheJollyRoger-M> strcat cripes man... I don't know. It's like some of these people have this religion built up, just crazy.
15:26:53 <strcat[m]> and argue about that because it's more subjective
15:27:09 <strcat[m]> and I don't know why they are pretending webRequest extensions are fail safe when they're not
15:27:11 <strcat[m]> it's clearly not
15:27:19 <strcat[m]> pkill the extension with SIGKILL/SIGSEGV yourself
15:27:21 <strcat[m]> see what happens
15:27:23 <madaidan[m]> I've had mozilla employees call my claims FUD before but their only argument was "we're working on it"
15:27:28 <strcat[m]> super easy to test and confirm that what I said is true
15:27:40 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they're a company with a culture of dishonesty and spreading misinformation
15:27:55 <strcat[m]> people working there are influenced by the culture
15:28:10 <strcat[m]> look at how they talk about these things
15:28:21 <strcat[m]> always weasel words, misrepresenting things, never just having an open / accurate discussion
15:28:34 <strcat[m]> very careful to not refute misinformation that is supporting them
15:28:53 <madaidan[m]> Yeah, I've seen that
15:29:02 <strcat[m]> but they'll jump in to try to argue against some minor thing I say - they failed to find anything I said wrong though, they just didn't understand what I was talking about with addons not being fail safe
15:29:10 <strcat[m]> but as I said
15:29:13 <strcat[m]> easy to confirm for yourself
15:29:22 <strcat[m]> pkill it with SIGKILL (like OOM) or SIGSEGV (like some crash)
15:29:24 <strcat[m]> see what happens
15:29:33 <strcat[m]> does all content start being paused / blocked? no
15:29:35 <strcat[m]> it allows everything
15:29:38 <strcat[m]> it's not a fail safe API
15:29:55 <strcat[m]> and that is the ONLY thing anyone even tried to contest other than just posting misinformation
15:29:56 <shortcastle[m]> Even J telegram was on whonix the other day
15:30:16 <shortcastle[m]> Couldnt answer a simole question
15:30:28 <shortcastle[m]> Simple*
15:32:00 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/137#issuecomment-634099948
15:32:14 <strcat[m]> looks like that issue is not fixed and may be worse in some ways than before?
15:32:24 <strcat[m]> valldrac: I might need to revert this and do a new release
15:32:57 <strcat[m]> I might not be able to merge further changes on it until they're heavily tested
15:33:11 <strcat[m]> not just by 1 person
15:33:25 <strcat[m]> I tried leaving it in beta for 2 days but no one said anything was wrong
15:34:30 <valldrac> strcat[m]: sorry about that, we failed to proper test the fix :/
15:35:18 <madaidan[m]> <shortcastle[m] "Couldnt answer a simole question"> He usually dodges stuff
15:35:58 <strcat[m]> anyway just spent my birthday not doing much aside from reading hateful emails and dealing with ongoing harassment
15:36:04 <strcat[m]> and trying to work on the project without proper support
15:36:10 <strcat[m]> and that just keeps going
15:36:27 <valldrac> strcat[m]: I only have one bluetooth speakers to test
15:36:48 <strcat[m]> valldrac: I don't have anything to test other than beacons
15:36:51 <strcat[m]> I can't test audio
15:37:13 <shortcastle[m]> <madaidan[m] "He usually dodges stuff"> There was long exchange of comments
15:37:47 <shortcastle[m]> Even The moderator complained in the morning
15:41:43 <valldrac> strcat[m]: there are three types of A2DP bluetooth devices AUDIO_DEVICE_OUT_BLUETOOTH_A2DP{,_HEADPHONES,_SPEAKER} and imposing a specific order could break the others? it works for my speakers, but can be wrong for other devices
15:42:16 <valldrac> strcat[m]: anyway, revert it and I'll look at it again when I get free time
15:42:32 <valldrac> strcat[m]: sorry for the broken releases
15:42:54 <strcat[m]> valldrac: but the current order is random?
15:42:56 <strcat[m]> if I revert it?
15:43:05 <strcat[m]> did you verify the order is random?
15:43:21 <strcat[m]> I don't know what to do about it.
15:44:52 <valldrac> yes, the order is random with malloc_hardeneded. The issue is that I don't know the expected order. I assume the current one checking other log dumps and my setup, but it's wrong
15:45:26 <valldrac> I have to check how the available device list is initialized in the first place
15:46:37 <strcat[m]> valldrac: maybe the order it initializes them
15:46:46 <strcat[m]> valldrac: that is the order it would *usually* have
15:47:03 <strcat[m]> valldrac: so maybe put some counter or something and sort by that
15:47:22 <strcat[m]> valldrac: try to match the existing order it'd have - usually with jemalloc assuming it's in a new size class
15:47:27 <strcat[m]> the order would be the order they are allocated
15:47:36 <strcat[m]> lowest address first
15:47:36 <valldrac> It can also happen the current order is correct, but that there's a parameter (supported encoding or something like that) that is initialized for AUDIO_DEVICE_OUT_BLUETOOTH_A2DP_HEADPHONES or AUDIO_DEVICE_OUT_BLUETOOTH_A2DP_SPEAKER, instead of AUDIO_DEVICE_OUT_BLUETOOTH_A2DP (which is the top device in the list)
15:48:08 <strcat[m]> valldrac: the current order may not match the order they're initialized tho
15:48:18 <strcat[m]> maybe you made the first one correct but the other two are out of order
15:48:30 <strcat[m]> valldrac: should check what the order is WITHOUT hardened_mallo
15:48:34 <strcat[m]> and make sure you matched that
15:48:38 <strcat[m]> just make it like it normally is
15:48:44 <strcat[m]> and then it shouldn't make things worse only better
15:48:51 <strcat[m]> because it was random before
15:49:15 <valldrac> strcat[m]: yes, that's my idea
15:50:31 <valldrac> strcat[m]: what are you going to do? I don't have time right now until next week
15:51:18 <strcat[m]> valldrac: probably leave it as is
15:51:37 <valldrac> strcat[m]: ok, I'll try to fix it ASAP
15:51:44 <strcat[m]> since I can't see how random would be better other than being able to keep rebooting to get different orders
15:51:58 <strcat[m]> at least some things work consistently now
15:52:05 <strcat[m]> and if it breaks stuff it should break consistently hopefully
15:52:09 <strcat[m]> or MORE consistently at least
15:52:18 <strcat[m]> valldrac: they said rebooting made it work btw
15:52:29 <strcat[m]> valldrac: maybe it just had to force a reconfiguration
15:53:50 <madaidan[m]> The new thread was just locked then deleted by the user before they deleted their whole account
15:54:10 <madaidan[m]> Weird how the mods locked it just before the user deleted it
15:54:16 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they still accomplish their goals
15:54:22 <strcat[m]> madaidan.:  they lock it to prevent posting rebuttals
15:54:53 <williamstopus[m]> <madaidan[m] "Weird how the mods locked it jus"> any idea who it is
15:54:56 <strcat[m]> they are happy with having a thread attacking me / posting misinformation
15:55:08 <williamstopus[m]> call them out
15:55:12 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't be surprised if you see them post and lock immediately
15:55:14 <williamstopus[m]> where is the info about your address?
15:55:22 <madaidan[m]> <williamstopus[m] "call them out"> I did. Multiple times.
15:55:27 <strcat[m]> williamstopus: someone who dislikes me leaked it and now multiple people are sharing that

16:02:19 <strcat[m]> williamstopus: yes
16:03:02 <strcat[m]> they put my address into the public record which is available online by filling out something on my behalf in a way that is not legal
16:03:10 <strcat[m]> and they filled out an optional field to include address to leak my address
16:03:26 <williamstopus[m]> wow
16:03:26 <strcat[m]> they might claim they didn't do it on purpose and didn't realize it would be public, or they didn't realize they didn't have to fill it out
16:03:28 <strcat[m]> but this is what they did
16:03:34 <strcat[m]> and that is just a BS claim they could make
16:03:43 <strcat[m]> they needed my permission to do what they did and didn't have it anyway
16:04:02 <strcat[m]> I don't want to give more details than that to avoid drawing more attention to where they posted my address
16:04:34 <strcat[m]> williamstopus: they did this as part of making a fraudulent claim, and making a claim that would have required my permission and written consent / contract
16:04:35 <strcat[m]> which did not exist
16:04:43 <strcat[m]> posting my address as part of it was just an added spiteful thing to do
16:04:52 <strcat[m]> as a bonus
16:04:59 <strcat[m]> it wasn't the main thing they were doing they just happened to include my address on what is essentially a forgery
16:05:13 <williamstopus[m]> they made a claim?
16:05:13 <strcat[m]> falsely claiming to be me authorizing something I never did

16:27:17 <strcat[m]> it is clear that the moderators in that subreddit - many of whom are  actively involved with Mozilla - are coordinating with the posts and supporting them
16:27:19 <williamstopus[m]> we should start a 4chan thread to take them down
16:27:31 <strcat[m]> williamstopus: please don't make things worse
16:27:36 <williamstopus[m]> is the release on beta?
16:28:17 <strcat[m]> there is no reason to have any posts about this BS at all on reddit, there is nothing that has happened aside from these people throwing a fit and trying to direct harassment towards me over an accurate paragraph in our docs
16:28:23 <dlm-johannes[m]> Thank you for that information. Why bother about them?
16:28:24 <dlm-johannes[m]> We could also ask Mozilla for comment if they post threats
16:28:38 <strcat[m]> dlm-johannes: some of them follow me, they are notably silent

16:29:57 <williamstopus[m]> <strcat[m] "the moderators are actively coor"> what can we do to help
16:30:28 <strcat[m]> they are more interesting in stopping me from responding (they removed my initial response and I had to repost it) and trying to find some tiny point in what I said that they can try to go off on
16:30:31 <strcat[m]> they failed pretty hard at that though
16:30:32 <strcat[m]> but it is clear what they're doing
16:30:46 <strcat[m]> and they could claim that it isn't them posting from the sockpuppet accounts - but they are actively supporting it
16:31:03 <strcat[m]> I don't think it's particularly important who is hiding behind those accounts
16:31:15 <strcat[m]> what's important is you can see Mozilla supports this, this is the tactics they use
16:31:24 <strcat[m]>  * what's important is you can see Mozilla supports this, these are the tactics they use
16:32:13 <williamstopus[m]> strcat: what is the plan to coutner this?
16:32:14 <strcat[m]> they give the sockpuppet accounts cover (they get involved in the thread, etc. but don't refute all the misinformation - just focus on promoting their product, not keeping discussion accurate or stopping character assassination / false claims)
16:32:25 <strcat[m]> the sockpuppet accounts give them cover
16:32:25 <madaidan[m]> <williamstopus[m] "what can we do to help"> Counter the bullshit
16:32:33 <strcat[m]> since it allows attacking people with a bunch of misinformation / false claims

16:32:50 <strcat[m]> while it not being clear who is doing it

16:33:20 <williamstopus[m]> have not receiving it yet
16:33:23 <williamstopus[m]> should I reboot?
16:33:44 <strcat[m]> no
16:33:46 <ThomCat[m]> Which mozilla.org chatroom?
16:34:00 <ThomCat[m]> (I'm not going to start anything, just want the logs myself)
16:34:11 <strcat[m]> ThomCat: I'm talking about what they are posting on reddit and 4chan - it was discussed in some of the Mozilla irc channels like security
16:34:20 <strcat[m]> a lot of them are aware of it, some of them follow me on Twitter
16:34:48 <strcat[m]> what is notable is their lack of involvement aside from talking about it themselves, trying to find ways to counter what I said (and failing), participating in the thread but only on peripheral tangent topics
16:34:53 <strcat[m]> you can see they are aware and involvement
16:35:08 <ThomCat[m]> Right, no I get that, I thought they had entirely shut down their IRC and moved to Matrix?  Maybe they are just bridged for now
16:35:14 <strcat[m]> and that they officially support / endorse spreading misinformation / false claims and using character assassination and targeted attacks on individuals to silence technical discussion
16:35:29 <strcat[m]> ThomCat: I don't know I guess it's Matrix now
16:35:34 <strcat[m]> I was just looking at the logs

16:53:30 <williamstopus[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "What's the AOSP Alliance?"> #aospalliance
17:09:19 <BrokenCog> hellos.  After flashing GrapheneOS, the /install# page mentions 'fastboot erase avb_key' before re-flashing stock Android.  are there any other steps? Because when I flash the AOSP, I get "Can't find valid operating system" at the device restarts.
17:10:08 <strcat[m]> AOSP is not the stock OS
17:10:46 <strcat[m]> the instructions are for flashing GrapheneOS and the extra section just documents one extra thing that needs to be done when moving away from GrapheneOS
17:10:59 <strcat[m]> the instructions work fine for the official releases of GrapheneOS along with the stock OS
17:11:18 <strcat[m]> if you're trying to use them for something else and it doesn't work, it is probably not built properly
17:13:10 <strcat[m]> also it's not really the end of the world if people don't erase the avb key - they can still flash the stock OS and lock it anyway
17:13:23 <strcat[m]> I just made sure to give complete instructions
17:13:45 <strcat[m]> to restore it to the factory state without a custom AVB key for the yellow boot state to work
17:14:11 <BrokenCog> alright.  so, nothing else needed.  thanks.
17:41:48 <thelearner[m]> altoslos: try Magic Earth app

17:55:35 <cg_droid> lol
17:55:54 <joshman[m]> <altoslos[m] "i routed a frequent route i have"> Try Magic Earth. Is much better than OSM which looks like we are still in the early 2000s
17:56:23 <thelonewolf[m]> <altoslos[m] "and has anyone gotten microG to "> Use calyxos instead of GOS if u want to use microg
17:57:18 <strcat[m]> altoslos: consider just using google maps in the browser
17:57:42 <strcat[m]> there are some decent apps just not osmand
17:57:46 <strcat[m]> osmand is overly recommended
17:57:55 <strcat[m]> I think people who recommend it mostly don't try using it, it sucks
17:58:11 <thelonewolf[m]> <strcat[m] "I think people who recommend it "> 110%
17:58:12 <renor> strcat[m]: Which one would you recommend?
17:58:27 <strcat[m]> https://maps.me/ has some issues but it's actually usable
17:58:34 <strcat[m]> I would not say I recommend it
17:58:52 <strcat[m]> altoslos: I'd recommend just running it in Vanadium in incognito
17:58:52 <renor> Okay I'll take a look
17:59:00 <strcat[m]> altoslos: or try maps.me
17:59:06 <cn3m[m]>  @altoslos:tchncs.de no notifications right?
17:59:17 <joshman[m]> Osm sucks big time. Magic earth is the best out of all I have tried. Maps.me is Yandex which is Russian NSA
17:59:22 <strcat[m]> there was some fork of maps.me trying to strip certain stuff out, etc. but afaik that stalled
17:59:47 <strcat[m]> I don't think it needs any permissions beyond location in foreground tho
18:00:12 <EssentialChaos[m> <joshman[m] "Osm sucks big time. Magic earth "> Correction: Yandex is Russian Google, not NSA
18:00:14 <thelonewolf[m]> Nothing beats google maps though
18:00:24 <strcat[m]> yandex is funny
18:00:35 <strcat[m]> I had to make an account with them for webmaster tools access
18:00:43 <strcat[m]> so I have some yandex email they send mail to in russian
18:00:50 <strcat[m]> trying to get me to use their wallet or whatever else
18:00:54 <renor> 😂
18:01:17 <strcat[m]> it's set to english but they send a ton of stuff in russian
18:01:18 <strcat[m]> and I click doc links and it's in russian
18:01:28 <EssentialChaos[m> > so I have some yandex email they send mail to in russian
18:01:29 <joshman[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Correction: Yandex is Russian Go"> Russian Google is Russian NSA
18:01:30 <strcat[m]> I deleted the DNS entries used to verify the site at one point because I don't like the cruft
18:01:35 <strcat[m]> and I didn't realize they regularly recheck them
18:01:51 <strcat[m]> so they deleted the webmaster tools access AND in retaliation wiped the page from their search index
18:01:53 <strcat[m]> weird stuff
18:02:11 <strcat[m]> I added it back and they added the site back to search index from scratch
18:02:29 <strcat[m]> like... how the hell does getting unverified for webmaster tools impact the search index
18:02:41 <strcat[m]> also think they are upset I am not making 'turbo pages'
18:02:46 <joshman[m]> <thelonewolf[m] "Nothing beats google maps though"> Waze beats it if we speak turn by turn navigation in car. Still Google though
18:02:46 <strcat[m]> some thing they want sites to do
18:02:59 <EssentialChaos[m> > so I have some yandex email they send mail to in russian
18:02:59 <EssentialChaos[m> Imho, that's their biggest  mistake: they target only Russian-speaking markets
18:03:11 <strcat[m]> I will give them credit for not having completely horrible webmaster tools like google's overhauled ones
18:03:14 <strcat[m]> google ruined their tools
18:03:32 <strcat[m]> I used to be able to look at which backlinks to the site existed including finding 404 links
18:03:38 <strcat[m]> and then I could redirect those to the appropriate page
18:03:52 <strcat[m]> but google broke all their tools in the overhaul - they are now super slow, horrible web 4.0 crap
18:04:03 <strcat[m]> everything takes ages, the UI sucks, and the info is mostly gone
18:04:14 <strcat[m]> bing is busy doing the same kind of overhaul - I don't get it
18:04:25 <strcat[m]> I really miss being able to see who was linking to my sites and fix their broken links
18:04:34 <strcat[m]> bing and yandex are too bad to find many of the backlinks
18:04:43 <strcat[m]> google has a massive db of backlinks and won't let me access it anymore

18:05:00 <strcat[m]> bing thinks there are like 42 links to grapheneos.org on the internet
18:05:03 <strcat[m]> quality search engine
18:05:43 <strcat[m]> yandex forgot the site existed at all cause of removing their TXT verify entry lol
18:06:02 <strcat[m]> super annoying how things want you to put a top-level TXT record
18:06:15 <strcat[m]> instead of _yandex.grapheneos.org they want you to just put it for grapheneos.org (@)
18:06:33 <strcat[m]> so you end up with this ever growing top-level TXT record with all these verify things
18:06:54 <EssentialChaos[m> > yandex forgot the site existed at all cause of removing their TXT verify entry lol

18:09:24 <strcat[m]> it's so dumb that the default is ppl can do stuff on your behalf
18:09:24 <strcat[m]> anyone
18:09:32 <cg_droid> strcat[m], does something happen if we delete all the apps from Sensors permissions?, I did it and all works fine
18:09:43 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: I mean, they can't access sensor data, that's it
18:09:57 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: the reason EVERY APP has the toggle is because apps don't have to add a permission to do it in iOS or stock Android
18:10:03 <cg_droid> strcat[m], I was wondering if any default app needs it
18:10:08 <strcat[m]> so GrapheneOS doesn't know which subset of apps need sensors access
18:10:24 <strcat[m]> there might be zero apps that actually use it in the stock OS - I dunno

18:11:54 <strcat[m]> williamstopus: you know how when you link to a site on twitter, etc. it puts a preview?
18:12:02 <strcat[m]> basically facebook lets them edit the preview
18:12:10 <strcat[m]> on our behalf
18:12:17 <strcat[m]> to make it look like we said something we didn't, etc.
18:12:24 <strcat[m]> unless you deal with this BS
18:12:29 <strcat[m]> and give facebook a bunch of info
18:12:33 <williamstopus[m]> <strcat[m] "williamstopus: people can post a"> what were they posting?
18:12:36 <williamstopus[m]> you supporting trump?
18:12:45 <strcat[m]> williamstopus: someone posted some weird ad
18:12:49 <strcat[m]> I dunno what the intent was
18:12:53 <strcat[m]> I dealt with it now
18:13:32 <strcat[m]> I had to give facebook a picture of my passport at one point because an account I used elsewhere got locked
18:13:33 <williamstopus[m]> okay
18:13:34 <strcat[m]> and relies on fb for verification
18:13:34 <williamstopus[m]> someone looking for keywords to troll maybe
18:13:38 <strcat[m]> I covered half the info like the issue #
18:13:49 <strcat[m]> I think verification is automatic
18:14:04 <strcat[m]> altoslos: did you try maps.me
18:15:12 <strcat[m]> btw it's from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru not yandex
18:15:58 <strcat[m]> it's open source but does have ads, etc. in the normal build but they can be turned off in settings
18:16:01 <strcat[m]> (maps.me)
18:16:17 <strcat[m]> the attempted fork lost steam afaict
18:16:36 <strcat[m]> maps.me doesn't want other people using their servers in a fork so you have to host your own server - which is fine, it's all open source
18:16:49 <strcat[m]> and unlike Signal no reason to really want to use their server
18:16:58 <strcat[m]> but makes it more involved than just a client side fork
18:17:03 <strcat[m]> since you need to host the map data tiles
18:17:14 <strcat[m]> and other stuff you want to work
18:17:15 <EssentialChaos[m> Mail.ru isn't much better than Yandex if at all
18:24:19 <thelearner[m]> altoslos: aurora
18:24:41 <thelearner[m]> Store
18:25:43 <thelearner[m]> altoslos: okay. Up to you.
18:25:47 <thelonewolf[m]> <altoslos[m] "u sure Magic Earth is on fdroid?"> It's not open source so it is not on fdroid
18:27:45 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/grsecurity/status/1252558055629299712 lol that's pretty bad
18:28:01 <strcat[m]> lots of worse things tho
18:28:23 <strcat[m]> just kinda amusing it's not noticed that the kernel is leaking a huge chunk of private kernel data into each coredump
18:28:36 <strcat[m]> 'many eyes'
18:28:45 <strcat[m]> since 2016
18:29:28 <strcat[m]> wonder how many obvious remote infoleaks there are happily leaking data in the real world without ppl (even attackers) noticing

19:04:12 <joshman[m]> <altoslos[m] "i was wrong, osm is actually ama"> No doubt. If we were in 2001
19:04:20 <shortcastle[m]> Anyone has knowledge about it?
19:21:33 <strcat[m]> shortcastle: no not really but fonts are definitely attack surface i.e. the font could be evil somehow
19:21:56 <strcat[m]> really hard to see how it could be evil other than trying to exploit the font renderer tho
19:22:24 <madaidan[m]> Those disgusting curly fonts are pretty evil imo
19:22:33 <cn3m[m]> Can Mozilla just drop out? I don't see what they are contributing at this point. Apple makes a much stronger argument for privacy and the open web
19:23:05 <strcat[m]> cn3m: may happen anyway and then Rust can be free of the web browser influence on it
19:23:10 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "really hard to see how it could "> They can exploit my eyes

19:24:10 <cn3m[m]> I wouldn't be sad if Firefox went away or became Firefox Chromium
19:24:19 <strcat[m]> cn3m: they currently depend on misleading people about privacy and security to retain usage share to keep the money rolling
19:24:31 <strcat[m]> usage share is their #1 concern, always
19:24:40 <cn3m[m]> competition is only good if they don't bring down the people doing the hard work down
19:24:44 <strcat[m]> remember them doing all that fake fretting about DRM
19:24:48 <strcat[m]> and they added it happily at the same time
19:25:02 <cn3m[m]> Mozilla is actively undermining the proper security and privacy work of Google and Apple
19:25:04 <strcat[m]> every time
19:25:11 <strcat[m]> I used to do a lot of volunteer work with them
19:25:17 <cn3m[m]> with FUD and privacy/security theater
19:25:26 <strcat[m]> I learned how they are from that close proximity and inside look at them
19:25:32 <strcat[m]> I went to that 2013 or w/e Mozilla Summit
19:25:37 <strcat[m]> whenever it was - can't recall
19:25:48 <strcat[m]> and it really gave me a good perspective on their fucked up way of doing things

19:26:47 <cn3m[m]> shortcastle: I am on reddit everyday debunking myths about firefox and lineage
19:26:48 <strcat[m]> shrug
19:27:18 <shortcastle[m]> cn3m: yes i recognise the username,you also on other rooms here aswell
19:27:25 <cn3m[m]> I spend 3-5 of my free time a day, this community needs a lot of work
19:27:31 <strcat[m]> cn3m: it's a company with extremely highly paid executives and engineers
19:27:45 <strcat[m]> cn3m: depending on usage share to keep money rolling
19:27:50 <cn3m[m]> shortcastle: ah gotcha, sorry I am sure you weren't targeting me
19:27:54 <shortcastle[m]> cn3m: are you from privacytoolsio?
19:28:01 <strcat[m]> and with this culture of feeling like they are a cannot-do-any-wrong underdog that is the saviour of the internet
19:28:01 <cn3m[m]> strcat: since profit matters more than anything
19:28:12 <strcat[m]> so this makes anything acceptable as long as it supports themselves
19:28:20 <strcat[m]> ends justify the means
19:28:28 <cn3m[m]> shortcastle: I operate mainly on there, but I am not a member. I do what I can to help
19:28:45 <strcat[m]> lying about privacy/security stuff justifies the end goal of increasing usage share because they see themselves as the good side and block out seeing anyone else
19:28:46 <cn3m[m]> strcat: people love a good underdog story
19:29:31 <cn3m[m]> I call them out of their bs like unblockable google analytics and hidden telemtry
19:29:33 <cn3m[m]> shitty differential privacy
19:29:46 <strcat[m]> usage share extremely important to them since the basis of their revenue is selling eyes to companies like Google
19:29:53 <strcat[m]> if they are privacy focused why are the searches of their users something they sell to the highest bidder
19:30:05 <strcat[m]> that is the fundamental basis of the company
19:30:13 <cn3m[m]> security is the least of my concerns with Firefox right now
19:30:23 <shortcastle[m]> At least one thing is sure 100% that Micay has succeded he turned the corner and doesnt matter how much missinfo mozilla does his name comes up everywhere
19:30:50 <shortcastle[m]> Everywhere you read his name comes up
19:30:53 <strcat[m]> it's their reputation that gets harmed by this shit really
19:30:56 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "if they are privacy focused why "> well this goes for Apple too.. The system is screwed only browser I remember actually defaulting to a sane search is Vanadium
19:31:22 <strcat[m]> cn3m: not sure I'd really call duckduckgo sane but yeah
19:31:23 <strcat[m]> lol
19:31:27 <cn3m[m]> shortcastle: Daniel is doing the hard work of 3 people and doing it well
19:31:41 <strcat[m]> duckduckgo isn't very good honestly
19:31:51 <strcat[m]> and they spread misinformation themselves
19:31:52 <strcat[m]> I don't have much faith in them
19:31:59 <cn3m[m]> he is a community manager, a rom developer, researcher, and server admin
19:32:08 <shortcastle[m]> I made a comment on whonix few days back
19:32:25 <strcat[m]> I would like a better alternative to set than duckduckgo
19:32:27 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: not sure I'd really call d"> is there a better option that has any sort of transparency?
19:32:38 <shortcastle[m]> And james donaldosn or whatever his name came on chat
19:32:39 <strcat[m]> I don't really want to set one that just proxies results although that is largely what duckduckgo does anyway
19:32:43 <strcat[m]> like duckduckgo is just crappier bing
19:32:43 <algebro[m]> My calls are still going to the phone speakers with Bluetooth a2dp offloading enabled, anyone else have that happen?
19:33:08 <strcat[m]> algebro: try rebooting, it's not necessarily fixed
19:33:10 <strcat[m]> algebro: that one specific bug is 'fixed'
19:33:28 <strcat[m]> but the 'fix' just makes the order static - not necessarily the correct order, and maybe something else being broken is the real cause
19:33:42 <algebro[m]> Cool, not a big deal, just wasn't sure if that was a known thing
19:34:16 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "I don't really want to set one t"> You could set Ecosia, at least it helps the environment, afaik

19:35:42 <algebro[m]> Yeah I saw the original patch, I can dig into it later, driving
19:35:56 <strcat[m]> algebro: may be order is still different
19:36:00 <strcat[m]> or there may be a similar problem elsewhere
19:36:07 <EssentialChaos[m> > goes straight to bing
19:36:07 <EssentialChaos[m> Everything?
19:36:16 <strcat[m]> algebro: it could be that this doesn't match order it allocates which is prob what it's supposed to be
19:36:17 <strcat[m]> algebro: dunno
19:36:28 <cn3m[m]> EssentialChaos: enough check their privacy policy
19:36:31 <strcat[m]> algebro: maybe need to override more than operator< too
19:36:31 <cn3m[m]> it is basically like a pinky promise from Bing to not spy on you
19:36:47 <strcat[m]> well it does this do_compare override

19:36:55 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "like duckduckgo is just crappier"> DDG has always been good for me
19:37:05 <madaidan[m]> Unless searching for some very specific thing

19:39:55 <EssentialChaos[m> Is Ecosia using https for marketing?
19:40:47 <cyredanthem[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): Firefox is so close to fixing the basic issues at least on Windows. Strict CFG can be forced and Fission is getting good. They just don't care
19:41:00 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox for Windows just needs some testing and priority and a new media player
19:41:14 <strcat[m]> CFG isn't like Clang CFI
19:41:16 <cyredanthem[m]> Or just steal the Chrome one
19:41:23 <strcat[m]> it's coarse CFI, not type-based CFI
19:41:36 <EssentialChaos[m> > Or just steal the Chrome one
19:41:36 <EssentialChaos[m> It's not stealing, it's open-source
19:41:37 <strcat[m]> Intel CET is almost available for coarse CFI on x86 anyway?
19:41:47 <cyredanthem[m]> I didn't know that thanks strcat (@strcat:matrix.org)
19:41:59 <cyredanthem[m]> EssentialChaos: I know I was being facetious
19:42:01 <cyredanthem[m]> I stand corrected
19:42:08 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "Intel CET is almost available fo"> Isn't CET quite shabby?
19:42:10 <strcat[m]> cyredanthem: coarse CFI enforces that only functions can be called, and ideally only indirectly callable functions
19:42:29 <strcat[m]> cyredanthem: Clang CFI enforces that only indirectly callable functions can be called indirectly, and that the type matches
19:42:32 <strcat[m]> much finer-grained
19:42:36 <cyredanthem[m]> Strict CFG isn't what I was thinking my bad
19:43:11 <strcat[m]> usually nothing is done about returns other than linear overflow protection
19:43:19 <strcat[m]> Android uses ShadowCallStack (for the kernel mostly)
19:43:37 <strcat[m]> lacks hardware feature to protect the shadow stack atm
19:43:43 <strcat[m]> protecting returns is actually easier to do well with hardware support
19:43:51 <strcat[m]> cause you can have a good hardware shadow stack, etc.
19:44:12 <strcat[m]> and is finer-grained than just enforcing types
19:44:16 <strcat[m]> it enforces the control flow matches what it should
19:44:39 <strcat[m]> but in software something can write to the shadow stack using an arbitrary write
19:44:46 <strcat[m]> so lack of hardware support makes it depend on ASLR, etc.
19:45:10 <strcat[m]> intel CET is a hardware shadow stack (potential to be really good) + efficient coarse CFI (meh)
19:45:37 <strcat[m]> coarse cfi just enforces that you can't jump into the middle of a function or w/e
19:45:40 <strcat[m]> only call actual functions
19:45:42 <strcat[m]> but ANY
19:46:02 <strcat[m]> shadow stack is just for returns
19:46:35 <strcat[m]> not indirect calls (function pointers, virtual function tables for C++ virtual functions, also non-virtual indirect method calls, etc.)
19:47:13 <strcat[m]> SafeStack tries to protect anything on the stack without address taken but kinda fails hard at it in practice since it depends on ASLR too but it's easier to leak the address
19:47:18 <strcat[m]> and lacks a way to enforce it in hw
19:47:36 <strcat[m]> memory tagging might be able to help with these things
19:47:42 <strcat[m]> reserve a tag value for internal use by libc
19:47:46 <strcat[m]> and use it for shadow stacks, etc.
19:47:50 <strcat[m]> and have compiler use that tag
19:48:06 <strcat[m]> and malloc, etc. exclude that tag for use
19:49:27 <madaidan[m]> I find CFI really interesting
19:49:44 <madaidan[m]> It's cool
19:50:58 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm sorry I didn't research that better before making such a statement. Thank you for the explanation and information
19:51:22 <strcat[m]> chromium uses Clang CFI on ChromeOS / desktop Linux
19:51:27 <strcat[m]> and it works for Android but there are size concerns
19:51:30 <madaidan[m]> Isn't CFG being worked on to be more fine-grained though? I.e. XFG
19:51:51 <strcat[m]> they are in the process of doing it for Windows, the issue is deploying Clang CFI there
19:52:54 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE37dMC
19:54:08 <madaidan[m]> Yeah I saw that a while ago
20:08:56 <strcat[m]> basically tho it isn't that yet
20:09:06 <strcat[m]> and Google wants to use Clang and Clang CFI on Windows
20:09:26 <strcat[m]> it may make more sense to just use what Microsoft ends up providing
20:09:37 <strcat[m]> or use what Microsoft provides for what they can't cover with Clang CFI
20:10:14 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: Chromium uses CFG like that already
20:10:21 <strcat[m]> i.e. for system DLLs etc
20:17:29 <cyredanthem[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): does CFG vs Strict CFG make a notable difference?
20:18:31 <strcat[m]> cyredanthem: that just prevents loading DLLs without it doesn't it?
20:18:40 <strcat[m]> doesn't really do anything aside from preventing you from screwing up
20:18:48 <strcat[m]> in an obvious way
20:19:06 <cyredanthem[m]> That's my understand
20:19:10 <strcat[m]> and that's assuming you are using something better like Clang CFI
20:19:14 <cyredanthem[m]> Understanding*
20:19:18 <strcat[m]> in which case you won't have CFG for those

21:02:52 <strcat[m]> Android <= 9 only and patched in the April security patch so old news now
21:03:26 <cn3m[m]> yes that's not relevant you shouldn't ever use an old version of Android
21:13:11 <mxnorvak[m]> Yea true sry, but poor those users that only get a new phone when the old one dies which means its been a long time they're without any OS or security patch update
21:14:20 <cn3m[m]> The only phones people should ever buy are iPhones and Pixels
21:15:04 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "The only phones people should ev"> Unfortunately, former are expensive and not everyone wants them and the latter are not available in some places
21:15:22 <cn3m[m]> well then get a used iPhone?
21:15:48 <EssentialChaos[m> There are people who don't want an iPhone
21:15:52 <cn3m[m]> here a great condition iPhone 8 with a good battery can go as low as $150 with 2.5-4.5 years left
21:16:23 <cn3m[m]>  @essentialchaos:tchncs.de Android phones are just more expensive per year. If you can't afford them iPhones are the cheap option
21:17:10 <EssentialChaos[m> I didn't say Android flagships are not expensive
21:17:26 <cn3m[m]> I mean you get what you pay for
21:18:12 <EssentialChaos[m> True, but both Android flagships and iPhones have features, that I don't need, but still have to pay for
21:19:08 <cn3m[m]>  @essentialchaos:tchncs.de iPhone SE and Pixel 3a are super barebones
21:19:32 <EssentialChaos[m> iPhone SE on the other hand lacks some things...
21:19:33 <EssentialChaos[m> Like a bigger screen
21:19:39 <EssentialChaos[m> And a bigger battery
21:19:52 <cn3m[m]> the battery is more than a day easy
21:19:52 <EssentialChaos[m> 3a is nice, but again not available in some places
21:20:28 <EssentialChaos[m> With what usage?
21:20:39 <cn3m[m]> Google and Apple only have each other as competition so what's there to expect?
21:21:06 <cn3m[m]>  @essentialchaos:tchncs.de I've a few friends with them and they are doing content consumption all the time
21:21:09 <EssentialChaos[m> iPhone SE also has that A13, that it doesn't need, but probably has to sacrifice some battery life for it
21:21:13 <cn3m[m]> videos, games, Facebook
21:21:27 <cn3m[m]> A13 is super efficient
21:21:48 <cn3m[m]> and it will make it usable still in 5 years
21:21:55 <EssentialChaos[m> Ok, still have an issue with that screen
21:22:11 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "and it will make it usable still"> If battery doesn't die

21:22:56 <cn3m[m]> $450 for 5 years out of a phone is great
21:24:02 <EssentialChaos[m> Ok, that solves the battery, but I still have an issue with 4.7" screen
21:24:20 <cn3m[m]> wait for the Plus rumored to launch beginning of next year?

21:58:17 <M0xC0ncord[m]> strcat: I noticed that media playing works after the latest update but I haven't tried calls. I can test it on my 3a tomorrow.
21:58:46 <strcat[m]> need development help too
21:59:09 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Yeahh... My Android knowledge on that front is extremely limited... :(
22:00:19 <strcat[m]> not asking you specifically :P
22:00:20 <strcat[m]> but the channel
22:00:25 <strcat[m]> valldrac helped a lot but this requires more help
22:00:35 <strcat[m]> valldrac doesn't have enough hardware to test etc
22:03:42 <valldrac> Yes, exactly. I'm going to order a bluetooth headset with microphone to test calls. But I don't think it will be enough
22:04:56 <qyo3462572445[m]> cn3m do you run openBSD on desktop?
22:04:57 <valldrac> so please, if have any issue with bluetooth audio, follow https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/137#issuecomment-633990360 and provide us with the sysdump for audio
22:05:18 <madaidan[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "cn3m do you run openBSD on deskt"> His profile pictures are sarcastic
22:05:49 <qyo3462572445[m]> <madaidan[m] "His profile pictures are sarcast"> Copy. Figured I'd ask.
22:11:35 <strcat[m]> valldrac: sounds a bit like it fixed music and broke calls
22:11:45 <strcat[m]> but I don't see how it'd break calls if before it was randomized and now it has an order that makes sense
22:25:32 <cn3m[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "cn3m do you run openBSD on deskt"> it's pretty bad OS tbh
22:38:06 <xabierd[m]> They advertise it to be very secure, what is the catch?
22:43:04 <strcat[m]> I don't think it's a bad OS for the use case it fits
22:57:53 <cn3m[m]>  @xabierd:matrix.org it is out of the box, but the whole security model falls apart after that
22:57:54 <cn3m[m]> especially if you use it as a desktop
22:57:55 <cn3m[m]> which is mainly the context I meant it in
22:58:13 <cn3m[m]> the mitigations are a little underwhelming in some ways
23:13:28 <nickcalyx[m]> I have used openbsd as a desktop and as a server
23:13:51 <nickcalyx[m]> Its a bit hard to work with but its unique
23:14:24 <cn3m[m]>  @nickcalyx:matrix.org no sandboxing on your browser is a deal break imo
23:15:27 <nickcalyx[m]> We used to have sun SPARC 20's with dual headed sun monitors at my old old office
23:15:37 <nickcalyx[m]> And we had a VAX running openbsd
23:16:00 <nickcalyx[m]> I don't think any browsers had sandboxing back then
23:18:15 <nickcalyx[m]> It literally took 5 or more minutes to login via ssh on the VAX.. Because of key exchange and the crypto calculations. You had to.crank the timeouts on both client and server
23:19:51 <cn3m[m]>  @nickcalyx:matrix.org holy cow
23:19:54 <nickcalyx[m]> Now you kids get off my lawn
23:32:08 <strcat[m]> cn3m: doesn't have the most modern mitigations but it's a lot simpler and more minimal which has value too
23:32:30 <strcat[m]> to run on some machine to run a specific service
23:32:36 <strcat[m]> works well for that
23:36:36 <cn3m[m]> what are you thoughts on Hardened BSD?
23:37:00 <strcat[m]> they do good work but I'd rather start from OpenBSD for a server use case, fork that
23:37:36 <madaidan[m]> HardenedOpenBSD
23:37:55 <cn3m[m]> that's a good point. I usually just use Linux for servers as that's what I know
23:38:09 <cn3m[m]> I will try OpenBSD someday
23:39:11 <nickcalyx[m]> I use hardenedbsd for.things
23:39:56 <nickcalyx[m]> Like the firewall/VPN distro I use, opnsense is based on hardeeedbsd
23:40:41 <nickcalyx[m]> I was running all my Tor nodes on hardenedbsd but switched back to Debian because their algorithms are much slower on BSD than linux
23:41:50 <travankor_> nickcalyx: give alpine linux a shot, too
23:48:14 <JTL> nickcalyx[m]: Which algorithms?
23:48:49 <nickcalyx[m]> Tor's scheduler
23:50:28 <JTL> Ah
23:51:07 <gervarouge[m]> Is Windows 10 Enterprise the most secure and private OS right now? Some of the features are looking awfully good
23:53:19 <madaidan[m]> "private" is very debatable due to the invasive telemetry.
23:54:31 <madaidan[m]> It's not the most secure by far unless you're talking specifically about popular desktop OSes then it'd be up there along with macOS and ChromeOS.
23:56:27 <madaidan[m]> Some of the "most secure" would be mobile devices since they've a far better security model than desktops
23:59:14 <strcat[m]> windows enterprise lets you turn off the telemetry
23:59:31 <strcat[m]> other than very basic stuff comparable to anything really
23:59:53 <strcat[m]> also don't really consider much of that invasive
