00:00:36 <M1eyejack[m]> With GrapheneOS, suggestions on a ETH wallet thats not from andriod(auroua) store, anyone have a good suggestion, looking for a apk for myethewallet or exodus, but they dont seem to have one.  best one i have found is a company called greenaddress, anyone use them?
00:13:43 <M1eyejack[m]> seems like greenadrress is only bitcoin, there is wallETH, anyone use them?
00:57:42 <renlord> powershell is just such a weird shell compared to *nix
00:57:51 <renlord> this will take a while to get use to
00:58:23 <renlord> win10 comes with stock core isolation + memory integrity protection
00:58:36 <renlord> easy to setup also
01:31:58 <dan-v[m]> does anyone know of an android client that supports proper oauth authentication to sync google calendar without relying on an on device account / google services? i was able to sync mail with imap (but required organization to turn on insecure apps) and primary calendar with davx (with unsupported method according to google), but can't get "other calendars" to work with davx. the only android client i have found so far
01:31:58 <dan-v[m]> that doesn't rely on the on device account is microsoft outlook :/
02:53:51 <aeonsolution[m]> dan-v: I haven't used it but you should look into https://www.etesync.com/; maybe thats what you're looking for
03:03:45 <cyredanthem[m]> Great the guy reposted his hit piece on ptio now
03:13:14 <dan-v[m]> aeonsolution: I do use etesync for personal calendar/contacts and it works great, but google account is for work
03:17:13 <aeonsolution[m]> dang, ok I'll let you know if I come across anything that supports oauth
03:17:26 <aeonsolution[m]> for android*
03:19:34 <dan-v[m]> thanks aeonsolution, appreciate it
06:48:21 <propertype> Offtopic: Chromium Releases. Newest stable release jumped from 81.XXX to 83.XXX lately. Why?
06:48:44 <propertype> What's with the 82.xxx release?
06:49:58 <cyredanthem[m]> > What's with the 82.xxx release?
06:49:58 <cyredanthem[m]> Coronavirus
06:50:34 <cyredanthem[m]> They didn't release 82
06:52:15 <cyredanthem[m]> It stayed in beta due developers being a little tied up
06:52:36 <cyredanthem[m]> They focused on security and video calling
06:52:58 <cyredanthem[m]> Chrome and Firefox were surprisingly very behind on video conferences
06:53:54 <cyredanthem[m]> Welcome
06:59:05 <thelearner[m]> What you guys think bout using Extensions in browsers?
06:59:48 <thelearner[m]> > Great the guy reposted his hit piece on ptio now
06:59:48 <thelearner[m]> Just read it, guys sounded little wacky haha
06:59:51 <cyredanthem[m]> > What you guys think bout using Extensions in browsers?
06:59:51 <cyredanthem[m]> It's the highest risk thing you probably do
07:00:22 <cyredanthem[m]> Extensions in browsers should be handled carefully
07:00:55 <thelearner[m]> I use UOB for ads. Which ones should be the go to?
07:01:12 <cyredanthem[m]> System and are you using a VPN?
07:01:20 <cyredanthem[m]> Brave or regular Chromium?
07:01:59 <thelearner[m]> Ungoogled, cause wanted to try it out. But later will switch back to Brave.
07:02:11 <thelearner[m]> And no to VPN.
07:03:03 <cyredanthem[m]> I'd use network level blocking then
07:03:05 <cyredanthem[m]> Don't use any add-on
07:03:26 <thelearner[m]> Adguard for DNS?
07:03:39 <cyredanthem[m]> NextDNS can be very powerful too
07:03:47 <cyredanthem[m]> NextDNS is more powerful for are
07:03:50 <cyredanthem[m]> Sure*
07:04:42 <cyredanthem[m]> You can block new domains that have been registered for less than 30 days, blocked parked domains, and even TLD level blocking
07:05:10 <cyredanthem[m]> The logging is really helpful
07:06:12 <cyredanthem[m]> NextDNS and Ungoogled Chromium is a great setup
07:07:02 <thelearner[m]> And adguard and vanadium for phone?
07:07:18 <cyredanthem[m]> NextDNS can be used there
07:07:18 <thelearner[m]> Or should I use NextDNS for both?
07:07:26 <cyredanthem[m]> Up to you
07:07:39 <thelearner[m]> cyredanthem: thanks :)
07:07:47 <cyredanthem[m]> NextDNS is more powerful and has open source apps
07:07:59 <cyredanthem[m]> Adguard has a better location
07:08:21 <cyredanthem[m]> NextDNS also will be only partially free eventually
07:08:23 <cyredanthem[m]> So that might not work for everyone
07:08:32 <thelearner[m]> Are there any good extensions though? What security/privacy concerns do they raise? Just want to fully understand, rather then just knowing. If that makes sense.
07:09:57 <thelearner[m]> > NextDNS also will be only partially free eventually
07:09:57 <thelearner[m]> That's a bummer to hear. Might just use adguard.
07:10:07 <cyredanthem[m]> > Are there any good extensions though? What security/privacy concerns do they raise? Just want to fully understand, rather then just knowing. If that makes sense.
07:10:07 <cyredanthem[m]> They get offered tons of money to be bought out
07:10:28 <cyredanthem[m]> NextDNS will turn into a regular dns after 300,000 requests a month
07:11:21 <cyredanthem[m]> When it goes partially paid
07:13:07 <thelearner[m]> > They get offered tons of money to be bought out
07:13:07 <thelearner[m]> Makes sense. Couldn't the same be said about different DNS like adguard so on?
07:13:31 <cyredanthem[m]> thelearner: I am referring to add-ons
07:14:22 <cyredanthem[m]> People have sold add-ons to malicious orgs in hours after launching them
07:14:38 <cyredanthem[m]> It's a huge market and one of the most common hacks
07:16:33 <thelearner[m]> Yea, I understood you were referring to add-ons. Just wanted to know how you or why you trusted certain DNS providers
07:16:42 <cyredanthem[m]> Root certs
07:16:51 <cyredanthem[m]> They are just blocking they can't be that malicious
07:16:55 <cyredanthem[m]> They could sell your data
07:17:07 <cyredanthem[m]> But that's happening with your ISP probably
07:17:43 <cyredanthem[m]> AdGuard is a reputable company
07:18:04 <cyredanthem[m]> NextDNS has a good business model they are planning and they are focused on open source
07:18:10 <thelearner[m]> Yea, up hill battle haha
07:19:59 <thelearner[m]> I will read more about both. Just like hearing everyone's opinion/knowledge regarding these things
07:20:22 <thelearner[m]> cyredanthem: thanks once again
07:20:48 <cyredanthem[m]> Oh I almost forgot
07:21:00 <cyredanthem[m]> You can leak dns of course
07:21:10 <cyredanthem[m]> So NextDNS with a unique setup is often semi unique
07:21:25 <cyredanthem[m]> It could be used for the world's weirdest fingerprinting
07:21:46 <cyredanthem[m]> That's not happening and wouldn't, but interesting thought exercise
07:23:55 <cyredanthem[m]> Technically you could be the only person with your vpn and dns combo
07:24:55 <cyredanthem[m]> It's not a real concern and you have a million other important things to consider that would happen first
07:25:02 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm a sucker for details though
07:26:09 <thelearner[m]> Okay, so NextDNS with ungoogled/Brave/chrome.
07:26:25 <cyredanthem[m]> That's generally my recommendation for the I'm ultra secure
07:27:06 <cyredanthem[m]> I run a Windows 10 VM(that resets) running NextDNS and Brave
07:27:17 <cyredanthem[m]> That's my day to day browser
07:27:30 <thelearner[m]> Same, knowing or learning the details of things for me, can't go wrong.
07:28:04 <thelearner[m]> Brave cause faster updates?
07:28:11 <cyredanthem[m]> That's my dev machine so I think that security is needed
07:28:24 <thelearner[m]> Makes sense.
07:28:27 <cyredanthem[m]> > Brave cause faster updates?
07:28:27 <cyredanthem[m]> Eh, I use both though I think Brave is a safer bet
07:28:33 <cyredanthem[m]> It's a little better watched
07:28:40 <cyredanthem[m]> If they screw up everyone will know
07:29:11 <thelearner[m]> Yea, got the same feeling after reading the github page for ungoogled.
07:30:02 <cyredanthem[m]> Ungoogled is cool as hell, but you need to build it yourself
07:39:30 <thelearner[m]> Is it worth building yourself? Cause got no idea how to. Might just use brave if it's a pain that's not worth having.
07:39:43 <cyredanthem[m]> > Is it worth building yourself? Cause got no idea how to. Might just use brave if it's a pain that's not worth having.
07:39:43 <cyredanthem[m]> It's easy
07:40:18 <thelearner[m]> Are the instructions on github page? Did I miss it?
07:40:21 <EssentialChaos[m> <cyredanthem[m] "Ungoogled is cool as hell, but y"> Don't they have pre-built binaries?
07:40:53 <cyredanthem[m]> EssentialChaos: sure but do you trust them?
07:42:49 <BallMonokuma[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "I run a Windows 10 VM(that reset"> That must kill your ram
07:43:17 <cyredanthem[m]> Ball Monokuma: Nothing like Qubes on 8GB
07:44:23 <BallMonokuma[m]> Heh
07:44:28 <BallMonokuma[m]> I need more ram tbh
07:44:29 <BallMonokuma[m]> I want to run QubesOS
07:45:01 <cyredanthem[m]> Qubes is not great for a holistic security approach
07:46:59 <BallMonokuma[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Qubes is not great for a holisti"> How?
07:47:22 <cyredanthem[m]> Terrible guest security and way too much package trust
07:47:51 <BallMonokuma[m]> Like, if my Whonix tempVM/ diposable VM/ whatever it's called gets compromised can't I just discard it and make a new one?
07:47:51 <BallMonokuma[m]> >INB4 but muh xen exploits that will totally be used against you
07:58:20 <propertype> <cyredanthem[m] "They didn't release 82"> Ah thanks!

08:11:23 <cyredanthem[m]> > How do you guys deal with vpn leak when inside shelter profiles?
08:11:23 <cyredanthem[m]> Describe your situation
08:12:26 * matic_nick[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GvmvFcbrtkaUqEmXWbfTHJcd >
08:12:53 <cyredanthem[m]> I could last I tried
08:13:15 <matic_nick[m]> Running VPN on main profile doesn't cover Shelter profiles somehow.
08:13:18 <cyredanthem[m]> Both blocking all connections outside and working in split view
08:13:24 <cyredanthem[m]> Install the VPN in shelter
08:14:26 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Install the VPN in shelter"> Yep. Did that main profile is leaking then
08:14:53 <cyredanthem[m]> Are they both set to block connections without it?
08:15:04 <matic_nick[m]> Yeah
08:17:13 <matic_nick[m]> For clarification Shelter is installed on the same profile so basically just running "work" profile
08:18:01 <cyredanthem[m]> So does the connection not get blocked?
08:24:30 <matic_nick[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "So does the connection not get b"> Actually it does. But then connection is only active on profile it is set on.
08:24:58 <matic_nick[m]> Have to disable it and re-enable on profile I'm working on
08:25:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Interesting I didn't have that issue
08:25:50 <matic_nick[m]> I was never able to route Shelter connection to main profile VPN
08:26:39 <matic_nick[m]> <matic_nick[m] "I was never able to route Shelte"> *if it's even possible
08:28:23 <cyredanthem[m]> Use dedicated profiles they are so much better
08:31:58 <matic_nick[m]> I guess there's that
08:55:15 <thelearner[m]> cyredanthem: how would one go about building ungoogle chromium?
08:57:06 <renlord> thelearner[m]: https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium
08:57:14 <renlord> and follow instructions.
08:57:26 <renlord> will take many hours to build, good luck.
09:13:02 <gervarouge[m]> Welcome
09:31:02 <thelearner[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): thanks :) hopefully just a few haha
09:34:25 <cn3m[m]> the misinformation on Reddit is so bad
09:51:55 <cx2[m]> I like to call it, "drive by privacy enthusiasm".... But nearly always are just spreading shit they learned on PTIO as gospel, while leaving out security all together.
09:51:55 <cx2[m]> It really is pretty bad
09:53:48 <cn3m[m]> Debian and Firefox is all I need
09:54:09 <cn3m[m]> I like that term
09:54:45 <thelearner[m]> What you guys use?
09:58:12 <cn3m[m]> a bad setup for security due to Linux but hey
09:59:20 <cn3m[m]> I use Fedora and Brave right now
10:03:52 <thelearner[m]> No matter how long it takes, at least you're doing it. Takes awhile to get on the path haha
10:04:33 <tronss> Hi!, do you know if the apps used in a different profile are isolated from the apps in another profile?
10:04:47 <thelearner[m]> How does fedora differ to Mac and windows?
10:05:16 <thelearner[m]> tronss: I think they are. Don't use shelter app.
10:05:38 <tronss> I don't use it, only I create a different profile to use only Tor browser
10:05:48 <tronss> I know the browser is not secure but...
10:06:35 <cn3m[m]> <thelearner[m] "How does fedora differ to Mac an"> fedora is much weaker much weaker
10:06:36 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 has great hardening for a common desktop
10:06:37 <cn3m[m]> they have meaningful features like Windows Sandbox
10:07:56 <cn3m[m]> macOS however is probably better imo due to the really decent open source kernel the better than nothing verified boot and the rootless app installs
10:08:04 <cn3m[m]> ChromeOS and iPadOS are the only serious options that remotely could be used as a laptop
10:08:51 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_tronss:matrix.org yes it is
10:08:53 <thelearner[m]> > I don't use it, only I create a different profile to use only Tor browser
10:08:53 <thelearner[m]> I think that's the way to go. Just clear app data
10:09:14 <tronss> cn3m[m], thanks!
10:09:34 <tronss> thelearner[m], yes, I always do: the caches
10:09:52 <cn3m[m]> iPadOS > ChromeOS > macOS > Windows > Arch > Fedora > Debian
10:10:42 <cn3m[m]> of course that leaves iPadOS as best privacy and security since they are related
10:11:03 <cn3m[m]> macOS can strike a balance too
10:11:15 <cn3m[m]> Lord I sound like an Apple shill. I swear I only have an iPad
10:11:30 <tronss> ChromeOS isn't a good example of privacy, more about security
10:12:52 <cn3m[m]> I means it's way overblown
10:13:09 <cn3m[m]> it's not as bad as it sounds
10:13:13 <cn3m[m]> it's probably better than Windows imo
10:14:20 <cn3m[m]> the account scares people, but they (obviously) as an open source project and a Google one are very transparent and give you control. it's a mixed bag
10:14:53 <tronss> yesterday an user here said he MITMd Windows with the telemetry disabled and it was ok. I don't think it would work in ChromeOS if you must be connected to Google to work with it
10:15:39 <tronss> cn3m[m], Maybe they say all is ok but they keep all the information about you in their servers, who knows...
10:16:05 <tronss> They show you that your information is not saved but they save it in another place. Who can we know?
10:16:12 <tronss> *How
10:16:47 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_tronss:matrix.org you can turn off a lot of stuff
10:17:05 <cn3m[m]> it's an open source project mostly you can see it all
10:17:12 <thelearner[m]> cn3m: thanks for your view points, for PC would have to go with Mac first though. No apple shill either haha
10:17:19 <cn3m[m]> they are giving the control there
10:18:06 <tronss> I remember someone hacking that device from Amazon and while they said they weren't saving the information or audios, then he found it in some server
10:18:15 <joshman[m]> <cn3m[m] "iPadOS > ChromeOS > macOS > Wind"> Where does hardened Arch stand in this tab?
10:18:37 <EssentialChaos[m> <joshman[m] "Where does hardened Arch stand i"> And Hardened Gentoo?
10:18:44 <joshman[m]> Yes please
10:19:46 <cn3m[m]> it's less than Windows
10:20:33 <cn3m[m]> seriously
10:20:37 <cn3m[m]> Linux issues are so pervasive
10:20:43 <cn3m[m]> Linux is a broken system
10:21:28 <thelearner[m]> tronss: what other apps do you use in your different profile? Just curious to everyone's usability.
10:22:01 <tronss> thelearner[m], I disable all the possible apps I can
10:22:08 <joshman[m]> Real life question.
10:22:08 <joshman[m]> Which OS is easier to get access to my laptops mic ans webcam to listen to conversations?
10:22:41 <joshman[m]> * Real life question.
10:22:41 <joshman[m]> Which OS is easier to get access to my laptops mic ans webcam to listen to conversations? Fresh install or hardened. Either way

10:22:41 <cn3m[m]> > Which OS is easier to get access to my laptops mic ans webcam to listen to conversations?
10:22:41 <cn3m[m]> Debian is the easiest to hack mics

10:24:49 <cn3m[m]> however for raw mic hacking (bad example imo). Windows wins
10:24:54 <tronss> Reading a lot
10:25:41 <tronss> And having many questions...
10:26:04 <cn3m[m]>  @josh.man:matrix.org now ChromeOS is the one less likely to get malware to do that is the distinction
10:26:15 <cn3m[m]> is persistence a factor?
10:27:18 <joshman[m]> Why is then Qubes even a thing? Just use bundled windows laptop and sleep safely
10:28:02 <joshman[m]> I don't get why so many are involved in voluntarily developing insecure OSes and brag about it everywhere anywhere
10:28:37 <cn3m[m]> don't get me wrong Qubes is cool but it's only good at one thing and ignores the rest
10:29:14 <cn3m[m]> it's basically like a beat up car with nice new seats
10:29:28 <cn3m[m]> I love how it feels to sit in it, but the rest is just sad
10:29:59 <joshman[m]> System 76 and some HP laptops are proud to ship with Ubuntu out of the box (which is screaming for security fixes) why?
10:30:03 <tronss> I read from Snowden and also from strcat here that WIFI is not secure to use. In the case we use our smartphones, is it safer to use our ISP connection only?
10:30:39 <joshman[m]> Why all IT junkies using Boxes and BSDs in every single IT conference instead of Macs and Windows
10:30:48 <thelearner[m]> tronss: rases glass

10:31:33 <cn3m[m]> security researchers tend to use Windows and macOS
10:32:16 <tronss> joshman[m], maybe a FSF conference?

10:42:40 <cn3m[m]> <aragorndr[m] "can someone give me some sources"> which part since there's a lot
10:51:00 <thelearner[m]> cn3m: I'll give them a look then :)
10:52:49 <thelearner[m]> > > <@aragorndr:matrix.org> can someone give me some sources from where i can learn more about this?
10:52:49 <thelearner[m]> > which part since there's a lot
10:52:49 <thelearner[m]> There was a long convo hours ago. Scroll up if u can.
11:02:06 <cn3m[m]> madaidans-insecurities.github.io
11:02:08 <cn3m[m]> start there
11:05:04 <aragorndr[m]> thanks
11:06:19 <cn3m[m]> you're very welcome I have more reading materials if that leaves your wanting more  @aragorndr:matrix.org
11:09:29 <barath[m]> this will probably sound/be ignorant, but the gist of what I hear/gather from reading a bit about grapheneos, and the discussions here, is that I can go to windows/macos and be more secure, but I'll be supporting more closed source/data mining/non "liberty respecting" (or however you wanna call the libre part of it) ecosystems, or linux, which is a security mess but it's all open and doesn't mine my data?
11:10:06 <brenneke[m]> When navigating to a different site in Bromite browser, I briefly get a page that says "Your connection was interrupted" before new page loads, does anyone know anything about this?
11:11:39 <cn3m[m]>  @barath:matrix.org I mean if you want free and open source and secure use ChromiumOS
11:11:44 <cn3m[m]> <brenneke[m] "When navigating to a different s"> what is your privatedns?
11:14:49 <brenneke[m]> <cn3m[m] "what is your privatedns?"> Set to Automatic with line blank, use VPN provider's DNS.
11:16:28 <cn3m[m]> you didn't set it? odd
11:17:52 <strcat[m]> barath: macOS and Windows don't "mine your data", you're fallen for a lot of BS
11:20:07 <cn3m[m]> he said Linux doesn't
11:20:19 <cn3m[m]> but Windows and macOS do
11:25:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> What's the end goal?
11:25:40 <strcat> tronss: neither snowden or I said 'WiFi is not secure to use' - if you want to go to extremes you can avoid the attack surface it exposes, sure
11:25:49 <xabierd[m]> What do you think in all those tools that stop telemetry tracking on windows?
11:25:49 <xabierd[m]> I use windows 10 ame on an old netbook because it s silly light.
11:25:58 <strcat> xabierd[m]: you don't need tools
11:26:08 <xabierd[m]> * What do you think about all those tools that stop telemetry tracking on windows?
11:26:09 <xabierd[m]> I use windows 10 ame on an old netbook because it s silly light.
11:26:24 <cn3m[m]> Windows and macOS aren't abusing your data they clearly define it and it has its uses and controls
11:26:55 <xabierd[m]> I mainly use it for gaming, so most of my data is tracked on anti cheat tools
11:27:07 <hypokeimenon[m]> Ultimately you want to use an operating system that has version checking, sophisticated bug tracking, local adaptation features etc. That make it more convenient and safer to operate unaided/automatically.
11:27:19 <strcat> there are settings it respects to disable telemetry but I think you have a misunderstand of what it is in the first place
11:27:50 <hypokeimenon[m]> Ideally you want this stuff to be opt-in
11:27:56 <strcat> it is
11:27:59 <strcat> it asks you when you install
11:28:05 <brenneke[m]> <cn3m[m] "you didn't set it? odd"> Is it related to the Bromite thing? What do you recommend for private DNS provider?
11:28:22 <strcat> the Basic mode just supports what's needed for updates
11:28:40 <cn3m[m]> which is more opt in?
11:28:41 <cn3m[m]> it takes me 2 minutes to opt out of everything on Windows and 10 seconds on mac
11:28:41 <cn3m[m]> ideally you want a basic security model
11:28:46 <cn3m[m]> it would take me months to fix linux
11:28:58 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
11:29:09 <strcat> The GrapheneOS Updater app fetches update metadata from https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-CHANNEL approximately once every four hours when connected to a permitted network for updates.
11:29:11 <strcat> Once an update is available, it tries to download https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-incremental-OLD_VERSION-NEW_VERSION.zip for a delta update, and then falls back to https://releases.grapheneos.org/DEVICE-ota_update-NEW_VERSION.zip.
11:29:13 <strcat> No query / data is sent to the server, so the only information leaked to it are the variables in these 3 URLs (device, channel, current version) which is necessary to obtain the update.
11:30:15 <cn3m[m]> Windows and macOS have better protections for your data
11:30:27 <cn3m[m]> Linux is not securing it
11:30:30 <cn3m[m]> it can't offer privacy
11:30:34 <hypokeimenon[m]> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): Sorry I was referring to desktop operating systems re: macros and Windows, not GrapheneOS
11:30:37 <strcat> you could consider that 'telemetry' and I don't see how else updates could be done
11:30:45 <strcat> it doesn't send any device identifier
11:30:47 <strcat> hypokeimenon[m]: I know
11:30:59 <strcat> I am pointing out that this could be considered anonymous 'telemetry'
11:31:02 <tronss> strcat, Ed Snowden: I wouldn't use WiFi at home, because global maps of every wireless access point's unique ID—including yours—are free and constantly updated. I would use ethernet; yes, ethernet on a phone. I would deny network permissions to any app that doesn't need it using an app firewall. https://nitter.net/Snowden/status/1175430722733129729?s=09
11:31:18 <strcat> tronss: which is not how you described what he said
11:31:30 <tronss> strcat, not using WIFI at all but being not secure. I read it from you in some conversation lately, if not sorry
11:31:50 <tronss> strcat, now I don't know what I posted lol, sorry
11:31:56 <strcat> that isn't saying wifi is 'not secure'
11:32:06 <cn3m[m]> <tronss "strcat, Ed Snowden: I wouldn't u"> thats not a practical guide
11:32:14 <strcat> and he says he wouldn't use it *at home*
11:33:08 <tronss> strcat, yes, that's true. well... we normally use it at home. I have to be more specific then
11:33:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> I mean if you want you can just run Windows offline, not use any services which require periodic licence validation online like Office suite, and use an offline download manager or directly download the upcoming Windows updates, fixes and patches.
11:33:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> That's what I'll probably do for a gaming rig anyway
11:33:45 <tronss> strcat, what do you think about WIFI then?
11:33:46 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 is not spying on you. The telemetry is on the setup screen and it is pretty transparent
11:33:58 <cyredanthem[m]> WiFi isn't insecure
11:34:24 <hypokeimenon[m]> Freedom vs Security cyredanthem
11:34:40 <hypokeimenon[m]> There isn't the choice to send nothing
11:35:52 <cyredanthem[m]> Linux doesn't give me privacy. Windows 10 does
11:36:15 <cyredanthem[m]> You can't have privacy on such an insecure system
11:36:55 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yeah we're talking about Windows though, leave Linux aside for a bit
11:37:32 <hypokeimenon[m]> I agree with secure defaults, but the option should exist to shut everything off
11:38:50 <hypokeimenon[m]> A layman like me just needs a warning in the settings that this is inherently unsafe because of the risk of running outdated (thus targeted) software dramatically increases
11:39:48 <cn3m[m]> the setup screen is transparent enough
11:40:29 <tronss> strcat, you're right. I posted it in a general sense but mentioning Snowden and you, without bad intentions. But I was wrong.
11:40:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> This isn't a question of whether the setup screen is transparent enough, or if the EULA sufficitlently details everything
11:40:53 <strcat> I don't think you had bad intentions
11:41:07 <strcat> I just want to clarify that's not what I've said about it
11:41:51 <tronss> I must post what others talk being careful
11:41:59 <hypokeimenon[m]> tronss he likely wouldn't use wi-fi at home because by its nature it needs to be discover able to discover
11:42:00 <tronss> strcat, thanks
11:42:27 <tronss> hypokeimenon[m], about Ed Snowden?, he talks about us in that thread
11:42:50 <hypokeimenon[m]> talks about us?
11:43:15 <tronss> What we should do, I think
11:43:21 <tronss> Not only him
11:43:32 <tronss> Or I missunderstood those words
11:43:49 <stuux[m]> strcat: May I send you a DM regarding the signing of Auditor?
11:44:17 <strcat> yes
11:45:01 <tronss> hypokeimenon[m], maybe that's the point: he's talking about his situation, not only what we should do, only what his
11:45:38 <tronss> And I thought he was talking in general
11:46:12 <hypokeimenon[m]> <tronss "Or I missunderstood those words"> Well, you're sort of misunderstanding. Snowden is talking about the kinds of things he would do or does do to maintain some control over the data he's putting out there. It's not a guide for us, it's his personal opinions.
11:46:31 <cn3m[m]> He said remove the mic
11:46:46 <cn3m[m]> that's not normal or needed
11:47:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> Unneeded is debatable in relation to your threat model, abnormal is right.
11:47:28 <tronss> hypokeimenon[m], yes, I was confused when later he talks about us, how you should use...
11:47:41 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is secure enough for all of us
11:47:42 <tronss> And he says not like him but...
11:47:49 <tronss> ok then :)
11:47:53 <tronss> My bad
11:48:26 <hypokeimenon[m]> Sorry to ask, but do you speak English natively? tronss
11:48:32 <tronss> cn3m[m], yes, but security is never 100%
11:48:43 <tronss> hypokeimenon[m], English is not my language
11:49:42 <cn3m[m]> <tronss "cn3m, yes, but security is never"> you need to worry about other things more
11:49:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> You should / One should / I would , are all ways of introducing suppositions
11:50:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> Not in all cases, but in the case that Snowden is making there they are not a strict guide for you to follow.
11:50:30 <tronss> He he cn3m[m] yes
11:51:08 <cn3m[m]> honestly I feel like root certs or something would get me first
11:51:11 <hypokeimenon[m]> I suppose someone has asked him: What sort of steps would you, or do you take to remain private?
11:51:11 <hypokeimenon[m]> The comments he's made are his answers given that initial question.
11:51:13 <cn3m[m]> or social engineering
11:51:16 <tronss> hypokeimenon[m], this is what confused me, thinking that he's saying that anyway we are all naked and so... My point is not that you should use a smartphone like me, but that you *shouldn't have to*. Privacy should not be a privilege, but because the legal system is broken, the average person today stands, at every stage of life, naked before the eyes of corporations and governments.
11:52:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yes that's his opinion
11:52:50 <hypokeimenon[m]> It's largely true, but what is confusing about it?
11:52:53 <cn3m[m]> privacy and security is expensive
11:54:20 <cn3m[m]> depends on the country though
11:54:46 <tronss> hypokeimenon[m], don't worry, I see that I didn't understand it
11:56:27 <tronss> hypokeimenon[m], thanks!
12:00:02 <hypokeimenon[m]> I haven't done anything worth thanking me for, but no problem
12:01:42 <tronss> Yes hypokeimenon[m] you helped me to understand it and about the English language when introducing suppositions...
12:01:45 <mxnorvak[m]> As someone who has read a lot of misinformation before thinking I'm educating myself on lets say privacy or security in mobile or desktop OSes, i should say one thing the community spreading misinformation always attack first is that the controls you think you have over your data, the opt in , opt out toggles are all fake and your data is gonna be collected anyways, they remove the trust in basic options ppl have
12:01:46 <mxnorvak[m]> while using their devices and then introduce never before heard ways to gain 100% privacy
12:02:57 <cn3m[m]> people make up things about toggles not working all the time
12:03:00 <cn3m[m]> that's very true
12:03:21 <mxnorvak[m]> So i can completely understand how stocked ppl are when they hear the solution is to use those toggles
12:03:22 <cn3m[m]> I do a lot of MITMs and get called a liar since the settings change or don't work
12:03:30 <mxnorvak[m]> Shocked*
12:04:05 <cn3m[m]> what companies wouldn't lie to my face when they could get sued?
12:04:25 <cn3m[m]> that sounded mocking I didn't mean that
12:04:36 <cn3m[m]> I'm just tired of the clowns
12:05:04 <cn3m[m]> that mislead people for muh FSF elitism
12:06:43 <kernelpaniker[m]> The link https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos doesn't open. Any suggestions on that? Tried several browsers
12:07:17 <cn3m[m]> people balk when I say that Librem devices make backdoors easy due to not signing firmware. it's true easist devices to backdoor
12:07:37 <cn3m[m]> paste in browser?
12:07:40 <strcat> they mostly just prevent updating it
12:07:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "As someone who has read a lot of"> I don't know if this is aimed toward me, but all things in operation can receive a given level of trust. How appropriate that level of trust is depends on the person.
12:08:19 <tronss> kernelpaniker[m], I can open it
12:08:19 <mxnorvak[m]> And now think those users now read an article by Snowden, its like fuel for fire,they are so ready to misinterpret what  he says
12:09:27 <tronss> mxnorvak[m], yes... in fact, you spend all your life thinking what others tell you about security and privacy and you are shocked when you see that all was a lie
12:10:11 <tronss> mxnorvak[m], well, English is not my language and sometimes I don't understand all what I read as I should
12:10:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> Saying it is a lie suggests people maliciously spread misinformation on purpose, and generally that is not true
12:10:15 <kernelpaniker[m]> <tronss "kernelpaniker, I can open it"> What's the browser? Have you tried to open it on graphene Pixel?
12:10:48 <tronss> kernelpaniker[m], maybe it's your connection. I open it in ungoogled chromium, I'll use another browser
12:11:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yes it can be inaccurate, but the issue is the widening gap between the sophistication in technology the average person uses and the average persons capacity to understand what they are using.
12:11:23 <tronss> Yes, it's your conection, not the browser I think
12:11:49 <kernelpaniker[m]> Hm, I'll try to use tor then
12:12:06 <tronss> kernelpaniker[m], using a VPN?
12:12:26 <mxnorvak[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "I don't know if this is aimed to"> It was in no way aimed towards you, or any one, as i said , i myself thought I'm gaining valuable information on those communities, I've been here for a month or so and I've seen the pattern of ppl coming here,finding things out and it being hard to accept cause its complete opposite of what they thought was best to do, im just saying how those misinformations work
12:12:26 <mxnorvak[m]> on ppl who aren't educated and techy enough like me
12:13:47 <tronss> kernelpaniker[m], even with Bromite works well
12:13:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "It was in no way aimed towards y"> Yeah I agree, I just made a point about that gap between tech and understanding
12:13:56 <cn3m[m]> people will cuss at me and after a few more exchanges they say they were wrong and they are sorry
12:13:57 <cn3m[m]> people just need it explained a lot check my Reddit history
12:14:01 <brenneke[m]> <cn3m[m] "you didn't set it? odd"> Recommendation?
12:14:20 <cn3m[m]> the misinformation is so ingrained
12:14:24 <tronss> kernelpaniker[m], no problem with Vanadium
12:15:13 <kernelpaniker[m]> tronss: it's blocked in my country. Thanks bro
12:15:30 <cn3m[m]>  @mxnorvak:matrix.org can I dm you I have a question
12:15:31 <cn3m[m]>  @mxnorvak:matrix.org can I dm you I have a question

12:16:04 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] " @mxnorvak:matrix.org can I dm y"> Sure
12:27:39 <cn3m[m]> thanks
12:29:52 <gervarouge[m]> Does anyone here recommend ChromiumOS?
12:39:19 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] "thanks"> No problem :)
13:32:50 <madaidan[m]> strcat: Are you gonna reply to those guys on reddit again?
13:34:46 <madaidan[m]> People are trying to use it as a rebuttal when he didn't even really dispute anything lol
13:47:53 <thelearner[m]> I'm surprised r/grapheneos is still on reddit, considering the state reddits in.
13:48:52 <thelearner[m]> And wouldn't the be better spent on other grapheneos matters. Correct me please, if need be.
13:49:01 <thelearner[m]> Time*
13:50:01 <EssentialChaos[m> thelearner: Reddit is still a big and popular platform
13:50:32 <EssentialChaos[m> Correct if I am wrong, but you could call marketing :P
13:53:01 <EssentialChaos[m> Btw, If Android ever finishes its feature, that allows you to connect your phone to a monitor and use it as a desktop system, will it land on Graphene?
13:53:14 <thelearner[m]> EssentialChaos: understandable. Yea, though popular doesn't always mean better. But yea, I get yah. Haha, of course PR all the way. Just a shame that energy is put towards comments/people like that. Should just be redirected to grapheneos page to save everyone time and a headache free day.
13:53:32 <barath[m]> so the reports I've read of windows updates re-enabling telemetry are FUD? I'm genuinely confused. also, I'm making a distinction (incorrectly?) between privacy and security, in terms of what data the OS/default configuration leaks/transmits. afaict, a default linux install will not send telemetry (opt-in), whereas I constantly hear about windows leaking data. is that false? I havent actually used windows as my main OS
13:53:33 <barath[m]> in years.
13:54:43 <thelearner[m]> > Btw, If Android ever finishes its feature, that allows you to connect your phone to a monitor and use it as a desktop system, will it land on Graphene?
13:54:43 <thelearner[m]> That would be beautiful.
13:54:59 <EssentialChaos[m> <thelearner[m] "EssentialChaos: understandable. "> Well, they need some way to talk to people outside of github issues
13:56:11 <thelearner[m]> > Well, they need some way to talk to people outside of github issues

14:23:25 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I need other people to help deal with them, I don't understand why that thread is allowed to exist at all
14:23:34 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I haven't logged onto reddit
14:23:46 <strcat[m]> don't know what else they've posted
14:24:21 <strcat[m]> not particularly interested in debating with dishonest, manipulative people who have no clue what they're talking about and just make up baseless BS repeatedly
14:25:03 <strcat[m]> Mozilla has serious problems with their community and employees being consistently dishonest, manipulative scumbags going after security researchers for stating facts
14:25:15 <strcat[m]> that thread serves a useful purpose to me as does their other nonsense
14:25:39 <strcat[m]> I can regularly refer to it to show how Mozilla endorses harassing and dishonest character assassinations of researchers along with pushing dishonest / false claims
14:25:43 <strcat[m]> by leaving up the thread they endorse it
14:25:45 <strcat[m]> reflects on them
14:25:52 <strcat[m]> other places remove stuff like that, Mozilla endorses this
14:25:57 <strcat[m]> and engages in it themselves
14:26:08 <strcat[m]> thoroughly untrustworthy and unethical company and community, little more to say than that
14:26:19 <strcat[m]> you can't debate with dishonest people just spewing huge posts full of lies / false claims
14:26:32 <strcat[m]> that person has little technical knowledge at all and is just BSing
14:26:37 <strcat[m]> how am I supposed to reply to them?
14:26:46 <strcat[m]> people who want to believe their baseless BS will believe what they want
14:26:57 <strcat[m]> the Mozilla security people in the thread they linked themselves say the Linux sandbox is useless, lol
14:27:39 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I think it's important to note there are Mozilla people there who know that guy is posting misinformation and dishonest claims
14:27:48 <strcat[m]> and they choose to support it and don't say anything to counter it
14:27:57 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: because they are dishonest, unethical people and that is their company culture
14:28:05 <strcat[m]> and the thread serves the useful purpose of being yet another example of how they are
14:28:44 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: you can see they are active there in that thread and yet they tacitly support dishonest character assassinations and misinformation
14:28:45 <aeonsolution[m]> hi everyone, does anyone need help with building the development branch or stable release? i can help you get unstuck if you have any specific questions.
14:28:46 <strcat[m]> that is their brand
14:31:34 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: can expand the documentation about it including assorted links to documentation, issues, analysis by other security researchers
14:31:50 <strcat[m]> and I'll just drop the workarounds for Firefox's broken / insecure approach to things, don't care anymore
14:32:43 <strcat[m]> I guess in the June release
14:35:45 <strcat[m]> I need people in the community to start taking these attacks on the project and project developers more seriously
14:35:47 <strcat[m]> and respond to it
14:35:51 <strcat[m]> don't leave it up to me to deal with it

14:37:39 <strcat[m]> if Mozilla employees, etc. are going to tacitly support that stuff then I will go back to actively talking about their dishonesty, misinformation and shit tier browser / security
14:37:48 <strcat[m]> can post daily about it
14:38:05 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "and counter the misinformation t"> I try to counter misinformation a lot but it's hard when these people form solid echo chambers
14:38:15 <strcat[m]> they never actually made up for what they started or gave me the money they owe me
14:38:27 <madaidan[m]> That's why I created my site but they *still* managed to do this shit
14:39:02 <madaidan[m]> It's crazy the straws they grasp at to defend their favourite software

15:38:50 <cgdroid> Hello, is there a xmmp channel about grapheneos in xmpp?
16:11:13 <strcat[m]> cgdroid: no official one
16:11:42 <strcat[m]> I don't want to further fragment the community, this is the only chat channel, and any additions need to be official bridges to this channel
16:16:48 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "I don't want to further fragment"> Would you want more bridges? I could set some up if you want.
16:33:35 <cgdroid> strcat, thank you!
16:34:12 <cgdroid> It's only that Matrix/Riot is very slow, nothing more
16:34:21 <cgdroid> I use irc
16:36:36 <cgdroid> madaidan[m], it would be fantastic if we could use xmpp too to be here
16:36:43 <cgdroid> I don't know how it's possible
16:37:06 <cgdroid> Better to my smartphone
16:37:40 <cgdroid> Is that possible?
16:48:35 <dazinism> cgdroid: think there are xmpp to freenode bridges that are open for public use
16:48:46 <madaidan[m]> <cgdroid "Is that possible?"> There's probably an xmpp bridge similar to the matrix-irc one.
16:50:24 <dazinism> ...or maybe xmpp to matrix. Through which you can join freenode channels. But guess that probably wouldnt be faster...
16:51:23 <cgdroid> dazinism, do you know where?
16:51:33 <cgdroid> madaidan[m], thanks
16:51:57 <cgdroid> dazinism, well, if it will be as slower as Matrix then...
16:52:28 <cgdroid> But xmpp to freenode is interesting
16:52:52 <cgdroid> Where can I find it?. I have no clue

17:26:15 <madaidan[m]> r/linux is one of the worst places to crosspost this to
17:27:41 <madaidan[m]> Expect another wave of dishonest people spreading misinformation

17:29:25 <dazinism> cgdroid: they both use https://doc.biboumi.louiz.org/
17:29:44 <cgdroid> dazinism, thank you! I am new in this, I don't know how but I'll figure it out
17:34:21 <cgdroid> dazinism, I suppose they are for PC; not for android

17:35:48 <dazinism> cgdroid: join that room from your xmpp clinet
17:35:54 <dazinism> client
17:37:38 <cgdroid> Including #?
17:38:26 <dazinism> cgdroid: will work on android, conversations.im is generally considered the best xmpp app for android, but its target SDK is a bit old. Pix-art messenger is a fork of conversations with the latest target SDK.

17:39:03 <cn3m[m]> how does this go without saying?
17:39:05 <cn3m[m]> how does this go without saying?
17:39:06 <cn3m[m]> CVEs do not equal security or Firefox = Pale Moon security which is fucking bullshit.
17:39:09 <dazinism> cgdroid: yeah you need to include the #
17:40:45 <cgdroid> dazinism, thanks!, I'll try it :)
17:41:23 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "CVEs do not equal security or Fi"> Yeah, TempleOS doesn't have a single CVE but that doesn't make it extremely secure

17:45:59 <cg_droid> ...
17:46:09 <cg_droid> Testing
17:46:57 <cg_droid> dazinism: it works!, I' ll see if I can read the chat too
17:47:48 <cyredanthem[m]> > > <@cn3m:privacytools.io> CVEs do not equal security or Firefox = Pale Moon security which is fucking bullshit.
17:47:48 <cyredanthem[m]> > Yeah, TempleOS doesn't have a single CVE but that doesn't make it extremely secure
17:47:48 <cyredanthem[m]> Arguably with the memory design almost every feature is a CVE (half kidding)
17:48:55 <dazinism> cg_droid: not sure how reliable their connection to freenode is, but not really a problem as you can read the channel logs at https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
17:49:16 <cg_droid> Yes, I can also read. Thanks a lot dazinism
17:49:31 <cn3m[m]> bullshit misinformation everywhere
17:49:41 <cg_droid> Until now great
17:52:40 <cg_droid> Testing from Dino in my pc
17:53:06 <cg_droid> Ok, sorry for these tests
17:53:38 <cg_droid> Yes dazinism, sometimes I read it there 🙂
18:20:57 <strcat[m]> please help out in https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/gokcis/firefox_is_insecure_refuted/ countering this misinformation
18:21:05 <strcat[m]> and the new thread at https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/gp3p67/firefox_is_insecure_refuted/
18:21:17 <strcat[m]> need this community to help with defending myself and the project from false claims and harassment
18:21:26 <strcat[m]> please help with this so I don't need to spend enormous amounts of time doing it myself
18:21:36 <strcat[m]> I have a release partway done that was going to be pushed out today and I will need to cancel that
18:23:56 <cyredanthem[m]> cn3m blasted this out to 12 people
18:37:43 <strcat[m]> this is a clear attempt to direct targeted harassment towards me and spread misinformation
18:38:00 <strcat[m]> need the community here to care about this and do their best to respond to it
18:38:06 <strcat[m]> I want to focus on development
18:38:08 <strcat[m]> not this kind of thing
18:38:30 <strcat[m]> it's important for me to be able to write documentation on the site without being targeted and harassed for it
18:39:07 <strcat[m]> we should be able to make app recommendations there and document technical reasons for it
18:39:26 <strcat[m]> I'm not posting this stuff across reddit and elsewhere
18:39:37 <strcat[m]> it's GrapheneOS documentation and answering questions within the GrapheneOS community
18:39:55 <strcat[m]> I could start writing blog posts and spreading it elsewhere, and treating this as some kind of war to fight, but I haven't ever done that
18:40:16 <strcat[m]> I only talk about it within our community and when people target me elsewhere
18:43:33 <cn3m[m]> exactly
18:48:56 <madaidan[m]> People are talking about it in #security:mozilla.org now
18:48:58 <cg_droid> strcat[m], sometimes it's better to leave these conversations behind and focus in other things, only posting something like: trust what you want, I only posted what I know here, it's up to you. Bye
18:49:23 <aeonsolution[m]> cg_droid: there's a history of targeted attacks on his research
18:49:35 <aeonsolution[m]> he refutes them, and they still continue to spread it unchallenged
18:50:12 <madaidan[m]> Anyone not buying into the same echo chambers spreading bullshit is consistently attacked
18:50:18 <aeonsolution[m]> it becomes a problem that they spread lies to launder bad security
18:50:22 <cg_droid> That's what I mean, I think it has no solution
18:50:37 <cg_droid> Only more and more discussions and they'll never end
18:51:09 <cg_droid> At least what strcat[m] posted is there, it's up to everyone else to trust or not
18:51:24 <cg_droid> Only my opinion, sorry
18:51:49 <cg_droid> Daniel will follow posting in his website what's right
18:52:09 <cg_droid> People will believe what they want to believe
18:52:29 <aeonsolution[m]> yes, which is why not countering lies and bad practices is critical
18:52:53 <aeonsolution[m]>  * yes, which is why countering the lies and bad practices is critical
18:53:34 <aeonsolution[m]> if its out there, people will believe its true, because a lot of people to do their own research
18:53:48 <aeonsolution[m]> they look at the source and say that must be true
18:54:10 <aeonsolution[m]> all the while this project is not attacking anyone
18:55:55 <skwisgaar[m]> I think there needs to be a delicate balance of telling the truth about insecure software/defending the project, without trying too hard to convert people who are obviously not thinking/willing to have an actual conversation
18:56:18 <skwisgaar[m]> There will always be people who are just making noise
18:56:37 <skwisgaar[m]> Actually think you guys already do a very good job of that
18:56:45 <cg_droid> It's something like religion: if all your life you believe something, it's very hard to change your opinion and you'll attack those trying to change your mind
18:56:52 <skwisgaar[m]> But it's tricky when people get so damn emotional
18:57:10 <strcat[m]> I am being actively harassed because of these kinds of posts targeting me
18:57:13 <strcat[m]> it's an attempt to silence me
18:57:15 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] if its out there, people will believe its true, because a lot of people to don't do their own research
18:57:22 <strcat[m]> I need the community to counter that and respond to whatever they do ten fold
18:57:36 <skwisgaar[m]> Targeted attacks are different, you are right
18:57:40 <strcat[m]> make it so I'm not an interesting target
18:57:52 <cg_droid> strcat[m], nobody will be able to silence you and your project, it's great and unique 🙂
18:57:55 <strcat[m]> by having 1000 other people talking about the same inconvenient facts
18:58:15 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: well they are successfully harming by work / productivity and making me upset and scared of what they are going to do
18:58:38 <strcat[m]> and I am not receiving much support from this community when this happens
18:58:45 <dazinism> Yeah, Firefox in particular has a lot of 'social capital'. Lots of folks have a strong emotional attachment that goes back the best part of 20 years from when Firefox rose up to challenge the dominance of Microsoft
18:59:13 <madaidan[m]> Lol. This guy trying to defend personal attacks against me https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/gokcis/firefox_is_insecure_refuted/frkno4q/?context=3
18:59:22 <strcat[m]> doesn't excuse singling me out to be targeted for harassment because I posted a few sentences recommending using other things
18:59:42 <strcat[m]> I have not gone around posting about it outside our community and I have not targeted individuals who disagree with me
19:00:23 <strcat[m]> the equivalent to this would be me seeing content I disagree with and going around posting all over Reddit and elsewhere trying to direct harassment towards those individuals
19:00:35 <strcat[m]> posting a ton of false claims / misinformation and trying to direct harassment at them
19:00:40 <strcat[m]> and it DOES successfully do that
19:00:45 <strcat[m]> I have seen it many times
19:00:51 <strcat[m]> this is a regular thing not specific to Firefox
19:01:00 <cg_droid> strcat[m], ok, if that's what you want then we'll help
19:01:05 <strcat[m]> this is a way for companies like Mozilla to silence people criticizing them
19:01:19 <strcat[m]> I posted technical information within our community
19:01:22 <strcat[m]> in the documentation
19:01:27 <strcat[m]> as answers to questions on IRC and in our subreddit
19:01:30 <cyredanthem[m]> If you're interested in fighting misinformation we have a small dedicated private group for sharing this stuff
19:01:31 <cyredanthem[m]> cg_droid:
19:01:41 <strcat[m]> it was accurate and thought out
19:01:47 <strcat[m]> and intended to help people using GrapheneOS make good decisions
19:01:47 <cyredanthem[m]> We have been voting and commenting
19:01:55 <cyredanthem[m]> Please join us if you want to help
19:02:17 <strcat[m]> I want to build a nice knowledge base on the site covering different topics
19:02:27 <strcat[m]> also it's the GrapheneOS site not my personal site
19:02:38 <strcat[m]> other people contribute to what's written there
19:02:49 <strcat[m]> most of the FAQ entries were based on what TheJollyRoger started
19:02:51 <cyredanthem[m]> > also it's the GrapheneOS site not my personal site
19:02:51 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes it's bizarre the attacks
19:03:03 <strcat[m]> I don't thing it's bizarre it's a strategy to silence people
19:03:24 <strcat[m]> they don't like that I said something critical of software they like
19:03:28 <strcat[m]> and Mozilla endorses this approach
19:03:32 <strcat[m]> they support it, they give a platform for it
19:03:39 <strcat[m]> it is them doing it, effectively
19:03:49 <strcat[m]> they are not responding to false claims and correcting them - they're fine with it
19:04:01 <strcat[m]> they'd only respond to a false claim critical of them, not one supporting them
19:04:24 <strcat[m]> I don't take that approach, I think you've seen that I shut down discussions that are criticizing something unfairly and I try to correct people misinterpreting what I said, etc.
19:04:43 <strcat[m]> I am okay with people making somewhat on-topic criticisms of other projects if they are accurate/factual
19:04:57 <strcat[m]> sometimes I stop the discussion because it's not sticking to that or is just unnecessary / unconstructive
19:05:27 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], how can I help, I'm not an expert in it
19:05:28 <strcat[m]> it's not like I am posting attacks on Firefox everywhere, it's just now and then people ask about it and I say something those people don't like
19:05:43 <strcat[m]> and when people do stuff like I respond to it
19:06:58 <cg_droid> But I think what strcat[m] posted is obvious and also the madaidan[m] Blog
19:07:36 <nuttso[m]> <strcat[m] "I want to build a nice knowledge"> This would be very good
19:07:56 <cyredanthem[m]> > cyredanthem, how can I help, I'm not an expert in it
19:07:56 <cyredanthem[m]> I'll invite you
19:08:23 <cg_droid> Right now I'm from xmpp
19:08:43 <aeonsolution[m]> <cg_droid "But I think what strcat posted i"> the person spreading their opinion on reddit is just trying to cause conflict, that's the part your missing.
19:08:58 <aeonsolution[m]> > <@freenode_cg_droid:matrix.org> But I think what strcat posted is obvious and also the madaidan. Blog
19:08:58 <aeonsolution[m]>  * the person spreading their opinion on reddit is just trying to cause conflict, that's the part you're missing.
19:09:24 <cg_droid> aeonsolution[m], I see
19:10:46 <skwisgaar[m]> I would like to help too
19:57:31 <limitless0[m]> Daniel shouldn't bother with them anymore.! I mean come on even on their own backyard r/firefox or r/linux and they still cant counter daniel's comments!
19:58:15 <cg_droid> If you don't want to hear you won't
19:58:48 <cg_droid> maybe the solution is to explain it in every technical detail... hard work
19:59:01 <cg_droid> And even then they will continue defending it
19:59:10 <limitless0[m]> Its tempting to joing the conversation there and defend Daniel but other than to tell them to Fuck off i dont know what else to say to them
19:59:20 <cg_droid> lol
20:00:00 <skwisgaar[m]> God is dead, Firefox is my new lord
20:00:30 <cg_droid> And they will tell we are like a cult here
20:00:41 <limitless0[m]> Seriously though even on r/firefox and they have nothing to counter with?! So why go on bitxhing about it
20:01:02 <skwisgaar[m]> Their own sanity depends on them being right
20:01:04 <EssentialChaos[m> <limitless0[m] "Its tempting to joing the conver"> Same, even if could come up with relevant arguments, I'd be just parroting something that has already been said by people, who know this way better
20:01:10 <cg_droid> limitless0[m], that's what I thought but Daniel explained it before
20:01:11 <EssentialChaos[m> And I would also have to create a Reddit account
20:01:38 <limitless0[m]> Xplained what
20:03:13 <cg_droid> "well they are successfully harming by work / productivity and making me upset and scared of what they are going to do and I am not receiving much support from this community when this happens"
20:03:48 <limitless0[m]> But ..
20:04:04 <limitless0[m]> How many people have knowledge to counter this?
20:04:26 <limitless0[m]> I saw people from this room commemting there
20:04:40 <limitless0[m]> But how many hace knowledge
20:04:49 <EssentialChaos[m> <limitless0[m] "How many people have knowledge t"> Not many, but I'd assume it's more like placebo effect
20:05:08 <limitless0[m]> I cant speak with daniel words cos they will ask a question amd i'll be stuck
20:05:14 <cg_droid> limitless0[m], yes, as I said: I'm not an expert but I understand and trust what Daniel and other post
20:05:18 <madaidan[m]> <limitless0[m] "Seriously though even on r/firef"> They can't counter it because it's true
20:05:21 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "Not many, but I'd assume it's mo"> Moral support
20:05:44 <cg_droid> EssentialChaos[m, good point
20:05:45 <limitless0[m]> I'll create an reddit acc and just say fuck off to any comment thats about i xan do
20:05:51 <limitless0[m]> Bitch them about
20:05:54 <madaidan[m]> It's somewhat reassuring that even with this onslaught of attacks, they still can't really counter the claims
20:06:28 <madaidan[m]> Mozilla security devs are literally in that thread
20:06:54 <cg_droid> madaidan[m], are they telling the truth or also lying?
20:06:55 <madaidan[m]> You'd think if Daniel's points were false they'd say something
20:07:00 <limitless0[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Not many, but I'd assume it's mo"> But still my knowledge is very limited on this things. I support daniel in every way and i think he is right all the way i trust him blind since the copperhead days
20:07:23 <madaidan[m]> <cg_droid "madaidan., are they telling the "> They aren't talking about it. They're talking about other things.
20:07:40 <cg_droid> madaidan[m], that's what I need to hear lol
20:07:59 <limitless0[m]> <madaidan[m] "It's somewhat reassuring that ev"> Thats what i said its almost very funny and i feel for Daniel bitchslapping their comments all the way to the bank
20:08:03 <cg_droid> So, if they don't answer is because they have something to hide
20:08:31 <cg_droid> Because it's something related to them
20:08:50 <cg_droid> They can't rebuke Daniel comments
20:08:58 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cg_droid "maybe the solution is to explain"> The solution is to write a book with 50 sources for every assertion made including the opinions of security technicians on Mozilla's own team. No one has the time or expertise to do that. People should be sensible enough not to 'refute' notions they do not understand.
20:09:22 <cg_droid> Difficult solution then
20:10:11 <cg_droid> Trolls will continue trolling
20:15:30 <skwisgaar[m]> The trolls are not interested in having a discussion and learning. They just want to perpetuate their own fantasy. 'Refuting' is just an immediate rejection of the real ideas we want to communicate. They are not actually processing anything we say.
20:15:39 <skwisgaar[m]> It's a shitty situation
20:15:47 <skwisgaar[m]> And that doesn't even factor in the attacking
20:40:26 <headgas[m]> I looked at the convo at the very end so at first I thought you were talking about fantasy trolls lol. I was like are they talking about a movie.  Then I realised...
20:50:46 <kanuk> hi there, trying to file transfer over usb with latest version of graphene, the USB preferences are all greyed out though
20:50:58 <kanuk> enabled usb debugging, tried every usb port on my computer
20:51:12 <kanuk> no notification pops up to ask what i want to do with the connection too
20:51:23 <kanuk> phone is not being detected by computer
20:51:32 <strcat[m]> file transfer is not done via developer options
20:51:36 <strcat[m]> you should disable developer options
20:51:58 <strcat[m]> so do that first, plug it into the computer and press the notification about the USB connection on the phone
20:52:04 <strcat[m]> set it to the file transfer mode
20:52:14 <strcat[m]> the computer needs MTP support - Windows comes with it, most Linux distributions come with it too
20:52:20 <strcat[m]> on macOS you probably need to install an MTP driver
20:53:04 <strcat[m]> MTP is used by pretty much everyone other than Apple
20:53:16 <strcat[m]> Microsoft made it as an extension to PTP IIRC which is what cameras use
20:57:41 <cg_droid> No de bdsm sino de bondage
20:58:01 <cg_droid> Sorry, not this channel lol
20:58:08 <JTL> lolwut
21:00:04 <madaidan[m]> Lmao
21:00:36 <kanuk> USB preferences still greyed out with developer options disabled (and notif does not pop up either), MTP should be working because i used this computer (and this usb port) to install graphene
21:00:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> ah bondage and GrapheneOS. My two favourite things.
21:00:48 <cg_droid> lol
21:00:56 <JTL> hypokeimenon[m]: No comment :)

21:02:50 <cn3m[m]> downvotes be a rolling
21:03:34 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] "posted why Linux is insecure on "> 😂😂😂

21:05:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> Does Chromium debloat and harden the Linux kernel?
21:05:40 <strcat[m]> ADB can transfer files but it's the wrong way to do it
21:05:45 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: you mean ChromiumOS?
21:05:58 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "posted why Linux is insecure on "> I've done that a few times before
21:06:00 <hypokeimenon[m]> <strcat[m] "hypokeimenon: you mean ChromiumO"> Yes sorry, Chromium OS
21:06:03 <madaidan[m]> They really don't like it
21:06:06 <madaidan[m]> Who would've known?
21:06:18 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: not really? I mean they have downstream hardening and they use pretty stripped down kernels
21:06:34 <strcat[m]> and Google are the main contributors to hardening upstream, other than arch-specific work by ARM
21:06:48 <strcat[m]> but they don't drastically change the nature of the kernel
21:07:07 <strcat[m]> it's still a massive monolithic kernel with an unworkable security model and lack of safety/security/robustness
21:07:19 <strcat[m]> can't really change that
21:07:26 <strcat[m]> can just add mitigations, reduce attack surface, make things less bad
21:07:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> Are there plans to port Chromium OS to a different kernel, or are they just going to depreciate it with Fuschia?
21:07:33 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "hypokeimenon: not really? I mean"> What downstream hardening? Anything I can steal^Wimplement?
21:08:00 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I assume it has the same CFI + ShadowCallStack stuff as Android? etc
21:08:27 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I don't think it's much different from Android but they do more stuff with custom LSMs I guess rather than SELinux
21:08:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "What downstream hardening? Anyth"> Safesetid

21:08:39 <strcat[m]> I think they upstreamed a lot already
21:08:46 <strcat[m]> no one else uses much of it really
21:09:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh safesetid would be great
21:09:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Time to destroy magisk for once and for all
21:09:27 <kanuk> i'm just trying to revert to factory images & the phone doesn't seem to want to connect to my pc
21:09:58 <strcat[m]> kanuk: thought you wanted to do file transfer?
21:10:24 <hypokeimenon[m]> <kanuk "i'm just trying to revert to fac"> If it's not connecting something is likely wrong with how you're doing it lol Phones don't have feelings
21:10:26 <cn3m[m]> madaidan.: you should just base Kicksecure off of ChromiumOS in general. The SELinux rules set a good foundation. It supports verified boot(by OS design) and sandboxing measures out of the box. That could also make it easier to move to hardening Fuchsia if that ever do that.
21:10:28 <cn3m[m]> It is the closest to a not completely fucked of Linux distro
21:10:46 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't do that
21:10:46 <kanuk> well yeah i'm trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong lol
21:10:53 <strcat[m]> it's not that hard to set up dm-verity and update_engine yourself
21:11:01 <kanuk> hence coming to the recommended place for graphene support
21:11:17 <kanuk> following the same instructions that worked to go from android > graphene
21:11:23 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't use upstart or quasi-Gentoo-inherited stuff like Chromium
21:11:39 <hypokeimenon[m]> <kanuk "hence coming to the recommended "> Do you get a notification on the dekstop/laptop?
21:11:57 <kanuk> no
21:12:02 <strcat[m]> kanuk: the instructions for installing it work for flashing stock OS
21:12:09 <kanuk> & it's not visible in device manager
21:12:17 <strcat[m]> kanuk: I'm just unclear on if you need to do file transfer first
21:12:22 <strcat[m]> or you just want to install the stock OS as step 1
21:13:12 <strcat[m]> kanuk: if you just want to install the stock OS, follow the install guide but with the stock factory images
21:13:20 <strcat[m]> and do the extra step of erasing avb key to fully revert to stock state
21:13:23 <strcat[m]> before you lock
21:13:35 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
21:13:37 <strcat[m]> this extra step
21:13:53 <hypokeimenon[m]> Are there issues with Gentoo specifically as a base? iirc French Cybersec are also using hardened Gentoo as a base for their publically viewable/available desktop operating system
21:14:09 <kanuk> yeah i am trying to do that but adb/fastboot aren't finding the device
21:14:15 <strcat[m]> kanuk: so you just need to enable oem unlocking in dev options if it's disabled, boot up the phone into fastboot mode
21:14:24 <strcat[m]> kanuk: it has to be in fastboot mode for fastboot to see it
21:14:26 <strcat[m]> don't bother with adb
21:14:51 <madaidan[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Are there issues with Gentoo spe"> It's a massive usability issue.
21:15:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> I compiled gentoo once
21:15:34 <kanuk> i've tried it in fastboot mode
21:15:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> It takes an hour to spin up a base system
21:15:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Compare that to arch
21:15:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Where you can set up a system in less than a minute
21:16:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Gentoo upgrades are also hard
21:16:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Conflict resolution for updates
21:16:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dependency paths break
21:16:25 <kanuk> i am assuming the reason it's not visible is the same reason why the usb preferences are greyed out & there's no notif & my pc does not see it as a device
21:16:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Gentoo can't be secure because the average gentoo system just can't be updated once you're done setting it up
21:17:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless you like to break your system
21:17:30 <aeonsolution[m]> kanuk: I'll help you out, but as a general rule. Any data loss that you may encounter is on the user.
21:17:41 <kanuk> yeah i don't really mind data loss
21:18:01 <kanuk> i mean, unlocking the boot loader is going to reset it anyways eh
21:18:57 <aeonsolution[m]> If you are trying to go back to the orginal OS. Make sure you have OEM unlocked and enabled USB debugging.
21:19:05 <kanuk> check on both
21:19:25 <aeonsolution[m]> What fastboot version do you have?
21:20:21 <kanuk> 30.0.0-6374843
21:20:49 <aeonsolution[m]> Go into the bootloader menu.
21:21:39 <aeonsolution[m]> What state is it in?
21:22:34 <kanuk> device state? locked
21:23:16 <aeonsolution[m]> If you have the USB plugged in the phone unplug it and try plugging it in again.
21:24:08 <aeonsolution[m]> If you have a working usb running: `fastboot flashing unlock`
21:24:12 <aeonsolution[m]> Unlocks the phone
21:24:38 <kanuk> yeah that is how i unlocked it when installing the first go around
21:24:46 <aeonsolution[m]> Then you need to run: `fastboot erase avb_custom_key`
21:25:00 <kanuk> fastboot is not seeing any devices
21:25:20 <aeonsolution[m]> then its the USB
21:25:25 <kanuk> same usb cable & port that worked when installing it
21:25:58 <TheJollyRoger-M> Kanuk are you on Linux and if so do you have your udev rules provisioned?
21:26:07 <kanuk> win10
21:26:18 <kanuk> i guess i can try it on my linux install
21:26:21 <kanuk> see what happens lol
21:26:33 <kanuk> i installed it using this windows install though
21:26:41 <kanuk> like everything is the exact same, which is what i'm finding very weird
21:27:10 <aeonsolution[m]> I would try using a different cable to verify that its not the cable.
21:27:50 <aeonsolution[m]> You have the fastboot the only thing now is the cable. Unless you did something weird to the phone, it should recognize the cable.
21:28:16 <kanuk> hmm, well i think i may know what the problem is/was
21:28:36 <kanuk> the jack on this phone has been shitting the bed recently, flipping the cable around & jiggling it a bit now has it showing up in fastboot
21:28:49 <kanuk> isn't it weird that it was charging it though?
21:29:13 <aeonsolution[m]> Depends on the cables
21:29:30 <kanuk> i'm obviously not super experienced with this kind of stuff but i would have figured if it was charging it would work for this too
21:29:40 <kanuk> fwiw factory pixel 3 usb-c cable
21:29:52 <kanuk> thanks for your help though
21:30:19 <kanuk> just gotta try and keep the cable in the right position throughout this lol
21:31:11 <TheJollyRoger-M> kanuk: this happened to me, if your phone has ever been wet before the USB slot sometimes has a nasty tendency to stop working or do this.
21:36:09 <Oswalt> Hello everyone
21:36:41 <kanuk> yeap back into stock android os now
21:36:54 <kanuk> that was an annoying problem lol
21:37:01 <aeonsolution[m]> Glad it worked out kanuk
21:37:02 <kanuk> thanks again gents
21:37:16 <aeonsolution[m]> When in doubt, blame the cable
21:37:26 <Oswalt> it's always the cable
21:37:26 <kanuk> lol fair enough
21:38:18 <Oswalt> Does anyone know if it's possible to install a custom font on graphene?
21:44:31 <strcat[m]> Oswalt: yes it's possible
21:46:42 <Oswalt> is it very difficult?
21:47:21 <Oswalt> I'd like to have a monospace courier-like font but I can't seem to find any easily accessible settings for changing fonts and styles
21:47:29 <Oswalt> so it must be a bit more tricky than that
21:58:52 <cn3m[m]> https://nm.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/gp3p67/firefox_is_insecure_refuted/frl79t9/
21:58:55 <cn3m[m]> wow
21:59:43 <cn3m[m]> PaleMoon is secure now?
21:59:46 <cn3m[m]> bullshit
23:26:40 <fomijafi[m]> Can someone help me understand how to use keepassdx in the most secure way?
23:27:01 <fomijafi[m]> I understand it may carry some risk tonuse the clipboard?
23:27:19 <cn3m[m]> use the secure keyboard
23:27:26 <cn3m[m]> the clipboard is very locked down on GrapheneOS however
23:27:38 <cn3m[m]> you can find that information on the website
23:28:50 <cn3m[m]> grapheneos.org/faq#clipboard
23:29:30 <fomijafi[m]> Ah thanks, I missed that!
23:30:26 <cn3m[m]> 90% of what you need to know for using GrapheneOS is on the website
23:30:41 <cn3m[m]> no problem I would make sure you've read the whole site in depth
23:34:54 <strcat[m]> the FAQ only has a tiny portion of what I'd like it to have but I do actually add the most frequent questions there
23:35:21 <strcat[m]> other than things that are controversial which I tend to avoid adding there until I have time to deal with it really well...
23:35:41 <cn3m[m]> yeah we've noticed with the Firefox shit
23:36:07 <cn3m[m]> not worth it always to overshare
23:36:08 <strcat[m]> I avoid talking about other operating systems, etc. there
23:36:35 <strcat[m]> and it's why it doesn't explain the usual breakdown I give of why app-accessible root is a bad idea and all the consequences of it
23:36:41 <strcat[m]> just cause I need to do a really good job of writing it up to put it on the site instead of just some reddit comment
23:37:05 <strcat[m]> also site doesn't currently cover what GrapheneOS actually provides in terms of features - just using it
23:37:59 <strcat[m]> although that's kinda odd to cover - because we're improving something that already has good privacy/security, so if we're only covering what we do, it's kinda misleading
23:38:09 <strcat[m]> especially since we've upstreamed a lot of stuff - so that wouldn't be listed anymore
23:41:06 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "although that's kinda odd to cov"> exactly, there's not much to complain about per se with stock AOSP with Pixels
23:41:54 <strcat[m]> my intent with a lot of what I do is to get upstream to do things better
23:41:55 <strcat[m]> various upstreams
23:42:09 <strcat[m]> so then we no longer need to deal with that
23:42:12 <strcat[m]> and move onto other things
23:42:38 <strcat[m]> sucks when the upstream in question is making things worse rather than better though
23:42:56 <strcat[m]> it's hard for me to keep up motivation to work on the Linux kernel side of things
23:43:21 <strcat[m]> especially when they are so hostile towards upstreaming security work or bringing up security concerns
23:43:32 <strcat[m]> I unsubbed from all those lists, etc.
23:43:53 <cn3m[m]> Linux upstream not AOSP upstream right?
23:44:10 <strcat[m]> cn3m: well there is an AOSP fork of the kernel
23:44:20 <strcat[m]> but when I say Linux upstream I mean the Linux kernel upstream
23:45:58 <cn3m[m]> is the only solution to wait for something better on the Linux front?
23:46:12 <cn3m[m]> or hope Google steps up their game
23:47:06 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "is the only solution to wait for"> The only solution currently is to improve Linux by adding new exploit mitigations, reducing attack surface etc. The longterm goal is to switch away from Linux to a microkernel.
23:47:17 <strcat[m]> cn3m: can only apply bandaids to Linux
23:47:39 <madaidan[m]> There's only so much you can do with such a broken base.
23:47:58 <strcat[m]> it's ofc super deeply rooted too
23:48:10 <strcat[m]> something like gVisor can only hope to replace it for the app sandbox
23:48:24 <strcat[m]> you still have the linux kernel with all the drivers
23:48:51 <madaidan[m]> gVisor is really interesting.
23:49:14 <strcat[m]> cn3m: I don't have a short term solution to propose
23:49:34 <strcat[m]> ofc in theory could just start totally from scratch with custom hardware and software from the ground up and make everyone yourself :P
23:49:39 <strcat[m]> gl tho
23:50:24 <cn3m[m]> I appreciate your explanation
23:51:00 <strcat[m]> cn3m: what makes it so frustrating is companies like Apple and Microsoft acknowledge this problem and are hard at work on addressing it
23:51:18 <strcat[m]> Microsoft made an experimental OS with a microkernel in a memory safe language
23:51:21 <strcat[m]> recently
23:51:32 <strcat[m]> and they are working on applying this stuff
23:51:44 <strcat[m]> they embrace memory safe languages, microkernels, etc.
23:52:01 <strcat[m]> Google, Apple, Microsoft are all pretty good with this stuff
23:52:11 <cn3m[m]> I appreciate your explanation
23:52:22 <strcat[m]> but then you have Linux where they have this anti-security culture and a ton of companies involved that are opposed to it for various reasons
23:52:38 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "Microsoft made an experimental O"> I haven't heard of this. do you have a name I can search?
23:52:57 <strcat[m]> they have this culture built around thinking C is the best thing ever, monolithic kernels are wonderful, performance > security/safety, etc.
23:53:08 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "but then you have Linux where th"> The most ridiculous part is how people believe it's the opposite.
23:53:36 <madaidan[m]> I always see people shitting on Microsoft, Apple and Google while praising Linux. It's so stupid.
23:53:40 <cn3m[m]> Google seems to be very held back by their reliance on Linux
23:53:50 <strcat[m]> cn3m: they are, so are others
23:54:06 <strcat[m]> it's a fucked up project really, it is broken and the processes don't scale to what it has become
23:55:08 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "I haven't heard of this. do you "> Singularity
23:55:19 <strcat[m]> cn3m: monolithic kernels elsewhere are more restrained... and in many places they are working on changing away from it
23:55:30 <strcat[m]> cn3m: you've probably seen how your graphics driver on Windows can crash / totally fuck up
23:55:34 <strcat[m]> screen goes black
23:55:36 <strcat[m]> it recovers
23:55:36 <cn3m[m]> speed above all else
23:55:51 <cn3m[m]> right yeah it takes a few seconds
23:55:53 <madaidan[m]> <madaidan[m] "Singularity"> Or maybe it's Midori
23:56:45 <strcat[m]> cn3m: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Display_Driver_Model#Enhanced_fault-tolerance
23:56:57 <strcat[m]> cn3m: they are steadily moving things out of the kernel
23:57:24 <strcat[m]> it's the opposite of the linux kernel trajectory
23:58:01 <madaidan[m]> Hence the "hybrid kernel"
23:58:02 <strcat[m]> cn3m: things getting less bad over time - that's a nice approach
23:58:45 <cn3m[m]> yes while Linux is the opposite
23:59:32 <cn3m[m]> I feel duped for the years I spent learning Linux for security reasons
23:59:42 <strcat[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU
