00:00:22 <TheJollyRoger> You can try using the images from google as a sanity check (Google publishes them), but I highly doubt the factory image is the problem unless you've downloaded an incorrect version, or the version you obtained somehow was corrupted.
00:00:51 <TheJollyRoger> If you need to, you can use those to revert your phone back to the way it used to be.
00:07:58 <ch878787> HEY JOLLY
00:08:07 <ch878787> IT WORKED
00:08:10 <ch878787> I
00:08:12 <ch878787> LOVE YOU.
00:08:32 <ch878787> ARE YOU A MAN/WOMAN OR EITHER/OR. IN ANY CASE. I LOVE YOU. XxXxXXx
00:14:41 <jcpicard32[m]> Lol. Welcome aboard ch878787. Happy to have you, and glad it worked (I'm not Jolly obviously, just saw this)
00:20:55 <nickcalyx[m]> ch878787 the last step is relocking the bootloader
00:21:16 <nickcalyx[m]> Did you,get to,that yet
00:42:29 <fluoridatedsheep> Does graphene use better disk encryption than the normal droid or is it the same?
00:53:47 <overheadscallop[> it's the same file encryption as android 10 (per user profile keys, direct boot etc)
00:54:21 <overheadscallop[>  * it's the same file-based* encryption as android 10 (per user profile keys, direct boot etc)
01:42:36 <jiibus[m]> <radixed9[m] "I am working on improving the up"> Understandable. Appreciate the work you're doing man
01:51:17 <jiibus[m]> I'm really enjoying graphene, however the main thing I really need to find a replacement for is Google Voice. I need a phone number to call from and to give people that isn't my SIM #. Is there any kind of FOSS alternative to it?
01:53:15 <radixed9[m]> <jiibus[m] "I'm really enjoying graphene, ho"> Linphone with voip.ms or jmp.chat(more expensive and more privacy focused) is what I have seen recommended
01:55:45 <jiibus[m]> I'll check em out, thanks
01:58:45 <fluoridatedsheep> <radixed9[m] "Linphone with voip.ms or jmp.cha"> id recommend mysudo but those cucks require it from playstore
01:59:11 <jiibus[m]> Yea, I would totally use them if it didn't require google services
01:59:18 <fluoridatedsheep> does anyone have advice for making my pix see my computer? android 10 is really weird with adb
01:59:29 <fluoridatedsheep> or it might be my wire
02:00:15 <jiibus[m]> > my pix see my computer
02:00:15 <jiibus[m]> What do you mean pix?
02:00:15 <jiibus[m]> Oh. Pixel. Sorry haha
02:00:44 <fluoridatedsheep> like its either my cable is a charge only, or android 10 is just fucky with new devices
02:00:48 <jiibus[m]> Are you just trying to expose the file system?
02:00:58 <fluoridatedsheep> im trying to flash
02:01:18 <jiibus[m]> Did you turn on USB debugging?
02:01:28 <fluoridatedsheep> got the right tools, everythings setup, just cant issue fastboot or adb commands, and yes i did
02:02:00 <TheJollyRoger> fluoridatedsheep: what's the desktop OS?
02:02:11 <fluoridatedsheep> its deb based
02:02:14 <TheJollyRoger> If it's Linux have you set udev rules?
02:02:15 <jiibus[m]> Did you get that authorization prompt on your phone?
02:02:26 <fluoridatedsheep> nada
02:02:31 <fluoridatedsheep> so it might be my wire
02:02:45 <jiibus[m]> Could try clearing out the authorizations
02:02:48 <TheJollyRoger> fluoridatedsheep: /did you set your udev rules/ for adb passthrough?
02:02:55 <jiibus[m]> But yea, cable is a common culprit
02:03:16 <fluoridatedsheep> got it, fucking cable lol
02:03:57 <TheJollyRoger> because if you haven't set your udev rules, fastboot and adb will simply say "what? There's no device here" even though it's connected right before your very eyes.
02:04:15 <fluoridatedsheep> ah, well i got it now :)
02:04:25 <jiibus[m]> Shouldn't debian have it ready?
02:04:32 <TheJollyRoger> jiibus[m]: no
02:04:38 <jiibus[m]> I'm not sure, never used it. Never had a problem with manjaro
02:05:00 <TheJollyRoger> A clumsy workaround in interim is to simply use the root account but that's very inelegant.
02:05:13 <jiibus[m]> fluoridated sheeple: so you got the prompt? sweet
02:09:09 <fluoridatedsheep> ugh, error
02:09:23 <fluoridatedsheep> Device product is 'sargo'.
02:09:23 <fluoridatedsheep> Update requires 'crosshatch'.
02:09:23 <fluoridatedsheep> fastboot: error: requirements not met!
02:10:56 <jiibus[m]> Almost looks like you're using the wrong zip
02:11:12 <fluoridatedsheep> i downloaded the one for 3a
02:12:58 <fluoridatedsheep> ignore me, idk wtf happened... lol
02:13:22 <jiibus[m]> You had a moment, it's ok
02:13:26 <fluoridatedsheep> hopefully i didnt brick this bitch
02:14:56 <fluoridatedsheep> well attempt two in roughly 20 minutes lol
02:56:09 <fluoridatedsheep> im in bois :)
03:05:09 <fluoridatedsheep> is vanadium installable on any droid?
03:15:26 <jcpicard32[m]> fluoridated sheeple: My understanding is that it relies on hardening and compatibility fixes within GrapheneOS. So while it may be possible to get it to run on another system, it would likely require substantial work on your end.
03:15:48 <fluoridatedsheep> ah i see, i was hoping for a quick fix apk. thanks for the knowledge
03:16:27 <jcpicard32[m]> No problem. Bromite is pretty great too if you need something to run on another device.
03:17:04 <fluoridatedsheep> noted, ill check it out. on fdroid?
03:17:40 <jcpicard32[m]> Yes, but you'll need to add a third party repository. See https://www.bromite.org/
03:18:00 <fluoridatedsheep> ah so might as well just dl from the web
03:18:24 <jcpicard32[m]> Sure. It's up to you I guess. I added the repo but either way should work fine.
03:18:31 <jiibus[m]> Aurora droid is a pretty sweet f-droid client. Very easy to add repos
03:19:28 <jiibus[m]> You can get it within f-droid
03:19:40 <fluoridatedsheep> Ah really? ive seen it on there but always just stuck with fdroid
03:20:06 <jiibus[m]> Try it, see if you like it
03:20:13 <fluoridatedsheep> will do!
03:20:28 <fluoridatedsheep> where do you find bromites repo?
03:20:59 <fluoridatedsheep> ah found it, that is easy
03:22:55 <fluoridatedsheep> so after you get aurora droid, fdroid is pretty much useless right?
03:23:18 <jiibus[m]> yea pretty much
03:24:15 <jiibus[m]> Since you're on linux, check out kde connect. Very useful little app to pair up the phone to your PC
03:24:40 <jcpicard32[m]> It should be, although I've never actually used it. Glad to see that someone who has can confirm
03:26:04 <fluoridatedsheep> <jiibus[m] "Since you're on linux, check out"> just for syncing files or whats your usecase?
03:26:29 <fluoridatedsheep> I have a larger target on me and i try to segment all my devices when possible
03:27:56 <jiibus[m]> Does a bunch of stuff. I use it to do things like run commands from my phone, share the clipboard and media control
03:27:56 <jiibus[m]> Ah. Well it would reduce that segmentation aspect.
03:33:05 * fluoridatedsheep sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/eDgwzgZAUZxXeFgVnoYINwcW >
03:33:18 <jiibus[m]> Yea, can't argue with you there.
03:33:29 <jiibus[m]> Always gotta consider your threat model
03:34:03 <fluoridatedsheep> yeah but thanks for all the help! i appreciate the recommendations, making that droid experience more aesthetic
03:35:46 <Jeff[m]> Do you guys think there is any significant privacy risk in using Spotify on grapheneOS?
03:36:02 <fluoridatedsheep> <Jeff[m] "Do you guys think there is any s"> Music is where privacy dies lmao
03:36:11 <Jeff[m]> Haha
03:36:25 <jcpicard32[m]> I use it, and I know some others in here do. If you're paranoid like me you can put it in a work profile/separate user profile
03:36:42 <jiibus[m]> I was just gonna recommend making a separate profile for it
03:36:53 <jcpicard32[m]> I have several big brother apps in a work profile on my phone because I need them for some combination of school, work or talking to my brother in another country
03:37:04 <jcpicard32[m]> Spotify is in that profile with them
03:37:33 <Jeff[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "I use it, and I know some others"> jcpicard32: yeah. I use multiple profiles and Spotify would be my only closed source app on my main profile. Just wondering if its worth it.
03:38:13 <jcpicard32[m]> I'm definitely not the most knowledgeable person here on the subject, but it's probably fine. If c3nm or someone like him knows better and says otherwise definitely default to what they say
03:38:25 <fluoridatedsheep> <Jeff[m] "jcpicard32: yeah. I use multiple"> i personally keep one phone for all the big bro shit, and then one thats hardened to hell.. but thats not practical for everyone
03:38:43 <Jeff[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "I'm definitely not the most know"> jcpicard32: thanks for the tip
03:38:53 <jcpicard32[m]> c3 worked in ad tech so he knows his stuff. Daniel (strcat) and madaidan are other examples of people whose word should definitely be trusted before mine.
03:39:01 <jcpicard32[m]> no problem man
03:39:35 <fluoridatedsheep> for those of you who use graphene as a daily driver (assuming most of you and myself shortly) what do you do for nav? andOSM?
03:40:09 <jcpicard32[m]> I have OSMand and Magic Earth
03:40:09 <Jeff[m]> Maps.me, but nav is the weak link in FOSS
03:40:24 <jcpicard32[m]> I really like Magic Earth for driving, but OSM is pretty great for walking
03:40:39 <fluoridatedsheep> hmm never tried it.. OSM is pretty bad for finding places imo
03:40:53 <fluoridatedsheep> normal addresses never have the right format for it
03:40:53 <jcpicard32[m]> Still hard to find a substitute for Google Maps in the world of FOSS, unfortunately, like Jeff said
03:41:08 <fluoridatedsheep> waze works with gapps.. but i know its owned by the goog
03:41:14 <jiibus[m]> Yea, waze is amazing for getting around traffic. Been thinking about keeping my OnePlus in the car in a faraday bag and whipping it out if I ever need something like waze
03:41:18 <fluoridatedsheep> without gapps**
03:42:32 <jcpicard32[m]> I've had good luck with Magic Earth for addresses. I used it to drive from Cleveland to Philly to Boston this past week and had no real problems with it.
03:43:34 <jiibus[m]> What repo is magic earth on? Can't find it in f-droid
03:43:52 <jiibus[m]>  * What repo is magic earth on? Can't find it in f-droid/ aurora droid
03:44:00 <jcpicard32[m]> It's in playstore/aurora store
03:44:07 <jiibus[m]> Ah!
03:45:48 <jcpicard32[m]> Yeah sorry. I could have been more clear
04:00:57 <generateduser392> couldn't you use g maps in tor?
04:01:33 <generateduser392> won't get step by step but can find address and all the other stuff
04:23:48 <nickcalyx[m]> Maps (Offline OpenStreetMap maps) - https://f-droid.org/app/com.github.axet.maps
04:24:20 <nickcalyx[m]> That program is,IMO,the best open source one out,there
04:25:27 <nickcalyx[m]> However it has some issue where you cant download the initial map, or used to have that problem
05:02:17 <twitx[m]> <generateduser392 "couldn't you use g maps in tor?"> It won't load
05:09:03 <twitx[m]> But I recommend you to take a look at: https://f-droid.org/app/de.grobox.liberario and https://f-droid.org/app/net.osmand.plus
05:22:26 <jalb66> strcat[m], there is a typo in https://grapheneos.org/install where it says: "To download, verify and extract the standalone platform-tools on Windows:" the last line is doing tar over platform-tools_r30.0.0-windows.zip but the version downloaded is r30.0.2
05:37:12 <TheJollyRoger> I'll make the PR. Hang on.
05:39:38 <TheJollyRoger> I'm seeing 30.0.2 here...?
05:43:51 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, yes! 🙂
05:43:58 <jalb66> All ok
05:47:41 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
05:48:09 <TheJollyRoger> If you see a minor problem with the site, you can submit a PR, or if you can't submit a PR, you can ask me to do it on your behalf if you like.
05:48:24 <jalb66> Thank you TheJollyRoger 🙂
05:48:29 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
05:48:52 <TheJollyRoger> Usually that's the easiest way, to just send in PRs.
06:19:27 <jalb66> ok
07:26:27 <cn3m[m]> I hate how fragmented Android is. You have  Google, Huawei, and Amazon doing their own thing all with their own closed services
07:46:49 <renlord[m]> Why is that a problem
07:47:35 <renlord[m]> It's analagous to Android loving people complaining how they hate iOS is walled garden lol
07:47:48 <renlord[m]> They are just different.
07:48:36 <cn3m[m]> I keep hoping someone will make a store that's popular that doesn't need proprietary services. I don't want that Amazon or Huawei stuff on my phone
08:02:22 <DarkUranium> Oh wow, this is populated. Hi folks.
08:03:06 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy DarkUranium! Good to see you here :)
08:03:15 <DarkUranium> Huh. New nick?
08:04:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr
08:04:56 <TheJollyRoger> My old one with the ` unfortunately suffered a name collision with another person in another channel so I had to change it.
08:05:09 <TheJollyRoger> So I prepended "The" to it.
08:08:58 <cn3m[m]> It suits you
08:12:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, thank'ee ^_^.

08:52:21 <furofuro_01[m]> I still cant unlock carrier even after the update
08:52:36 <furofuro_01[m]> What should I do
08:52:40 <furofuro_01[m]> OEM unlock is grayed out
08:54:47 <furofuro_01[m]> I already had internet access
08:55:52 <dallemon[m]> furofuro_01: have you checked the IMEI to verify it's not a Verizon device?
08:56:27 <furofuro_01[m]> IMEI starts at 35
08:56:31 <furofuro_01[m]> -gulps-
08:56:39 <furofuro_01[m]> Oh no.
09:01:44 <furofuro_01[m]> But
09:02:13 <furofuro_01[m]> I can put other sims wit it
09:02:31 <strcat[m]> carrier unlocked != unlocked
09:03:17 <JTL> cute
09:03:20 <JTL> oops wrong channel
09:03:21 <furofuro_01[m]> But
09:03:22 <JTL> Should go to sleep
09:12:33 <furofuro_01[m]> It was found at verizon welp.
09:12:38 <furofuro_01[m]> So yeah, gotta replace
09:13:33 <furofuro_01[m]> I should order something that starts with IMEI 99 right?
09:23:13 <furofuro_01[m]> Looks like the Graphene is delayed
09:23:29 <furofuro_01[m]> <JTL "cute"> Im curious lol
09:25:28 <furofuro_01[m]> That was disappointing ngl
09:27:48 <furofuro_01[m]> * Looks like the Graphene is delayed for me
09:28:45 <cn3m[m]> <a121a[m] "Hi,im sure its not a OS problem "> Could you describe what you are doing?
09:32:33 <fll[m]> a121a: and it won't do anything while power cable is connected either, I assume?
09:32:55 <cn3m[m]> <a121a[m] "i keep pressing the power button"> Did you do the forced reset?
09:35:54 <fll[m]> Not to jinx it since I can only guess here, but I would assume a hardware failure in the power circuit
09:36:42 <fll[m]> ...or maybe the screen
09:37:34 <fll[m]> There is little usb-sticks you can plug in between that show you power consumption
09:38:02 <cn3m[m]> a121a: long press power and volume down and hold
09:38:09 <fll[m]> Those are not expensive. Maybe worth a look
09:38:28 <cn3m[m]> Oh nvm
09:38:43 <cn3m[m]> Lag
09:42:57 <cn3m[m]> It's the buttons

15:30:57 <fluoridatedsheep> <furofuro_01[m] "Is there a workaround for Pixel "> I believe that isnt possible.. unless the carrier unlocks it after its completely paid
15:57:32 <cryptoamnesia[m]> not possible IMO, I tried so many different things. Best thing to do is just lookup the IMEI on verizon's site before you buy.
15:59:29 <fluoridatedsheep> so is strcat daniel micay?
15:59:47 <fluoridatedsheep> I have a recommendation for newer updates, very small but just default privacy settings
16:00:35 <strcat[m]> file an issue on the tracker if you've thought it out
16:01:57 <fluoridatedsheep> I've thought it out.. not intricate at all, was just thinking to turn off the print service by default
16:02:26 <fluoridatedsheep> and maybe restrict internet permissions by default on things like the pdf viewer, clock etc
16:03:16 <fluoridatedsheep> but big fan of the OS, thanks for all the hard work you've put in!

16:43:20 <fluoridatedsheep> Power corrupts absolutely.. and why would those in power seek limitations on themselves? it would be perverse to believe they'd place legitimate limitations against themselves. My two cents
16:44:05 <fluoridatedsheep> anyways i dont want to spam the chat. Feel free to dm if you wanna discuss
17:00:35 <cn3m[m]> 5 eyes and beyond is all speculation at this point

17:29:16 <fluoridatedsheep> hmm, very well could be, unless they had its cracked somehow prior to rollout.. but all speculation

18:28:33 <cn3m[m]> Assuming your apps don't have serious vulnerabilities everything that works on that will work here
18:34:41 <joshman[m]> This ain't no caveat. That's a feature
18:35:25 <fll[m]> slvrsrfrr: aurora store has a tag 'GSF dependent'. Many apps still work although they are marked with the tag, but it's at least a lead
18:36:44 <joshman[m]> We all use different apps. For me personally I have not a single problem to run everything I need for work and leisure
18:38:25 <jcpicard32[m]> It really depends what you need to run. Some apps, like Snapchat, have a hard dependancy on Play Services, due to their use of SafetyNet. Other apps like ProtonMail will work fine, except that push notifications will not work. This is because they use play services to handle push. Best way to find out if people aren't sure is just to try it.
18:38:34 <fll[m]> slvrsrfrr: banking apps often don't work without gsf for example
18:40:05 <fll[m]> Google Maps only works in the browser. The app won't work.
18:50:32 <dallemon[m]> Both Snapchat and Google Maps work fine

23:06:22 <testacct12312312> Hey do any of you guys have experience mounting encrypted external volumes on pixels running graphene? I was thinking of picking up a 3a XL for the extended support but am put off by the 64gb storage limit since thats only like 2/3s of my music library alone. . .
23:07:15 <TheJollyRoger> testacct12312312: EDS Lite, an ordinary USB-C Adapter, and an ordinary USB drive will have you covered.
23:08:05 <TheJollyRoger> I prefer to use a 6" USB-A (F) to USB-C (M) Cable adapter, because that way my phone doesn't have this great big rigid daisy-chain of dongles dangling off the end, but this is largely a personal choice.
23:08:40 <TheJollyRoger> Veracrypt, and Cryptsetup (optionally with ZuluCrypt as a frontend) will read those volumes natively.
23:20:01 <testacct12312312> Ah thanks that's perfect - one other question though, I just had a look at their site and the feature comparison of the Lite version and the full (closed source :[ ) version and it seems only the full version supports hidden containers or combined encryption algorithms. I think my on my current external hard drive (usb c so no cable problems!) uses both of those although I can't remember since it's been so long
23:20:01 <testacct12312312> since I set it up. Any chance thats only referring to setting up encrypted volumes and not decrypting them?
23:21:15 <testacct12312312> Actually on typing that out i realise im just wishful thinking now, guess ill have to re-encrypt without all the extra bells and whistles oh well haha
23:22:08 <testacct12312312> That was still very helpful though, thanks a lot
23:49:55 <faxing[m]> I don’t think they accept crypto but don’t quote me on that
