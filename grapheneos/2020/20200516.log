00:00:34 <JTL> yeah right
00:00:44 <JTL> the naming to directory mapping isn't exact
00:01:08 <JTL> (I was just using that repo as an example)
00:02:27 <dazinism> Composition Kills: A Case Study of Email Sender Authentication https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20fall_chen-jianjun_prepub_0.pdf
00:03:11 <JTL> BrokenCog: Hold on, what does git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/u-boot do?
00:03:50 <dazinism> strcat renlord blacklight447 if you not already seen, thought you may be interested ^
00:04:48 <BrokenCog> JTL:  clone's the repo.
00:04:56 <JTL> ah kay
00:05:02 <JTL> Just seeing if THAT works
00:05:13 <JTL> repo sync still broken?
00:05:13 <BrokenCog> right.
00:05:37 <BrokenCog> for the existing grapheneos-10 tree, works in an empty dir.
00:05:48 <JTL> Okay
00:43:46 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: there is throttling by IP for the AOSP repos
00:43:56 <strcat[m]> maybe you triggered it or have an IP being used to DoS it
00:45:19 <TheJollyRoger> Hey strcat, could I PM you for a sec?
00:45:20 <BrokenCog> maybe.  on the clean/fresh sync I was getting a couple errors and changed to -j10 which seems to be running fine.  However, in the existing tree the sync fails even with -j1 ... maybe they have my IP blacklisted or osmething.
00:45:38 <JTL> BrokenCog: Are you behind a CGNAT or similar?
00:45:50 <JTL> strcat[m]: Surprised I never ran into that myself lol
00:46:56 <BrokenCog> well, I wouldn't know what the provider has implemented in their NATs, but I don't have anything unusual in the LAN.  I'm not sure actually if this is the first sync I've done with an existing tree ... I guess I'll find out if something is wrong in the specific sync, or generally after this fresh sync completes and I re-try.
00:47:33 <JTL> Moreso I was asking if your WAN IP is behind a NAT or not
00:54:52 <BrokenCog> not the WAN IP, but the router's LAN holding it boviously.
00:54:53 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: yes
00:56:39 <TheJollyRoger> OKay!
01:29:45 <clathu[m]> What do you guys think about this project ?
01:29:45 <clathu[m]> https://github.com/Gedsh/InviZible/blob/master/README.md
01:34:29 <strcat> DNS-over-TLS is built into the OS
01:36:44 <strcat> also worth noting that the normal i2p software is memory safe and PurpleI2P regresses that by switching to C++
01:36:51 <strcat> so it trades security for lower memory usage
01:37:26 <strcat> I think the OS supported DNS-over-TLS is what should be used
01:37:34 <strcat> so this doesn't make sense
01:37:54 <JTL> Agreed. I don't see why reinventing the wheel here is going to do any good
01:38:20 <madaidan[m]> And there's already Orbot for Tor
01:38:47 <strcat> it would make sense to have a new app to do Tor instead of Orbot that's more robust - but I'm not convinced that this will be, and it includes this other stuff which I don't think it should
01:39:21 <strcat> also worth noting that Tor uses permissive licensing
01:39:36 <strcat> these apps take it and wrap it up in more restrictive licensing
01:39:55 <strcat> GPLv3 licensing terms forbid an OS like GrapheneOS from bundling it
01:40:43 <strcat> GPLv2 is fine but it's better to have software where the code isn't incompatible with other projects
01:42:38 <strcat> *BSDs consider GPLv3 non-free, as do a lot of others
01:46:14 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh.
01:55:22 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe that's what Theo De Raadt meant when he was saying stuff about their code being wrapped in GPL stuff and then not being able to get it back.
02:10:20 <aeonsolution[m]> hey everyone!
02:18:16 <aeonsolution[m]> has anyone gotten this error building the development branch:
02:18:17 <aeonsolution[m]> FAILED: out/soong/.intermediates/frameworks/base/test-api-stubs-docs/android_common/check_current_api.timestamp
02:18:17 <aeonsolution[m]> ( rm -rf "out/soong/.intermediates/frameworks/base/test-api-stubs-docs/android_common/current-apicheck/srcjars" && ...
02:18:43 * aeonsolution[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/rGmzAegXeYzqysrRouuouDJL >
02:19:05 <JTL> Yeah
02:19:25 <JTL> make test-api-stubs-docs-update-current-api usually fixes it, you can diff the changes it makes to make sure it's not doing anything strange
02:20:15 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, where do i jump back to?
02:20:33 <aeonsolution[m]> am i supposed to run `repo diff`?
02:20:45 <aeonsolution[m]> oh
02:21:01 <aeonsolution[m]> you mean `m test-api-stubs-docs-update-current-api`
02:21:25 <aeonsolution[m]> sorry, my eyes got cross eyed
02:23:06 <JTL> That should work
02:23:20 <JTL> not usd to this "m" from "make" toolchange though
02:24:07 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, it clicked after i looked at it for a second
02:24:13 <JTL> Okay
02:24:20 <aeonsolution[m]> it looks like its working ^^
02:29:43 <aeonsolution[m]> JTL: THAT FIXED IT
02:30:03 <aeonsolution[m]> alright, lets flash this phone
02:33:02 <aeonsolution[m]> lol i just noticed that command was in the log, nice
02:34:22 <JTL> heh
04:46:13 <strcat> renlord: btw you need to set adkim=s and aspf=s in DMARC policy to enforce exact domain matches for subdomains
04:47:10 <strcat> renlord: so for example to enforce that foo.grapheneos.org can't send mail as grapheneos.org which is important if you use a CNAME for anything
04:47:24 <renlord> does that mean that without the above settings someone can spoof foo.renlord.com?
04:47:28 <strcat> no
04:47:42 <strcat> renlord: but if you set foo.grapheneos.org as a CNAME pointing as a service foo
04:47:58 <strcat> the service foo can probably send fake emails as grapheneos.org
04:48:09 <renlord> but why'd an admininstrator be concerned that services in their zone would misbehave?
04:48:42 <strcat> renlord: well for example bing has me set a CNAME to point at verify.bing.org to prove ownership and I don't want bing to be able to send email as grapheneos.org
04:49:01 <strcat> renlord: adkim=s aspf=s just enforces that each subdomain has a separate spf / dkim setup
04:49:17 <strcat> renlord: you probably do want it
04:49:34 <strcat> all I had to do to support it was add a dkim record for mail.grapheneos.org and have it refer to that instead of the grapheneos.org one
04:50:18 <renlord> alright thanks for letting me know
04:50:22 <strcat> renlord: you probably don't want a subdomain to be able to send mail as the main domain basically
04:50:30 <strcat> esp. if you point one at another service with a CNAME
04:50:32 <strcat> that's all
04:50:34 <strcat> it's a minor thing
04:50:42 <renlord> i do use cnames with github.io pages
04:51:01 <renlord> so i probably have to do it, but it's not intuitive to me why dkim policies take cnames into account
04:51:20 <strcat> renlord: when you put a CNAME, you delegate SPF/DKIM to that CNAME
04:51:35 <renlord> but its so obviously a different zone
04:51:38 <renlord> @_@
04:52:15 <strcat> renlord: so basically they could send email as the main domain without aspf=s
04:52:45 <strcat> renlord: since they can add an spf policy for foo.renlord.com (since you delegated it to them) and allow their own mail server
04:52:54 <strcat> renlord: so, you obviously delegated the ability to send mail as foo.renlord.com
04:53:05 <strcat> but you may not realize you delegated the ability to send mail as bar.renlord.com or renlord.com
04:53:09 <strcat> unless you set a strict DMARC policy
04:53:42 <aeonsolution[m]> hey strcat,renlord when you flash the development branch, has it happened to you that when the script finishes running, fastd restarts without letting you select 'restart to fastboot'? i did a sanity check and flashed the previous qq2a.200405.005 release and was able to boot GrapheneOS
04:53:54 <aeonsolution[m]> i cant boot my graphene-10 build
04:54:17 <strcat> renlord: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489#section-3.1.1
04:54:33 <strcat> renlord: next section is for spf
04:54:53 <strcat>    For example, if a message passes an SPF check with an
04:54:55 <strcat>    RFC5321.MailFrom domain of "cbg.bounces.example.com", and the address
04:54:57 <strcat>    portion of the RFC5322.From field contains "payments⊙ec",
04:54:59 <strcat>    the Authenticated RFC5321.MailFrom domain identifier and the
04:55:01 <strcat>    RFC5322.From domain are considered to be "in alignment" in relaxed
04:55:03 <strcat>    mode, but not in strict mode.
05:04:26 <renlord> aeonsolution[m]: sometimes happens to me
05:04:36 <renlord> but only happens if flashed incorrectly
05:04:47 <renlord> just repeat the steps
05:05:25 <aeonsolution[m]> the flashing or the entire process?
05:05:45 <renlord> aeonsolution[m]: are you flashing a user build? or userdebug?
05:05:48 <strcat> never experienced those kinds of issues
05:05:52 <aeonsolution[m]> userdebug
05:06:19 <renlord> if the flash-all step not done correctly, it could happen
05:06:30 <renlord> but it only happened to me when i was still very new to the process
05:06:42 <renlord> it almost never happens anymore.
05:06:51 <renlord> i cant even remember what i did wrong back then
05:07:13 <renlord> i should probably record these basic errors for quick reference in future
05:07:26 <aeonsolution[m]> will do; another quick question
05:07:54 <aeonsolution[m]> is the development build folder supposed to have an 'avb_pkmd.bin'
05:08:48 <aeonsolution[m]> thats one difference i noticed in my working release and my development build
05:09:01 <aeonsolution[m]> the development build doenst have that file
05:09:11 <renlord> if you're doing development and dont use dm-verity
05:09:14 <renlord> you can probably ignore that
05:09:32 <renlord> are you looking at setting up for development only?
05:09:36 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: you're supposed to have avb_pkmd.bin if you're making signed builds
05:09:43 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: it sounds like you missed that step
05:10:00 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: you're not making it clear what you're talking about though
05:10:02 <aeonsolution[m]> renlord: only development for now since it has less steps
05:10:04 <strcat> be more specific
05:10:17 <strcat> there are the same number of steps
05:10:25 <renlord> aeonsolution[m]: very important that its completely unsafe to use dev build for production
05:10:30 <renlord> its not the matter of cutting steps
05:10:35 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: there aren't fewer steps for one or the other
05:10:48 <strcat> the only difference is whether you use the 10 branch or a tag for repo
05:11:05 <strcat> tags *can be* verified via the signature but that's not mandatory
05:11:51 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: where I think I'm getting lost is after the `m` step
05:12:10 <strcat> are you trying to make a development build that isn't signed
05:12:14 <strcat> or a release build that is signed
05:12:20 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#faster-builds-for-development-use-only
05:12:26 <strcat> m is the final step
05:12:41 <aeonsolution[m]> i am making a development build that isn't signed
05:12:50 <strcat> mkdir grapheneos-10
05:12:51 <strcat> cd grapheneos-10
05:12:53 <strcat> repo init -u https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest.git -b 10
05:12:55 <strcat> repo sync -j32
05:12:57 <strcat> source script/envsetup.sh
05:13:07 <strcat> choosecombo release aosp_sargo userdebug
05:13:09 <strcat> m
05:13:18 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: well also building the kernel + android-prepare-vendor
05:13:25 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Hey, since you all are here - where's everyone getting Windows LTSC, if you're using it?
05:13:25 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Part II: possible for a small medical office to order it?
05:13:28 <strcat> but that's most of the process
05:13:38 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: m is the final step - that runs the build - what are you trying to do after?
05:13:53 <JTL> DannyWorkOrderPr: I know what you're asking, but I'm not sure either
05:14:05 <strcat> (what I posted above will work for the emulator target just not a device requiring vendor files and a custom kernel build)
05:14:50 <strcat> just use the normal Pro version
05:15:42 <renlord> adkim=s; aspf=s;
05:15:47 <renlord> i actually already do have them set
05:16:45 <strcat> ah good
05:17:32 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: the stable tags and dev branch are the same code other than the stable tags being tags
05:17:34 <aeonsolution[m]> <strcat "aeonsolution: m is the final ste"> then i tar xf ~/grapheneos-10/vendor/android-prepare-vendor/sargo/qq2a.200501.001.b2 and  ./flash-all.bat
05:17:38 <strcat> the build process is identical
05:17:55 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: don't know what you mean
05:17:58 <strcat> why are you doing that?
05:18:32 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: the final step is `m` to build a dev build - there is nothing after that, you aren't supposed to do anything with android-prepare-vendor afterwards
05:18:40 <strcat> and there is no flash-all script
05:18:52 <aeonsolution[m]> oh
05:18:53 <strcat> because you aren't generating a signed release with an ota update and factory images
05:18:58 <strcat> you're doing stuff not in the instructions
05:19:05 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/build#faster-builds-for-development-use-only
05:19:06 <strcat> look
05:19:09 <strcat> there's nothing after this
05:19:21 <strcat> the other stuff listed after is about signing a release
05:19:40 <strcat> if you do things not in the instructions it will go wrong - just follow them
05:19:50 <strcat> there's nothing missing from the instructions, you don't need to invent your own process
05:20:11 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, so then development is just for an emulator
05:20:14 <strcat> no
05:20:19 <aeonsolution[m]> you dont put that on a phone to test?
05:20:21 <strcat> didn't say that
05:20:30 <strcat> you're confusing different things
05:20:43 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, yeah can you help me understand
05:20:53 <strcat> stable tags vs. development branch are about which code you are syncing, the build / signing process is IDENTICAL for both, there is no difference - look at the instructions
05:20:59 <renlord> just follow the instructions verbatim first, then understand later.
05:21:38 <strcat> there are 2 ways to build: a signed release, or a development build, this is not tied to which device you are building for or whether you are building a stable tag or the development branch
05:21:45 <strcat> the instructions cover both
05:22:05 <strcat> for a signed release you need to build target-files-package, for a dev build you don't so you can use `m` by itself
05:22:17 <strcat> that's the entire building step, there's nothing after aside from signing a release
05:22:30 <strcat> the build process is 1 step: m, or m target-files-package if you need to sign it
05:22:37 <strcat> for the OS
05:22:50 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: you need to do things in the order they are listed as the page and don't add your own steps
05:22:56 <strcat> it covers the whole process, in order
05:23:00 <strcat> there is no step to add
05:23:13 <strcat> if you're EVER running a command not listed there, you're doing your own process, not what's there
05:23:22 <strcat> it covers every single command that needs to be entered
05:23:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: You use Windows Pro? MS telemetry and all?
05:23:24 <strcat> in order
05:23:54 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: I don't live in an alternate reality where there's invasive telemetry that can't be disabled
05:24:07 <strcat> I know a lot of privacy activists live in an alternate reality in their head
05:24:08 <strcat> I don't
05:24:26 <renlord> i've been contemplating just using windows as my base OS
05:24:31 <strcat> don't believe everything you read from uninformed and/or dishonest people
05:24:35 <aeonsolution[m]> im going to process that, i got the steps for building the development branch; i just need to figure out the other workflows
05:24:36 <renlord> they seem to have saner out-of-box security
05:24:57 <renlord> without too much knob tinkering and all
05:24:58 <aeonsolution[m]> thanks strcat and renlord
05:25:18 <strcat> I have 2 monitors, one is hooked up to my workstation, the other to my Windows computer
05:25:53 <strcat> workstation is basically strictly for work
05:25:54 <renlord> thinking of just using a linux VM for all dev instead
05:25:58 <renlord> fuck xorg really
05:26:04 <strcat> I should probably swap the GPUs
05:26:09 <strcat> my 1080 Ti is in my workstation atm
05:26:11 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: Oh, I definitely don't. But, in the age of big companies like Microsoft turning telemetry toggles back on with updates, Google being taken to court for collecting and working with location data from those with those settings turned off, it's... Pretty tough to trust those toggles.
05:26:12 <strcat> but I want to rebuild both
05:26:30 <renlord> 1080Ti abit too much for work no?
05:26:32 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: in both cases you're making misleading statements
05:26:33 <renlord> lol
05:26:39 <strcat> renlord: it wasn't strictly a work computer
05:26:39 <renlord> so much TDP just to render text
05:26:43 <strcat> I used to have windows on a separate drive
05:26:46 <strcat> not a separate computer
05:27:40 <strcat> the Pro version will give you better security than the frozen LTS releases
05:27:42 <renlord> xorg gives me nightmares and wayland is a timesink
05:27:51 <dan-v[m]> if you want crystal clear text on your terminals you need at least a 2080
05:27:54 <renlord> ya, i will very likely just install windows as base
05:27:57 <strcat> renlord: I used to dual boot with different drives, that's why
05:28:15 <JTL> dan-v[m]: That font antialiasing is so graphically intensive eh?
05:28:17 <strcat> and I was playing games that supported linux on linux, but you get lower fps and the graphics are worse so I stopped a while ago
05:28:30 <dan-v[m]> JTL: haha
05:28:48 <JTL> (Joking obviously)
05:28:50 <strcat> renlord: also my windows computer doesn't have a good enough GPU for the 1080 Ti atm, probably
05:28:53 <cn3m[m]> I use Damn Vulnerable Linux. Linux doesn't have malware /s
05:28:58 <strcat> I need to rebuild both
05:29:00 <JTL> ahahaha
05:29:13 <renlord> LOL 2080 for font
05:29:16 <renlord> nice
05:29:21 <strcat> renlord: I don't dual boot anymore so I can use both at the same time
05:29:21 * leohopper[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/NBqGoXXtLrilDSAUFEZJzWeD >
05:29:28 <renlord> font with pretty shading also?
05:29:30 <renlord> ray tracing?
05:29:49 <JTL> lol
05:30:28 <strcat> leohopper[m]: this is a dishonest article and shouldn't be posted here
05:30:45 <strcat> it's misinformation
05:30:56 <cn3m[m]> yeah that's a stupid article
05:30:58 <JTL> Pavel Durov smoking from his crackpipe eh?
05:31:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> JTL: LMAO
05:31:25 <JTL> Although the attack surface of various IM apps could be a valid discussion
05:31:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: The W10 telemetry turning back on is mostly reports from social media, and obviously I cannot verify. Troublesome "bug" to hear about, though.
05:31:42 <cn3m[m]> an exploit is not a backdoor
05:31:43 <strcat> leohopper[m]: I don't understand the relevance of GrapheneOS - you seem VERY confused
05:31:51 <strcat> leohopper[m]: I'd suggest starting by no longer reading misinformation
05:31:53 <JTL> (And not the shit that Durov talks about)
05:32:13 <strcat> leohopper[m]: the article is just misinformation and full of inaccurate and dishonest claims
05:32:16 <strcat> so throw away the article
05:32:24 <strcat> if you have a question, ask the question, don't involve the misinformation post
05:32:28 <JTL> strcat: I think he's asking if those known past vulnerabilities were exploitable with WhatsApp on a GrapheneOS device
05:32:50 <renlord> strcat: do you use like a raptor for your workstation like TheJollyRoger?
05:32:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: I know OT, and will take your comments off the air, haha, but, this, regarding my Google comment: https://apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb/AP-Exclusive:-Google-tracks-your-movements,-like-it-or-not
05:32:53 <strcat> no I think he's asking what 'all data on the phone' means which is just a dishonest claim
05:33:27 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: this is an inaccurate article
05:33:35 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: doesn't demonstrate / prove what you said
05:33:47 <strcat> it's not accurate and the people writing it and spinning the facts and making incorrect statements based on their misunderstandings
05:33:50 <strcat> which is typical
05:34:11 <strcat> as always, my suggestion is not to take the poor quality of information from mainstream journalists at face value and actually confirm what is or isn't true
05:34:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Google tracking location, even with the preference indicating you'd like them not to? haha - maybe I'm missing something?
05:34:19 <strcat> don't get your tech information from non-technical journalists
05:34:31 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: it's not accurate - it's either totally ignorant or dishonest
05:34:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> ^+1
05:34:34 <strcat> take your pick
05:34:49 <strcat> I think it's both
05:34:54 <renlord> mostly clickbait
05:34:56 <renlord> tbh
05:35:02 <strcat> so now, move on, and stop posting misinformation here
05:35:04 <renlord> an exercise in job security.
05:35:19 <strcat> I suggest reading what the location history option says and what the other options say
05:35:21 <JTL> renlord: Ahahaha
05:35:36 <renlord> gotta up fkin click quotas
05:35:37 <renlord> s/up/meet/
05:35:47 <JTL> Gotta get that ad revenue
05:35:48 <strcat> the location history option is about maps building a location history by regularly obtaining location
05:35:57 <cn3m[m]> I get my information about privacy pretty much from my own MITMs and common sense. It works
05:36:02 <leohopper[m]> > strcat: I think he's asking if those known past vulnerabilities were exploitable with WhatsApp on a GrapheneOS device
05:36:02 <leohopper[m]> Yes exactly - sorry for not being clear on that
05:36:09 <strcat> they never said disabling that doesn't mean there won't be location in web/app history
05:36:13 <dan-v[m]> huh interesting, didn't realize there are actually gpu accelerated terminal emulators (e.g. https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
05:36:26 <strcat> leohopper[m]: I am not going to answer what you posted because it is unclear and what I say can be twisted / misunderstood
05:36:39 <strcat> leohopper[m]: I won't refer to a misinformation / propaganda piece that's totally inaccurate and dishonest
05:36:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > leaving “Web & App Activity” on and turning “Location History” off only prevents Google from adding your movements to the “timeline,” its visualization of your daily travels. It does not stop Google’s collection of other location markers.
05:36:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Seems a good summary of the dark patterns used in telemetry UI =[
05:36:49 <strcat> leohopper[m]: if you want to ask a question, ask a clear and specific question without involving that
05:36:56 <strcat> I won't answer or allow an answer to what you asked, try again
05:36:57 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS won't let apps escape the sandbox
05:37:18 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: it isn't a dark pattern
05:37:59 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: turning off location history disables location history
05:38:44 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: if you just carry around the device and don't do anything with it, your location is no longer going to be recorded by a service, since you disabled the background / passive location history feature that's part of maps
05:38:58 <strcat> that's a maps feature, not a Play Services or Android feature
05:39:51 <strcat> leohopper[m]: anyway you need to ask a clearer question
05:39:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Non-techheads don't see "Location History" as a service name. They see it as a type of data concept. So, yeah, when they open their phone and run a search, or use Duo to send a picture, or open the Gmail app, they're still expecting their location not to be stored and used for an ad profile. Buuut, it is.
05:40:07 <strcat> leohopper[m]: it's not true that the vulnerability gives access to all data on the device, it's not true that it's a backdoor - those are dishonest/inaccurate claims
05:40:28 <strcat> leohopper[m]: so, that is the only answer you'll get with what you posted - what the post claims to exist does not exist, and I cannot tell you about something that does not exist in terms of relevance to GrapheneOS
05:40:54 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: turning off location history turns off location history
05:41:07 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: I'm not saying that it's a service name
05:41:09 <strcat> I'm sayiong it does that
05:41:16 <strcat> as I already said
05:41:18 <strcat> > if you just carry around the device and don't do anything with it, your location is no longer going to be recorded by a service, since you disabled the background / passive location history feature that's part of maps
05:41:58 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: I'm not sure what there is to misunderstand or spin like this
05:42:49 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: disabling location history is a maps / google account thing, has nothing to do with the location permission on the device, whether photos have a tagged location, whether various apps use location
05:43:02 <strcat> it's not an OS configuration setting
05:43:22 <strcat> go to https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols and look at it
05:43:29 <strcat> Location History (paused)
05:43:31 <strcat> Saves where you go with your devices, even when you aren't using a specific Google service, to give you personalised maps, recommendations based on places that you've visited and more. Learn more
05:44:28 <strcat> what gives you the impression that disabling location history would disable using location for other things?
05:44:50 <strcat> it disables actively monitoring and recording a location history - that's it
05:45:00 <strcat> I think it maps well to what it does
05:45:17 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Me? It doesn't. But, I'm not their target market (the other 95%+ of users).
05:45:31 <strcat> so above that it has
05:45:35 <strcat> Web & App Activity (paused)
05:45:37 <strcat> Saves your activity on Google sites and apps, including associated information like location, to give you faster searches, better recommendations and more personalised experiences in Maps, Search and other Google services. Learn more
05:45:45 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: and disabling BOTH of these obviously doesn't mean location isn't used
05:45:58 <strcat> it means that keep track of usage history and location history is disabled
05:46:07 <strcat> so it won't keep a history of searches, etc.
05:46:39 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: if what you want to do is not give them location, that's an OS / browser setting, this is about what kinds of history gets recorded
05:46:54 <strcat> > Choose which settings will save data in your Google Account.
05:47:13 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: I don't think anything is unclear about this
05:47:18 <strcat> to anyone, technical or not
05:48:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > obviously doesn't mean location isn't used
05:48:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Being used would be cool with most, but stored against an ad profile, or given to people trying to find someone to match a crime based on proximity or something, are a bit different.
05:48:40 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: you're again making misleading statements
05:48:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Definitely glad to have an OS I trust to do those OS-level toggles, these days =] A good opportunity to say, thanks again!
05:48:49 <strcat> vague and misleading statements / spin
05:49:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Misleading implies intent...of which I have none besides learning through discussion, mate
05:49:33 <strcat> yeah it does imply intent
05:50:12 <strcat> only because you keep doing it
05:50:16 <strcat> otherwise it wouldn't
05:50:43 <strcat> I can say something is misleading without that implying the author intentionally made it to be that way
05:50:49 <strcat> but that is what those journalists intended
05:51:23 <strcat> > The data saved in your account helps to give you more personalised experiences across all Google services. Choose which settings will save data in your Google Account.
05:51:30 <strcat> i.e. these are toggles to control what HISTORY is saved
05:51:38 <strcat> not what data is given to them and not saved
05:51:39 <cyredanthem[m]> Is this about Windows 10 still?
05:51:43 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes misleading isn't intentional necessarily
05:51:52 <cyredanthem[m]> Misleading is essentially fake news
05:52:29 <strcat> and I don't see anything misleading or deceptive about how they have 'Web & App Activity' as a global toggle for tracking usage history and a separate toggle for active monitoring / saving of location history
05:52:51 <strcat> important to note location history is disabled by default
05:52:56 <strcat> and always has been
05:53:08 <strcat> if you have never EXPLICITLY enabled location history, it isn't enabled
05:53:15 <strcat> it isn't something people have to go and disable
05:53:50 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3118687
05:54:04 <strcat> and yes this is separate from the general Web & App activity history toggle - which is enabled by default
05:54:44 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: since this is an opt-in feature and they don't nag to you to enable it / bother you if you don't, I don't think it's particularly relevant to anything
05:55:08 <strcat> Web & App activity is what people have to opt-out of having, that's the toggle people need to explicitly turn off after making an account
05:55:41 <strcat> and it does not do involve anything that actively monitors / records location - it's an app / web (search mostly) history
05:58:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Which includes location data from everything between Maps/messaging apps, to the weather widget, lol =\
05:58:11 <strcat> and opting out of that is just opting out of history - it is a totally separate thing from whether you have your OS / browser configured to send them history
05:58:25 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: what else would you expect?
05:58:53 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: when you do a search on maps and you have history of searches enabled - what do you expect?
05:59:01 <cyredanthem[m]> Google isn't the top privacy company exactly
05:59:03 <cyredanthem[m]> They aren't as bad as people say
05:59:25 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: when you grant location access to the search engine in the browser, and you have search history enabled - what do you expect?
05:59:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Again, this is a debate regarding the understanding of Google's market, the average user
05:59:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> whom we both agree needs better education and understanding into their daily tools
06:00:02 <strcat> yeah and I don't think there's anything confusing for the average user
06:00:07 <strcat> first of all location history is not enabled by default
06:00:21 <strcat> there is a single unified web & app activity enabled by default and it prompts you to review that regularly
06:00:33 <strcat> and you can see the data that's there, it clearly lists it all
06:00:40 <strcat> so there's nothing secret about what it records
06:00:57 <strcat> it regularly sends you an email to review it, and when you first go to that page you see the latest history
06:01:09 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But the location-saving of other apps/onphone bits are recorded and stored - perhaps safely hashed and only used securely in ad profiles. Perhaps.
06:01:09 <strcat> so you'll see your latest searches and if you have location enabled for the search engine it'll be there
06:01:30 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: I don't know what you mean by 'hashed' there...
06:01:36 <strcat> and I don't know what you're trying to say
06:01:41 <strcat> I think you're continuing to be misleading and spin this
06:02:24 <strcat> it's perfectly valid to disagree with web & app activity being enabled by default, or the lack of granularity that's offered
06:02:35 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I think we just have a difference of opinion on how easy it is for someone's mom to understand the metadata, and further, the importance of the metadata, they're giving their phone.
06:03:00 <strcat> this is about a google account not settings on the phone
06:03:33 <strcat> there is a big difference between disallowing location for google apps and disabling web & app activity
06:03:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> For people that aren't like us, Android == Google. It's wrong, in a hundred ways, but that's what they're presented (internationally) by Google/carriers, etc
06:04:11 <strcat> I don't think there's anything misleading or confusing about these settings and people claiming there is are just being dishonest generally
06:04:17 <strcat> and I won't permit that here
06:04:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > lack of granularity
06:04:45 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Big time. You should be able to turn off Location point storage for EVERY app and service, and if you can't do that, it should be explained why.
06:04:47 <strcat> valid: criticism for the history that's enabled by default (the location history feature is an opt-in setting that is not nagged about)
06:05:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Sorry for damaging the community.
06:05:24 <strcat> valid: criticism for the lack of granularity (i.e. you can turn off history of searches, app usage, etc. everywhere but you don't have granular toggles such as if you WANTED to save your search history or certain app usage history)
06:05:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Goodnight, all
06:05:38 <strcat> valid: criticism for the nagging if you disable web & app activity
06:06:13 <strcat> not valid: complaining about location history being enabled by default since it ISN'T and they NEVER try to trick you or nag you to enable it - I have had a device running stock as a reference for years, I know
06:06:32 <strcat> not valid: claiming that it's misleading to have a separate toggle for location history
06:06:34 <strcat> in fact
06:06:48 <strcat> that complaint conflicts with complaining about the granularity
06:07:29 <strcat> location history actively monitors and stores your location - that's super invasive, just carrying around the device builds a location history - there's a reason it's opt-in (not enabled by default) and separate
06:07:54 <strcat> an app recording location when you have allowed it location access and have app usage history enabled is much less invasive, it requires actively doing something
06:09:10 <strcat> basically people complaining about this separate are saying they want things to be less granular and they're ignoring that location history is off by default
06:09:28 <strcat> I don't see how it's a bad thing that they actually kept it as a separate opt-in feature since they actually acknowledge how invasive that is
06:09:41 <strcat> it would be good if MORE stuff was a separate opt-in feature
06:10:20 <strcat> or if web & app activity was off by default and they didn't nag, then there wouldn't really be anything to complain about
06:10:32 <strcat> in terms of this history
06:11:13 <strcat> if people decide to opt-in to location history they can't act surprised about it
06:11:26 <strcat> but it's valid to be surprised there is web & app history
06:11:45 <strcat> it's not valid to pretend having the location history toggle is misleading, that's just stupid, and counter-productive
06:11:55 <strcat> you want that merged with the enabled by default, much less invasive stuff? :|
06:12:30 <strcat> I could see why someone would want to enable that - or why someone would want to enable search / app usage history
06:12:46 <strcat> but I think it's wrong that it's enabled by default
06:12:54 <strcat> location history is off by default - good
06:13:06 <strcat> web and app usage history should be off by default too, and split up more
06:13:20 <strcat> I seem to remember it was split up more and people found it confusing so they made it one big toggle
06:13:37 <strcat> I remember having to separately disable search history and other things 10 years ago or something
06:13:57 <strcat> I never disabled 'web and app activity', I disabled the more granular things that came before
06:15:42 <renlord> strcat: ah yes
06:15:47 <renlord> does nsjail work inside docker?
06:15:55 <strcat[m]> renlord: probably not?
06:16:01 <strcat[m]> don't know
06:16:08 <renlord> i tried building yesterday inside docker and it complained that nsjail doesnt work
06:16:13 <renlord> and i should report it
06:16:15 <strcat[m]> yeah namespaces don't nest properly
06:16:34 <renlord> ok, is the default docker namespacing adequate enough compared to nsjail/
06:16:43 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes
06:16:43 <renlord> or i should run in docker privilege and delegate to nsjail?
06:17:10 <strcat[m]> renlord: the purpose of the build jail is to stop it from accidentally breaking the OS and deleting your data, and to stop it from having accidental dependencies on the outside environment
06:17:17 <strcat[m]> it's not really a security feature
06:18:01 <renlord> i see
06:18:09 <strcat[m]> renlord: and the build jail is used for the main build itself - it isn't used for shell you source envsetup, building the kernel, android-prepare-vendor, etc.
06:18:19 <strcat[m]> it's used for the soong build when you run `m`
06:18:21 <strcat[m]> it enters the build sandbox
06:18:26 <renlord> but i read it enables seccomp-bpf filters and all
06:18:37 <renlord> so doesnt it count as a security sandbox?
06:18:48 <strcat[m]> renlord: well nsjail can be used to make a sandbox for security
06:18:57 <strcat[m]> but the way soong is using it is for what I said
06:19:03 <renlord> oh ok
06:19:08 <strcat[m]> it's not necessarily configuring it in a way that provides a security boundary
06:19:15 <strcat[m]> and the build process doesn't make connections to the internet or anything
06:19:19 <strcat[m]> so what exactly is the security boundary
06:19:31 <strcat[m]> since you're running envsetup, etc. outside the build sandbox anyway
06:50:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "renlord: the purpose of the buil"> So why is it broken?
06:51:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Using arch with the hardened kernel
07:10:14 <strcat[m]> the purpose is just not implementing a security sandbox

17:11:18 <cn3m[m]> choosing which KeePass to build into GrapheneOS would be challenging and controversial. It doesn't make sense
17:18:11 <matic_nick[m]> I do use keepass across platforms but I feel like the whole password management experience could be better.
17:19:56 <matic_nick[m]> While I'm no stranger to managing keys and such, I'm not overly comfortable having my password keyfile visible
17:20:57 <matic_nick[m]> Hence I praise the password management of iPhones.
17:22:51 <matic_nick[m]> I'm not sure how they(Apple) manage all the keys but afaik if iCloud is disabled then passwords are local only
17:26:10 <cn3m[m]> it's e2ee or no?
17:28:10 <matic_nick[m]> I believe so I have to check
17:28:35 <matic_nick[m]> Yes https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303
17:31:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cn3m[m] "choosing which KeePass to build "> Not that this is likely, but, if this were a thing, I'd choose an inbuilt CLI with *pass*
17:31:21 <headgas[m]> What linux distros are you guys using?
17:31:35 <jalb> renor: If I remember well in Android One I could see that permission in the telephone. I can't undestand why the Settings is also a permission in the Camera but not in other apps, and I can't disable it.
17:33:04 <bseeinu[m]> After 2 weeks, the other thing I'm noticing is how much Japanese font rendering is trash on AOSP compared to iOS
17:33:12 <bseeinu[m]> Kanji are just horrible to read
17:35:12 <bseeinu[m]> And apparently rendered with Chinese characters. No wonder then...
17:38:03 * bseeinu[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200516-123731.png (335KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/raNoEBVciggeMaxDBpRRBhOS >
17:38:03 <bseeinu[m]> There are even apps to attempt to fix that
17:38:04 <bseeinu[m]> Wth
17:39:34 <cn3m[m]> <headgas[m] "What linux distros are you guys "> something that's not Linux
17:39:56 <headgas[m]> Well those of you that do use linux haha
17:40:46 <Kurai> arch linux seems to be the most popular around here
17:41:12 <cx2[m]> Fedora....though I'm  trying to get ahead of the game and attempting to learn Silverblue
17:42:48 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "Well those of you that do use li"> He makes a great point
17:43:33 <headgas[m]> Yea I think I'm gunna switch from Pureos to Fedora, I heard arch is a little out of my league as far as experience
17:44:01 <headgas[m]> I was just curious
17:44:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Fedora is the least bad option on Linux imo
17:45:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> headgas: I'd evaluate which has faster package updates for what you rely on: Manjaro (a user-friendly Arch variant), or Fedora
17:45:26 <cyredanthem[m]> Windows 10 LTSC, OpenCore Catalina, and ChromiumOS all are probably better. The security just isn't there
17:45:54 <cyredanthem[m]> Manjaro is behind on Fedora updates wise
17:45:54 <headgas[m]> I want to use linux
17:45:55 <cyredanthem[m]> They are around a week behind
17:46:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cyredanthem[m] "They are around a week behind"> Are they that far behind upstream Arch, as well?
17:46:55 <headgas[m]> I just want it to be secure and private as it can, run as smoothly and quickly as it can, and get all the updates quickly, and look good in the process haha
17:47:18 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Pick ⅔ of those.
17:47:19 <cyredanthem[m]> > I want to use linux
17:47:19 <cyredanthem[m]> If a Google account doesn't freak you out a locked down ChromiumOS would be a decent Linux setup
17:47:24 <jalb> headgas[m], maybe some people here are only looking for security but not for privacy
17:48:06 <jalb> Linux is not secure but at least respect your privacy more than others
17:48:13 <headgas[m]> i'm moving away from google completely
17:48:25 <jalb> headgas[m], I did some time ago
17:48:49 <TheJollyRoger-M> There is no privacy without security. It's a false dichotomy.
17:48:52 <gervarouge[m]> <headgas[m] "I just want it to be secure and "> Yeah what Danny said
17:49:00 <gervarouge[m]> Security Privacy and Usability pick one
17:49:02 <jalb> TheJollyRoger-M, that's true, but the same otherwise
17:49:21 <gervarouge[m]> * Security Privacy and Usability pick two
17:49:35 <jalb> But your system can be very secure and inform about all what you do
17:49:48 <jalb> Promising that all is disabled and it's not true
17:49:50 <gervarouge[m]> <TheJollyRoger-M "There is no privacy without secu"> This 100%
17:50:15 <jalb> SO, it's better to look for privacy and security, both
17:50:19 <headgas[m]> Ok for sure so then i'll focus on security
17:51:09 <headgas[m]> So I'll go with Fedora for now
17:51:18 <headgas[m]> I need to learn a lot
17:52:15 <bseeinu[m]> Is there a way to change the default system font family from Open Sans to Noto? Noto has CJK style that handles Han for Japanese and Chinese correctly
17:53:09 <cyredanthem[m]> macOS is security and privacy, but no usability. Linux, is privacy and usability, but no security. Windows is security and usability, but no privacy in a very broad generalization
17:53:31 <jalb> cyredanthem[m], Apple is privacy?...
17:53:38 <nickcalyx[m]> Macos has no usability?
17:53:50 <headgas[m]> Well I bought a librem 15 so I'm stuck with linux
17:55:58 <bseeinu[m]> This OSs discussion happens once every 24hrs...
17:56:25 <jalb> bseeinu[m], lol
17:56:40 <bseeinu[m]> Just scroll above and you'll see history repeating itself with a strict cadence
17:57:07 <cyredanthem[m]> > cyredanthem, Apple is privacy?...
17:57:07 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes it is MITM baby
17:57:19 <cyredanthem[m]> There's no discernable difference to a Linux desktop
17:57:25 <bseeinu[m]> Fedora manjaro Linux sucks desktops are messy and someone asks about ChromeOS and someone recommends iPads
17:58:04 <cyredanthem[m]> > Macos has no usability?
17:58:04 <cyredanthem[m]> In the way Windows has no privacy and Linux has no security. It was a comparative thing
17:58:15 <bseeinu[m]> "But LTSC is quite good"
17:58:16 <bseeinu[m]> "Secure hardware doesn't exist etc etc"
17:59:16 <TheJollyRoger> Just a heads up guys... I'd really like to congratulate the lot of you on not letting this turn into another one of those Toxic Power User infested "Privacy" communities that keep churning their old tirades; as this room continues to grow and take on new members, I'd really like to keep it that way.
17:59:16 <headgas[m]> Well I sold my ipad pro
17:59:18 <headgas[m]> And my pixelbook
17:59:44 <jalb> cyredanthem[m], so you never read all the news and dicoveries about "privacy" in Apple all these past years....
17:59:46 <gervarouge[m]> The whole security privacy and usability pick 2 is so apt
17:59:50 <Kurai> ltsc has nothing special, you can set the telemtry to security on a regular enterprise/education install
18:00:07 <Kurai> and be more up to date
18:00:11 <TheJollyRoger> Something I'd like everyone to keep in mind is that security and privacy is at every step of the way, a process of harm reduction.
18:00:28 <bseeinu[m]> Lol
18:00:28 <bseeinu[m]> "Quotes"
18:00:32 <cyredanthem[m]> > Just a heads up guys... I'd really like to congratulate the lot of you on not letting this turn into another one of those Toxic Power User infested "Privacy" communities that keep churning their old tirades; as this room continues to grow and take on new members, I'd really like to keep it that way.
18:00:32 <cyredanthem[m]> Seconded it's pretty mature here
18:01:18 <cyredanthem[m]> > cyredanthem, so you never read all the news and dicoveries about "privacy" in Apple all these past years....
18:01:18 <cyredanthem[m]> Nothing is perfect I turn off iCloud. It's good practice to not use cloud services from anyone.
18:01:35 <cyredanthem[m]> > ltsc has nothing special, you can set the telemtry to security on a regular enterprise/education install
18:01:36 <cyredanthem[m]> No edge or store it's pretty cut down
18:02:03 <headgas[m]> Well I appreciate all your guys knowledge
18:02:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. There's nothing worse than those toxic privacy rooms that have no concept of a threat model, and end up driving people to take steps /backward/ rather than forward because they've never actually dug into the code, nor set up interception and continue churning old myths based on reputation and hearsay. It's very harmful and it'd really break my heart to see this place become like that.
18:03:29 <bseeinu[m]> Guys, side question when a dev gets a chance, related to Grapheme: what's the system font? Roboto? Open Sans?
18:03:29 <bseeinu[m]> I'm trying to figure out how can I use one that doesn't cause problems with Japanese and Chinese characters and see if I can fix that with adb
18:03:42 <bseeinu[m]> *graohene
18:03:50 <bseeinu[m]> * *graphene
18:04:55 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, hmm. I'm not sure, fingers crossed we'll find that. Let me see if there's anything under developer settings.
18:05:18 <cyredanthem[m]> TheJollyRoger: I ran into a guy who said that Superfish was no big deal...
18:05:20 <cyredanthem[m]> Other chatrooms are scary
18:05:53 <JTL> DEAR GOD
18:07:29 <TheJollyRoger> Aaaaargh X(
18:08:11 <jalb> :-o
18:08:13 * bseeinu[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YfsrjSEMuUMBQUFyXxLJUxyU >
18:08:32 <bseeinu[m]> Well, for the part that I care about which is Han characters
18:08:49 <bseeinu[m]> I think I'm just going to keep the sucky rendering
18:09:09 <cyredanthem[m]> TheJollyRoger: cn3m ran into a guy that said MITMs were downgrade attacks and you couldn't see contents
18:09:23 <BrokenCog> hellos.  I'm getting a connection error trying to extract the vendor binaries with the command:
18:09:25 <cyredanthem[m]> He said all software should be free software or I guess be deleted

18:10:01 <BrokenCog> have I got the BuidlId wrong or something??
18:11:38 <TheJollyRoger> cyredanthem[m]: *cringe*
18:12:40 <TheJollyRoger> Hey BrokenCog, ah crud, you're way ahead of me here, I'll try and see if I get the same once I catch up X(
18:12:57 <BrokenCog> okay :).
18:13:30 <TheJollyRoger> It uh... it could be a while >_<.
18:13:55 <BrokenCog> I hear you :).
18:14:05 <BrokenCog> PM me your results?  I'll be in and out.
18:14:21 <TheJollyRoger> That video of the wrestler jumping off the top of the cage and (accidentally?) landing flat on his face adequately describes my attempt to wrestle with the computer :(
18:14:35 <TheJollyRoger> I will!
18:16:03 <aeonsolution[m]> BrokenCog: did you find a fix for that error
18:17:15 <aeonsolution[m]> this is dan-v's solution: <https://github.com/RattlesnakeOS/android-prepare-vendor/commit/32e6e21fda3347850f1a1cffc12e0350715c694c>
18:17:36 <TheJollyRoger> \o/ Horay aeonsolution[m] and dan-v to the rescue!
18:18:02 <aeonsolution[m]> run: `find -name download-nexus-image.sh`
18:18:31 <aeonsolution[m]> and make the changes the file, DO NOT edit anything else
18:18:32 <aeonsolution[m]> you'll have a bad time
18:20:01 <dan-v[m]> i heard my name, what did i break
18:20:27 <aeonsolution[m]> nothing, I was giving BrokenCog your solution to the URL not found error
18:21:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > Seconded it's pretty mature here
18:21:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Self-regulation, and a well-defined goal (Harden Android, understand and bolster threat models). Best communities practice these =]
18:22:40 <DannyWorkOrderPr> bseeinu: Doesn't Japan use iPhone more than the US? Or is that a cognitive bias?
18:24:26 <dan-v[m]> also worth mentioning on android-prepare-vendor side, cdesai  has the updated aospalliance fork (https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-prepare-vendor/) with pixel 4 support and with a few tweaks for stock aosp (https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-prepare-vendor/pull/3) was able to get it working for rattlesnakeos.
18:27:10 <dan-v[m]> so in theory, there could be pixel 4 support now for graphene if those changes are pulled in and there was someone willing to maintain it etc
18:28:10 <bseeinu[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "bseeinu: Doesn't Japan use iPhon"> I think that is correct, and I definitely can't blame them if fonts look like this to Japanese people
18:28:58 <cyredanthem[m]> US and UK are both 50% iOS 50% Android right?
18:29:12 <bseeinu[m]> US not really
18:29:25 <bseeinu[m]> More androids but it becomes an income thing
18:29:45 <bseeinu[m]> Over 65 middle to low income are basically 80% android
18:29:57 <bseeinu[m]> Also low income in general are more android
18:30:01 <aeonsolution[m]> Thanks! dan-v  I would be interested in doing that ✋, but I don't have the funds for the phone. strcat put a deadline too so I don't know where that leaves us.
18:30:03 <bseeinu[m]> That's the real world
18:30:30 <aeonsolution[m]> Is there a place to get the Pixel 4 refurbished or cheap on the secondary market?
18:30:37 <bseeinu[m]> Swappa
18:34:12 <headgas[m]> I posted on here that i'd sell mine but then I found out Calyxos is ready for the pixel 4 on monday so I'm gunna try that out
18:35:10 <dan-v[m]> in the past i've bought phones from ebay that have severe screen burn in / cracks / etc if it's purely a phone for testing
18:35:27 <dan-v[m]> generally you can get those for very cheap, but with pixel 4 still being pretty new, probably tough to find that
18:35:42 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, i figured as much :/
18:35:51 <aeonsolution[m]> thanks dan, ill see what i can find
18:36:12 <jalb> Well, maybe pixel 3a is the best phone you can buy now and it's cheaper
18:36:32 <headgas[m]> But gotta get the 4 to get graphene on it haha
18:36:42 <aeonsolution[m]> I have the Pixel 3a already, just wanted to pitch in to help with Pixel 4 support
18:36:51 <jalb> We don't know if pixel 4 will get grapheneos yet
18:37:07 <headgas[m]> I wanna start learning so I can help and not just be like is it ready yet?
18:37:18 <TheJollyRoger> jalb: it'll only happen if someone is going to step up and put in the work for it, and that's what he wants to do.
18:37:42 <jalb> Yes TheJollyRoger , I read what strcat said these last days about it
18:38:06 <jalb> That's what I mean
18:38:08 <cyredanthem[m]> Pixel 4 just doesn't have the developer interest
18:38:59 <jalb> It's a pity...
18:39:10 <jalb> But I understand strcat completely
18:39:10 <aeonsolution[m]> it does, what is happening is not enough people are willing to pitch in to help
18:39:35 <TheJollyRoger> cyredanthem[m]: it's not just the 4. We need help maintaining the devices we currently have. Right now, it's a full time job for our lead developer. Ideally, what would be the best would be if we had one dedicated maintainer for each device.
18:40:11 <TheJollyRoger> As well as get contributions from the community at bringing back many of the past features that were lost during the split.
18:40:48 <jalb> TheJollyRoger, that would be great, maybe talking more and more about GrapheneOS out there could be a solution to get it
18:41:16 <cyredanthem[m]> Making a phone rom is hard since you need to devices
18:41:16 <aeonsolution[m]> For now, I'll throw out there. If there is anyone that wants to start with maintaining a device from a completely no experience position, please reach out to me. I can help you get started.
18:41:33 <cyredanthem[m]> I really have no interest for that reason
18:41:47 <TheJollyRoger> If we could have at least one dedicated maintainer for each device, a large amount of community contributions like developing an application store, our lead developer could have more time doing things like making headway toward the features that he really sees the niche for GrapheneOS for, like improving the memory safety routines and low-level exploit mitigations to deal with the memory
18:41:49 <TheJollyRoger> corruption vulnerabilities Linux is very vulnerable to.
18:41:49 <cyredanthem[m]> I would love too since I worked on custom ROMs before
18:41:51 <headgas[m]> Me
18:42:05 <cyredanthem[m]> However, two devices isn't in the cards for me
18:42:12 <TheJollyRoger> At this moment, the good news is for people who aren't doing device specific work (which there's still a lot of!)
18:42:21 <TheJollyRoger> The good news is that GrapheneOS /can run in an emulator./
18:42:45 <aeonsolution[m]> headgas: What device are you trying to maintain that is actively supported already?
18:42:54 <TheJollyRoger> So this means if you're doing things like say, for instance, working on contributing a first-party appstore with a list of curated apps specifically for GrapheneOS, such as hey,
18:43:00 <headgas[m]> I only own the pixel 4, but I want to learn
18:43:06 <TheJollyRoger> maybe we could replace the old E-mail app with a modern, full-featured mail client!
18:44:14 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe we could locate a full-featured media player that's got good, dependable, reliable upstream sources, and work with them to produce a GrapheneOS media player that also takes advantage of the sandboxing and such on GrapheneOS, and will work with the scoped storage that GrapheneOS may implement, and target the GrapheneOS versions of the Android API!
18:44:23 <jalb> TheJollyRoger, what about FairEmail?
18:44:35 <TheJollyRoger> All that is /entirely/ doable without even purchasing *one* phone!
18:44:56 <nickcalyx[m]> I don't think fairemail supports pgp
18:45:09 <dan-v[m]> nickcalyx: it does
18:45:13 <jalb> I think so if I remember well when I used it
18:45:33 <TheJollyRoger> Again, the pull request could be welcomed, especially if you're willing to maintain the port, or upstream is willing to play ball with us.
18:45:49 <jalb> Anyway I continue with K-9
18:45:55 <dan-v[m]> nickcalyx: it integrates with openkeychain
18:45:58 <cyredanthem[m]> Theoretically I don't need two devices if I run an emulator?
18:46:00 <cyredanthem[m]> I thought that wasn't recommended
18:46:26 <TheJollyRoger> cyredanthem[m]: again, that's if you're doing device-specific work like backporting the kernel patches and out-of-tree code from upstream.
18:46:55 <TheJollyRoger> Or if you're handling drivers, which again, are device-specific.
18:47:01 <nickcalyx[m]> Nice, I am using k9 with open keychain
18:47:35 <gervarouge[m]> I might be able to help with emulator stuff too would love to bring back old features
18:47:41 <dan-v[m]> nickcalyx: the FairEmail developer is insane, never seen a dev so constantly committing code to a project.
18:47:45 <TheJollyRoger> Another thing that could really help us, as well, would be to do something like work on developing an application store. It doesn't have to be fancy, or even offer a slick UI at this moment.
18:47:45 <headgas[m]> Whats open keychain, i use k9 on my pixel
18:47:56 <aeonsolution[m]> <headgas[m] "I only own the pixel 4, but I wa"> I don't know about porting, I want to help people maintain actively supported devices. Porting a device, is outside of my skillset at the moment.
18:48:15 <TheJollyRoger> But what it does need to do is accomplish the goals of an application store, without being relied upon as a trusted third party.
18:48:16 <headgas[m]> Ok
18:48:21 <TheJollyRoger> This means we need upstream to play along with us.
18:48:39 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yes.
18:48:39 <jalb> TheJollyRoger, that's a dream come true :)
18:48:45 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
18:49:04 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yes. Speaking of which, did any of you guys ask me if Yubikey 5NFCs work with GrapheneOS?
18:49:13 <TheJollyRoger> Someone did, but I forget who...
18:49:34 <TheJollyRoger> So I'll confirm right now Yubikey 5NFCs will work with OpenKeyChain for GPG signing and decryption operations.
18:49:54 <TheJollyRoger> Just hold them onto the back of your phone next to the fingerprint sensor and enter the pincode.
18:50:02 <TheJollyRoger> BUT!!!!
18:50:06 <TheJollyRoger> And there's always a but --
18:51:01 <dan-v[m]> yubikey 5c also works nicely with openkeychain
18:51:05 <TheJollyRoger> On the regular Factory Google Android, the backend U2F functionality is actually provided by Play Services on behalf of the apps. Because Google Play is by design absent in GrapheneOS, this functionality theoretically exists,
18:51:28 <TheJollyRoger> but it needs a bit of extra code to be added to the operating system to work with the apps.
18:51:57 <jalb> TheJollyRoger, does it mean adding Google trackers or something like that?
18:52:56 <jalb> Or an alternative?
18:52:57 <TheJollyRoger> jalb, it doesn't. The code for U2F clients is freely available on Github and is permissively licensed. I see one way out of this going forward without needing Google Trackers:
18:53:09 <jalb> Great!
18:53:14 <TheJollyRoger> A) You add that code directly to the Vanadium patchset and patch it in.
18:53:23 <TheJollyRoger> This is probably the most "direct" route.
18:53:33 <TheJollyRoger> However,
18:53:34 <schnenhcs[m]> Hmm ok. The last client RiotX was buggy af. Normal Riot works.
18:53:38 <TheJollyRoger> There's option B:
18:54:32 <TheJollyRoger> Option B: Someone stubs in the play services API for U2F, and writes the missing API to have GrapheneOS' own code provide the missing U2F functionality.
18:54:39 <schnenhcs[m]> I asked about the fingerprint sensor in Pixel 3a XL, does it only output hashed data from the device itself?
18:55:17 <TheJollyRoger> Option B would take more time and effort, but it would be a more permanent and more lasting solution, and it would allow other apps on the phone that aren't Vanadium to use U2F, which would be very nice.
18:56:08 <TheJollyRoger> So Option A could be considered in interim. So if anyone's good with C and Java, check out the code from FIDO Alliance for U2F: the reference code is available.
18:56:34 <TheJollyRoger> schnenhcs[m]: your fingerprint isn't stored on the phone, if I recall correctly, so I'm not actually sure what you mean by "output hashed from the device itself."
18:56:42 <TheJollyRoger> Only the means to check it for correctness.
18:58:25 <TheJollyRoger> dan-v[m]: wow. If there's a really good developer for FairEmail, maybe if we could get a first party app store, I wonder if it might be possible to work with him and work out a system where he could push updates to the app store directly without us needing to become a downstream trusted third party...?
18:59:17 <jalb> TheJollyRoger, it's the same developer from Netguard
18:59:50 <TheJollyRoger> Since I have to admit it would be REALLY nice to have an appstore model where the upstream app developers themselves sign their own packages, with their own certificates, and then `git push` to an app store update server so the updates can be distributed to the phones right away, the way Google does it.
19:00:01 * TheJollyRoger whistles.
19:00:05 <TheJollyRoger> Wow!
19:00:41 <jalb> I uninstalled FairEmail because it was updating the app more than 2 times daily
19:00:46 <cyredanthem[m]> NetGuard is kinda useless
19:00:48 <jalb> He works a lot in the app
19:00:57 <TheJollyRoger> This decentralized method of signing where each app is signed by a different certificate would beat the security vulnerabilities out of a "trusted third party" app store distribution model.
19:01:04 <jalb> cyredanthem[m], wrong, it has many features you can use
19:01:31 <TheJollyRoger> But first, I think we would need that appstore.
19:01:32 <TheJollyRoger> FORTUNATELY!
19:01:43 <TheJollyRoger> An appstore like that actually isn't device-specific!
19:01:49 <jalb> An example: routing all your smartphone through Tor (ORbot) if you want, and only the apps you want to connect to internet
19:01:59 <TheJollyRoger> So that's one of the "big ticket" items.
19:02:06 <schnenhcs[m]> <TheJollyRoger "schnenhcs: your fingerprint isn'"> As far as I have read (found the vendor but not the datasheet) the sensor is not connected via Titan but Trustzone, which is imo way more malleable. Graphene supplies it as far as I know its prebuilt, isn't it?
19:02:37 <cyredanthem[m]> > cyredanthem, wrong, it has many features you can use
19:02:37 <cyredanthem[m]> Firewalls are bypassable
19:02:55 <jalb> cyredanthem[m], but you can use some other features included
19:03:07 <TheJollyRoger> jalb:  on GrapheneOS you might actually notice there's an existing Network Permission alongside the standard Android permissions. This actually complies with the Android security model in that nothing but netd should EVER talk to the networking stack.
19:03:32 <TheJollyRoger> So breaking the Network permission on GrapheneOS would actually require a kernel or SELinux exploit.
19:03:37 <schnenhcs[m]> I have one very specific usecase that nethuard just cant provide.
19:03:37 <schnenhcs[m]> A HP printer App that is only allowed access to the local wifi subnet and not further.
19:03:59 <jalb> TheJollyRoger, I know, but for example in Netguard I see many system apps I can't see in the Network permissions
19:04:13 <jalb> And with Netguard I can also use other features
19:04:30 <schnenhcs[m]> It works really well but I dont want my printjobs at HP or my printer to become unable to bear 3rd party ink.
19:05:31 <jalb> TheJollyRoger, the fact is that it only uses the VPN service of Android and redirect some apps to a sink hole, nothing more. Even Daniel talked in the website some words about this app, I don't remember what
19:05:39 <jalb> If it was good or bad
19:06:25 <TheJollyRoger> sec
19:06:54 <jalb> I use it with no problems
19:07:27 <jalb> Using the VPN service to provide something other than a VPN also means that these apps need to provide an actual VPN implementation or a way to forward to apps providing one, and very few have bothered to implement this. NetGuard is an one example implementing SOCKS5 forwarding, which can be used to forward to apps like Orbot (Tor).
19:07:34 <jalb> That's what he posted
19:07:57 <jalb> And that's what I use with Netguard exactly
19:08:34 <schnenhcs[m]> <TheJollyRoger "This decentralized method of sig"> Would be cool if android had attestation (only to the user) and a ledger for app signatures. For example I travel to another country and install a local bus plan app, then remove it. A year later I come back there and want to installit again...
19:08:36 <jalb> Or only blocking all traffic except Tor browser when I want to browse in a private mode

19:47:02 <bseeinu[m]> The smallest possible pure black wallpaper image at native resolution for Pixel 3, if anyone wants it for their OLED display :) Stripped all metadata possible and at 1080x2160 so no need for resizing by Android :) Only 364 bytes, if anyone wants it :)
19:47:34 <bseeinu[m]> I guess you could shorten the filename to make it smaller if you really wanted to :D
19:47:48 <headgas[m]> How about for the pixel 4xl haha
19:48:26 <bseeinu[m]> Would it be better to use native resolution, like this, or to make a 1x1 black square? Not that it makes any real impact, but I just didn't want it to have to do any stretching or tiling with a 1x1 PNG
19:49:41 <bseeinu[m]> I'll share one for the 4XL once Graphene runs and is maintained on it :D
19:52:40 <cyredanthem[m]> 1x1 vs native resolution doesn't matter
19:52:41 <cyredanthem[m]> At all
19:52:47 <bseeinu[m]> :D
19:53:10 <bseeinu[m]> Then here's a 1x1 black png square. 82 bytes

19:55:35 <bseeinu[m]> I got to 67 bytes if that can generate one more yawn
19:55:53 <bseeinu[m]> It's just me and compression right now :)
19:56:19 <headgas[m]> No that you wont make a black background for the 4 until graphene os is running on it and maintained lol
19:56:31 <bseeinu[m]> Haha
19:56:36 <bseeinu[m]> Use the 1x1 pixel
19:56:43 <bseeinu[m]> That's why I made it.

20:13:52 <organella[m]> With NetGuard do you block wifi&mobile by default and is there a list for Graphene's system apps&services that should have net access for security updates and other essential functions?
20:14:50 <organella[m]> * With NetGuard do you block wifi&mobile by default and is there a list for Graphene's system apps&services that should have net access for security updates and other essential functions if blocking by default?
20:44:30 <jalb> organella[m], yes!
20:45:36 <jalb> You can do it without Netguard too if you use Orbot in VPN mode but it's different to me, more options and easily.
20:48:59 <jalb> You can only se 1 VPN service in Android, and Netguard uses 1 in mine, so I use it with Orbot sometimes to route the apps through Tor (only the apps i want, the rest are blocked to internet), or only Tor browser when I give it access. I block all system apps except DNS Daemon, root (it's not like Linux) and Seemless Update Client
20:49:09 <jalb> *only use
21:25:34 <aeonsolution[m]> renlord: were you able to fix the URL not found issue?
21:29:39 <strcat[m]> jalb: you can see all the system apps in the regular permissions menu
21:34:49 <jalb> straycat[m], I don't know why but in Netguard there are others I can't see in the permission menu. Maybe they are not so important.
21:35:08 <strcat> you can see all apps in the permission menu
21:35:11 <strcat> what you're saying isn't true
21:35:14 <strcat> among other things
21:35:14 <jalb> Sorry, strcat
21:35:28 <jalb> Please clarify me those things
21:35:31 <strcat> there is a toggle to show system apps in the permission menu
21:35:37 <strcat> all apps are listed there
21:35:39 <jalb> Yes, I click in it
21:35:50 <strcat> there is nothing not listed there
21:35:56 <jalb> And I counted the number of apps in both sides
21:36:03 <strcat> forbidding permissions needed by system apps is not really a good idea though
21:36:04 <jalb> It's different
21:36:16 <strcat> so then Netguard ix broken/wrong which is not surprising
21:36:18 <jalb> Is there a problem using Netguard?
21:36:40 <strcat> I already know the way it does various things is wrong
21:36:44 <jalb> Maybe it's not forbidding them, only says so
21:36:46 <jalb> IDN
21:37:32 <jalb> For example I can use only Orbot in VPN mode to route apps through Tor, but in Netguard I get more options and easily and it only uses the Android VPN service
21:37:37 <jalb> Is it a problem?
21:38:38 <strcat> not clear what you mean
21:38:49 <strcat> but you don't need a third party app to see all the apps with the Network permission and toggle it off
21:38:51 <strcat> it's not true
21:38:56 <strcat> same goes for other things you said earlier
21:39:12 <jalb> I know, I can only use the Network permission
21:39:14 <strcat> and disabling permissions for system apps is not a good idea if you don't understand what you're doing
21:39:36 <jalb> strcat, that's interesting
21:39:44 <strcat> how are apps going to download things via DownloadManager if you disabled the Network permission for it?
21:40:06 <jalb> You know, I was using Netguard before in an Android one full of Google services and apps, maybe I don't need it now in GOS
21:40:25 <Kurai> strcat you should move "adkim=s; aspf=s;" at the end of the dmarc entry to have a syntactically correct policy
21:40:27 <strcat> and I don't know what you mean by allowing network access for root since there are 0 processes running as root that access the network
21:41:29 <jalb> Then root is a Netguard thing to use DNS too...
21:41:31 <strcat> Kurai: per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489 that's not the case
21:41:51 <strcat> there is no rule about order
21:42:10 <jalb> So, in GOS, do you recomend to only route through Tor with Orbot in VPN mode?
21:42:30 <jalb> And not using another app?
21:42:37 <jalb> It's useful to me, thanks
21:42:42 <strcat> Kurai: in fact I'm using the order they use in the RFC which is alphebetical
21:42:49 <strcat> but you don't have to use a specific order
21:43:11 <Kurai> uhm ok, I just noticed that mxtoolbox.com and internet.nl complain if they are in you order
21:43:28 <Kurai> but it didn't read the documentation
21:43:31 <Kurai> I*
21:44:36 <strcat> I could put it at the end but I see no requirement to do that
21:44:40 <strcat> seems like a bug in those sites
21:56:41 <strcat[m]> Kurai: seems to be fine now
21:56:47 <strcat[m]> can you look again
22:04:52 <Kurai> strcat yep they are fine now, so there was no need to move them at the end like I did
22:05:58 <strcat[m]> Kurai: p= has to be first, that's all
22:06:04 <strcat[m]> the others can be in any order
22:06:13 <strcat[m]> I don't really know why p= has to be first but that's implied in a sentence
22:09:05 <Kurai> anyway thank you for the email knowledge
22:18:33 <limitless0[m]> Netguard its not perfect but its very useful on blocking ads and trackers from apps
22:19:25 <limitless0[m]> The doh or dot adguards or others i tried dont block all facebooks domains
22:20:35 <limitless0[m]> If you want to block network use the system toggle,if you want to use it as adblocker then netguard it does what it says on the tin
22:24:55 <limitless0[m]> To block all social media trackers with netguard change the hostfile download link to Steven Black including social blocking
22:27:16 <strcat[m]> if an app is on your device and you're allowing it network access then that's everything it needs to export data
22:27:25 <strcat[m]> blocking certain domains doesn't stop it from indirectly talking to those
22:27:43 <strcat[m]> there's this fallacy that blocking client-side connections to a certain place like facebook stops it from talking to that
22:28:07 <strcat[m]> people make the same mistake with the browser
22:28:21 <strcat[m]> if the app can talk to the app developer's server it can talk to facebook, sorry
22:28:25 <limitless0[m]> <strcat[m] "there's this fallacy that blocki"> Oh come on not again!
22:28:47 <strcat[m]> facebook has server-side integration too
22:28:49 <strcat[m]> there is no requirement that the app itself talks to them
22:28:55 <strcat[m]> applies to anything
22:29:00 <limitless0[m]> Pleasr dont say i been wasting my time with netguard
22:29:22 <renor[m]> <strcat[m] "there's this fallacy that blocki"> So what's the most viable option to avoid being tracked?
22:29:34 <strcat[m]> define tracked
22:29:41 <strcat[m]> blocking client-side connections like that accomplishes little
22:29:47 <strcat[m]> what do you think you're accomplishing and why?
22:30:09 <strcat[m]> why would blocking direct connections to facebook from the client stop data from getting to fb?
22:30:10 <limitless0[m]> Tracking like Graph.facebook
22:30:12 <limitless0[m]> Etc etc
22:30:15 <strcat[m]> it clearly doesn't, think about it
22:30:16 <strcat[m]> define tracking
22:30:19 <strcat[m]> not clear what you mean
22:31:06 <renor[m]> By tracked I mean giving information about my usage, content, and other to third parties which I haven not given explicit consent to
22:31:09 <strcat[m]> an app is code, obviously it has access to the data it owns
22:31:25 <strcat[m]> if you give it network access then it can send that data somewhere
22:31:31 <renor[m]> For sure
22:31:36 <strcat[m]> blocking direct connections to certain sites doesn't stop the data from ending up there
22:31:46 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have to go directly from the client... why would it? doesn't make sense
22:31:58 <strcat[m]> if you allow the app to talk to the app dev's server you can assume they send the data to everyone they want to send the data to
22:32:04 <strcat[m]> blocking stuff in the client doesn't change anything
22:32:12 <strcat[m]> why would it? I don't understand where you get that idea
22:32:15 <renor[m]> You're right
22:32:51 <strcat[m]> if you don't want an app sending data somewhere don't give it the data
22:32:55 <strcat[m]> don't give it access
22:33:00 <limitless0[m]> Yes but the dev server maybe doesnt collect what letd day app-measurement collect
22:33:01 <renor[m]> <strcat[m] "why would it? I don't understand"> I'm not saying this, I have never said it
22:33:04 <strcat[m]> there's a permission model and you choose what data you enter into the app
22:33:16 <strcat[m]> don't give the app data you don't trust it to have
22:33:46 <limitless0[m]> But we need apps that connect to internet do its a losing battle?
22:34:05 <strcat[m]> limitless0: you're misinterpreting what I'm saying
22:34:18 <strcat[m]> limitless0: fine-grained filtering of client-side connections does not accomplish what you seem to think
22:34:33 <strcat[m]> if the app wants to send data to facebook it can send the data from their server, it doesn't need to send it from the client
22:34:43 <strcat[m]> why would it need to send it from the client?
22:34:45 <strcat[m]> just think about it
22:34:58 <strcat[m]> applies to browsers too
22:35:10 <strcat[m]> what do you really think you're accomplishing with privacy/security theater approaches
22:35:16 <renor[m]> <strcat[m] "limitless0: fine-grained filteri"> In fact it can make you more unique, am i wrong?
22:35:28 <strcat[m]> well if you are breaking the app
22:35:38 <strcat[m]> you can assume you are going to show up in app error logs for the dev
22:35:57 <limitless0[m]> Do even apps that declare no tracking on exodus can still sell our data ?
22:36:22 <strcat[m]> limitless0: scanning apps for tracking/malware is basically just theater
22:36:26 <strcat[m]> you can identity known 'trackers'
22:36:27 <limitless0[m]> Ok better question:
22:36:50 <strcat[m]> an app not having known 'trackers' doesn't mean it doesn't do things you would consider privacy violating
22:36:51 <strcat[m]> clearly that isn't a working approach
22:36:56 <strcat[m]> it's like AntiVirus - how can that work?
22:37:02 <limitless0[m]> Can an app without trackers Can* do same as app with trackers?
22:37:08 <strcat[m]> you can enumerate all badness, it is not a working approach to privacy or security
22:37:11 <strcat[m]> it's a bankrupt approach
22:37:19 <strcat[m]>  * you can't enumerate all badness, it is not a working approach to privacy or security
22:37:20 <renor[m]> <limitless0[m] "Do even apps that declare no tra"> I think so, you should read the code to make sure... I think that most times trusting words is trusting the common theater
22:37:26 <strcat[m]> limitless0: I don't know what you mean
22:37:35 <strcat[m]> limitless0: what you'
22:37:40 <strcat[m]> what you're saying is nonsensical
22:37:54 <limitless0[m]> Nevermind
22:37:58 <strcat[m]> there is no 'tracking' privilege for apps
22:38:15 <strcat[m]> there is no way to detect whether or not an app does 'tracking'
22:38:27 <strcat[m]> that is fundamentally impossible to do
22:38:35 <strcat[m]> you can only detect KNOWN code that is considered to do 'tracking'
22:38:58 <strcat[m]> I really strongly suggest just thinking about these things
22:39:13 <strcat[m]> I'm sure if you actually think about it you can see why what you are saying doesn't make any sense
22:39:20 <limitless0[m]> In tracking i mean trackers that declare on aurora store for example when you domwload an app you can srr for google trackers facebook etc etc
22:40:05 <strcat[m]> checking if an app includes obvious SDKs, etc. that are considered to do 'tracking' (whatever you're using to check that may not be accurate anyway) can only identity known things
22:40:07 <strcat[m]> do you understand?
22:40:24 <strcat[m]> lets say the app requests access to your contacts for local usage
22:40:33 <strcat[m]> the app developers decides to send it off to their server without telling you
22:40:37 <strcat[m]> they then send it to facebook
22:40:45 <strcat[m]> that's not going to be detected as a 'tracker' by anything
22:40:51 <strcat[m]> because it's code specific to that app
22:41:32 <strcat[m]> absence of common SDKs that are considered to do 'tracking' obviously does not mean the app doesn't do stuff like that
22:41:35 <strcat[m]> really, before saying more, just think about it
22:41:40 <strcat[m]> think before writing
22:41:56 <strcat[m]> it's a waste of time to state obvious things here and go through common sense reasoning
22:42:07 <strcat[m]> people are more than capable of doing that on their own
22:42:45 <strcat[m]> I can't be expected to go through every possible thing like this, people need to think for themselves
22:42:51 <limitless0[m]> I understand and i knew that app devs can do this
22:42:55 <limitless0[m]> But*
22:43:20 <strcat[m]> you can control which permissions an app has and what access to data it has
22:43:27 <strcat[m]> you can control what data you enter into the app and how you use it
22:43:30 <strcat[m]> you're in control of that
22:43:36 <strcat[m]> if you give an app data, you're trusting it with the data
22:43:50 <limitless0[m]> I had the impression that just cos it has internet connection an app cant get all the which app im using when i lock my phone when im playing which app game etc
22:44:08 <limitless0[m]> But now i see more clearly
22:44:25 <strcat[m]> limitless0: ok now you're saying stuff I didn't say
22:44:36 <strcat[m]> apps run in a sandbox
22:44:45 <strcat[m]> apps obviously don't have access to all the information on your device and how you're using it
22:45:08 <strcat[m]> they have access to their own data and the limited things that the system gives them access to
22:45:10 <strcat[m]> and you control most of that via the permission model
22:45:34 <strcat[m]> if you don't give an app access to usage stats (which you have to go far out of the way to do - it can't even directly prompt for it) it doesn't have access to that
22:45:50 <strcat[m]> obviously the app can record data on how you use the app itself
22:45:56 <limitless0[m]> <strcat[m] "apps obviously don't have access"> But they have access to what apps are installed on my phone without requiring permission?
22:46:00 <strcat[m]> it can't record data on how you use other apps
22:46:16 <strcat[m]> limitless0: they have access to which apps are installed in the profile, not on the phone
22:46:21 <strcat[m]> limitless0: they do not have access to usage stats
22:46:30 <strcat[m]> they can't see what's running on the phone
22:46:50 <strcat[m]> or in the profile, at least directly
22:47:02 <limitless0[m]> Ok thank you
22:47:21 <limitless0[m]> So its better than i thought then
22:47:21 <strcat[m]> there are a bunch of existing posts about these things on the subreddit and a fair bit of information in the FAQ and usage guide already
22:48:14 <limitless0[m]> Last question:
22:48:21 <strcat[m]> apps can't obtain usage data / process information / network connection information (net information restricted since Android 10 but GrapheneOS used to do it itself)
22:48:40 <strcat[m]> you can explicitly grant access to usage stats
22:48:42 <strcat[m]> via Settings
22:49:13 <strcat[m]> apps can see which other apps are installed in the profile in various ways - not really any way around that since apps within a profile are designed to be able to communicate with each other
22:49:18 <strcat[m]> like opening a page in the web browser
22:49:19 <limitless0[m]> Can an app export the list of apps to its server if it has internet permission?
22:49:32 <strcat[m]> limitless0: an app can export any data it has access to
22:49:43 <strcat[m]> limitless0: it is not specific to different kinds of data
22:49:54 <strcat[m]> if an app has access to data and network access, it can obviously send it over the network
22:50:02 <strcat[m]> it doesn't need to be asked for each different thing
22:50:11 <limitless0[m]> Thank you
22:50:30 <miniblue[m]> Damn you strcat you answer questions so quickly. It takes me a few minutes to even draft a single response, lol.
22:51:30 <renor[m]>  Has the storage permission been deprecated from Android?
22:51:39 <strcat> yes
22:52:46 <strcat> apps should have migrated to using SAF when it was introduced in Android 4.4, directory support added in Android 5.0
22:52:59 <renor[m]> Interesting
22:53:00 <miniblue[m]> I spent like five minutes trying to explain the concept of trust, open source, attack surface, permissions, etc.
22:53:17 <strcat> it has been required to access external drives since Android 4.4 when the Storage permission was restricted to the profile's home directory
22:53:40 <strcat> in Android 10, Storage is deprecated for accessing the profile's home directory and cannot be done by apps targeting Android 10 unless they opt into the legacy storage model
22:54:11 <strcat> in Android 11 (the version coming out this year), apps targeting the current API level can no longer obtain legacy storage access when installed
22:54:26 <strcat> in the long term it will fully go away even for legacy apps
22:54:36 <strcat> it was supposed to fully go away for Android 10
22:55:08 <strcat> but app developers ran a big negative campaign against the changes and lots of journalists helped them do it, and users got tricked into fighting against their own interests
22:55:23 <renor[m]> <strcat "in Android 11 (the version comin"> Won't this make some legacy apps incompatible?
22:55:25 <renor[m]> Well, maybe its better
22:55:26 <strcat> so Google intervened and stopped the Android developers from doing it for Android 10
22:55:29 <strcat> renor[m]: no, it won't
22:55:34 <strcat> read what I said again
22:55:58 <strcat> it doesn't change anything for legacy apps yet
22:56:19 <strcat> and when it does change for legacy apps it won't break compatibility with them because there is ALREADY emulation of the legacy storage model in Android 10
22:56:36 <strcat> it is just inconvenient and perhaps confusing for users for the emulation to be used
22:56:45 <strcat> which is why this hasn't just been globally enabled in AOSP for all apps
22:57:03 <renor[m]> Sorry, true
22:57:03 <strcat> they want apps to migrate to officially supporting doing things properly
22:57:10 <strcat> and once most apps support doing things properly
22:57:25 <strcat> the switch can be flipped to remove the Storage permissions completely
22:57:31 <strcat> and just use the emulation for legacy apps
22:57:51 <strcat> there is an issue filed in our tracker about enabling this for all apps and relying on the emulation
22:57:54 <strcat> it already exists in Android 10
22:57:57 <strcat> we could be doing that
22:58:02 <strcat> no one has been interested in working on it yet
22:58:04 <renor[m]> Ahh this is great
22:58:34 <strcat> this was a planned feature for GrapheneOS years before it landed in Android 10
22:59:08 <renor[m]> Does the emularion have any efficency impact?
22:59:11 <strcat> but yeah the Storage permissions are deprecated and modern apps (i.e. target current API level without opting into the legacy model) cannot use it
22:59:14 <strcat> renor[m]: no
22:59:41 <renor[m]> * Does the emulation have any efficency impact?
22:59:48 <strcat> renor[m]: the modern storage model removes the permissions and apps can still access files the way they used to as if they have the permissions
23:00:00 <strcat> renor[m]: but it just looks like the top-level profile home directory to them
23:00:06 <strcat> it's  really an app-specific directory inside of it
23:00:25 <strcat> and when the app is uninstalled their directories in the profile's home directory are removed, with the modern model
23:00:41 <strcat> so they cannot persist files after being uninstalled without the user granting the ability to do that to them by giving them access to directories/files
23:00:49 <renor[m]> Awesome
23:01:00 <strcat> renor[m]: this is already all implemented
23:01:15 <strcat> renor[m]: in the Android 10 dev previews, it was enabled for ALL apps, not just those targeting the current API level
23:01:23 <renor[m]> This is really a great change
23:01:30 <strcat> due to the backlash from developers and then the media/users, it was rolled back temporarily
23:01:59 <strcat> so in the Android 10 stable release it is only done for apps targeting the current API level (29) and they also added a temporary opt-out for the time being
23:02:08 <strcat> that's the result of the campaign that was run against the feature
23:02:21 <strcat> renor[m]: in Android 11, this year, it will be forced for all apps targeting API 30 - no more opt-out
23:02:37 <strcat> renor[m]: but that's still not as strong as it was originally going to be in Android 10
23:02:55 <strcat> renor[m]: I think the way it will work upstream is once the vast majority of apps support it, they will finally force it on legacy apps
23:03:24 <strcat> renor[m]: similar to how apps not supportung runtime permissions (API < 23) are not granted those permissions at install anymore but rather there's a screen to review it
23:03:43 <strcat> renor[m]: apps can drag their heels or be abandoned and eventually the new privacy/security changes are forced on them anyway via emulation / workarounds like that
23:03:53 <renor[m]> Most devs are lazy, if they're not forced they won't do it
23:04:08 <strcat> renor[m]: Google Play requires new apps and updates to apps target modern API level
23:04:14 <strcat> and they quickly raise the minimum API level
23:04:26 <strcat> so devs for apps that aren't dead are forced to move to latest API level
23:04:33 <strcat> renor[m]: F-Droid has no such restriction
23:04:56 <strcat> they don't require that new apps or app updates target modern API level like Play
23:04:59 <renor[m]> <strcat "renor: F-Droid has no such restr"> How strange..
23:05:32 <strcat> renor[m]: btw the OS warns when you install an app targeting a very old API level
23:05:41 <renor[m]> Thanks!!!
23:06:08 <renor[m]> This is better than I thought
23:09:21 <strcat> I think the current warning is for API < 23
23:09:31 <limitless0[m]> strcat (@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): Thank you Daniel really!
23:09:55 <strcat> [ro.build.version.min_supported_target_sdk]: [23]
23:09:57 <strcat> yeah
23:10:06 <strcat> renor[m]: so for apps targeting API < 23 it shows a warning
23:10:09 <strcat> that could be raised higher
23:10:30 <strcat> renor[m]: new API bring new privacy/security improvements
23:10:34 <strcat> new API levels*
23:11:00 <strcat> renor[m]: changes that don't horribly break backwards compat are just global, but changes that do break backwards compat are generally limited to a new API level
23:12:33 <renor[m]> That's nice, AOSP devs are awesome
23:13:24 <strcat> renor[m]: so for example
23:13:39 <strcat> Android 6 started using SELinux for MLS, not just MAC
23:14:20 <strcat> they separated each user profile into a different MLS level, to prevent most vulnerabilities allowing communication / sharing data across user profiles which is not allowed
23:14:49 <strcat> renor[m]: Android 9 (API 28) extended this so that apps targeting API 28+ are each placed into their own MLS level
23:14:59 <strcat> renor[m]: so apps no longer just run in the untrusted_app domain
23:15:05 <strcat> they run in a *unique* security domain
23:15:39 <strcat> renor[m]: this means that an app cannot chmod their app data to allow other apps to access it - they're fully isolated at the file system, etc. level whether they want it or not
23:15:55 <strcat> renor[m]: so this prevents a lot of security vulnerabilities in apps that were doing dumb things
23:16:00 <strcat> for API 28+
23:16:24 <strcat> renor[m]: anyways some privacy/security improvements like this are only for newer API levels
23:16:32 <strcat> so ideally you only use apps targeting the most recent 2 API levels
23:16:35 <renor[m]> Beautiful.. I love hearing this nice things that AOSP has
23:16:43 <strcat> it's reasonable for an app to still target API 28, but not lower than that
23:17:11 <renor[m]> Are there many apps targeting older API levels?
23:17:19 <strcat> yes especially on F-Droid
23:17:31 <strcat> on Google Play there's a minimum API level requirement for all new apps and app updates
23:17:41 <strcat> which fairly quickly moves most apps onto the latest API level
23:17:42 <renor[m]> I've never seen the warning you said
23:17:51 <strcat> renor[m]: because the warning is for < 23
23:18:02 <strcat> so apps not supporting Android 6+
23:18:18 <strcat> renor[m]: if I raised the warning to < 28 you would see it a lot
23:18:55 <strcat> ifndef PLATFORM_MIN_SUPPORTED_TARGET_SDK_VERSION
23:18:56 <strcat>   # Used to set minimum supported target sdk version. Apps targeting sdk
23:18:58 <strcat>   # version lower than the set value will result in a warning being shown
23:19:00 <renor[m]> Is there any way to know the api version an app is using?
23:19:00 <strcat>   # when any activity from the app is started.
23:19:02 <strcat>   PLATFORM_MIN_SUPPORTED_TARGET_SDK_VERSION := 23
23:19:04 <strcat> endif
23:19:07 <strcat> yes
23:19:25 <strcat> part of basic app metadata
23:19:27 <strcat> targetSdkVersion
23:20:02 <strcat> renor[m]: apps do have incentives to move to newer target API versions since features that require backwards incompatible changes require it
23:20:39 <strcat> but in general devs can stay on an old target API level forever - aside from Google Play forbidding them shipping any further updates or publishing a new app, unless they update the target API level to the latest
23:20:48 <strcat> but F-Droid doesn't have a rule like that
23:20:50 <strcat> they should
23:21:04 <strcat> although we could just raise the minimum in the OS for the warning
23:21:27 <strcat> renor[m]: it's a fairly arbitrary decision - although since the current API level is 29, the highest minimum we could sanely use is 28
23:21:30 <renor[m]> <strcat "but F-Droid doesn't have a rule "> How bad.. Maybe someone shoud tell them about this 😅
23:21:48 <strcat> 28 is the one that introduces per-app MLS level
23:22:06 <strcat> renor[m]: you can look at the list of backwards incompatible privacy/security improvements
23:22:08 <strcat> per API level
23:22:28 <renor[m]> Then we would be seeing a lot of warnings
23:23:48 <renor[m]> <strcat "renor: you can look at the list "> Yeah i was already taking a look into it
23:24:24 <strcat> renor[m]: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/behavior-changes-10
23:24:35 <strcat> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-28
23:24:45 <strcat> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes
23:26:49 <strcat> renor[m]: for Android 10 they split list of privacy changes into https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes
23:29:07 <strcat> renor[m]: most changes are for all apps
23:29:17 <strcat> some changes are for API 29+ for backwards compat
23:33:23 <strcat> renor[m]: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes#aaad
23:33:30 <strcat> so for example here's an important privacy change tied to API 26+
23:35:50 <strcat> GET_ACCOUNTS (part of Contacts toggle) no longer gives access to accounts other than the ones the app created or was explicitly granted access to
23:35:58 <strcat> but if an app targets API 25 or earlier, that's not the case
23:36:05 <strcat> for backwards compatibilility
23:42:36 <strcat> https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk
23:42:40 <strcat> > When you upload an APK, it needs to meet Google Play’s target API level requirements. Both new apps and app updates must target at least Android 9 (API level 28).
23:43:00 <strcat> renor[m]: I could raise it to API 28, which has the nice MLS security enhancement (secures the app itself better)
23:43:19 <TheJollyRoger> Oh fantastic!
23:43:20 <strcat> so it'd warn for < 28 instead of < 23
23:43:22 <strcat> makes sense to me
23:43:32 <TheJollyRoger> Wow. How soon do you think we could try this...?
23:43:47 <strcat> and we could keep it aligned with Google Play Store which generally means apps much target the most recent or previous API level
23:43:54 <strcat> which gives them over a year to migrate
23:44:01 <strcat> since they can start migrating when the dev previews are available
23:44:22 <strcat> and then after it's released they have a whole year to migrate before the next API level is released
23:48:21 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: well I just changed it
23:48:24 <strcat> it'll be in the next release
23:48:26 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. Just one year off, but being able to get rid of the shared storage leakage and all those other sidechannels sounds like it would be a huge improvement over what we ha--
23:48:28 <strcat> doesn't need testing
23:48:29 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow, awesome!!!
23:48:47 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: well you can already just not grant the Storage perm
23:49:01 <strcat> this doesn't change anything aside from warning when installing API < 28 apps
23:49:27 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. But it'll give us more time and encourage people to stop holding out on old outdated apps, which sounds like a huge gain to me.
23:57:04 <strcat> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_build/commit/0ed05412e4d7045a18db447970e3915a988778f3
23:59:30 <TheJollyRoger> Oh nice
