00:26:29 <izymandias[m]> how does one delete their messages from riot?
00:37:10 <TheJollyRoger> hi izymandias[m], you can "redact" your messages, but this only asks the server to stop displaying them. It is very much dependent on whether your homeserver and your recipients' homeservers will respect your wishes.
00:37:57 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, this Matrix and IRC channel is bridged to multiple servers, each of which are run by their own respective owners that don't answer to each other.
00:38:12 <TheJollyRoger> So consider anything that goes to Matrix to be up there forever.
00:38:47 <TheJollyRoger> In theory, you could log out all your devices and not back up your OLM private key sessions, which would flush the keys from your device and account, but then you'd have to ask everyone else you communicated with to do the same.
00:38:59 <TheJollyRoger> And only for sessions you had previously enabled E2EE on.
00:39:04 <JTL> And this channel is also logged publicly
00:39:07 <TheJollyRoger> And most people don't do this.
00:39:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, that too.
00:39:21 <JTL> So worrying about privacy in this channel is a moot point
00:39:34 <TheJollyRoger> Most people will happily start new webui sessions and end up with hundreds of "dead" devices that are no longer turning over their keys, but still are being encrypted to.
00:39:48 <JTL> Well I wouldn't say "moot", just something to keep in mind
00:39:53 <TheJollyRoger> So, even if Matrix offers end to end encryption, don't count on your messages being private.
00:39:58 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: That's a concern as well
00:40:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:41:13 * TheJollyRoger drowns his sorrows.
00:43:42 <TheJollyRoger> If I don't get to do my "Operation Acapella" talk at 37C3 or 38C3...
00:43:45 <TheJollyRoger> maybe I'll get to do it here.
00:44:02 <JTL> ^^
00:54:53 <qyo3462572445[m]> So on GrapheneOS and android in general I guess, can all apps you allow storage access to access everything in storage, or are they limited to their own sandbox? Or is that what the Scoped Storage is suppose to address?
01:06:26 <izymandias[m]> <TheJollyRoger "hi izymandias, you can "redact" "> hmm well thats not very private.  why Riot then? and not discord?
01:06:58 <JTL> I don't understand the question?
01:07:58 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: I don't quite understand what you're getting at...?
01:08:20 <TheJollyRoger> We bridge to Riot for convenience and network effect. Discord, I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.
01:08:27 <JTL> ^
01:08:44 <JTL> I hope Discord goes away at some point
01:08:57 <JTL> Please fade away into obscurity
01:10:05 <TheJollyRoger> Well, with any luck, what my prediction is that it'll stop growing, something new will come along, and what's going to happen is that Jason Citron will sell Hammer & Chisel to new owners.
01:10:27 <TheJollyRoger> But at that point what he'll be selling isn't a failing chat platform, but rather, all the value-added data that it's now full of.
01:10:37 <izymandias[m]> <TheJollyRoger "We bridge to Riot for convenienc"> I mean there's the potential to reach more people on discord cause a lot more people use it.
01:11:04 <izymandias[m]> where are you bridging from?
01:11:05 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: There is a line we won't cross. That happens to be one of them.
01:11:17 <JTL> > 18:10 <@TheJollyRoger> Well, with any luck, what my prediction is that it'll stop growing, something new will come along, and what's going to happen is that Jason Citron will sell Hammer & Chisel to new owners.
01:11:19 <JTL> > 18:10 <@TheJollyRoger> But at that point what he'll be selling isn't a failing chat platform, but rather, all the value-added data that it's now full of.
01:11:21 <JTL> I think your close to hitting the nail on the head with this one
01:11:22 <TheJollyRoger> Freenode.
01:11:28 * TheJollyRoger grimaces
01:11:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:12:06 <JTL> I'm pretty sure Riot (with the reference matrix.org homeserver) has more users then Freenode at this point
01:12:09 <JTL> and it allows easy webchat
01:12:13 <JTL> so mission acomplished
01:14:11 <izymandias[m]> <TheJollyRoger "izymandias: There is a line we w"> how do we know riot isnt harvesting peoples data like discord?
01:14:59 <TheJollyRoger> We don't, but it's a lot easier to get ahold of the Matrix developers and ask them ourselves.
01:16:13 <TheJollyRoger> As with everything, it's trust.
01:16:21 <JTL> And this is a public room so in the context of this room that's a moot point
01:17:13 <JTL> Best to know on a technical level what data they have access to and make inferences from that
01:22:21 <izymandias[m]> <TheJollyRoger "As with everything, it's trust."> what about signal? cant we look at the code and confirm the claims... removing trust from the equation
01:22:49 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: Indeed, you can. Have you?
01:23:30 <TheJollyRoger> More importantly, did the person you're communicating with?
01:35:41 <izymandias[m]> <TheJollyRoger "More importantly, did the person"> hmm you sir just check mated me
01:36:40 <TheJollyRoger> It's a hard problem, no doubt!
01:36:55 <TheJollyRoger> Not insurmountable, not impossible, but... hard.
02:04:26 <izymandias[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Not insurmountable, not impossib"> so do you trust them?
02:05:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, I trust Signal more than the other instant messengers it replaces.
02:06:45 <izymandias[m]> i mean riot?
02:07:29 <TheJollyRoger> I have certain degrees of how much I trust something. Riot is lower on my personal list than Signal, but it's much higher than Discord.
02:10:40 <TheJollyRoger> Generally, one of the reasons I trust Signal is because it actually makes a very serious attempt at addressing the points in the study "Obstacles to Adoption of Secure Communication Tools" that was carried out by University College London and University of Bonn.
02:10:55 <TheJollyRoger> But also, because it helps to solve that problem of "I don't know what's on the other side."
02:13:42 <TheJollyRoger> This takes a bit of thinking to understand:
02:14:20 <izymandias[m]> imma give that a read
02:15:07 <TheJollyRoger> First up, the builds are reproducible and on Play, they're signed and they're signed by OWS. So Play can't ship a malicious update to devices that have already installed those builds, and if need be I can reproduce the build here locally.
02:15:44 <TheJollyRoger> The bigger reason though is this:
02:15:51 <TheJollyRoger> Most people won't install
02:16:10 <TheJollyRoger> security theatre apps like XprivacyPro or afWall and root their phones for a false sense of security.
02:16:35 <TheJollyRoger> Unless they're a bunch of self-defeating toxic power users. So I have some amount of trust that they aren't doing the equivalent of installing AVG and Norton.
02:16:49 <TheJollyRoger> I highly recommend you do read that paper.
02:17:10 <TheJollyRoger> It highlights that there is a VERY REAL disconnect in what users want, and what we the geeks think they want.
02:17:32 <TheJollyRoger> And Signal is so far the only app that actually feels like an attempt to /address that study./
02:19:06 <WokeBillKristol[> whats wrong with afwall?
02:19:15 <WokeBillKristol[> root?
02:19:17 <TheJollyRoger> WokeBillKristol[: it destroys the entire Android Security model.
02:19:56 <JTL> THere are better ways at implementing an app like AFWall without needing root access
02:19:59 <TheJollyRoger> Android is not built like a desktop operating system. It is built to minimize privilege and access and is actually made from a series of many different and mutually distrusting components which are only trusted to do what they are intended to do and nothing else.
02:20:32 <izymandias[m]> is signals desktop app worth downlaoding?
02:20:33 <TheJollyRoger> So for instance, the networking stack's security model is designed so that only netd has access to it.
02:20:48 <qyo3462572445[m]> Would Riot be your choice in messengers for one you didn't need to sign up with your phone number or would you personally recommend another right now?
02:21:16 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: it's good for convenience, but if you're a very high-threat model user and don't want to trust your computer, I wouldn't use it; plug in a keyboard to your phone instead.
02:21:52 <qyo3462572445[m]> <izymandias[m] "is signals desktop app worth dow"> I personally think it is if you are on desktop a lot. But that's just my opinion. I know nothing behind the desktop security or anything like that, so take it with a grain of salt. Its just convenient to have on desktop.
02:22:37 <TheJollyRoger> WokeBillKristol[: So in other words, when you rooted your phone to install afwall, you've just made it so now all it takes is a single clickjacking attack to essentially persistently compromise the phone. You've had to undo verified boot and now you've placed the entire phone's security on trusting the application layer.
02:22:46 <TheJollyRoger> That's what's wrong with root.
02:22:58 <izymandias[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "I personally think it is if you "> can you message people on mobile?
02:23:33 <qyo3462572445[m]> <izymandias[m] "can you message people on mobile"> Only if they are using signal. Its not an SMS replacement on desktop
02:23:34 <izymandias[m]> <TheJollyRoger "izymandias: it's good for conven"> im not today, but i could be tomorrow
02:24:18 <WokeBillKristol[> <TheJollyRoger "WokeBillKristol: So in other wor"> but it's mostly a problem with rooting right?
02:24:46 <WokeBillKristol[> or is the concept of a firewall for android just futile regardless?
02:24:53 <TheJollyRoger> WokeBillKristol[: The fact that afwall requires root is an example of poor design.
02:25:48 <TheJollyRoger> The proper way to do it would have been to write a privileged extension into the operating system which would then be constrained to only allow it to do what it needs to do via the SELinux Mandatory Access Control policies, and have the app communicate with that privileged extension.
02:26:00 <izymandias[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "Only if they are using signal. I"> how do you register on the desktop? username?
02:26:15 <gervarouge[m]> <WokeBillKristol[ "or is the concept of a firewall "> With IPC it's really both
02:26:31 <qyo3462572445[m]> <izymandias[m] "how do you register on the deskt"> No, it links to your mobile
02:26:53 <TheJollyRoger> WokeBillKristol[: Android already includes a firewall. GrapheneOS exposes some of that functionality to the user via the NETWORK permission.
02:28:01 <izymandias[m]> @qyo3462572445 are they planning on making it username based?
02:28:02 <madaidan[m]> Rooting is a terrible, insecure way of doing things.
02:28:21 <TheJollyRoger> what he said.
02:28:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "Rooting is a terrible, insecure "> Yes
02:29:24 <izymandias[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "No, it links to your mobile "> are they planning on making it username based?
02:29:46 <qyo3462572445[m]> <izymandias[m] "@qyo3462572445 are they planning"> No idea. There's discussion about it but I honestly don't know. Might wanna check out Session...a fork of signal that doesn't require a phone number.
02:32:22 <TheJollyRoger> Signal's been moving toward usernames. There are two main reasons they use a phone number and one of them may surprise you:
02:32:48 <TheJollyRoger> The first one is, obviously, to make contact discovery automatic. The second one is division of responsibility.
02:33:05 <qyo3462572445[m]> I understand the reasons..personally I don't mind it
02:33:16 <qyo3462572445[m]> But I know everyone is different
02:33:41 <izymandias[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The first one is, obviously, to "> Devision of responsibility?
02:33:48 <qyo3462572445[m]> I can say if it was user name only, there's no way I would have been able to get so many of my friends and family on it. They just want simple stupid sign up. And phone numbers are it
02:35:38 <izymandias[m]> but usernames are coming?
02:36:26 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: Yes. It's to place the onus of account registration outside of their own system and onto a system that in most places is regulated by law, unlike E-mail, which can always be subpoena.
02:36:40 <TheJollyRoger> *subpoenaed and has no constitutional protection.
02:38:30 <TheJollyRoger> In short, by shifting that elsewhere, it's one of the ways they can reduce the need to hold onto that toxic account data.
02:38:38 <izymandias[m]> i see.
02:39:44 <izymandias[m]> how long before we see it?
02:40:16 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know yet. At this moment, we'll see how they implement it.
02:42:56 <izymandias[m]> TheJollyRoger: what OS do you run on your desktop?
02:43:55 <BalooRJ> interesting re: signall
02:44:15 <BalooRJ> It's the easiest E2E open source app I can get my family and friends to install and use
02:44:41 <BalooRJ> what are the other options really aside from Conversations/XMPP, which has even less adoption but should have been the real standard for messaging 10 years ago?
02:45:11 <qyo3462572445[m]> I love xmpp personally
02:45:26 <qyo3462572445[m]> So simple yet usable IMO
02:48:21 <BalooRJ> And it's integrated into other programs. Really, it's what we should be using to message each other on every phone
02:48:37 <BalooRJ> but instead there are a million proprietary messaging apps and services, even worse than the early 2000s
02:49:22 <BalooRJ> WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Duo, Allo, SMS, MMS, GroupMe, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram...all a waste when we could have used a standard that's baked into stuff like Thunderbird and easily run from any device
02:49:40 <BalooRJ> too bad next to no one uses it compared to all of those
02:49:56 <qyo3462572445[m]> It would be nice if it was more widely adopted but people want fancy features and fun emojis now
02:50:40 <qyo3462572445[m]> I do like signal. But if I would pick, signal and xmpp would be my two favorites. Signal just has a much higher adoption rate among my contacts
02:54:57 <izymandias[m]> first time hearing about xmpp?
02:55:11 <izymandias[m]> is it as secure as signal?
02:56:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> xmpp = email. It's effectively a plaintext open standard that's as secure as you make it. Lots of plugins for encryption.
03:00:26 <izymandias[m]> so which is the most secure desktop OS i can game on?
03:00:50 <algebro[m]> Windows
03:01:04 <TheJollyRoger> Seconded.
03:04:34 <izymandias[m]> really? not a linux os?
03:05:38 <algebro[m]> If security and gaming are your primary concerns don't even bother with anything but win10
03:06:02 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: the Linux kernel and ecosystem is a security disaster.
03:07:10 <algebro[m]> There are a lot of reasons one might choose to use Linux instead of windows but security isn't one of them
03:08:35 <cyborgninjaneer[> Windows is for gaming. GrapheneOS is for security and privacy. Linux is for development. iOS is for those without access to GrapheneOS.
03:09:39 <cyborgninjaneer[> Linux is a big fat kernel written in an old, bad language. It's not designed to be secure.
03:09:50 <izymandias[m]> yh i saw the syzbot video. but what about all the telemetry data windows collects
03:10:33 <algebro[m]> Has nothing to do with security
03:10:34 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <izymandias[m] "yh i saw the syzbot video. but w"> Security and privacy are two different things. Windows may not be a very private OS but is most definitely a secure OS. Linux is the opposite (depending on the distro).
03:10:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> Couple of registry edits fixes most of that
03:10:38 <bseeinu[m]> If you really want to stick to that
03:11:20 <bseeinu[m]> TheJollyRoger what apps/utilities do you keep on graphene that you consider essential?
03:11:23 <bseeinu[m]> Yeah Windows 10 LTSB is the one to use
03:11:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> Windows security is still "meh," not good but better than GNU/Linux
03:11:49 <qyo3462572445[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "xmpp = email. It's effectively a"> Which is why I like it. I get to decide how to secure it.
03:12:03 <bseeinu[m]> I tried Auditor, pretty cool
03:12:31 <cyborgninjaneer[> Win10 LTSB is nice, but you're lucky together access to it without a monthly subscription fee. Jerk move, Bill.
03:12:39 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: Not quite -- your recipient/addressee determines how to secure it.
03:12:49 <TheJollyRoger> bseeinu[m]: Signal's probably my number one.
03:13:38 <TheJollyRoger> That's probably the one app on GrapheneOS I can't live without.
03:14:05 <qyo3462572445[m]> <TheJollyRoger "qyo3462572445: Not quite -- your"> Well that can be said for anything I guess then. You need to trust who you are talking to.
03:14:09 <bseeinu[m]> Yeah I got almost everyone to use it
03:14:11 <cyborgninjaneer[> Signal is a secure, private drop-in replacement for traditional telephony. Quite a good solution for the average person.
03:15:24 <TheJollyRoger> qyo3462572445[m]: Of course, but in a federated ecosystem, that goes double so because you have to trust the providers in the middle. Sure, you might do everything right, but you might just be the only one that did, and if that happens, you're still going to have to interoperate with the lowest common denominator.
03:16:48 <TheJollyRoger> In some ways, this is one of the reasons why I've never had much luck with XMPP; some people do the right thing and enforce Server to Server TLS. Some people support Server to Server TLS via STARTTLS and fail open. Others support STARTTLS and fail closed. Others enforce no TLS at all and it's no wonder why the XMPP ecosystem is fragmented and has split itself off into small hamlets.
03:17:17 <TheJollyRoger> And now is subject to severe quality of service and interoperability issues.
03:17:58 <TheJollyRoger> And that's a HUGE no-go for users -- I highly recommend reading tht apaper about obstacles to adoption of secure communication tools.
03:20:02 <qyo3462572445[m]> Yea that makes sense. I guess that is one of the major downsides of federated systems
03:27:02 <qyo3462572445[m]> So then MacOS would be a more "secure" system.than a Linux box?

05:20:09 <leohopper[m]> hi there! my question addresses primarily users from germany, or users having experienced at least a similar problem: has anyone of you guys successfully installed Graphene OS on a Pixel 3 coming from Vodafone Germany? I'm worried about the recommendations on prerequisites here: https://grapheneos.org/install
05:20:09 <leohopper[m]> > To make sure that the device can be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and bootloader unlocking
05:20:09 <leohopper[m]> Does anyone know for sure whether Pixel-3-devices coming from Vodafone are unlocked and "ready" to perform the installation of Graphene on those devices? Thank you so much for your help - I'm just trying to avoid running into "obvious" problems...
05:20:31 <renlord> leohopper[m]: does vodafone germany lock the bootloader?
05:21:26 <JTL> renlord: I think that's his question
05:21:52 <JTL> I've haerd rumours of Sprint and T-Mobile Pixels being non-unlockable, but not in the US so I can't comment
05:22:45 <leohopper[m]> <renlord "leohopper: does vodafone germany"> probably that's my question summed up in one sentence - I don't know, but am about to buy a Pixel 3 - however I am not sure if that's a good idea since that very device is one coming from vodafone
05:23:37 <renlord> nuttso[m] might be able to help
05:24:28 <miniblue[m]> Also, semi related. Am in need of a decent calendar, gallery, and RSS reader. Any recommendations? Ideally something non-intrusive with a decent feature set and UI.
05:25:01 <renlord> i use etar, leafpic, feedly
05:25:32 <miniblue[m]> And I assume the best camera is still Open Camera even though the UI is shit.
05:26:00 <miniblue[m]> As far as the Pixel 3 goes

08:12:35 <matic_nick[m]> Hey guys
08:20:23 <matic_nick[m]> This is kind of a stupid request. The goal is to donate to this project. For someone who have no association with crypto like myself how does one donate through it?
08:31:30 <wiringhen[m]> Why not just donate via PayPal? https://grapheneos.org/donate
08:31:49 <wiringhen[m]> Otherwise, you need to buy Bitcoins from an Exchange for Fiat ( "normal" money)
08:35:03 <wiringhen[m]> Good resource on that is https://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started
08:36:16 <wiringhen[m]> Github donations are preferred at the moment, because Github matches the Donation amount, which gives your donation even more positive impact on the project
08:39:10 <matic_nick[m]> <wiringhen[m] "Github donations are preferred a"> I don't generally feel safe being personally associated with it given how volatile the whole concept is.
08:41:03 <matic_nick[m]> <matic_nick[m] "I don't generally feel safe bein"> >whole concept= I meant the privacy community as a whole
08:46:55 <renlord> github donations are prefered because github will match donations, effectively doubling them
08:47:48 <gervarouge[m]> <matic_nick[m] "I don't generally feel safe bein"> I mean if someone cares enough to know you contributed they probably can figure out you use GrapheneOS
08:47:53 <gervarouge[m]> Maybe your ISP
08:48:00 <gervarouge[m]> I'd just donate on GitHub and call it a day
08:49:39 <mischling[m]> <dazinism "... I mean aegis over andOTP"> how about the otp integrated in keepassDX?
08:51:55 <matic_nick[m]> <gervarouge[m] "I mean if someone cares enough t"> Yeah you're right but I just want to remain "just some grapheneos user" and raise not much flags
08:53:50 <gervarouge[m]> Unless you live in China is there much to worry about? Not seeing the risk

09:39:46 <gervarouge[m]> Most apps don't check your app list

09:41:41 <gervarouge[m]> Sprint, TMobile, and Verizon all have reports of being locked in the US. That's all I know of
09:50:29 <yekip[m]>  safest bet is a factory unlocked device, great prices on ebay. really come down over the last few months (to my loss, as i forgot to sell my 3a when prices were better!)
09:51:15 <yekip[m]> does anyone in here have any knowledge of Jami.net? I am looking to replace Wire, is Jami trusted or is it too new to know yet?
09:55:02 <yekip[m]> not sure this was best place to ask that but i know there are a few mega brains in here so thought i would give it a whirl!
09:57:03 <yekip[m]> Still keeping an eye on SafeSwiss.com - had high hopes for that a year ago then it seemed to slow down, but their site seems updated so maybe its seen some progress. Only drawback I think was lack of desktop app which i need, hence the use of Wire.
10:12:38 <cx2[m]> <dazinism "mischling: having both of your t"> I would triple down and say that you might as well not even have 2FA if you're storing both the 2FA secret and your password together.

10:21:15 <wiringhen[m]> The permission to read or write the Id is either denied or always a lot of zeros for legacy apps that would crash otherwise

10:28:15 <cx2[m]> Beause this is sort of a tiertiary method, you could even make a rule for yourself that says, " For every email password that I have, I am going to add 'space, space, email' to the end of the copy and pasted password. For every bank password, 'space, space, bank'. And so on.

It most certainly needs to be easy to remember, and is absolutely not the gatekeeper. The bottom line is, it's something thats not stored with your password proper, and it's in addition to 2FA.
10:39:41 <cx2[m]> EDIT: I went ahead and did this: adding verbatim: "blank_blank_bank" just to the end of a password? +~50bits of entropy.

11:03:18 <cclown[m]> I like that idea mxnorvak
11:03:18 <cclown[m]> I already use yubikey/only key along with strong random passwords and that adds another level that could be very easy to remember
11:10:41 <mischling[m]> cx2: thanks for the response. from what i read copying a pasword is a nono as a lot of apps have access to the clipboard. keepassdx goes around this by using a custom keyboard. there is a auto compete service baked into android but is seems to not work with chromium based browsers. some kind of bug. salting the password (adding a few characters at the end or begining) is a great ideea as well. regrading yubikey,
11:10:41 <mischling[m]> isn't using one  for multiple accounts means using the same secret and thus a problem from an anonymity point of view?
11:14:07 <cclown[m]> I use it a lot with their authenticator app for OTPs
11:14:07 <cclown[m]> Depends on how the service supports it I suppose
11:16:03 <cclown[m]> And also as a requirement for logging into, root access, etc...
11:16:43 <cclown[m]> So make sure you don't leave it at home, lol
11:17:38 <cx2[m]> Great point/question. I can't speak intelligently about apps having access to the clipboard. It's definitely a concern of mine, and I should look into it more diligently for sure. In the interim, I do use keepass's "magikeyboard". It's convenient and hopefully a more secure option.
11:17:38 <cx2[m]> Lets not get carried away by calling it "salting" hahaha.... maybe "salt-lite" or "No-Salt" Salt. In all seriousness, yes in that same vein.
11:17:38 <cx2[m]> One yubikey can contain multiple secrets, and there are a handful of variations of even this implementation. I use them sparingly.

11:21:25 <dazinism> > Do app trackers even work on GrapheneOS?
11:21:51 <dazinism> gervarouge theres all kinds of tracking that could be going on...
11:22:37 <dazinism> Apps can get a fair bit of info about the device they are installed on
11:23:53 <dazinism> They can track your use of the app and send that somewhere.
11:24:09 <dazinism> eg. An email app can see all your emails...
11:24:51 <dazinism> Also its possible for apps to communicate with each other
11:25:12 <cclown[m]> Yubico's
11:26:15 <dazinism> So eg. an app without network access could collect data about you, and send it to another app with network access
11:28:39 <dazinism> The info available to all apps about the device/user profile they are installed on/in can provide a pretty good fingerprint of the device.
11:31:42 <dazinism> Could be better to install less trusted apps in new/blank user profiles
11:33:38 <dazinism> Depends on lots of stuff. What app, what it can do, how worried you are (why are you worried)
11:34:02 <dazinism> What are you going to do with the app
11:57:36 <mxnorvak[m]> <dazinism "So eg. an app without network ac"> Can you explain this a bit more, on how it works and where the limitations are? What data they might be sharing with eachother and in this case if its possible for an app to exploit another one although they are each in their own sandbox and assuming user hasn't given the apps any unnecessary permissions
12:08:31 <magicos[m]> Two apps can agree to share information.  An example could be Microsofts office apps.
12:08:32 <magicos[m]> So if you for example deny network for Word, PowerPoint would still be able to read the data and send it off.
12:29:55 <mxnorvak[m]> So is there a way to know which two apps  do agree on sharing information ? Ofc im not talking about the obvious ones like whatsapp and instagram  or like your example MS ofiice apps

13:42:28 <brenneke[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "So is there a way to know which "> And is it even likely that two different apps from two different developers would be able to feed from one another?

14:07:04 <BalooRJ> I personally don't get why more people aren't using GrapheneOS over those garbage new kickstarter phones that never seem to go anywhere and run no common apps
14:08:50 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Lack of knowledge. I've got my finger on the pulse of everything underground tech, and I'd never heard of GrapheneOS until I started Qwant-ing Pixel "ROMs"
14:08:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It's our responsibility to spread the word, and such =D
14:09:22 <BalooRJ> I mean it's a fantastic OS
14:09:44 <BalooRJ> and less sketch than running some unofficial LineageOS build, which will probably run like crap on the phoe
14:10:26 <BalooRJ> I tried LineageOS once in a LG V20, made the phone feel a hot coal in your hand. GrapheneOS has been so great. Definitely a learning curve to build on my Linux PC but I figured it out after poking around enough
14:18:43 <DannyWorkOrderPr> it's optimized for the device, instead of just throwing AOSP onto any old toaster. A very nice experience indeed.
14:33:33 <mischling[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Lack of knowledge. I've got my f"> could you share some cool underground tech or places where one can get up to date?

18:40:21 <gervarouge[m]> Facebook SDK
18:40:52 <gervarouge[m]> That sends your ad id and usage data to the mothership
18:41:09 <strcat[m]> well there's no such thing as an advertising id
18:41:17 <strcat[m]> there's a per-profile per-app randomized ANDROID_ID
18:42:26 <strcat[m]> not really useful in any way for 'tracking' (or anything else really? because it's only 64-bit)
18:43:04 <gervarouge[m]> strcat: thanks I appreciate it
18:43:08 <strcat[m]> AFAIK ANDROID_ID is used as part of licensing systems
18:43:19 <strcat[m]> so when you buy a license it's tied to the ANDROID_ID which is specific to that profile + that app
18:43:38 <strcat[m]> if they license per install
18:43:54 <strcat[m]> that's about all it's good for because it's only 64-bit, not 128-bit or larger which would be needed to use it for something more
18:44:24 <strcat[m]> and even then, you can't trust what a client says on a server
18:46:37 <gervarouge[m]> Thanks, so it's possible there's a passive benefit to tracker protection, but if someone crafts something for a gapps free Android they'll find a way
18:49:08 <madaidan[m]> What do you mean by "tracker protection"?
18:49:11 <strcat[m]> gervarouge: define what you mean by tracker
18:49:17 <strcat[m]> gervarouge: it's not clear what you're talking about
18:49:25 <strcat[m]> there is nothing like an advertising id
18:49:32 <strcat[m]> it is not a matter of supporting non-Play Android
18:49:33 <gervarouge[m]> Facebook SDK
18:49:47 <strcat[m]> the feature isn't provided by the OS
18:49:49 <gervarouge[m]> The Facebook app trackers
18:49:55 <strcat[m]> define tracker
18:50:01 <strcat[m]> or what tracking you think is happening
18:50:46 <strcat[m]> apps are obviously in control of their own code and data, that's a given
18:50:52 <gervarouge[m]> Facebook SDK can collect various usage data and send it home. It uses the non existent ad ID. It could have benefits
18:51:15 <strcat[m]> and if you give them networking access they can send information about their own data to a server whether it's first party or not - doesn't make any difference since their own server could send the data to others
18:51:20 <strcat[m]> that's a given
18:51:26 <strcat[m]> it's not a 'tracker' it's how things fundamentally work
18:51:28 <strcat[m]> an app is code and has data
18:51:36 <strcat[m]> if it has networking access it can send data to a server
18:51:46 <strcat[m]> that's basic functionality of software
18:51:57 <strcat[m]> apps don't have access to sensitive data by default
18:52:23 <strcat[m]> and they don't have access to identifiers aside from ANDROID_ID which is per-profile per-app
18:53:15 <strcat[m]> and is a randomized id not something tied to hardware
18:53:22 <gervarouge[m]> Right, I'm more worried about app to app usage linking.
18:53:26 <gervarouge[m]> Thanks it seems they would have to use Android ID which wouldn't be that helpful since I have a few profiles
18:53:31 <gervarouge[m]> Thanks for the explanation
18:53:40 <strcat[m]> ANDROID_ID has very little use case
18:54:09 <strcat[m]> the app could just generate their own 128-bit random value and use that as an id representing the app install
18:54:21 <strcat[m]> ANDROID_ID is 64-bit (i.e. not big enough to avoid collisions)
18:54:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > ANDROID_ID which is per-profile per-app
18:54:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Mildly OT: Is this AOSP-inherited, or Graphene specific?
18:54:56 <strcat[m]> nothing to do with GrapheneOS

19:20:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nullnickname[m] "do you think it works?"> These are the devices currently supported: https://grapheneos.org/releases
19:20:09 <gervarouge[m]> No Essential is insecure
19:21:05 <TheJollyRoger> jacksonpollock19: If you think that your phone gets compromised, simply reboot your phone. The phone's verified boot will validate the entire system image all at the same time. If something doesn't match, the verified boot has error correction codes and will restore the phone to a state where it will pass signature validation. If it can't, it'll warn you that the phone's system image is damaged
19:21:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nullnickname[m] "Why?"> Verified boot: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
19:21:07 <TheJollyRoger> and it will stop right there to prevent you from using a phone that's been compromised.
19:21:10 <gervarouge[m]> It has no vendor patches and it has no security chip features. You could probably get verified boot working, but it doesn't have vendor patches which is deal breaking
19:21:13 <gervarouge[m]> Essential is not longer any good for security
19:22:01 <gervarouge[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Verified boot: https://grapheneo"> Theoretically the Essential supports verified boot
19:22:11 <gervarouge[m]> It being unpatchable is the #1 concern
19:22:25 <TheJollyRoger> jacksonpollock19: check your phone's time and date to see if it's too far ahead or too far back. If your phone's clock is too far ahead or too far behind it will think the certificate is expired or isn't valid yet.
19:23:37 <gervarouge[m]> Essentials aren't safe anymore sadly
19:23:48 <gervarouge[m]> Good phone though
19:24:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Sounds like it was good hardware, but is now a bad phone, lol
19:24:50 <TheJollyRoger> Ecosystem's moving.
19:25:07 <gervarouge[m]> It is essentially a phone that's still from the future
19:25:25 * mxnorvak[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/FEFMGTylbblKoUZNTfZxKMan >
19:25:31 <TheJollyRoger> What's a cutting edge device today will be a pop tart tomorrow.
19:25:31 <jacksonpollock19> <TheJollyRoger "jacksonpollock1993: check your p"> Thanks a lot, sorry if I'm being annoying lockdown to much time on my hands.
19:25:46 <gervarouge[m]> It had a 27w charger before anything else was close. It was the first major phone at $700. It was the first notch. It is still the best screen to body ratio under 6". The essential is still a beast
19:26:02 <gervarouge[m]> It is a future phone we are just starting to catch up too
19:26:13 <gervarouge[m]> It had an unlockable bootloader and probably had verified boot
19:26:15 <mxnorvak[m]> Or TheJollyRoger ,would you mind?
19:26:33 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: pop tart :D
19:26:35 <nunbit[m]> nullnickname: I would like graphene on mia3 which I was told is doable but there is just nobody to do it. So u will need to pay 400$ directly to google to buy pixel if u want graphen.
19:26:36 <JTL> (also hi)
19:26:40 <gervarouge[m]> It was almost perfect beside a buggy launch
19:26:41 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
19:26:47 <JTL> Nom nom
19:26:48 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: yes?
19:26:58 <gervarouge[m]> <nunbit[m] "nullnickname: I would like graph"> More like $300
19:27:01 <gervarouge[m]> You can find a deal
19:27:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nunbit[m] "nullnickname: I would like graph"> This is ignorant. Pixels are available used for under $300. No money directly to Google.
19:27:36 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: yes?"> –an app without network access could collect data about you, and send it to another app with network access
19:28:04 <gervarouge[m]> Yeah firewalls don't work on Android
19:28:09 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: If both apps are within the same profile, and have mutually opted in to each other.
19:28:58 <TheJollyRoger> gervarouge[m]: this is incorrect. Android only allows netd access to the network stack, and GrapheneOS exposes the network permission to the user.
19:29:51 <gervarouge[m]> <TheJollyRoger "gervarouge: this is incorrect. A"> I thought that wasn't fully guaranteed to not have a data leak
19:30:40 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: If both apps are withi"> So there's no way for the user to know if two apps agree on doing that or not?
19:31:26 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: If you don't trust those apps to conspire, please install them into different profiles. There is no communication across separate profiles.
19:31:37 <TheJollyRoger> gervarouge[m]: again, see above.
19:31:48 <gervarouge[m]> <nullnickname[m] "l then I'll continue reading som"> Pretty much your phone doesn't matter what OS it's running it's insecure. Stock rom with no gapps is your best bet
19:31:50 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't trust those apps to conspire, install them into different profiles.
19:33:02 <TheJollyRoger> In order for an app to reach into another profile, first remember that the profile data is encrypted with different keys.
19:33:13 <TheJollyRoger> And those keys are kicked out of memory when that profile is not in use.
19:33:24 <nunbit[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "This is ignorant. Pixels are ava"> So u are saying that for that used pixel u buy second hand google didtn receive their money? How do u think that phone got out of store at some point?
19:33:25 <TheJollyRoger> Secondly, to do so would require breaking the Linux kernel.
19:33:49 <izymandias[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Please read the GrapheneOS docum"> can wifi be used to triangulate your location?
19:35:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nunbit[m] "So u are saying that for that us"> I'm saying the money's already been given to Google. Whether someone throws that phone in the trash to get the new hotness, or sells it to me for $220, doesn't make a difference to Google.
19:35:19 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Looks like Matrix may not be as responsive to bans. One moment.
19:35:46 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But I'm mostly saying it's not $400, lol
19:36:15 <TheJollyRoger> Removing him for a ban evasion.
19:36:31 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Secondly, to do so would require"> Yeah well my question was more on if there is any indicator to know which apps will share data with each other in the same profile, just wanted to know more about how the system of sharing data between apps (in the same profile) and if there is anything users can do to stop that ,ofc beside using profiles
19:36:43 <DannyWorkOrderPr> TheJollyRoger: I see. Original ban reason?
19:37:01 <rgeturk[m]> you should ban on matrix instead of IRC
19:37:01 <rgeturk[m]> on matrix, it says that the user just got kicked and not banned
19:37:43 <rgeturk[m]> the user is not listed under "Banned users" in room settings -> roles and permissions
19:37:50 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Why did he get banned?
19:37:53 <rgeturk[m]> so it's not registering as a matrix ban
19:37:54 <JTL> (I actually forgot)
19:38:11 <JTL> Although it's probably better I don't clog my brain with such trivial nonsense :)
19:38:58 <TheJollyRoger> The original ban reason was because he kept posting in an inflammatory way, accusing people of being "microsoft shills" and "closed source shills" even after ignoring repeated technical arguments about why we use the handsets we support for a reason.
19:39:13 <JTL> Argh
19:39:29 <JTL> >implying we're against open source in principle
19:39:32 <JTL> sigh
19:39:45 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I'm unfortunately not a moderator on the Matrix side, so I don't think I'm able to do that.
19:39:59 <JTL> I thought it synced with IRC channel permissions, odd
19:40:14 <TheJollyRoger> Let's try that.
19:40:39 <gervarouge[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah. I'm unfortunately not a mo"> Nunbit is a shill for Microsoft
19:40:54 <rgeturk[m]> yeah the bridge is just doing auto-kicking when they join the room instead of banning
19:40:56 <TheJollyRoger> There we go.
19:41:31 <gervarouge[m]> I would recommend stock rom with gapps disabled nullnickname
19:41:34 <gervarouge[m]> That's probably the least insecure

21:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> Never did that again!
21:27:49 <izymandias[m]> TheJollyRoger: is it feasible to do away with cellular radio all together and just use wifi to communicate with everyone?
21:28:21 <cx2[m]> It is..... it's called an iPod
21:28:39 <cx2[m]> I actually use this method when at home :-)
21:33:11 <bablux[m]> Hi ! Somebody succeed to get working location with microG and unified plugin like mozilla or dejavu?
21:33:47 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: yes! Tap the Airplane mode tile, and switch WiFi on.
21:34:48 <TheJollyRoger> You won't be able to use the publicly switched telephone network, but you can substitute that very approximately with an encrypted voice/text application like Signal.
21:52:25 <mxnorvak[m]> A very simple and noobish question not related to graphene
21:54:21 <mxnorvak[m]> When you get a usb flash drive from someone, to either get a file from em or just to erase/format it and use it, what's the safest way to check it actually?
21:55:25 <izymandias[m]> TheJollyRoger: I meant for everyone. Is wifi as reliable as cellular radio. Is our future without sim cards?
22:01:20 <M0xC0ncord[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Have a dedicated machine that exists solely for plugging unknown devices into that then gets wiped and re-verified after every test?
22:01:27 <M0xC0ncord[m]>  * ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Have a dedicated machine that exists solely for plugging unknown devices into that then gets wiped and re-verified after every test? mxnorvak
22:06:16 <mxnorvak[m]> What if i only have a pc running windows 10 :/?
22:07:23 <M0xC0ncord[m]> I mean my answer is assuming maximum paranoia, i.e. the possibility of malware existing in the flashdrive's firmware.
22:09:45 <mxnorvak[m]> Yeah i got that,any way a normal windows user could be on the safe side while checking the flashdrive?
22:10:41 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "Yeah i got that,any way a normal"> If we're just assuming that there could be malware on the drive, but it's just in the form of files stored on it, you're fine as long as you don't have autorun enabled.
22:10:49 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: Cellphones don't seem to be going away anytime soon, especially in countries where cellphone service is reliable, ubiquitous, and deeply entrenched.
22:12:54 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, I've heard rumours that in some cities in Korea, where cellphone service is so reliable, restaraunts and sit-down diners don't even provide Free WiFi anymore because people do not use it, and simply use their cellphones instead.
22:14:32 <JTL> > In fact, I've heard rumours that in some cities in Korea, where cellphone service is so reliable, restaraunts and sit-down diners don't even provide Free WiFi anymore because people do not use it, and simply use their cellphones instead.
22:14:37 <JTL> I've heard similar happens in Japan
22:15:00 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. That makes sense too.
22:15:37 <mxnorvak[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "If we're just assuming that ther"> there's just so many small scenarios and small things that i wanna ask that im just not gonna bother asking casue it'd just be me constantly chatting here,thank you for your time and your answers
22:16:57 <mxnorvak[m]> Cause*
22:18:20 <TheJollyRoger> From a regular user's perspective, it it saves common-average-joe so much time in having to disconnect and reconnect when say, he leaves his home and walks down the street to the train, then leaves the train to go to work, then leaves work to go to a takeout store, and back, and all that connectivity loss inbetween.
22:19:23 <TheJollyRoger> If we assume that the train is more than 20m from his home and work, and his work is more than 20m from the diner, it's quite a reasonable assumption.
22:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> And 20m is really generous for ordinary WiFi.
22:33:15 <izymandias[m]> TheJollyRoger: WAIT! when i said wifi i really meant 4g
22:34:16 <izymandias[m]> TheJollyRoger: is 4g and cellular radio the same thing?
23:31:53 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: it's my understanding (don't quote me on this) that 4G is a set standards for cellphone service providers.
23:32:17 <TheJollyRoger> *is a set of standards for cellphone service providers.
23:32:44 <TheJollyRoger> It's a goal for cellphone service providers to achieve.
