00:10:15 <aeonsolution[m]> <cdesai "aeonsolution: for R for android-"> thanks, let me see what i can manage, getting started now
00:11:08 <mak1991[m]> hello
00:15:26 <cdesai> aeonsolution[m]: sure, let us know on #AOSPAlliance, or even a github issue there is fine.
00:32:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hi strcat[m], the CTS seems to have been stuck for the past ~12 hours, after running for about 100 hours or so on the vendor OS for flame. Should I just scrub this one, update flame, and start getting the results for that?
00:32:30 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: that's why you should run it in chunks
00:32:37 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: try rebooting and see if it starts up again
00:32:41 <strcat[m]> will make current test fail
00:32:57 <strcat[m]> can you link the latest logs
00:33:07 <strcat[m]> results page I mean
00:33:51 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. Will reboot it, reset, and rerun.
00:34:19 <TheJollyRoger> The last ones I took were for GrapheneOS Flame as of last month. I haven't compiled the results page yet, I'll go and do that now. Expect new results soon.
00:46:24 <TheJollyRoger> There we go, rebooted 'er and let's see if this continues.
00:49:41 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: can you link me it I lost the link
00:50:29 <TheJollyRoger> Sec.
00:50:31 <Icy-Sprite^[m]> Greetings people
00:50:35 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
00:51:54 <TheJollyRoger> Sent. I'm going to post the plain .txt file in a few minutes.
00:52:01 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like your trick worked, it's continuing!
01:01:44 <TheJollyRoger> Some of these are too lengthy to put into one text file - especially stuff like the Camera Test cases module has over a hundred entries. Any ideas what I should do for those?
01:02:14 <TheJollyRoger> Same with some of the CTS Bionic Test Cases, the page is monstrously long.
01:09:42 <TheJollyRoger> Actually, nevermind, I got it.
01:26:15 <TheJollyRoger> Continuing.
01:44:45 <dolores0[m]> @aeonsolution:matrix.org: ah I accidentally rejected ur invite!
01:45:39 <aeonsolution[m]> dolores0: no worries, was just going to ask if you got an answer on how to help from the channel; i had tagged you earlier but didnt follow up
01:48:02 <go_fish[m]> Other than price is there any reason not to get a Pixel 4 over 3 for Graphene
01:53:42 <go_fish[m]> * Other than price is there any reason not to get a Pixel 4 over 3 for Graphene?
01:59:44 <strcat[m]> get a 4 if price doesn't matter
01:59:48 <rover1[m]> go_fish: 4 has smaller battery
02:03:02 <greenmoon[m]> Its like 3% smaller..
02:20:24 <dolores0[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "dolores0: no worries, was just g"> mmmm while I did get some headway it's not exactly what I was looking for. in lieu of a structured way forward I'm just diving in with python
02:22:54 <aeonsolution[m]> doing that is good, if you want to help the project without coding at this moment you can help by running your GOS phone on Beta and reporting bugs as you experience them
02:23:31 <aeonsolution[m]> if you want to help with code, checking out https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues is a good place to see what you can contribute too
02:25:43 <dolores0[m]> I'm trying to run GOS, ideally I'll be running it starting tomorrow, otherwise around the following week
02:25:50 <dolores0[m]> I want to help both ways
02:26:23 <dolores0[m]> the thing with the issue tracker is understanding what exactly I'll need to study before I can tackle it
02:27:03 <dolores0[m]> and gauging the difficulty level for different issues which I'm completely incapable of
02:27:43 <dolores0[m]> maybe this? https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/224
02:28:22 <aeonsolution[m]> a bigger priority is helping the migration from Android 10 to Android 11
02:29:00 <aeonsolution[m]> the best way to help with that is the beta channel, to help with code you need to be able to build the development branch
02:29:03 <aeonsolution[m]> thats step 0
02:29:44 <dolores0[m]> step 0 is being able to build the development branch?
02:29:55 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
02:30:02 <dolores0[m]> that sounds quite intimidating
02:30:05 <dolores0[m]> what does it mean?
02:31:46 <aeonsolution[m]> building the operating system GrapheneOS is the prerequisite to help contribute code to the operating system
02:32:04 <dolores0[m]> as in, run it on my phone?
02:32:38 <aeonsolution[m]> building it on your host machine and then yes flashing it on your mobile device
02:32:51 <dolores0[m]> gotcha
02:32:58 <dolores0[m]> yes I'm taking steps towards being able to do that
02:33:17 <dolores0[m]> the problem is once I'm capable of contributing, I have nothing to contribute without the skills
02:33:23 <dolores0[m]> the skills are the actual bottleneck
02:35:02 <aeonsolution[m]> helping the devs by reporting bugs is the best way to help the devs focus on bugs affecting the os
02:35:15 <aeonsolution[m]> at least during the critical portion of the migration
02:35:31 <dolores0[m]> yep and I'll be doing that because it's easiest to do so
02:35:45 <dolores0[m]> personally I would like to work towards my goal of contributing with code as well
02:38:05 <TheJollyRoger> Horay!
02:39:19 <dolores0[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#programming-languages
02:39:23 <dolores0[m]> this looks helpful
03:50:30 <animalchin[m]> Hello people.

03:52:29 <animalchin[m]> Does anyone know what this app is? I've read up on all the other apps even the fonts but this one I can't find anything on.

04:17:23 <alicebobandeve[m> I think smart lock, not sure
04:24:27 <larncat[m]> Like new Pixel 3 - black 64GB on Amazon from Abe's Electronics confirmed legit Google ed. unlocked. $269 prime, still in stock. Came in mint conditon with box, all accessories and warranty till January. Confirmed by a reviewer on Amazon as well.
04:24:46 <larncat[m]> üòÅ
04:26:12 <larncat[m]> Looking forward to running GrapheneOS  soon!
04:28:21 <animalchin[m]> alicebobandeve:  mostly just find posts about turning your old cell into a security cam. I know it isn't that. Smart Lock sounds right after reading other peoples posts about it not working as they got close to their house. Still not positive though. Thank you for the reply
04:30:18 <alicebobandeve[m> animalchin: no worries
04:30:53 <alicebobandeve[m> larncat: congratulations!
04:32:36 <larncat[m]> alicebobandeve Thanks! Happy to find a legit device. Had to wade thru some duds.
04:34:16 <larncat[m]> Pixel 4 support came as I searched. Lack of fingerprint reader is a deal breaker tho.. and the price.
04:36:07 <larncat[m]> animalchin 'Presence' seems like a VoIP / chat feature to see your availability to communicate.
04:36:54 <alicebobandeve[m> larncat: I'm using a Pixel 3 as well and it's a great device.
04:39:04 <larncat[m]> alicebobandeve right on, it does seem in the sweet spot! I'm coming from a phablet and looking forward to something easier to hold.
04:41:55 <larncat[m]> I've been frustrated with a lack of IMS + WiFi calling support in LineageOS, let alone the privacy aspects of the OS. I've been looking at this project for years.
04:48:18 <animalchin[m]> larncat: After reading more that looks likely as well. Cisco shows Presence used in conjunction with Jabber
04:48:43 <animalchin[m]> Good job on the P3
04:49:31 <alicebobandeve[m> larncat: Nice, makes sense. GOS is light years ahead of LOS. I hate phablets, I like the Pixel device form factor.
04:49:46 <alicebobandeve[m> Although, eSIM doesn't work just in case you weren't aware. larncat
04:52:10 <larncat[m]> <animalchin[m] "larncat: After reading more that"> Nice. Thanks!
04:56:17 <larncat[m]> alicebobandeve this was my first. I came from a 5x before. The Nexus S was one of ny all time favs. P3 reminds me of it. I wasn't aware eSIM was unsupporte ; fortunately do not need.
05:01:20 <animalchin[m]> Nothing more beautiful than owning a Pixel and not having to have a google account associated with it. I hate getting locked out of those damn accounts and filling out that damn recovery form. Ha

05:06:04 <animalchin[m]> $ 200 ^
05:06:41 <animalchin[m]> Dang.  Wish it was payday
05:08:59 <animalchin[m]> At least 3 under 225 from Amazon Warehouse
05:51:05 <larncat[m]> Unfortunately many are the VZ editions. With Amazon you have to roll the dice.
06:40:46 <q22[m]> The 128gb version seems pretty rare. Took me a couple of weeks to get one with a broken back for a reasonable price
07:01:59 <renlord> trying to run fastboot flashall but keeps erroring out
07:02:00 <renlord> Device version-bootloader is 'b4s4-0.2-6066691'.
07:02:02 <renlord> Update requires 'b4s4-0.2-6355063'.
07:02:07 <renlord> with the latest release
07:02:11 <renlord> strcat[m]:
07:04:02 <strcat[m]> Dunno
07:04:17 <renlord> how to just reflash the whole thing
07:04:19 <renlord> zzz
07:04:19 <strcat[m]> Which device
07:04:24 <renlord> sargo
07:04:34 <renlord> i think i accidently flashed boot when it was not in fastbootd
07:04:42 <strcat[m]> You need to flash bootloader first
07:04:44 <strcat[m]> And radio
07:04:49 <strcat[m]> Factory images does that
07:05:00 <renlord> doesnt flashall do that implicitly?
07:05:06 <strcat[m]> Flashall only flashes the OS partitions
07:05:14 <renlord> oh ok, no wonder
07:05:17 <strcat[m]> It's not the same as factory images flash-all.sh
07:06:01 <renlord> so now i cant `fastboot reboot fastboot` to get back into fastboot
07:06:30 <renlord> just stuck at fastboot mode with 'error booting boot.img'
07:16:53 <renlord> ok i think fixed now
07:20:45 <strcat[m]> renlord: you ported forward the secondary stack ASLR feature right?
07:20:53 <strcat[m]> renlord: it appears to be causing pthread#pthread_attr_setstacksize in CtsBionicTestCases to fail
07:21:08 <strcat[m]> there are also other concerning test failures elsewhere from other unrelated things
07:21:47 <renlord> yes
07:22:24 <renlord> ok i'll look into it
07:22:32 <renlord> can you file an issue
07:23:08 <renlord> its been in for long time
07:24:17 <strcat[m]> yes but we aren't properly testing
07:24:51 <renlord> so we want to pass all cts testcases comprehensively?
07:25:51 <strcat[m]> we need to pass all tests, yes
07:25:59 <strcat[m]> unless we decide to deviate from what's tested on purpose
07:26:04 <strcat[m]> otherwise that's a serious bug to address
07:26:22 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/xdNfttthqZiaTmlBkPrGwpAP >
07:26:33 <strcat[m]> these need to be fixed or it needs to be determined that it's intentional
07:26:39 <strcat[m]> realloc_0 is an intentional failure
07:27:27 <renlord> do they pass without secondary stack ASLR?
07:28:23 <strcat[m]> don't know
07:28:36 <renlord> ok i'll check
07:28:38 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/240
07:28:51 <strcat[m]> it's probably doing something slightly wrong
07:28:58 <strcat[m]> changing what's visible via the API
07:29:09 <strcat[m]> it might be breaking that feature
07:29:13 <strcat[m]> needs to be addressed
07:30:59 <renlord> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/239
07:31:03 <renlord> is this a broken screen?
07:31:04 <renlord> lol
07:31:20 <renlord> or can other people confirm it is indeed "green-ish"?
07:34:34 <strcat[m]> it might be broken Pixel 4 resource configuration
07:34:47 <strcat[m]> missing resource overrides
07:35:01 <strcat[m]> paintedman: anupritaisno1 ^
07:35:04 <strcat[m]> need to go through the resources in stock frameworks-res and Settings
07:35:07 <strcat[m]> and make sure to get what's missing
07:35:10 <strcat[m]> figure out everything missing and then submit it bit by bit
07:51:12 <TheJollyRoger> Argh. Sorry guys. I missed the "Intentional" flags, I'll add those in tomorrow once I wake up >_<.
07:57:07 <paintedman[m]> strcat: it might be related to this problem https://www.xda-developers.com/custom-kernel-fix-green-tinting-issues-google-pixel-4-xl-units/
08:00:01 <crueltekk[m]> > strcat: it might be related to this problem https://www.xda-developers.com/custom-kernel-fix-green-tinting-issues-google-pixel-4-xl-units/
08:00:01 <crueltekk[m]> Added the link to the issue on Github. Was the only thing I found that sounds like where is a chance to fix this.
08:05:17 <renlord> does anyone know what the the search bar that sits in launcher is called?
08:05:24 <renlord> so i grep it in the source code
08:08:49 <strcat[m]> which one
08:09:01 <strcat[m]> there's QuickSearchBox but we have the widget disabled
08:09:05 <strcat[m]> there's also the Chromium one
08:09:28 <strcat[m]> Launcher app supports arbitrary integrated search widgets as long as it implements a proper widget / intents
08:09:34 <strcat[m]> but we have that disabled
08:09:51 <strcat[m]> so there's no hard-wired search widget
08:09:53 <strcat[m]> although you can add one
08:11:48 <greenmoon[m]> I may be offtopic but I recommend Just search from fdroid to replace the assistant gesture (in default apps config) to bring a web search bar with gesture from bottom corners.
08:12:54 <greenmoon[m]> Well that's if you use gestures, not sure how it work with 3 buttons mode maybe it's long press on home.
08:46:25 <crueltekk[m]> > I may be offtopic but I recommend Just search from fdroid to replace the assistant gesture (in default apps config) to bring a web search bar with gesture from bottom corners.
08:46:25 <crueltekk[m]> Only gesture app in the official repo I can find is last updated 3 years.
08:46:40 <crueltekk[m]> * > I may be offtopic but I recommend Just search from fdroid to replace the assistant gesture (in default apps config) to bring a web search bar with gesture from bottom corners.
08:46:40 <crueltekk[m]> Only gesture app in the official repo I can find is last updated 3 years ago.
09:05:58 <pikey[m]> am i right in thinking apps from aurora store are de-googled (code wise)?
09:08:33 <alicebobandeve[m> <pikey[m] "am i right in thinking apps from"> No, aurora is a mirror of the play store.
09:08:39 <alicebobandeve[m> You just download apps anonymously from Aurora. That's the main use case of the app.
09:09:18 <pikey[m]> oooh. haha thanks. will avoid then
09:15:04 <greenmoon[m]> crueltekk: yea its old but still work well, I haven't found better replacement
09:20:10 <crueltekk[m]> greenmoon  Don't want to use outdated apps.
09:20:30 <greenmoon[m]> Its uptodate but ok
09:21:43 <greenmoon[m]> You can just compile it with latest SDK there is only one or two lib to update
09:28:48 <crueltekk[m]> Okay I have to wait then until I can run an installed Linux again. Don't want to mess up with windows compiling.
10:29:13 <randolf[m]> Just finished flashing pixel4 to graphene, but I can't find the option for "always on display" am I missing something?
10:29:40 <randolf[m]> on the pixel 3 it's under display> lock screen > "when to show" always on
10:29:40 <randolf[m]> but on the pixel 4 I can't find it anywhere
10:39:45 <dazinism> randolf: you tried to search settings?
10:40:36 <dazinism> Maybe its not implemented in Pixel4 AOSP
10:53:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord "or can other people confirm it i"> Yes it is and Google just messed up
10:53:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is no user who doesn't have the issue
10:53:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's just that some are more sensitive and notice it faster
11:01:46 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thestinger/11e00e6c7549fb8029cadf08535b5cf7/raw/4187bc2f636f884093cfc3c7abc58822738eba48/bionic_tests.txt
11:01:55 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: looked into the bionic test failures
11:01:58 <strcat[m]> renlord: ^
11:03:05 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: renlord: so most of those are intentional but pthread#pthread_attr_setstacksize is not and is probably failing because the test is checking the size and the randomization feature is visible
11:03:22 <strcat[m]> can perhaps be avoided to retain full compatibility with the API
11:03:33 <strcat[m]> I think it should be avoided
11:03:43 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: dlext#ns_anonymous is something for you to test
11:04:09 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: do -m CtsBionicTestCases -t dlext#ns_anonymous or whatever and figure out why that fails - I think there might be an SELinux denial in the logs (a userdebug build would be useful but not mandatory)
11:04:26 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: see if there's an SELinux audit denial for execmem
11:04:29 <strcat[m]> delegating that to you

13:53:46 <galyoninion[m]> What should I do if Google Play Services is required to play games on GrapheneOS? I can't be asked for it when I try to play the game. I found a service called MicroG, but I hear that it also has weak security. What should I do?
13:55:16 <crueltekk[m]> > What should I do if Google Play Services is required to play games on GrapheneOS? I can't be asked for it when I try to play the game. I found a service called MicroG, but I hear that it also has weak security. What should I do?
13:55:16 <crueltekk[m]> You should swap the system or stop playing games that are in need of playservices
13:55:29 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <galyoninion[m] "What should I do if Google Play "> You play different games. GrapheneOS has no support for neither Google Play Services nor microG.
13:55:34 <alzxjm[m]> <galyoninion[m] "What should I do if Google Play "> You can check out CalyxOS, which ships with microG. It's the only other OS you will find with full verified boot.
13:58:51 <galyoninion[m]> Is CalyxOS secure?
13:59:08 <strcat[m]> most games probably won't work with microG
13:59:15 <strcat[m]> if you want real Play Services just use the stock OS
13:59:30 <strcat[m]> you won't have the GrapheneOS hardening but you won't elsewhere anyway
14:02:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just play Chinese games
14:02:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> They work without gms
14:03:18 <alzxjm[m]> <galyoninion[m] "Is CalyxOS secure?"> CalyxOS focuses more on usability than security. As far as I can tell, it is not less secure than stock. It is not as hardened/secure as GrapheneOS.
14:03:33 <alzxjm[m]> Stock Pixel Android is quite secure, and the Google Play Store is better for security than F-Droid, but as long as you don't install untrustworthy software CalyxOS should give a good balance between usability/compatability, security, and privacy.
14:04:38 <alzxjm[m]> #CalyxOS:matrix.org is a great room. The developers are active there, as well as the founder of the Calyx Institute.
14:04:47 <galyoninion[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Stock Pixel Android is quite sec"> Understood.
14:05:24 <alzxjm[m]> I recommend you go there with questions about that operating system.
14:05:45 <galyoninion[m]> <alzxjm[m] "#CalyxOS:matrix.org is a great r"> When you wanna use app with Google Play Store, what do you do?
14:06:25 <alzxjm[m]> You can install the Aurora Store (available in F-Droid) which is a mirror of the Google Play Store.
14:06:44 <strcat[m]> most games won't work with microG tho so
14:06:51 <strcat[m]> you should just use stock if you want that
14:09:16 <causasui[m]> aurora stor ecan also filter apps that require play services. nice feature

14:34:10 <SchismXL[m]> Just a few trackers in the game, too. /s
14:35:30 <SchismXL[m]> My Pixel 4 XL has been dispatched today. This is a very exciting time!
14:51:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> Honestly if you want to game on Android, you'd be better off getting a cheap tablet and using it only for that. Last resort, you can play Fortnite on GrapheneOS. That game is cancer, but it is indeed compatible.
14:52:18 <cyborgninjaneer[> Epic didn't want to pay Play Store royalties, so they told Google to gtfo and released the game directly on their site.
14:53:04 <samuel[m]3> I need help fellow humans
14:53:33 <cdesai> Fortnite is on play store now though.
14:53:33 <cyborgninjaneer[> There are humans in here? Dadgummit I hate humans!
14:53:36 <cyborgninjaneer[> Jk
14:53:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> Oh it is?
14:53:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> Well you don't have to get it there
14:54:28 <cyborgninjaneer[> It was originally released as a direct download and is still available as such
14:54:39 * samuel[m]3 sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/kRZNVjSnnOockVKRuyLekNzr >

14:56:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you're on Linux and used the package manager, it's probably out of date due to the dumb way most distros update their repos
14:56:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> Especially Debian. It's always out of date.
14:57:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> If that's not the issue idk
15:00:56 <fomijafi[m]> samuel: is fastboot in your PATH?
15:09:52 <samuel[m]3> And now I'm getting "illegal number"
15:18:33 <learninandlurkin> test
15:43:44 <causasui[m]> unrelated but I'm curious why rooting the phone destroys the security model so completely. I can use 'sudo' on my PC but its mere availability isn't a disaster unless misused, right? is it not possible to authorize root access in such a way using aosp/grapheneOS?
15:44:43 <causasui[m]> I ask because there are some interesting things one can do with a rooted device e.g. use a different bootloader passphrase than lock screen PIN, shut down the phone if a wrong PIN is entered too many times etc, that I don't think can be done without root afaik
15:45:37 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Does anyone of a online server that is capable of building grapheneos or aosp in general, maybe aws or something that is more tailored to aosp builds?
15:48:44 <cdesai> j3ghprjfo[m]: it can be built on any server with good enough resources. RattlesnakeOS has aws configs to automate the process
15:49:05 <cdesai> but you can just as easily get a linux vm or box anywhere (aws ec2, gcp, ovh, hetzener) and build it just fine
15:49:14 <overheadscallop[> causasui: https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/android.html#rooting root destroys the security model
15:49:14 <overheadscallop[> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html sudo is not secure.
15:50:57 <j3ghprjfo[m]> cdesai: thanks
16:02:43 <strcat[m]> causasui: the availability of it without using it does destroy the security model
16:02:57 <strcat[m]> > I ask because there are some interesting things one can do with a rooted device e.g. use a different bootloader passphrase than lock screen PIN, shut down the phone if a wrong PIN is entered too many times etc, that I don't think can be done without root afaik
16:03:01 <causasui[m]> I wouldn't want it to be available if I weren't using it
16:03:06 <strcat[m]> you're wrong about those things too
16:03:18 <causasui[m]> how's that? now I'm interested
16:03:30 <strcat[m]> causasui: the availability of it implies not having meaningful verified boot and having a ton of extra attack surface for root too
16:03:37 <strcat[m]> it has a substantial negative impact on the security model
16:03:48 <strcat[m]> causasui: it doesn't give you those things / isn't needed for them
16:03:54 <strcat[m]> causasui: you're just wrong about it
16:04:00 <causasui[m]> I'm not arguing. I'm talking about the second part, how can I get those features without rooting the phone
16:04:24 <strcat[m]> you can't get a separate passphrase for boot with rooting it because it's not how it works...
16:04:29 <strcat[m]> encryption is per-profile
16:04:55 <strcat[m]> and if people actually wanted to implement that they would have contributed to our relevant planned feature which has been open since 2016
16:05:05 <strcat[m]> not sure how having root would help you obtain that
16:05:24 <strcat[m]> there is no 'boot passphrase', encryption is per-profile
16:05:29 <causasui[m]> Me either since I don't know what planned feature you are describing lol
16:05:33 <strcat[m]> each profile has a different encryption key
16:06:05 <strcat[m]> causasui: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28 read that
16:06:24 <strcat[m]> and read my reply to someone with similar confusion as you
16:06:33 <strcat[m]> 2nd comment
16:06:36 <causasui[m]> man I appreciate you and what you're doing but I didn't intend to make this so contentious
16:08:52 <causasui[m]> alright, it was a thing on older versions of android but ofc it seems it isn't anymore, and if that's not a thing then there's no help powering off the phone with too many bad PINs then
16:11:29 <strcat[m]> yeah that won't help and isn't the right approach
16:11:57 <strcat[m]> the right approach is either adding a 2nd factor to biometric unlock, which is already designed as a restricted secondary unlock mechanism
16:12:16 <strcat[m]> or adding another secondary unlock mechanism for that
16:13:26 <causasui[m]> yeah I'm not using biometric unlock at all
16:13:28 <strcat[m]> causasui: rebooting after N attempts with the old method also relies on the adversary not knowing that's implemented / available... and also not just trying to exploit the device
16:14:15 <interceptingfist> I bought a 3a that worked on art but the OEM is greyed out?
16:14:26 <interceptingfist> Att*
16:14:29 <strcat[m]> the secondary unlock mechanism strength certainly matters even with limited attermpts
16:14:39 <strcat[m]> because that's what is securing data at rest when locked rather than powered off
16:15:24 <strcat[m]> interceptingfist: sounds like a verizon pixel 3a - look at the package
16:15:38 <strcat[m]> interceptingfist: they aren't carrier locked
16:15:51 <interceptingfist> I don't have the package I bought it used
16:16:26 <strcat[m]> interceptingfist: you can confirm with adb shell or an app that lists system properties by checking carrierid of the device
16:16:58 <interceptingfist> ok what app
16:17:17 <causasui[m]> strcat: this is all dreamworld apparently but the way I was thinking about it was something like- if I am leaving my phone unattended, crossing a border, in an encounter with police, some other contact with an adversary, then it would be good if I could power off the phone and know that the contents are protected by a strong passphrase. but when it's in active use I can still use a user-friendly PIN. I recognize that
16:17:17 <causasui[m]> is a compromise but the most secure phone is one that doesn't exist, right?
16:17:19 <strcat[m]> causasui: when a profile is logged in (decryption key is available), data can still be kept at rest when locked via the keystore
16:17:40 <strcat[m]> causasui: that's not a good approach
16:18:03 <strcat[m]> the proper approach is having a strong passphrase for each profile and then more convenient secondary unlock mechanisms that automatically time out / get disabled and can be easily disabled
16:18:35 <strcat[m]> I don't know why you think you want that rather than using a strong passphrase as the main unlock mechanism so it protects everything including the keystore
16:19:30 <causasui[m]> Depends on what the "convenient secondary unlock mechanism(s)" look like maybe. I'm not conceptually a fan of using biometrics e.g. fingerprint unlock since that can be duplicated without a warrant
16:19:52 <strcat[m]> if your main unlock method is a strong passphrase then rebooting or logging out accomplishes the same thing but encryption is per-profile and the keystore, etc. are protected via this passphrase too
16:20:28 <causasui[m]> Right, but this is why it swings on the secondary unlock mechanism, because entering a strong passphrase every time I want to use the phone is not practical on these small screens
16:20:49 <strcat[m]> causasui: read causasui:
16:20:53 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28
16:21:00 <strcat[m]>  * causasui: read
16:21:59 <strcat[m]> causasui: you can also take advantage of profiles already
16:22:09 <strcat[m]> put sensitive stuff in a profile with a strong passphrase
16:22:29 <strcat[m]> use a profile with a short PIN for quick use
16:22:53 <strcat[m]> keep the sensitive profile inactive (logged out)
16:23:16 <strcat[m]> atm there isn't an explicit logout option in the GUI but you can reboot for now, we could easily add a logout to the power menu
16:23:29 <strcat[m]> just another thing people have to step up to help implement
16:23:42 <strcat[m]> logout / purging the keys is already supported
16:23:46 <strcat[m]> just isn't a button for it in the GUI
16:23:57 <causasui[m]> Let me try to spit this back at you to make sure I see the picture you're drawing for me
16:24:18 <causasui[m]> I haven't used profiles on any recent android version so I' m sure to get this a bit wrong somewhere
16:24:28 <interceptingfist> Its a g020e phone
16:24:40 <interceptingfist> Says gsm in the app
16:24:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah you don't need to strcat
16:25:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> CAF has a beta implementation of that from what I know
16:25:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: we can just copy the CAF implementation over. No idea if it is released BTW
16:25:28 <strcat[m]> interceptingfist: that's the verizon variant
16:25:35 <strcat[m]> interceptingfist: doesn't allow oem unlocking
16:25:50 <strcat[m]> it's not carrier locked, it's bootloader locked
16:26:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Apps can only encrypt new data when locked but can't decrypt is the CAF implementation
16:26:09 <strcat[m]> because that's what verizon wants for usage on their network and if you get a phone from verizon that's how it'll be
16:26:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> That what we want?
16:26:47 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I think you're misunderstanding what CAF has available
16:27:06 <interceptingfist> strcat: dang
16:27:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmm maybe
16:27:22 <interceptingfist> This is bs, I even did mybduendiligence
16:27:24 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: and it's not really about what apps can do
16:27:25 <causasui[m]> Is a "profile" ~= "Multiple Users" in settings?
16:27:32 <strcat[m]> causasui: yes
16:27:35 <strcat[m]> those are user profiles
16:27:54 <strcat[m]> causasui: each one has a separate encryption key derived from the lock method
16:28:20 <causasui[m]> Ok, I'm exploring how fine grained is the control I can get over the privileges of a non-admin user
16:28:29 <strcat[m]> causasui: each one has a separate hardware-backed keystore namespace protected by the lock methods (for keys tied to the device being unlocked) - which lets apps keep data at rest when just locked (rather than just powered off)
16:28:44 <strcat[m]> causasui: the non-owner users just can't do much by default
16:28:53 <strcat[m]> the Settings GUI doesn't expose all the fancy options, just a few
16:29:12 <causasui[m]> are the fancy options exposed some other way?
16:29:33 <strcat[m]> yes
16:29:52 <interceptingfist> Are most phones on the market a Verizon phone
16:29:56 <strcat[m]> but not really in a way that you can use
16:30:01 <strcat[m]> interceptingfist: no definitely not
16:30:23 <interceptingfist> How the hell do you buy exactly the right one
16:30:37 <strcat[m]> you don't need 'exactly the right one'
16:30:46 <strcat[m]> you need a non-Verizon one
16:31:01 <strcat[m]> only the Verizon ones are locked like that
16:31:07 <interceptingfist> So this is a Verizon unlocked phone
16:31:24 <interceptingfist> Which ones are specific to verizon
16:31:34 <strcat[m]> it's a Verizon Pixel which can be carrier unlocked but are always bootloader locked
16:31:43 <strcat[m]> the bootloader being locked is part of enforcing Verizon's rules
16:32:34 <strcat[m]> they can have it carrier locked and then release it when the contract ends
16:32:40 <strcat[m]> and then someone might decide to sell it
16:32:47 <strcat[m]> and not mention it's a Verizon device
16:33:10 <interceptingfist> ok
16:33:21 <strcat[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_3a#Models
16:33:29 <interceptingfist> Thanks for the help
16:33:32 <strcat[m]> there are 4 variants
16:33:34 <strcat[m]> one if Verizon
16:33:42 <strcat[m]> the other 3 are bootloader unlockable
16:33:45 <interceptingfist> They need to do one plus phones or something
16:33:55 <strcat[m]>  * one is Verizon
16:34:18 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't support devices not meeting the security requirements
16:34:43 <causasui[m]> my old phone was a 1+ because they had a rep for being easy to flash custom ROMs on but I got a pixel to use grapheneOS and it wasn't any more difficult
16:34:52 <interceptingfist> It'd have a better camera lol
16:35:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
16:35:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Bootloader exploit on verizon is possible
16:35:17 * bobfett-[m]1 just lurking
16:35:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can literally bypass their security
16:35:33 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you don't need to exploit the bootloader to bypass the Verizon Pixel locking
16:35:53 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's a software enforced lock in the Settings app
16:35:58 <causasui[m]> of course it would be nice if every device had good hardware security & if grapheneOS supported all of them, or better yet if AOSP were secure to begin with but this is all dreamland also. "pull requests welcome"
16:36:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> interceptingfist: also it took me 6 months to get a proper security patch merged in that "better" camera
16:36:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: oneplus stuff
16:36:28 <strcat[m]> causasui: AOSP is secure to begin with, there will always be stuff for GrapheneOS to improve
16:36:33 <strcat[m]> doesn't really matter what OS it's based on
16:36:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can literally go around it and unlock the phone
16:36:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> The stock ROM will be basically unusable but custom ones work
16:36:53 <strcat[m]> there will be privacy/security improvements to make and further compromises to make for privacy/security
16:36:57 <strcat[m]> and that's what the project does
16:37:30 <causasui[m]> ok rephrase that to "or better yet if grapheneOS were unnecessary" the point is that practical constraints have to be balanced against each other and it's not as easy as ticking a box to support a 1+ phone because someone asked
16:37:52 <strcat[m]> it isn't 'necessary', it's useful
16:37:56 <strcat[m]> and regardless of what gets improved in AOSP
16:38:01 <causasui[m]> I don't know why you are arguing with me about this
16:38:02 <strcat[m]> there will always be privacy and security improvements to make
16:38:16 <strcat[m]> especially via further compromises on performance, memory usage, compatibility
16:38:56 <strcat[m]> usability compromises too
16:39:14 <causasui[m]> yup, sounds like that "practical constraints have to be balanced against each other" thing
16:39:49 <interceptingfist> causasui: I'm sure many people would want it
16:40:01 <interceptingfist> anupritaisno1: how?
16:40:10 <strcat[m]> we don't want support for insecure devices
16:40:19 <strcat[m]> if people try to contribute it, we'll reject it
16:40:35 <strcat[m]> finding suitable devices is a substantial undertaking
16:40:46 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't start by arbitrarily choosing some device and assuming it will meet the requirements
16:40:48 <strcat[m]> doesn't work that way
16:41:05 <strcat[m]> and if people decide to work on that they should prepare to be disappointed
16:41:22 <causasui[m]> interceptingfist: go ahead and fork it then, the license is permissive
16:41:22 <strcat[m]> because if it's discovered that the device doesn't have functional verified boot for alternate OSes, or other problems
16:41:33 <strcat[m]> or has serious security issues like broken IOMMU configuration permitting Wi-Fi to write to all the device memory
16:41:40 <strcat[m]> well, we won't support it
16:41:49 <causasui[m]> I know, and he won't fork it either
16:42:30 <strcat[m]> there may be other devices meeting the bare minimum requirements
16:42:48 <strcat[m]> but there still has to be some compelling reason to seek those out and do the immense work of supporting them
16:43:09 <strcat[m]> if there was a viable huawei kirin device, I'd see a compelling reason to support that
16:43:24 <strcat[m]> I don't see a reason to support Qualcomm SoC devices other than Pixels unless it's our own hardware where we control more of it
16:43:52 <strcat[m]> and if we have our own hardware that's actually modern + up to the same standards
16:44:00 <strcat[m]> we wouldn't need to support Pixels
16:44:16 <strcat[m]> the goal is not broad device support, it's providing the best possible setup
16:44:36 <strcat[m]> if the best setup is not a Pixel anymore we won't support them anymore
16:45:07 <strcat[m]> if there is a better alternative to the Pixel 5 we could do that instead
16:48:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> interceptingfist: there's a hardened ROM going on for oneplus for a while but the lack of maintainers is frustrating me
16:49:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> I might kill it for good and just build for my friend (who actually contributes back) and myself one day because without people wanting to step up to maintain it the whole thing is falling apart
16:51:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> I haven't committed a single new thing to glassrom in months and it'll probably remain that way. It's basically just waiting to die
16:51:52 <interceptingfist> anupritaisno1: which ROM is it,I'll look into it
16:52:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> interceptingfist: https://github.com/GlassROM/glassrom-landing
16:54:58 <interceptingfist> anupritaisno1: thanks
16:58:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> interceptingfist: but I will need AVB for all partitions and nothing strange in sepolicy/kernel as a minimum
16:58:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> The oneplus 5 series is permanently banned
17:00:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: btw sent a couple of things to android-prepare-vendor. Maybe WiFi calling will work
17:00:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also no voice over LTE on airtel on official build
17:00:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need to open an issue?
17:01:21 <pikey[m]> I am getting constant connectivity problems. I have pia VPN but sure it isnt that as I have used it for years and never had this trouble. Emails often won't send, sometimes won't download. Various apps have good connections while others don't. Right now I can't send signal messages. They just sit spinning forever not sending. I tried airVPN and had similar issues. This makes me wonder if its the OS. Anyone else having
17:01:22 <pikey[m]> issues like this?
17:01:22 <pikey[m]> PS if I turn off the OS setting to block connections outside VPN then everything works. Maybe I am being over zealous using that setting.
17:02:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> pikey: PIA VPN connectivity is just bad
17:02:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have a 3 years subscription, regretting the wasted money
17:03:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically every few hours the connection just gets shit
17:04:01 <SchismXL[m]> anupritaisno1: and continuous disconnects. I have 30 days left of the subscription and I'll be converting to Mullvad permanently.
17:04:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then there are several thread races in the app as well
17:04:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> One part of the app doesn't even know what the other part is doing
17:04:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> The app does bs like showing connecting forever when already connected
17:05:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or says connected when disconnected
17:06:07 <SchismXL[m]> That, along with them being bought out by a dodgy company has solidified my decision to say adios. It was fun while it lasted, but all good things must come to an end lol
17:06:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> These are all signs of thread races and weird interleaving producing near undefined behavior
17:06:56 <joshman[m]> You can blame it or not, but NordVPN Nordlynx (aka Wireguard) has performed amazing recently
17:07:28 <joshman[m]> PIA is just bad and within 5! Eyes
17:08:06 <SchismXL[m]> Its pretty much the eye lol
17:08:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Here's what I do
17:08:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Go to arubacloud
17:08:29 <LinusSexTips[m]> Mullvad performs amazingly as well, except they dont advertise on "Deep Web Link" sites that have CP sites listed
17:08:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Buy their really cheap VPS
17:08:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Run wireguard
17:08:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'll just be $1-5 a month
17:09:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> $25 if you want to go overboard and have a few 100 clients
17:09:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's pretty cheap
17:09:17 <joshman[m]> Own VPS doesn't solve my country hoping need
17:09:23 <pikey[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "pikey: PIA VPN connectivity is j"> thanks anu. I have used it for years. Its not great, but it doesnt do this. I get slower and faster periods, and occasional connection problems. BUt this is not like that, my Pixel is connecting to 90% of services, my connection is fine, speedtest.net shows 40mbps download, 20 up. i am connected fine. yet signal messages wont send, and occasionally emails wont due to
17:09:23 <pikey[m]> some strange error.
17:11:09 <pikey[m]> thanks but i am not looking for altenatives. I also have AirVPN. That is superb. I get the SAME issue when running that on Graphene too. OCcasionally ONE app gets trouble connecting. very strange. not convinced its GOS causing it, but PIA is running fine otherwise, and running on four other devices (iphone included, running Signal and connecting/sending fine).
17:12:38 <pikey[m]> weird. i just wiped Signal cache, no change, then wiped its storage data. Didn't realise that would all but uninstall it so had to set up again. connecting fine now.
17:12:49 <pikey[m]> maybe a one off signal bug.
17:13:23 <SchismXL[m]> <joshman[m] "Own VPS doesn't solve my country"> Same. But, what I've found with PIA is that so many IP addresses are blacklisted these days, to the point where it can be detrimental to actually use the VPN. Case and point... Freenode is sponsored by PIA, yet blocks access from loads of different countries.
17:14:21 <joshman[m]> With Nord id say 90% of IPs aren't blacklisted
17:14:41 <joshman[m]> Though I heard it doesn't perform well for PRC needs
17:15:34 <SchismXL[m]> <pikey[m] "weird. i just wiped Signal cache"> Glad you got to sorted :)
17:15:37 <pikey[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Same. But, what I've found with "> yep, i got plenty of issues with blocked IPs but I can't see Signal doing that surely? Definitely getting rid of PIA when my subs run out, but can't say it hasn't been 99% perfect on iphone and mac for many years now. but AirVPN is better, more security focussed, way faster, and IPs seem less blaclisted

17:19:39 <pikey[m]> oh, thanks. what problems do you have?
17:20:54 <SchismXL[m]> Similar to you regarding VPN usage, with apps not connecting when the "block connections outside VPN" is selected. No VPN? No problem.
17:21:45 <SchismXL[m]> So it is just unselected all the time and hope my host list / pihole soaks up the rest of the nefarious traffic.

17:25:31 <SchismXL[m]> Yep
17:26:07 <q22[m]> I haven't had any problems paying in cash for my email account. I hope my international letter won't 'get lost'
17:26:54 <pikey[m]> haha

17:27:18 <pikey[m]>  means VPN i assume
17:27:33 <pikey[m]> i can use mullvad with cash credit card so nice and anon, just can't bloody afford yet another vpn at the mo
17:29:06 <SchismXL[m]> Thinking about biting the bullet and paying for a year with a disposable cc, as I can't see any other way and crypto just too much effort
17:29:48 <pikey[m]> ha, peas in a pod! still haven't got into crypto. just can't find the time and its never as easy (or anon) as so many people make out.
17:29:55 <pikey[m]> i can buy a credit card with cash and use that. way easier
17:30:22 <pikey[m]> bit like the "run your own VPN" idea. I LOVE the idea, but the implementation for someone like me (limited knowledge but also very limitedtime) is just too much
17:30:29 <pikey[m]> brilliant idea though. i hope to one day
17:32:21 <SchismXL[m]> Yep, precisely. Never got into it. That being said, some young kid on my street got on that Bitcoin train many years ago, hoarded them and literally became a millionaire when he sold most of it during the surge a couple of years back. Can't say I'm not jealous, but crypto just doesn't interest me all that much
17:33:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> > i can buy a credit card with cash and use that. way easier
17:33:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> How do you do that?
17:34:02 <SchismXL[m]> <pikey[m] "bit like the "run your own VPN" "> Its not as hard as you think. anupritaisno1 said it earlier and can be quiet cheap if you find a decent VPS in the country or countries that you need. Its just the initial getting it done. You should watch some tutorials or read some blog posts etc. If you're okay with flashing a custom ROM onto a phone, you can set up a VPS tbh
17:34:21 <cyborgninjaneer[> > bit like the "run your own VPN" idea. I LOVE the idea, but the implementation for someone like me (limited knowledge but also very limitedtime) is just too much
17:34:21 <cyborgninjaneer[> This has limited use. It's less anonymous since your traffic is tied to a single IP only used by you.
17:35:13 <cyborgninjaneer[> On the other hand, if you're smart enough nobody will know who that IP actually belongs to, and you only have to trust the VPS host or data center.

17:35:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yes, it depends on use case.
17:36:44 <cyborgninjaneer[> For privacy, it's best for most users to simply choose a reputable VPN outside the Five Eyes that had been audited to ensure security and no logs.
17:37:39 <cyborgninjaneer[> Proton, ExpressVPN, and SurfShark are possible examples, although I'm not necessarily recommending them.
17:38:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> Choice of VPN is pretty personal. Do your research.
17:42:53 <q22[m]> <SchismXL[m] "> <@cyborgninjaneer:matrix.org> "> SchismXL yes, I paid for a posteo email account
17:43:14 <q22[m]> That quote shouldn't be there, sorry
17:43:30 <SchismXL[m]> Ah cool, nice! Didn't know you could with posteo. I'm thinking of changing from FastMail at some point :)

18:39:08 <anonymouserobot[> <mrmanpants[m] "or is there another method to bu"> bitcoin ATMs, p2p marketplaces, a few companies that sell vouchers like fastbitcoins.com and azteco. a lot depends on country because buying with cash is inherently local

19:12:57 <Jimmehh[m]> i was in here maybe last week talking about ios vs android for my next phone and this has my hopes up that will help the cause for android over ios, i do fear it won't change much for device support. also google probably already utilities

19:13:13 <Jimmehh[m]> i was in here maybe last week talking about ios vs android for my next phone and this has my hopes up that will help the cause for android over ios, i do fear it won't change much for device support. also google probably already utilities all of these and i find their support to be lacking compared to ios
19:21:47 <SchismXL[m]> Serious question... Why would you go iOS instead of Android? More specifically, deGoogled Android. It does baffle me how someone can go to iOS. I'm not an Apple shill, by any means, but there's no way I could ever trust any iDevice to have any sort of data on it. Yes, there have been "cases" in the past where the authorities have been told "no" from Apple for unlocking or having a back door into devices, but that's
19:21:47 <SchismXL[m]> all you typically see in the press and not what may be going on behind closed doors.
19:23:01 <cyborgninjaneer[> Apple is pretty good if you don't use the parts of iCloud that Apple has the encryption keys for. Better yet, forego iCloud entirely.
19:23:47 <cyborgninjaneer[> iOS is more resistant to after-first-unlock attacks than Android, degoogled or not.
19:24:48 <cyborgninjaneer[> Safari has good anti-fingerprinting. Password managers are implemented better on iOS. Water resistance (weirdly) has a better reputation for quality control on Apple devices.
19:25:31 <cyborgninjaneer[> Apple is better at keeping malware out of their app store, and is taking a moderately strong stance against tracking in iOS 14.
19:25:39 <cyborgninjaneer[> There are a lot of reasons.
19:26:57 * cyborgninjaneer[ sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tBzcTSCUhxxHsnxQodaymfDg >
19:29:03 <SchismXL[m]> To me, I couldn't give up those things. I wouldn't be able to trust a device that isn't open source. You can kind of track any telemetry and information Apple might be syphoning off you, but I don't think you could ever know what they may have on you. iCloud or not, because the OS is pretty much closed source, you can never be sure your device isn't giving them everything.
19:29:09 <cyborgninjaneer[> Android has more freedom, while Apple does a variety of specific things better but offers less freedom. There are a lot of tradeoffs both ways, especially when you consider the security of GrapheneOS versus stock.
19:29:44 <cyborgninjaneer[> Also depends on threat model
19:30:59 <cyborgninjaneer[> Apple is (arguably) less robust against nation state adversaries, but usually more resistant to cyber crime and commercial surveillance.
19:32:15 <nitroneurons[m]1> <SchismXL[m] "To me, I couldn't give up those "> you probably want graphene then
19:32:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> As far as Vanadium versus Safari, I don't really know which is more secure. My gut says they're comparable.
19:32:57 <nitroneurons[m]1> apple is better for most users, graphene for the minority of technically inclined people who value the above listed attributes
19:33:53 <jneplokh> https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/ekxifpa/
19:33:53 <SchismXL[m]> For sure, it all depends on threat model. I suppose if someone is happy with that, then so be it. That's why I'm glad we do have  choices and options. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going full Stallman by any stretch of the imagination (I used to have an iPhone), but as I've got more into this privacy-orientated lifestyle and getting rid of social media, it just blows my mind how many are just accepting of the practises
19:33:53 <SchismXL[m]> these companies undertake.
19:34:04 <SchismXL[m]> <nitroneurons[m]1 "apple is better for most users, "> You said it more succinctly than I
19:34:34 <nitroneurons[m]1> isn't safari considered fairly insecure in comparison to chromium (and hence more so compared to vanadium)?

The USB-C that connects to the charger and the phone isn't compatible with my computer (uses just regular USB-A port)). I've tried two USB-C to USB adapters and my Linux desktop doesn't seem to recognize the device. Any advice?
20:06:25 <nickcalyx[m]> you may need a real usba to usbc cable
20:07:55 <kinderkraft[m]> Hi, is it possible to rewrite the phone, if I forgot screen lock pin?
20:09:54 <cyborgninjaneer[> Of OEM unlocking is still enabled you can unlock the bootloader to force a factory reset.
20:10:34 <kinderkraft[m]> And if it is locked, no way?
20:11:14 <alzxjm[m]> Are your udev rules set up correctly?
20:11:28 <alzxjm[m]> https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/blob/master/51-android.rules
20:11:33 <alzxjm[m]> (or something like it. I haven't reviewed that specific file)
20:56:06 <randolf[m]> how do I enable always-on display on the pixel 4?
20:56:10 <randolf[m]> setting seems to be missing
20:59:16 <IxquickOG[m]> henlo
21:01:42 <randolf[m]> I would personally say throw a browser into shelter, and a VPN, then only use facebook through that
21:02:07 <randolf[m]> but best practice would to just use facebook on your PC if you can help it
21:02:10 <SchismXL[m]> If you really need to use it, I'd recommend Frost from F-Droid. It is a Facebook wrapper that compartmentalises the usage of Facebook.
21:02:45 <SchismXL[m]> More than a wrapper, but essentially that.
21:02:57 <randolf[m]> shelter uses the "work profile" of your android phone to isolate apps to their own area, so they can't communicate with your "main" profile and "main" apps
21:03:04 <SchismXL[m]> Frost for Facebook (A fast and extensive third party wrapper for Facebook.) - https://f-droid.org/app/com.pitchedapps.frost
21:03:13 <x0axff> What about Whatsapp?
21:03:34 <randolf[m]> again, I'd say to just use shelter
21:04:00 <SchismXL[m]> Yeah, Shelter for that :)
21:05:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> Shelter and other device manager apps are not recommended. It's better to use a separate user profile if possible. Shelter is a hack or fudge to provide something that Android doesn't support.
21:07:36 <x0axff> Whatsapp will still have access to your contacts, camera and microphone in a seperate user profile doesn't it? The best way would be to use the Web app for it but it requires the Smartphone to be connected I think
21:08:28 <randolf[m]> you could just deny said permissions?
21:10:36 <x0axff> Is the application usable if it has no permissions to the contacts?
21:11:17 <randolf[m]> no idea, I don't use it so I couldn't tell you
21:12:56 <SchismXL[m]> > Is the application usable if it has no permissions to the contacts?
21:12:56 <SchismXL[m]> Yes, it is. You can message someone directly, but you won't have their name as a contact, only a number.
21:14:22 <SchismXL[m]> Tried it the other day on Sailfish OS, as my partner point blank refuses to leave WhatsApp. She won't have a choice, soon, though. :)
21:15:02 <randolf[m]> anyone know why the always-on display doesn't appear on a pixel 4?
21:15:05 <x0axff> Ah I see thanks :) Do you know if group chats are working that way too?
21:15:32 <randolf[m]> the setting shows just fine on a pixel 3, but pixel 4 just doesn't show it, and sadly that's a huge deal breaker for me
21:16:09 <SchismXL[m]> > Ah I see thanks :) Do you know if group chats are working that way too?
21:16:09 <SchismXL[m]> As long as you're in the group or invited into the group and someone sends a message, you'll get the conversation appear in WhatsApp.
21:19:37 <x0axff> Ok nice i will try this, thank you

22:55:22 <diagocosta[m]> These iPhone spy apps that claim to do everything including get keystrokes and turn microphone on remotely by apple ID..
22:55:22 <diagocosta[m]> Is this true for all iOS devices ?
22:58:31 <cn3m[m]> diagocosta: Nope that is more of an Android problem
22:58:33 <cn3m[m]> Accessibility services
22:58:43 <cn3m[m]> iOS apps can't do that without jailbreak, but that is difficult or impossible if you are at all careful
22:59:24 <cn3m[m]> if you leave your device unattended reboot it before using it again and run the latest version of iOS and you will be fine on anything released in the past 7 years
23:04:16 <cn3m[m]> This is why you should use remote attestation and never install an accessibility service on GrapheneOS or any Android system
23:04:19 <cn3m[m]> It will check for accessibility services installed by your or not
23:05:18 <diagocosta[m]> I'm reading that android you need physical access to load a spy app..
23:05:18 <diagocosta[m]> And ios you can remotely Do it if you know the apple ID credentials ..

23:41:12 <cn3m[m]> found 500,000 cases of stalkerware
23:41:42 <cn3m[m]> stalkerware has grown 30-100% during lockdown
23:41:55 <cn3m[m]> I would consider it a large to massive issue considering the invasive
23:43:02 <cn3m[m]> the victims are typically targeted and people who are already being manipulated. I am sure the vast majority aren't noticing it. Hell there are only 5 AVs that detect it at all and it is a light warning if they do
23:43:44 <qyo3462572445[m]> According to google play kaspersky has over 50,000,000 downloads. And they detected 500,000 cases?

23:44:38 <cn3m[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "According to google play kaspers"> yes that is 1% chance of an extremely destructive life altering event essentially
23:45:58 <qyo3462572445[m]> That can be said for anything in life.
23:49:14 <cn3m[m]> The chances of course are much higher for women than it is men which should be considered
23:49:19 <cn3m[m]> that was also just January to August 2019

23:49:38 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cn3m[m] "the victims are typically target"> Which 5?
23:54:00 <cn3m[m]> Avira, Malwarebytes, Gdata, Fsecure, Norton iirc
23:54:03 <cn3m[m]> Kaspersky
23:54:05 <cn3m[m]> 6
23:54:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> Hm haven't heard of gdata
23:56:33 <qyo3462572445[m]> I would get a practical car that fits my needs and learn how to operate it safely. If I run a business that requires me to have a pickup truck, I'm not going to buy a sedan just because it has better safety features. I wouldn't buy an iPhone JUST because it lowers the risk of stalkerware if I don't like what else the phone offers.
23:59:41 <cn3m[m]> Well we are all here using a limited versions of Pixels so less common threats. I think we all understand that dynamic
