00:45:31 <RedNovember[m]> I was looking to see if there was any other people who had this issue, because this looks to be like some kind of bug.
02:23:41 <RedNovember[m]> I haven't tried any of the solutions in the troubleshooting section yet, I'll have to test that tomorrow.
02:30:37 <abridgeacrack[m]> huh noticed Android R sources being GPL-released, any ETA on GrapheneOS switched to them? I can probably contribute some 40-60 hours on porting and testing things if needed
02:35:34 <aeonsolution[m]> what device do you have abridgeacrack?
02:36:36 <abridgeacrack[m]> blueline, tons of blueline with actual user and tester base... I foresee they'd be exploding my inbox tomorrow asking about that R  :D
02:37:07 <abridgeacrack[m]> there was pixel 4 but some punk took it home from office  :/
02:37:28 <aeonsolution[m]> blueline is the pixel 3 right?
02:37:34 <abridgeacrack[m]> yup
02:37:48 <aeonsolution[m]> nice, ok well step 0 is building the development branch
02:37:52 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build
02:39:48 <abridgeacrack[m]> figured out earlier this year I'm done with AOSP development on my own, seeing how my experience with exploiting and backdooring it is two years behind what they got in  China with Virualapp type of apps.. was detaling with networking mainly last months, VPLS and all of that. Think its a good way to refresh skills, by contibuting to R port
02:40:19 <aeonsolution[m]> im going to try my best to port the kernel patches of the project to R-preview-4 this week and will try to build it on my device first before asking for others to help test
02:40:27 <aeonsolution[m]> oh nice well if you think you can do that
02:40:52 <aeonsolution[m]> let me send you some links in a PM
02:41:03 <abridgeacrack[m]> oh cool
02:46:35 <aeonsolution[m]> you're all set, good luck
02:46:47 <aeonsolution[m]> if you have questions direct them to the chat
02:54:37 <abridgeacrack[m]> on an unrelated node.. maybe someone had a chance to look into IMEI changing with 845 and newer snapdragons? I think I can get my hands on a test GSM station to test that kind of mod - just to MVP some cool stuff, not to abuse the law :D haven't seen it working on non-MTK devices tho.. got char_diag enabled kernel, but seems the modem firmware is loaded without participation of HLOS and takes no input from it
02:54:37 <abridgeacrack[m]> after
02:55:55 <JTL> > seeing how my experience with exploiting and backdooring it is two years behind what they got in  China with Virualapp type of apps..
02:55:57 <JTL> Oh?
03:08:20 <abridgeacrack[m]> well there was a lot of "WTF this is doing" coming from github/researchgate look. Dexposed, epic, pine.. think @zysyyz [github] had a good collection of that. Nvm :D
03:21:30 <JTL> abridgeacrack[m]: I gotcha :)
03:49:53 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you know if the cts sources are available so i can debug how the attr size is checked for the bionic tests?
04:30:36 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes
04:30:37 <strcat[m]> they are
04:30:46 <strcat[m]> renlord: the bionic tests are in bionic
04:30:50 <strcat[m]> just grep for the test name in bionic
04:30:58 <strcat[m]> the cts is fully open source
04:31:12 <strcat[m]> there's a cts directory with a lot of tests and then some test suites have dedicated repos
04:31:21 <strcat[m]> most tests are just with the project they are testing
04:34:52 <renlord> ok
04:36:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> ok
04:36:52 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you have the failure logs for pthread#pthread_attr_setstacksize
04:36:57 <renlord> or just prints fail?
04:37:08 <strcat[m]> Dunno
04:37:11 <strcat[m]> You can run it
04:37:22 <strcat[m]> Look at cts guide in our build guide
04:37:30 <strcat[m]> Can run specific test alone
04:39:41 <renlord> 07-15 14:38:56 I/ModuleListener: [1405/2851] pthread#pthread_attr_setstacksize fail:

04:40:09 <renlord> stack_base invalid?
04:40:46 <renlord> look like test just dont accept randomized stack base
04:40:52 <renlord> it is page aligned
04:41:10 <renlord> strcat[m]:
04:41:42 <strcat[m]> renlord: the actual stored stack base should be unchanged?
04:41:56 <strcat[m]> it'll need to be figured out
04:42:01 <strcat[m]> there are multiple changes to this stuff
05:09:29 <TheJollyRoger> cts test just finished running.
05:09:53 <TheJollyRoger> Report will be on the way. Total time >100h.
05:10:27 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, sorry, my mistake. Total time, 94 hours, 7m, 42s.
05:10:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah basically 100
05:13:21 <TheJollyRoger> So far I'm trying to use some basic bash scripting to remove the failed tests from test_results.html. If I can figure out how to run some of these as a batch it might go a long way to getting more reliable results.
05:13:48 <TheJollyRoger> The ones that are marked intentional of course I'll just cross off.
05:24:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> @paintedman:matrix.org: I still have no update on the patch
06:03:43 <alicebobandeve> All I see in my feed when I check GOS is renor has left the room or renor has joined the room. This is a mystery.
06:51:05 <anni3> So what is unique about vanadium?
07:01:05 <cn3m[m]> <anni3 "So what is unique about vanadium"> many many hardening features
07:01:07 <cn3m[m]> it is designed to blend in with Chrome on Pixels
07:01:11 <cn3m[m]> which is ideal to avoid fingerprinting
07:01:20 <cn3m[m]> it is the perfect fit for GrapheneOS
07:02:46 <theultron[m]> Do we have any data on number of active GrapheneOS users?
07:06:49 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "Do we have any data on number of"> no
07:26:52 <jknsec[m]> That would be counterintuitive to the purpose of the project
07:28:03 <jknsec[m]> Part of having no telemetry means that you have little to no statistics regarding user info
07:28:52 <jknsec[m]> Same goes for bugs, usability issues, etc. (which we rely on the Github for)
07:29:56 <jknsec[m]> It makes development a bit harder to it makes GOS comparatively very private in its default configuration

12:54:05 <strcat[m]> sadly it doesn't provide details
12:54:16 <strcat[m]> and I don't know how to get verbose output from bundletool
12:54:24 <strcat[m]> it says "check the logs" which is not helpful when it seems to delete all the intermediate files

12:57:15 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no
12:57:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: talking about building Vanadium not GrapheneOS
12:57:29 <strcat[m]> it's one of the Chromium prebuilts
12:57:36 <strcat[m]> it has prebuilts just like AOSP
12:57:40 <strcat[m]> for reproducible builds / signing
12:57:45 <strcat[m]> so I know I'm using the correct version
12:57:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): why not build the bundle tool yourself and add an artificial wait?
12:58:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just pause when that message is printed and check logs
12:58:09 <strcat[m]> there is probably an error somewhere in the patches
12:58:11 <strcat[m]> that creates a duplicate resource

12:58:25 <strcat[m]> if they exist

12:58:27 <strcat[m]> don't know

12:58:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay
12:58:39 <strcat[m]> it has no proper help output either

13:02:26 <strcat[m]> cdesai: I really don't think bundletool is an issue here
13:02:45 <strcat[m]> it's just finding a problem with the resources
13:02:49 <strcat[m]> and can't make it into an apk because of it
13:03:02 <strcat[m]> it's not bundletool's fault - I definitely don't think that's the problem
13:04:11 <cdesai> yeah. I'll fire off a build

13:23:34 <byolog[m]> Grapheneos website recommend to use vanadium browser, but given that I can't install add-ons, I feel I have more control over my data while using Firefox with add-ons like umatrix.. any idea which one really better?
13:23:45 <strcat> ypi
13:23:52 <strcat> you're misleading yourself about what those addons do
13:24:17 <byolog[m]> <strcat "you're misleading yourself about"> How?
13:25:09 <strcat> I don't know what you mean by how
13:25:44 <strcat> enumerating badness isn't a security or privacy model
13:26:06 <strcat> you don't stop sites from getting your data by blacklisting/whitelisting domains
13:26:10 <strcat> doesn't make sense
13:26:12 <byolog[m]> Do you mean that these add-ons not really useful for privac
13:26:21 <strcat> I mean you don't seem to understand what they can accomplish
13:26:27 <strcat> which is not nearly as much as you imply
13:26:40 <strcat> and I'd seriously question whether you are making yourself better off rather than worse off
13:26:54 <strcat> by making yourself stand out from everyone else so much
13:26:56 <strcat> and for what
13:27:23 <strcat> I don't understand what data you're talking about - they don't prevent any access to data
13:27:36 <theultron[m]> Hey. Does it matter if I store important stuff in Main User Profile or Second User Profile?
13:28:02 <strcat> theultron[m]: profiles can't access each other's data, the owner profile isn't special in that regard
13:28:05 <byolog[m]> But at least they stop tracking
13:28:09 <strcat> byolog[m]: no, they don't
13:28:54 <strcat> byolog[m]: as I said above, I'd seriously question whether you are making yourself better off rather than worse off especially when you don't seem to understand what you're doing - you've been given the feeling that the effort you're putting in to customizing your browser is making you better off
13:28:58 <strcat> that's a feeling you have
13:29:02 <strcat> it doesn't mean you are better off
13:29:12 <theultron[m]> <strcat "theultron: profiles can't access"> Excellent. Thanks!
13:29:30 <strcat> byolog[m]: how do you think it stops tracking? and define what you mean by tracking
13:29:41 <strcat> byolog[m]: it certainly does not stop tracking, sorry
13:30:39 <strcat> and if your goal is obtaining real privacy/anonymity then standing out from everyone else with your own very custom setup with your own custom whitelists/blacklists (which sites can see) is counterproductive
13:30:57 <strcat> sites can see what you've blocked/allowed
13:31:17 <strcat> blocking third party assets / connections *client-side* also really does not mean those third parties don't get the data
13:31:32 <byolog[m]> I'm really new with privacy but that's what I thought about the add-ons like ublock origin and umatrix are to stop big companies from tacking me.
13:31:59 <strcat> no, they strip out lots of low hanging fruit but also create their own problems
13:32:09 <strcat> they are not a viable way to stop yourself from being tracked
13:32:28 <strcat> if you want to avoid being tracked you need anonymity not stripping out some low-hanging fruit while making yourself more unique/trackable
13:33:25 <strcat> you can't achieve privacy by making a completely unique setup with your own unique set of addons, whitelist/blacklist rules, etc.
13:34:10 <strcat> all you're doing is stripping out obvious, known tracking-related connections *that are not integrated into the functionality of the site* since they can't remove things that would break the site
13:34:23 <strcat> really don't see how you can think you're avoiding tracking by doing that
13:34:46 <byolog[m]> I'm trying to do what I find in privacytools website, they recommend firefox with some add-ons.
13:34:46 <alzxjm[m]> byolog: I recommend you read the GrapheneOS [FAQ page](https://grapheneos.org/faq)
13:34:46 <alzxjm[m]> > GrapheneOS leaves these set to the standard four URLs to blend into the crowd of billions of other Android devices with and without Google Mobile Services performing the same empty GET requests. For privacy reasons, it isn't desirable to stand out from the crowd and changing these URLs or even disabling the feature will likely reduce your privacy by giving your device a more unique fingerprint. GrapheneOS aims to
13:34:46 <alzxjm[m]> appear like any other common mobile device on the network.
13:34:58 <alzxjm[m]> It has lots of really great stuff
13:34:59 <strcat> byolog[m]: it's not good advice
13:35:12 <byolog[m]> Ok I'll do now
13:35:37 <alzxjm[m]> If you don't want to be tracked then you should ask yourself how to (a) remove unique identifiers (such as your IP) and (b) blend in with lots of other people.
13:36:01 <alzxjm[m]> GrapheneOS takes measures to appear identical to millions of other Android phones, which endeavors to solve (b).
13:36:06 <byolog[m]> <alzxjm[m] "If you don't want to be tracked "> By using VPN!
13:36:15 <strcat> your best bet is safari on an iphone either without a content blocker or with one of the most popular couple ones (but it'll make you more unique) + a very popular VPN (with their standard DNS)
13:36:25 <alzxjm[m]> You can think about helping (a) by using a VPN and thus sharing an IP address with lots of other people.
13:37:21 <strcat> other than that the least bad thing you can do is use Vanadium if you're on GrapheneOS
13:37:30 <strcat> there aren't enough GrapheneOS users though
13:37:43 <strcat> but using anything else is just going to make you stand out more
13:37:57 <alzxjm[m]> byolog: If you are new to privacy/security, as you claim to be, you can save yourself and the devs in this room a lot of time/energy by reading through the official GrapheneOS website and searching in the graphene subreddit.
13:39:12 <byolog[m]> Ok thank you.
13:39:27 <cdesai> strcat[m]: does upstream use different trichrome targets now? trying to figure out what they're building now
13:39:54 <byolog[m]> But what kind of questions I can ask in this room then?
13:39:57 <strcat[m]> cdesai: I assume they use the ones without 6432 at the end
13:40:08 <strcat[m]> cdesai: but maybe they do use 6432 in some cases now
13:40:15 <cdesai> there was https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/07/03/chrome-for-android-is-finally-going-64-bit/
13:40:17 <strcat[m]> orbischlorbi: importing contacts in the app
13:40:35 <strcat[m]> cdesai:  how is your build going
13:40:59 <cdesai> strcat[m]: about to start, just need to know what target to build, updating stock
13:41:00 <strcat[m]> cdesai:  btw seems the issue happens when aapt generates resources
13:41:11 <strcat[m]> to input to bundletool
13:41:12 <strcat[m]> so it's really an error from aapt
13:41:20 <cdesai> yeah
13:41:27 <strcat[m]> cdesai: well 6432 variants of each is the 64-bit preferred mode
13:41:33 <strcat[m]> so if they are using 64-bit preferred that's the right set of targets
13:41:38 <strcat[m]> I don't know what they ship
13:41:40 <cdesai> I couldn't spot anything in your resource patches (the smaller ones atleast)
13:41:50 <strcat[m]> cdesai: they might still use 32-bit webview processes though don't know
13:42:04 <strcat[m]> cdesai: could be something screwed up by the automated string rebranding don't know
13:42:10 <strcat[m]> it takes me so long to build a clean build atm
13:42:15 <strcat[m]> I need a new workstation
13:42:19 <strcat[m]> I can't really productively resolve this
13:42:21 <cdesai> takes 1h here
13:42:25 <strcat[m]> really need help
13:44:08 <cdesai> strcat[m]: http://www.lenovo.com/p620 if you can tolerate a prebuilt system
13:44:47 <alzxjm[m]> <byolog[m] "But what kind of questions I can"> I invited you to a good room to ask non-GrapheneOS privacy/security questions.
13:44:53 <strcat[m]> No I will just build one but it's difficult right now
13:58:36 <strcat[m]> orbischlorbi: are you on GrapheneOS
13:58:43 <strcat[m]> open the contacts app
13:58:46 <strcat[m]> press import
13:58:49 <strcat[m]> select vcf file
13:59:24 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you aren't on GrapheneOS
13:59:48 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I think they're still using the same targets, they added expected manifest files and I get a different certDigest
14:00:00 <cdesai> trichrome_webview_apk trichrome_chrome_bundle
14:03:18 <strcat[m]> cdesai: I doubt it because those still use is_64_bit_browser = false
14:03:46 <cdesai> chrome 84 beta is still 32-bit
14:03:59 <cdesai> that androidpolice link / issue mentions 85 as the switch
14:04:04 <strcat[m]> orbischlorbi: where do you see any mention of a Google account
14:04:05 <strcat[m]> in the phone app?
14:04:14 <strcat[m]> because these apps do support arbitrary accounts
14:04:21 <strcat[m]> you can install apps providing accounts
14:04:26 <strcat[m]> and use them via contacts, etc.
14:04:42 <strcat[m]> but I'm curious where you see a mention of the option to use a Google account
14:04:50 <strcat[m]> because there isn't support for that included
14:05:11 <strcat[m]> orbischlorbi: it said *Google* account?
14:05:19 <strcat[m]> 'add account' does not mean Google
14:05:53 <strcat[m]> it means any type of account providing contact sync
14:05:58 <strcat[m]> via an app implementing the API
14:06:06 <strcat[m]> did you see something that actually said Google?
14:06:10 <strcat[m]> or you're assuming that
14:06:15 <strcat[m]> I want to know if there is wording that has to be fixed
14:06:23 <strcat[m]> somewhere
14:06:45 <strcat[m]> orbischlorbi: where
14:07:25 <strcat[m]> yeah so I click phone
14:07:38 <strcat[m]> click add a favorite
14:07:42 <strcat[m]> click create new contact
14:08:11 <strcat[m]> "Take a minute to add an account that will backup your contacts."
14:08:17 <strcat[m]> "Cancel" "Add account"
14:08:21 <strcat[m]> it doesn't say Google
14:08:41 <strcat[m]> clicking add account without installing some contacts sync app doesn't do anything
14:08:49 <strcat[m]> if you install one it'll do it via that
14:10:28 <strcat[m]> cdesai: no luck figuring this out
14:10:44 <strcat[m]> I'll try building without my changing
14:10:52 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I'm building the default targets
14:10:54 <strcat[m]>  * I'll try building without my changes
14:11:16 <strcat[m]> trying to build unmodified tag
14:11:19 <strcat[m]> still 6432
14:11:48 <strcat[m]> orbischlorbi: I don't think it says Google anywhere
14:12:16 <strcat[m]> orbischlorbi: ah wait maybe you use a non-English locale?
14:12:40 <strcat[m]> we only change strings in English
14:12:40 <cdesai> trichrome_{chrome_bundle,library_apk,webview_apk}
14:12:43 <cdesai> this is what I'm building
14:13:15 <strcat[m]> ninja -C out/Default/ trichrome_webview_64_32_apk trichrome_chrome_64_32_bundle trichrome_library_64_32_apk
14:13:20 <strcat[m]> is what I'm trying
14:13:28 <strcat[m]> just without my changes
14:13:37 <strcat[m]> it's what I usually build
14:14:22 <strcat[m]> orbischlorbi: yeah we don't update those strings
14:14:36 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Contacts/commit/fc73ecf4390962e9313739b9ea8e4916481d8fa3
14:14:49 <strcat[m]> don't know what to do about that aside from removing translations
14:15:15 <strcat[m]> it's too hard to maintain changes to more than english
15:21:23 <strcat[m]> orbischlorbi:  it's not maintainable to do translations
15:21:31 <strcat[m]> there's nothing hard about it we just need to drop translations
15:22:00 <strcat[m]> maybe just disable the other locales because we can't support that
15:34:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): we shouldn't disable the other locales
15:34:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "there's nothing hard about it we"> It is better to leave a few strings not translated
15:34:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Didn't mean to quite that
15:35:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Disabling other locales will just mean people who are not great at English won't use the ROM
15:43:29 <strcat[m]> there is no process for translations
15:43:34 <strcat[m]> we can't do translations
15:43:36 <strcat[m]> we can't maintain that
15:43:48 <strcat[m]> when we rebase onto a new release or add strings ourselves what are we supposed to do?
15:44:16 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: well the issue is that when we change a string in English it doesn't change it for the locales we don't touch
15:44:31 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: if we had a simple way to disable the translations from being used for that string that would be good
15:44:41 <strcat[m]> don't want to edit 100 files removing the translated string
15:44:51 <strcat[m]> and then have to deal with that for each rebase onto new versions
15:45:01 <strcat[m]> it will have conflicts every time in most files
15:45:40 <cdesai> strcat[m]: same error here
15:46:01 <cdesai> and I only have one string patch
15:46:30 <cdesai> and that's basically your old s/Chrome/Chromium/ in two places
15:46:54 <cdesai> upstream bug? i was trying to find it ci.chromium.org would have build logs for this release/build
16:10:15 <strcat[m]> cdesai: well it's good it isn't caused by our changes
16:10:22 <strcat[m]> too frustrated to work on this more atm
16:10:26 <strcat[m]> been trying to add debugging to aapt
16:10:31 <strcat[m]> don't want to deal with it anymore
16:11:00 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I'm trying to do the same,
16:16:28 <cdesai> why is this so complicated :(
16:39:32 <strcat[m]> cdesai: bundles D:
16:55:22 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> Is 5G possible with pixel 3a?
17:02:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: just
17:02:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Make a chrome public apk as a workaround?
17:02:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless you don't like that solution
17:02:56 <g65434-2[m]> yxcvbnmlp:  nah
17:05:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: that isn't a solution
17:05:24 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: and we can't do that
17:05:36 <strcat[m]> we need to provide both the browser and WebView with the modern target API level
17:05:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay
17:05:41 <strcat[m]> this needs to be resolved
17:06:03 <strcat[m]> help is needed to get this dealt with ASAP
17:07:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will check
17:07:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Right now somehow got in touch with the guy who put the SCS patch. Trying to fix kpti in r-preview kernel
17:08:11 <cdesai> there was a r-beta2 tag pushed earlier today
17:09:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh god
17:09:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need to rebase again then?
17:09:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Need to rebase again then
17:31:57 <crabman[m]> Can you connect to hidden SSID?  I can not seem to do it.
17:33:11 <anonymouserobot[> <crabman[m] "Can you connect to hidden SSID? "> I've had no issues
17:35:21 <crabman[m]> <anonymouserobot[ "I've had no issues"> Even after connecting to visible SSID, then hiding SSID, the connection dicsonnects on when the SSID hides.

18:23:46 <crabman[m]> @SchismXL  Thanks.
18:30:04 <cdesai> strcat[m]: doing a enable_resource_whitelist_generation=true build.
18:40:08 <strcat[m]> cdesai: afaik I'm already doing that?
18:40:10 <strcat[m]> isn't it the default with official build etc
18:40:30 <cdesai> ah didn't notice
18:40:43 <cdesai> I was going through the aapt code and this showed up
18:41:19 <cdesai> trying to get aapt to print what resource it's failing at
18:53:08 <hiya> How do some of the apps detect unlocked bootloader and state the device as rooted? Even if it is not.
18:54:04 <cn3m[m]> here is an article on how Snapchat does it(one sec)
18:54:39 <cn3m[m]> https://t.co/fy9EWnjfBM
18:55:52 <cn3m[m]> hiya: there are many ways to do this
18:55:59 <cn3m[m]> this goes over a lot
19:16:44 <hiya> cn3m[m]: I see. So, basically locking the bootloader is the way to go?
20:06:28 <cdesai> strcat[m]: it's an anim resource id 0x7f010001 if my logs are right.
20:07:54 <cdesai> TrichromeChrome.aab.R.txt:int anim abc_fade_out 0x7f010001
20:08:06 <cdesai> but I'm not sure what to do next or if this is even the bug.
21:28:11 <jknsec[m]> A bit off topic but are there any links to further resources as the issues with the Linux kernel and desktop security model, including Daniel's sources if any?

21:34:03 <cn3m[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html madaidan has a ton of sources here and the previously listed articles I think he did excellent research on those

21:35:35 <jknsec[m]> Thanks
21:42:32 <jappie03> Hey i installed grapheneos. When my phone restarts i enter my 6 digit pin code on my lockscreen. That is the bootloader right? After entering the code its unlocked?
21:49:20 <overheadscallop[> jappie03: That's not the bootloader. When you're at the lockscreen that means the OS has already been loaded
21:50:21 <overheadscallop[> you get into the bootloader by powering off, then holding the power + volume down keys
21:52:17 <strcat[m]> cdesai: any luck yet?
21:52:25 <cdesai> strcat[m]: nope :(
22:58:15 <jappie03> Anyone experienced in GrapheneOs and just general phone security who could join me in a private chat? Just having some rookie questions that i wanna be sure about. Will pay for it good ;)
