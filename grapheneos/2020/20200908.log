06:21:59 <Autopsy[m]> <dazinism "If its booting with verified boo"> Worked for me when I had WiFi memory leaks, that caused the phone to crash every time I tried to turn on WiFi, a couple of months ago.
07:35:07 <dazinism> Autopsy: interesting, my guess is that something you did post install changed something that caused this. Had you tried a device reset first (if so I'm a bit surprised / confused)
07:39:04 <dazinism> Only thing I can think of that I've heard thats caused something to be different is when someone had flashed a beta of Android R
07:39:32 <dazinism> Think they ended up with some newer firmware somewhere
07:40:25 <dazinism> Which made Auditor fail on Audits
07:42:21 <dazinism> GrapheneOS installation/updates should give you the latest stable firmware on components - but can't necessarily downgrade if they've already have a alpha/beta firmware upgrade.
07:45:03 <dazinism> There a chance I'm misunderstanding something, but thats currently how I think it all works on the Pixels....
07:49:23 <cn3m[m]> dazinism: you can't downgrade a beta build unless the stable is newer
07:49:26 <cn3m[m]> you are correct
07:49:50 <cn3m[m]> it has to do with what is signed
07:50:06 <cn3m[m]> if something older was signed as newer it would work ofc
07:54:57 <Autopsy[m]> <dazinism "Autopsy: interesting, my guess i"> Nope, didn't do anything whatsoever. Followed the guide on the website and I was getting memory leaks. I then updated to the latest Google Stock and then reflashed GrapheneOS and it has been fine since. I did try a device reset, but it didn't help - I was still getting memory leaks.
07:56:53 <Autopsy[m]> I didn't even set any private DNS settings. It was just crashing. Anyways, that was two months ago
08:17:20 <dazinism> Interesting. You mean it was doing this on a fresh install of the latest GrapheneOS?
08:18:28 <dazinism> (latest at the time)
08:20:04 <dazinism> Autopsy And you reflashed with the same factory image?
08:21:39 <Autopsy[m]> Yep, all on fresh install and yeah it was the exact same factory image (I did download another one, but I checked the hashes, signified it and it was fine).
08:22:06 <dazinism> Oh.... wonder what happened there then
08:22:16 <Autopsy[m]> The ONLY thing I did differently was: the first time, I updated to latest Google Stock on OTA. Second time, I used their website installer.
08:59:55 <dazinism> You used https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/flash ?
09:00:18 <dazinism> Or you mean you downloaded a factory image from them?
09:01:33 <dazinism> Or the Pixel Repair Tool ?(possibly only works in the US - although guess you could fool it with a VPN)?
09:01:54 <dazinism> https://pixelrepair.withgoogle.com/
09:40:32 <Autopsy[m]> dazinism using this site https://developers.google.com/android/images you can flash through the browser. This is for coral: https://flash.android.com/welcome?continue=%2Fbuild%2F5831595%3Ftarget%3Dcoral-user%26signed%3D
09:41:58 <Autopsy[m]> * dazinism using this site https://developers.google.com/android/images you can follow the links to flash through the browser (you can also download the files from there, too). Following the "flash" link for your specific device, you can flash stock Google straight onto a Pixel or Nexus devices. This is for coral: https://flash.android.com/welcome?continue=%2Fbuild%2F5831595%3Ftarget%3Dcoral-user%26signed%3D
09:42:50 <Autopsy[m]> So yeah, Android flash tool
10:00:18 <belay_that_order> trying to flash grapheneos on pixel 3a, booting it into fastboot and all commands from my pc to phone return as failed, immediately. the phone is visible to pc in fastboot, fastboot ver 30, oem unlocked, usb debugging turned on, but i cannot get to the step where i have the bootloader unlocked, and i assume i will not be able to flash anything on it as well. advice?
10:00:37 <belay_that_order> i dont live in USA, device was bought from one store selling electronics, didnt come with any plan etc. BUT, my device does have ONLY ONE IMEI when i go for barcode readout. does that mean it's still a blocked version?
10:04:49 <dazinism> belay_that_order: you managed to flip the OEM unlocking toggle in developer options?
10:05:02 <belay_that_order> <dazinism "belay_that_order: you managed to"> i managed
10:05:11 <belay_that_order> the thing is that it's behaving as if i didn't
10:05:32 <dazinism> I would suggest trying different usb lead or port
10:06:02 <belay_that_order> even though i am able to transfer files via this lead and port, and give commands via adb?
10:06:44 <dazinism> Yeah I think its definitely worth trying that still
10:08:01 <dazinism> Think fastboot is a bit more demanding on all the usb stuff being right than adb or file transfers
10:09:14 <dazinism> If your using usb C to USB C, try A - C
10:09:52 <dazinism> Often usb C isnt set up correctly in PCs
10:09:55 <belay_that_order> i did try, but it wasnt even visible to my os
10:10:06 <dazinism> Try what?
10:10:17 <belay_that_order> do you have any bullet proof cables to susggest?
10:10:18 <belay_that_order> try another cable
10:10:32 <belay_that_order> it was a - c
10:11:23 <dazinism> If you can try different cable(s).  Also different port(s)
10:11:44 <dazinism> Maybe even try and flash from a different computer
10:12:27 <belay_that_order> ok, that would be a much softer solution than having to change a phone
10:12:33 <belay_that_order> do you have any bullet proof cables to suggest?
10:13:15 <dazinism> I've had success with the cable that came in the box from Google
10:13:45 <dazinism> Which was a - c
10:13:59 <dazinism> Sorry no I lie
10:14:12 <dazinism> That was c-c
10:14:36 <dazinism> I used a genuine anker a-c (there are bootlegs about)
10:15:53 <Autopsy[m]> <belay_that_order "do you have any bullet proof cab"> Official Sony ones, USB A to C have worked for me. The one from the box didn't work.
10:16:19 <belay_that_order> <Autopsy[m] "Official Sony ones, USB A to C h"> have a link handy?
10:16:57 <Autopsy[m]> Mine came in an Xperia box, so no.
10:17:10 <dazinism> To try and ensure I got genuine Anker I bought off them via Amazon.
10:17:11 <Autopsy[m]> But why genuine Sony one should be fine.
10:17:29 <Autopsy[m]> Anker are top quality too tbh
10:18:49 <dazinism> Recently got a genuine usb a - c adaptor from ebay as my friends 2 year old magicked my original into a different dimension
10:19:08 <dazinism> Of course the new one isnt genuine
10:19:34 <dazinism> And doesn't work with my usb key (so no seedvault backups)
10:19:58 <dazinism> üò†
10:20:10 <Autopsy[m]> üéª
10:23:35 <dazinism> But I hear Amazon dont really care about bootlegs. Hopefully getting one sold via Anker on Amazon would mean you get an original...
10:31:48 <belay_that_order> thank you all for your inputs
10:44:00 <dazinism> Maybe anker a-c via eBay is my next move....
10:44:25 <dazinism> I mean via amazon
10:48:17 <belay_that_order> dazinism: yeah looking it up now
10:55:33 <cdesai> do you have another phone?
10:55:48 <cdesai> try flash.android.com via that - it'll unlock the phone
10:58:15 <belay_that_order> i dont actually have another phone
10:58:44 <belay_that_order> i am going to go with a cable first, as i am afraid that after unlocking, flashing of the image might go wrong
11:08:07 <Autopsy[m]> <belay_that_order "i am going to go with a cable fi"> It won't
11:56:56 <lickidysplit[m]> Thanks to the devs for the custom ROM üëç just wondering when the 3aXL should expect the next security update?
11:59:01 <Autopsy[m]> <lickidysplit[m] "Thanks to the devs for the custo"> Something something it's not a ROM, it's an OS. Secondly, when it's ready.
12:06:31 <kkkkk> are pro's on device porting to graphene OS ?
12:07:07 <kkkkk> I have a device and all the sources (mtk based), would pay for the effort of course
12:08:41 <jpds> Logs from two days ago in this channel have: "MTK devices are a security nightmare would be a waste of time"
12:18:53 * rip_mca[m] uploaded an image: screenshot flash-all_bat.PNG (22KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QKLLCKAyJRCKeVCzGZNdHdsz/screenshot flash-all_bat.PNG >
12:20:44 <rip_mca[m]> I cant flash GrapheneOS in my Pixel 3a XL. Everything works fine but the flashing itself. Any ideas
12:22:55 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> <rip_mca[m] "I cant flash GrapheneOS in my Pi"> Follow the instructions and you're good to go. Download the link given in that instructions.
12:24:08 <rip_mca[m]> I strictly followed the instructions in the GrapheneOS Website.
12:24:16 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> Everything should run the latest version. Your Pixel OS.
12:26:10 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> You should check Techlore's video for GrapheneOS Error installation.
12:27:49 <aeonsolution[m]> rip_mca: that's not powershell
12:28:13 <aeonsolution[m]> follow the instructions on the website, and put a thumbs down on whatever video you used
12:28:56 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
12:30:15 <aeonsolution[m]> since you are not setting fastboot on the path, if you open new windows that don't have the path to it set, it will not appear
12:30:31 <aeonsolution[m]> so dont open new windows while following the steps on the website
12:40:10 <Autopsy[m]> This is what I said before about the documentation
12:42:55 <Autopsy[m]> Download platform-tools to downloads. Extract it. In terminal (or PowerShell) type $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path" in the actual downloads folder, NOT in the platform-tools folder.
12:45:20 <Autopsy[m]> When I get home, I'm gonna write a GrapheneOS Installation for Dummies lol
13:16:17 <kkkkk> jpds, by default that may be the case, but replacing the aosp to graphene is a step in the right direction
13:16:40 <kkkkk> the rest of the security will be replaced too
13:18:57 <jpds> kkkkk: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200906#c5012781
13:19:57 <kkkkk> yeah that was me actually
13:28:26 <rip_mca[m]> Thanks for your help. The hint with Powershell was the solution!!!
13:28:47 <rip_mca[m]> The rest was easy
13:33:34 <kmart> jpds, are you good with device porting ?
14:27:05 <renex> Could someone enlighten me about GrapheneOS and filesystem encryption. When I recently installed GOS I just gave a pattern to unlock the phone. Now when I look in settings the phone tells me that it is encrypted. But I wonder if there is enough entropy in that pattern. Could I have one strong password to unlock the phone at boot and a simpler
14:27:06 <renex> pattern to unlock the screen?
14:29:19 <renex> Also could I have an other pattern that would encrypt the filesystem, i.e. one would have to enter the strong password again?
14:30:05 <sad_plan[m]> Realisticly, how much do I gain by switching to graphene, from omni when Im already using only foss apps? Apart from the obvious security enhancements that is..
14:30:28 <critik> ... is privacy ;) no google services!
14:31:10 <sad_plan[m]> No gapps C:
14:35:32 <kmart> anyone here who would port graphene for money ? :(
14:37:20 <jacktheclipper[m> <renex "Could someone enlighten me about"> The real encryption key is on the Titan chip. The pattern only unlocks that chip.
14:37:58 <renex> Titan chip?
14:40:12 <jacktheclipper[m> Titan M is the full name. Basically it is a separate chip that stores the encryption key for the phone. This article explains it better than I can: https://www.wired.com/story/google-titan-m-security-chip-pixel-3/
14:40:33 <renex> Ok, thanks
14:42:34 <jacktheclipper[m> When you change your screen PIN or pattern, the actual encryption keys do not change (re-encypting the phone would take a long time) but because it is really hard to access the tiny Titan M chip the encryption keys are still safe.
15:14:29 <adsfasf> I have been thinking about getting a pixel and installing graphene. In my search, I came across the following site https://freedomphones.net/ which offers graphene preinstalled on a pixel and am curious if they are known in the graphene community?
15:16:05 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Price tax too expensive
15:16:15 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> And not affiliated to GrapheneOS in any way
15:16:21 <adsfasf> Ok. Thanks.
15:16:47 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Not sure if they even donate such price tax, we can just offer to help you flash it
15:17:33 <cdesai> "Can I have you pre-load some of the secure apps on my phone before shipping so I can use them right out of the box?"
15:17:41 <cdesai> That is also not good
15:18:07 <adsfasf> There is a premium. I am just beginning my research but I would have to buy a used phone and then install it. I don't yet have a sense of what the risks of bricking the phone are if I were to install it myself.
15:18:48 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <cdesai ""Can I have you pre-load some of"> Yeah, it's probably modified too
15:19:05 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <adsfasf "There is a premium. I am just be"> Well, bricking risks is next to nonexistent
15:19:14 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Due to A/B partition scheme
15:19:15 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Iirc?
15:19:30 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> (Somebody needs to confirm this)
15:20:10 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <adsfasf "There is a premium. I am just be"> Not much of a risk if you ask me. Make sure you either have a usb C port, or have a working A to C cable
15:20:31 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> And also just reading the instructions properly
15:20:44 <adsfasf> Thanks.
15:23:46 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> You're welcome
15:25:33 <adsfasf> Since I would have to purchase a phone, my inclination would be to go with a Pixel 4 or Pixel 4XL with 128 gig. Is this reasonable?
15:26:16 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <adsfasf "Since I would have to purchase a"> Yes
15:26:28 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Depends on your needs and budget but yeah
15:28:46 <adsfasf> Thank you for your help!
16:03:22 <ninjahmeh> Love the project
16:03:31 <ninjahmeh> :)
16:26:09 <ninjahmeh> Is there a specific area of focus for development at the moment for the os?
16:46:31 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Probably android 11
17:03:25 <ThomCat[m]> Which just dropped today
17:03:30 <ThomCat[m]> https://blog.google/products/android/android-11/
17:27:23 <kickstart> i would like to say thank you
17:27:26 <kickstart> really
17:27:49 <kickstart> my pixel 4 not XL stayed for almost 10 days on stand by with 4g on
17:28:02 <kickstart> only graphene preinstalled apps
17:36:15 <a0e0e753> Has anyone tried algo vpn on graphene (https://github.com/trailofbits/algo)?
17:36:36 <faxing[m]> So when approximately is GrapheneOS getting Android 11?
17:37:45 <jpds> a0e0e753: It just uses other open-source VPN tooling like WireGuard and IPsec
17:38:10 <a0e0e753> Exactly
17:38:24 <a0e0e753> So it should not be a problem
17:38:29 <jpds> Not at all
17:38:33 <a0e0e753> Great!
17:58:45 <ninjahmeh> What are people finding is the best use of the camera on graphene? Open camera do a good job at things and what are peoples thoughts on the use of Google camera within graphene? Does that then nullify too much of what graphene brings to justify its use?
18:05:43 <ninjahmeh> Saying that as a pixel 3 user who does quite like the quality and features of the stock camera etc
18:06:13 <strcat[m]> faxing: the source code hasn't even been pushed for AOSP yet
18:06:38 <strcat[m]> faxing: in general, we don't offer timelines for development, but you're asking for a timeline for something that couldn't have even started development yet
18:07:15 <strcat[m]> if you want it to happen soon you should work on it
18:09:40 <strcat[m]> AOSP support has to be brought up for each device along with porting all of the GrapheneOS changes to the new Android 11 tags (that are not yet available)
18:09:51 <strcat[m]> devices without maintainers / developers to do the porting work will be dropped
18:10:03 <strcat[m]> features that aren't ported will go away
18:10:58 <strcat[m]> so it's likely the Pixel 2 will be dropped this month, and perhaps other devices, and many features will probably be dropped, only what people are interested in keeping will be kept
18:11:02 <ninjahmeh> Having used stock 9 on my OG pixel and 10 on my newly acquired pixel 3 which iv just jumped onto beta channel 11 preview doesn't feel like a huge amount of features are there that make it that intriguing yet
18:12:02 <strcat[m]> that's not really relevant
18:12:12 <strcat[m]> migrating to Android 11 is important and time sensitive
18:12:16 <ninjahmeh> Oh for sure
18:12:45 <strcat[m]> if the project lacked the resources to do it quickly, it would be discontinued because it would no longer be providing something useful or sensible to use
18:13:08 <ninjahmeh> <3
18:13:21 <strcat[m]> it's possible that going forward not as many devices can be supported since there aren't maintainers for most
18:13:40 <strcat[m]> and most features will initially be lost to keep things going
18:13:42 <strcat[m]> help wanted
18:15:49 <strcat[m]> I haven't decided if there will be another release based on Android 10, I don't think there are the resources to do that
18:16:11 <strcat[m]> so development will be fully focused on bringing up the new version of the OS based on Android 11
18:16:40 <strcat[m]> definitely not going to be a timeline or a clear idea of which devices will be supported going forward
18:16:45 <ninjahmeh> Well up until the other day I was just on an OG pixel and once I got a chance to make a bit of an upgrade financially found a great deal on a pixel 3 (¬£190 boxed in basically new condition) I would like to try and help on that front. Not to say I am streaks ahead on the knowledge front but have had experience over the years with custom ROM stuff and testing stuff in early stages etc.
18:17:24 <strcat[m]> atm not much that can be worked on yet since it's still in the process of being released
18:17:34 <strcat[m]> other than what could have already been worked on based on the earlier previews
18:17:34 <ninjahmeh> For sure
18:18:02 <strcat[m]> most devices don't have maintainers so there weren't people doing the preparation work
18:18:06 <ninjahmeh> I didn't even realise it was now into the wild having just got the beta 3 build to have a nose around
18:19:23 <strcat[m]> it was possible to get the kernels ported based on the beta tags along with getting android-prepare-vendor ready
18:19:29 <faxing[m]> Well if I knew coding then I'd help but I can't code.
18:19:39 <strcat[m]> unfortunately there is not much interest in contributing like that
18:19:56 <strcat[m]> so please do not expect a quick turnaround when the preparation work that was needed is incomplete and most devices lack maintainers
18:20:05 <faxing[m]> and by the time I learned how to, and to a standard of the project, it very well may be useless at that point.
18:20:44 <strcat[m]> my time and energy is currently focused on dealing with attacks being made on the project and myself by malicious people
18:20:50 <strcat[m]> so I'm not focused on development right now
18:20:59 <strcat[m]> not the priority for me
18:21:12 <strcat[m]> there are other people that started working on the preparation work for porting
18:21:30 <strcat[m]> they need more help working on that especially if it's going to get finished any time soon
18:21:39 <Ultron[m]> <strcat[m] "my time and energy is currently "> Where those attacks are being made? I meant on an online forum or something?
18:21:51 <strcat[m]> that's not what I'm talking about
18:22:03 <strcat[m]> I suggest reading the history section on the site for some background
18:22:14 <strcat[m]> read past logs here
18:22:20 <strcat[m]> not going to go through all of it for you sorry
18:22:38 <Ultron[m]> I am aware of the Copperhead - Graphene situation.
18:23:39 <Ultron[m]> I remember we had some trollers here in matrix in last month posting gore stuff.
18:24:49 <strcat[m]> I've been up all night working on stuff so I'm about to finally go to sleep and when I wake up hopefully the new tags will be pushed and I can start directing people who are interested in working on it
18:27:28 <ninjahmeh> The situation on that front sounded like horse crap. Always seems to be the case on good ideas by good people getting dragged into a whole mess that could have basically been avoided and so on. Seen similar albeit less overt things happen between Foss community members on custom ROM stuff in the past and just found it all a bit saddening
18:30:42 <ninjahmeh> Sadly the world we live in makes those situations more frequent and often times more dramatic/detrimental than they really need to get. Props to you for the project though. Piqued my interest just based on the ethos along with the ease of installation so far etc. Lot more straight forward than was expecting when I started out
18:44:12 <i_am_your_device> I have a pixel 4a and would like to be a guinea pig for the Android 11 version of GrapheneOS. Is there somewhere I can be contacted if someone needs me to test features etc?
18:44:30 <bob52> hi
18:44:46 <bob52> I don't know what the following statement means. Please tell me.
18:44:55 <bob52> Avoid using hidden APs (i.e. APs not broadcasting their SSID) since known hidden SSIDs end up being broadcast to find them again. SSIDs are not broadcast for standard non-hidden APs.
18:45:07 <bob52> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy-scanning
18:46:06 <jpds> bob52: Don't use hidden WiFi points
18:47:28 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <i_am_your_device "I have a pixel 4a and would like"> well, there is no work yet there to begin with
18:48:00 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <i_am_your_device "I have a pixel 4a and would like"> Well, the patches and some features have to be ported first and the OS has to be built
18:48:36 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Maybe if you are willing to try learn how to port and build an OS, perhaps you can  test it yourself
18:49:00 <bob32> no
18:49:13 <bob32> look it
18:49:14 <bob32> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy-scanning
18:49:28 <bob32> wut is it mean?
18:49:28 <bob32> Avoid using hidden APs (i.e. APs not broadcasting their SSID) since known hidden SSIDs end up being broadcast to find them again. SSIDs are not broadcast for standard non-hidden APs.
18:50:09 <bob32> I don't understand the above explanation.
18:50:27 <jpds> bob32: It's saying to never connect to a non-broadcast access point, as every time you go somewhere your device will call out looking for that access point
18:50:45 <i_am_your_device> d64qoc8432li8p9o Is there any work on 4a at all? Even Android 10? I know how to build images and have a lot of programming (javascript) experience but I don't know too much about the android ecosystem. Is there an example (or better yet a git diff) that shows you what's needed to add a new device? :S
18:51:50 <bob32> What is a broadcast access point?
18:52:34 <jpds> bob32: Any WiFi point that's not displayed when you open the WiFi list
18:53:02 <jpds> bob32: You can still connect to hidden WiFi networks by manually entering their name
18:53:16 <jpds> bob32: If you've never done this - it is not a problem for you
18:53:41 <bob32> I see. Haven't you seen him in town?

18:54:13 <jpds> bob32: Not sure what you're asking
18:54:39 <dexlibre[m]> Anyone else have a hard time getting their laptop to see their pixel is plugged into it? Others phones work fine and I have USB debugging on
18:54:42 <i_am_your_device> Thanks, I will take a closer look and try to get something to build.
18:54:50 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <dexlibre[m] "Anyone else have a hard time get"> Is your phone locked?
18:54:58 <dexlibre[m]> Negative
18:54:59 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> When you plugged it
18:55:13 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Try replugging when unlocked
18:55:47 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> And check the security settings and make sure it's at default option
18:55:48 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> "allow new usb peripherals when unlocked"
18:55:55 <bob32> It's described in the wiki as something to be aware of when connecting to free wifi, but don't you see that kind of wifi? That's what I'm talking about.
18:56:27 <jpds> It's not about free WiFi points
18:57:28 <bob32> Huh? Do you have anything other than a wireless phone? Are you talking about tethering?
18:57:29 <dexlibre[m]> > <@d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix.org> And check the security settings and make sure it's at default option
18:57:29 <dexlibre[m]> > "allow new usb peripherals when unlocked"
18:57:29 <dexlibre[m]> Yeah it's set to that :(
18:57:47 <jpds> bob32: Do you know what an SSID is?
18:58:28 <jpds> Nevermind, I suppose you've never connected to a hidden WiFi network before
18:58:55 <bob32> yeah
18:58:58 <bob32> exactly
18:59:10 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <dexlibre[m] "> <@d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix"> Is this adb?
18:59:16 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Just asking
18:59:55 <jpds> bob32: It's a network that's there, but the admin has configured it to not be publicly listed in the WiFi list
19:00:21 <dexlibre[m]> <d64qoc8432li8p9o "Just asking"> I have adb on this laptop I'm trying to connect the pixel to. It shows up when I run adb devices
19:00:59 <bob32> That means don't enter the SSID manually to connect, right?
19:01:29 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <dexlibre[m] "I have adb on this laptop I'm tr"> It's working fine for me
19:01:32 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Not sure if it's port issues
19:01:35 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> On your side
19:01:52 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> (Like try cleaning the usb C port?)

19:25:08 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 is out
19:25:36 <inrdrna[m]> nice
19:25:42 <inrdrna[m]> rip fdroid ?
19:27:25 <cn3m[m]> They aren't using that API level yet
19:31:39 <bob32> Do you have opsec on irc?
19:32:19 <bob32> I've got an ip and propider exposed from my irc account.
19:32:56 <bob32> And now you can see that I'm using a riseup vpn.
19:33:31 <wa[]ge[m]> <cn3m[m] "Android 11 is out "> meanwhile my old galaxy is still on pie lol
19:36:21 <bob32> wa[]ge[m]: cn3m[m]inrdrna[m]  Why is the gateway to matrix.org hidden?
19:49:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hey
19:49:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Does anybody know where the R factory images are?
19:51:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nvm got it
19:51:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll start bringup now
19:54:11 <dazinism> FDroid finally have an issue up for moving to v2 / v3 sigs
19:55:01 <cdesai> we had discussed it, just didn't have an issue
19:55:23 <dazinism> Theres already some SDK30 apps on their repo
19:55:45 <dazinism> Yeah, I know....
19:56:24 <cdesai> I did have a warning put in for that, do you have an example
19:56:48 <cdesai> we do want to get it working soon, there's some other signing related changes going on too which should improve things overall.
19:56:48 <dazinism> Apparently won't be a load of work to get all the apps they build sign with v2 / v3
19:57:40 <dazinism> Appropriately  enough SDK Monitor
19:57:49 <dazinism> Also NetGuard
19:57:53 <dazinism> Both on SDK30
19:58:07 <cdesai> thanks
20:09:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Find it very funny that google needs to give fdroid a kick in the pants to get them to improve their processes
20:09:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even funnier that they still rely on sha1
20:39:00 <inrdrna[m]> yeah but when will they do it
20:40:57 <sandroteem[m]> Is there anyone here today who can tell me if I can verify an untrustworthy device with the Auditor App? Or can you only verify that the software has changed, but not if it is really GrapheneOS?
20:46:36 <pheonix3082[m]> anyone able to help? i have a fastboot too old error
20:50:59 <inrdrna[m]> pheonix3082: read the guide and download android-tools standalone
20:51:40 <pheonix3082[m]> i did that. i was using techlore to do the install too over powershell but it keeps returning me the error
20:52:26 <inrdrna[m]> why are you following a video when there is a very well, tested and up to date official guide ?
20:52:40 <inrdrna[m]>  * why are you following a video when there is a very good, tested and up to date official guide ?
20:53:22 <pheonix3082[m]> because the same error occure
20:53:29 <pheonix3082[m]> occurs rather

20:55:24 <cooperlead> Hello
20:55:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW
20:55:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Where's the R source?
20:56:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cooperlead "Hello"> strcat
20:56:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat
21:06:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> What a troll
21:09:27 <pheonix3082[m]> is anyone able to help?
21:10:02 <blueuser[m]> yea the problem is probably because you don't use the official guide
21:11:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh pheonix3082 if you want remote support I can do it
21:11:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> But you must decide fast. I have 30 mins at best
21:13:04 <pheonix3082[m]> blueuser: as ive said. I used it. thats the reason i used techlore. and im also using a windows system not mac or linux
21:13:39 <pheonix3082[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Tbh pheonix3082 if you want remo"> i appreciate that but no thankyou
21:13:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> K
21:18:45 <Autopsy[m]> <sandroteem[m] "?"> If you look on the release notes, you'll see what devices are supported
21:19:24 <Autopsy[m]> sandroteem https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.attestation.auditor is the easiest to see what is supported
21:20:07 <Autopsy[m]> pheonix3082 where are you getting stuck?
21:21:02 <Autopsy[m]> Fastboot too old, just read
21:22:14 <Autopsy[m]> pheonix3082 https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200908#c5031424
21:22:17 <pheonix3082[m]> <Autopsy[m] "pheonix3082 where are you gettin"> i click the flash-all.bat the command line flashes and does nothing. when i try o do it from inside the command line it tells me fastboot is too old. so i removed adb and reinstalled platform tool
21:22:49 <Autopsy[m]> Simple fix, don't sweat
21:23:54 <Autopsy[m]> So, open PowerShell as Administrator in your Downloads folder. NOT platform-tools. In the Downloads folder on PowerShell, type $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
21:24:14 <Autopsy[m]> And DO NOT close PowerShell. Ever.
21:24:45 <Autopsy[m]> Assuming the files are in your Downloads folder ^
21:24:58 <pheonix3082[m]> they are =]
21:25:51 <Autopsy[m]> I would also recommend NOT putting all the files in the platform-tools folder (I think that's what Techlore does in his video, iirc). Just extract them into their own folder.
21:26:31 <Autopsy[m]> <Autopsy[m] "So, open PowerShell as Administr"> Once you've done this... Run fastboot --version and see if it matches the most recent one you've downloaded.
21:27:05 <Autopsy[m]> <Autopsy[m] "I would also recommend NOT putti"> When I say all files, I mean the GrapheneOS files from the website.
21:27:30 <pheonix3082[m]> ok
21:27:54 <Autopsy[m]> So, in the Downloads folder, you should have..
21:28:23 <Autopsy[m]> A platform-tools folder and a folder for GrapheneOS.
21:29:36 <pheonix3082[m]> yes
21:30:45 <Autopsy[m]> Have you run the command in the downloads folder and verified using fastboot --version? $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
21:31:52 <Autopsy[m]> This is the trickiest part imo. Afterwards, the script does the rest for you.
21:36:34 <pheonix3082[m]> yes
21:36:44 <pheonix3082[m]> fastboot version is the same platform tools one ive downloaded
21:38:36 <Autopsy[m]> Excellent
21:38:39 <Autopsy[m]> Now, do not close PowerShell
21:39:07 <Autopsy[m]> You can now change the directory to where the GrapheneOS files are stored (the flash-all.bat file)
21:39:54 <Autopsy[m]> So, if you made a folder called GrapheneOS in Downloads and your PowerShell is in Downloads already, just type cd GrapheneOS and press enter.
21:40:02 <Autopsy[m]> Sorry if I'm teaching you to suck eggs, I don't know your level
21:40:31 <pheonix3082[m]> no thats ok. ive dealt with noobs for other things before lol
21:41:12 <Autopsy[m]> Nice one. So just run the .bat and you should be good to go.
21:41:47 <pheonix3082[m]> yay!
21:41:58 <pheonix3082[m]> thankyou very much =]
21:42:19 <Autopsy[m]> 99 times out of a 100, it is that step that people mess up on.
21:42:25 <Autopsy[m]> You're welcome
21:43:21 <Autopsy[m]> Now cross fingers you don't get stuck on "waiting for device". That'll mean your USB cable is shite and you'll need to try another port or try another cable.
21:43:51 <chimeyy[m]> Hey, Id like to swap to a grapheneos phone. the 3a is too huge for my taste and hands but the 4 is too expensive and lacks the headphone jack. Now when to expect support for the 4a? Would it be worth to get more money for the 4 or should i wait untill 4a will be supported? Thx
21:43:59 <pheonix3082[m]> hahaha. I luckily have decent wires
21:46:22 <Autopsy[m]> <chimeyy[m] "Hey, Id like to swap to a graphe"> At the mo, I believe there isn't a date set in stone. I haven't seen if anyone is currently building for the 4a (I know cdesai is doing it for CalyxOS, but not sure about GrapheneOS).
21:47:12 <cdesai> If anyone has a 4a and wants to help port, feel free to ping me for pointers
21:57:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: where's R source
21:58:52 <cdesai> Usual place
21:59:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Where
21:59:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Huh
21:59:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's there now
22:00:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Could have swore it wasn't
22:09:05 <sandroteem[m]> <Autopsy[m] "sandroteem https://play.google.c"> My question was not a support question. I try to understand what the protocol can ensure and what not.
22:10:24 <gonner11> hello folks.
22:10:32 <gonner11> Is project-fi pixel2 can be unlocked?
22:17:03 <cdesai> https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-prepare-vendor/issues/12
22:21:42 <gonner11> yes, so according to this and the website Pixel 2 is supported, legacy.
22:21:57 <gonner11> I can't unlock it following the instructions and I was wondering if that's a known issue
22:22:41 <gonner11> "fastboot flashing unlock" just says waiting on device. The cable works and I can mount the phone just fine when it boots in a regular manner
22:27:02 <gonner11> I turned on developer options as instructed, unlocked from the setting menu...
22:38:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> overheadscallop
22:38:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're up for testing my bs?
22:38:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll join you too on the weekend
23:16:14 <cdesai> if anybody wants to build AOSP R: https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2013092
23:16:14 <cdesai> once that's done, a port can start, piece by piece.
23:53:23 <overheadscallop[> anupritaisno1: Yeah, just message me whenever and I'll get around to it.
