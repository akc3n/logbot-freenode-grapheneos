00:05:02 <renlord> dont matrix K-line spammers?
00:06:22 <refragable[m]> They don't seem to respond very quickly to reports/flagged messages.
00:07:29 <refragable[m]> And due to the federated nature of the system, the spammers might use a homeserver where the admin doesn't care to remove them.
00:07:42 <renlord> sounds like a broken system to me
00:08:39 <cn3m[m]> renlord: federation means censorship is effectively impossible in a complete way
00:08:49 <cn3m[m]> that has some massive drawbacks
00:08:54 <alzxjm[m]> <refragable[m] "And due to the federated nature "> Looks like most of these guys were on matrix.org anyway.
00:09:03 <strcat[m]> we can probably ban home servers
00:09:04 <refragable[m]> the last one was using a different home server
00:09:27 <renlord> a federation can filter membership
00:09:29 <strcat[m]> because it's multiple people doing it on behalf of James
00:09:30 <strcat[m]> not one
00:09:33 <ShortRound[m]> Question:  I've had my pixel 3a xl for a couple of weeks now.  I just got a system update from the stable channel.  Is there some place I can learn about the changes in the update?
00:09:48 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
00:09:50 <refragable[m]> Short Round: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.08.03.22
00:09:54 <cn3m[m]> grapheneos.org/releases
00:09:58 <renlord> strcat[m]: the spam messages read as bots
00:10:06 <renlord> i doubt its multiple people
00:10:16 <renlord> he prolly paid a script kiddie on fiverr or some shit
00:10:16 <ShortRound[m]> strcat: refragable cn3m Thank you!
00:10:30 <strcat[m]> renlord: they were interacting with people though
00:12:36 <renlord> anyways, i can moderate quite actively when its daytime in my timezone
00:31:42 <YumekoJabamiIRL[> Saleh is weirding me out. Dude rejoins the room 20 times a day.
00:33:09 <YumekoJabamiIRL[> Also is there a good alternative to the Alltrails app?
00:36:38 <cn3m[m]> Saleh: hello?
00:36:58 <strcat[m]> Yumeko Jabami IRL: they're using IRC so it doesn't keep them in the channel when their client isn't active
00:37:03 <strcat[m]> just filter join / leave messages
00:37:26 <YumekoJabamiIRL[> üëç
00:50:40 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, after doing some testing bittorrent is not feasible right now
00:51:47 <nikitalita[m]> qbittorrent doesn't support libtorrent2.0 yet, libtorrent2.0's v2 implementation of hash checking with sha256 is INCREDIBLY slow
00:52:10 <nikitalita[m]> oh, it just segfaulted, great
00:52:16 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, not using this for a while
00:52:34 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, someone with some fat pipes throw up a mirror :P
01:00:32 <pixelusu> it's maybe J and his bots slowing down it
01:01:02 <pixelusu> https://i.imgur.com/X0fKqUj.jpg
01:02:49 <nikitalita[m]> it's certainly possible
01:03:30 <nikitalita[m]> ok, it's almost done downloading
01:04:58 <nikitalita[m]> so, question: I wanna get volte working on this new pixel 4, and I understand I need IMS activation for that; If I activate the phone with my simcard with the stock firmware, then will the IMS activation persist when I flash grapheneos, or what
01:17:09 <nikitalita[m]> well, i suppose i'll just have to find out
01:26:42 <strcat[m]> may leave the room on invite only overnight
01:26:44 <strcat[m]> when I'm not around
01:26:57 <strcat[m]> tired of removing messages one by one
01:28:04 <strcat[m]> it's matrix not irc
01:28:09 <strcat[m]> it's harder to deal with on matrix
01:28:32 <strcat[m]> james riles them up with his lies and then they come here and spam
01:41:31 <barstool[m]> Too bad it couldn't stay invite.
01:41:52 <barstool[m]> I know that's a lot of work though
01:43:51 <barstool[m]> Is invite the same someone requesting to be approved?
01:46:08 <refragable[m]> It means that, on the matrix side, someone already in the matrix room needs to specifically send an invite to another matrix user before they can join
01:47:33 <strcat[m]> a non-mod can probably invite people though and we're well aware that James and others are in this channel
01:47:52 <strcat[m]> so I don't think that's really going to accomplish much since they can invite people themselves and then have those people invite others
01:48:13 <barstool[m]> So basically a mole letting people in?
01:48:14 <strcat[m]> unless there's a way to limit that to mods I don't see it as more than a temporary solution
01:48:37 <strcat[m]> I think we can probably expect this kind of thing to happen if James is going to rile people up with his lies like the false claim that I harassed journalists
01:49:11 <strcat[m]> he incites people to do this stuff and he can't deny responsibility for posting libel about me and partnering up with people who do these things including people he has paid
01:49:30 <strcat[m]> he has gotten involved with a subset of a community that's known to do these things
01:50:33 <refragable[m]> I believe that the power level for that permission can be changed
01:50:34 <strcat[m]> so whenever there's a spark in the conflict and he starts inciting them with his lies I think we'll have this kind of problem now if they're going to persistently do it
01:50:42 <strcat[m]> matrix is designed in a way that I don't see a good way to deal with this
01:50:52 <strcat[m]> refragable: keep in mind this channel is owned by a matrix.org irc bridge bot
01:51:07 <strcat[m]> if they are going to persist in attacking the channel it may be necessary to move entirely to IRC
01:51:07 <refragable[m]> room settings > permissions > invite users
01:51:16 <strcat[m]> I don't have the necessary moderation tools here
01:51:19 <strcat[m]> refragable: not accessible
01:51:43 <refragable[m]> Right, I hadn't considered that the bridge causes problems. I was examining a regular room
01:52:01 <strcat[m]> appservice-irc is the owner of the room
01:52:09 <strcat[m]> it's really an IRC room
01:52:16 <strcat[m]> it's not a Matrix room that's bridged to an IRC room and could be split apart
01:52:30 <strcat[m]> it's an IRC room exposed through matrix.org via this special room managed by that bot
01:52:40 <strcat[m]> the point of it is supposed to be that you can do everything on the IRC side but it's quite broken
01:52:51 <strcat[m]> for example it wasn't bridging those messages or letting cdesai see them or ban them on the IRC side
01:52:53 <strcat[m]> it's really broken and problematic
01:53:12 <strcat[m]> and we don't control all the room settings + matrix is just designed in a very abuse friendly way
01:55:31 <barstool[m]> Is there another option that would give you and mods the control you need? We'll all move to whatever brings peace of mind to you DM
01:55:59 <BalooRJ> this channel is openly connectable to via Freenode
01:56:21 <BalooRJ> any way Freenode staff could give extra eyes to prevent the spammers
01:56:59 <strcat[m]> using just IRC would probably be a lot better if this is going to continue
01:57:18 <strcat[m]> I am not sure but I expect this to start being a problem whenever James starts lying about GrapheneOs and myself
01:57:24 <strcat[m]> he's inciting people to harass the developers
01:57:27 <barstool[m]> strcat:  Sounds good

03:02:10 <BalooRJ> Any princes involved?
03:02:11 <BalooRJ> https://github.com/sponsors/thestinger - Help hit the goal
03:07:49 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Does enabling developer options to use fake location allow for any insecurities?
03:16:36 <barstool[m]> I think you have to use a app along with that developer option. From what I've read you're adding more attack surface by adding that app and it isn't advised.
03:17:32 <JTL> barstool[m]: I'd assume that developer option is or testing and not privacy
03:17:44 <JTL> should look into that in more detail at soem point
03:19:19 <renlord> pyxel3aXL[m]: dont enable developer options if you are not a developer
03:19:54 * renlord wears moderation hat
03:21:14 <barstool[m]> JTL: I've used mock location before on other OS. I didn't advise it here.
03:21:27 <JTL> I'm just saying in general
03:21:58 <barstool[m]> I have developer options unlocked but just to check running apps every once in a while
03:23:42 <barstool[m]> JTL: I'm not really interested in using it. When I used it before I ha to use a app alongside it and I wouldn't do that with GOS
03:24:00 <JTL> fair
03:24:15 <renlord> i know what you're talking about, the mock location feature
03:24:28 <renlord> developers typically use it to test applications that use the location api
03:24:48 <renlord> the official advice is to not toggle developer option if you are not a developer.
03:25:50 <alicebobandeve> Woah, that reboot took its time on the Pixel 3, nearly shat myself. Did everyone face this?
03:26:01 <renlord> alicebobandeve: yeah i experienced this
03:26:16 <refragable[m]> <alicebobandeve "Woah, that reboot took its time "> Yes, the reboot lasted longer than usual.
03:26:19 <barstool[m]> I only have two apps on my device apart from the stock apps. One from FDroid and one from Aurora. Very simple with minimal permission access. Nothing has storage permission.
03:26:42 <barstool[m]> Mine was a little laggy
03:27:04 <alicebobandeve> Good to know I wasn't the only one.
03:28:19 <kan12> is there a better way to speed up window animations other than using developer mode?
03:28:58 <ghostcat[m]> alicebobandeve: I had no issue on 3a.
03:28:59 <renlord> kan12: whats wrong with window animation atm?
03:29:07 <renlord> that requires you to speed it up
03:29:11 <kan12> i find the defaults to be too slow
03:29:25 <renlord> in general? or specific apps?
03:29:39 <kan12> in general with navigating android's UI
03:30:06 <alicebobandeve> ghostcat: just read the changelog, I'm assuming it's related to the fix for the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL kernel mentioned there.
03:30:09 <JTL> Yeah, also not a fan of aesthetic delays and animations myself
03:30:41 <renlord> if that's something many people find annoying, probably a good idea to expose this as a display personalization option via the settings menu and eventually aim to upstream it
03:30:54 <renlord> so people dont need to access developer options for this
03:31:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: I don't think mocking location works for release builds of apps in a release build of the OS
03:31:14 <JTL> I guess the question is passively having "developer options" enabled just for this and NOTHING else, have any side effects?
03:31:36 <renlord> JTL: yes it does
03:31:46 <strcat[m]> because the apps that mock location are untrusted third party apps
03:31:53 <strcat[m]> if it was a first party feature of the OS it would be different
03:31:56 <renlord> as an example, adb can interact with the phone when you toggle on developer options
03:32:06 <strcat[m]> renlord: well you have to enable adb
03:32:39 <strcat[m]> note that turning on developer options requires having the primary unlock method
03:32:50 <alicebobandeve> <alicebobandeve "ghostcat: just read the changelo"> Hey. Did the reboot take its time because of this? strcat
03:32:57 <strcat[m]> if you someone gets your unlocked phone they can't enable dev options
03:33:09 <BalooRJ> reboot after update was very quick for me on 3a
03:33:09 <strcat[m]> alicebobandeve: no
03:33:12 <barstool[m]> I was curious about this as well. I like to check running and cached apps and nothing else
03:33:35 <renlord> strcat[m]: the longer than usual reboot not related to the bionic fix is it?
03:33:37 <renlord> @_@
03:33:45 <strcat[m]> so for example lets say someone gets your unlocked phone and wants to turn on adb and whitelist their device to basically backdoor your phone
03:33:48 <strcat[m]> they can't do that
03:33:56 <cn3m[m]> ^
03:33:56 <alicebobandeve> I think it affected only Pixel 3s
03:34:03 <kan12> my 3a spent a few minutes on the boot screen when i rebooted it
03:34:12 <strcat[m]> if you have developer options already enabled
03:34:12 <kan12> otherwise it works fine
03:34:22 <strcat[m]> then if someone gets your unlocked phone they can turn on adb and whitelist keys
03:34:39 <cn3m[m]> strcat: I should know this, but I don't. Location permission enables sensor use in the background or no? I was thinking yes, but now I am doubting myself
03:35:00 <cn3m[m]> if it does location spoofing is pretty much a joke, otherwise idk it would have to be first party
03:35:18 <strcat[m]> cn3m: sensor use in background isn't ever permitted
03:35:18 <barstool[m]> So if no one gets my unlocked device and ADB is toggled off, no worries?
03:35:19 <strcat[m]> sensors, camera and microphone are foreground only
03:35:20 <strcat[m]> location has the option to enable background access
03:35:22 <strcat[m]> (this is not different in GrapheneOS)
03:35:37 <strcat[m]> barstool: not what I said
03:35:42 <strcat[m]> dunno how you infer that
03:35:55 <strcat[m]> but it prevents them from just trivially backdooring your device via granting themselves adb access
03:36:01 <strcat[m]> or abusing another developer option
03:36:31 <strcat[m]> some kinds of settings such as enabling dev options ask for the primary unlock method again
03:36:37 <strcat[m]> in case someone gets their hands on an unlocked phone
03:36:59 <cn3m[m]> ^
03:37:00 <cn3m[m]> thanks
03:37:01 <barstool[m]> I'll turn off Developer mode if that's what you advised and I believe you did. Like I said I check running applications every once in a while
03:37:02 <strcat[m]> so, for example, maybe you hand your unlocked phone to your romantic partner to use and they set up some shit to spy on you
03:37:13 <strcat[m]> and whitelist an adb key
03:37:35 <renlord> [aside] i wish my romantic partner knew how to whitelist an adb key
03:37:36 <strcat[m]> also in recent versions of Android, whitelisted adb keys now expire after a while
03:37:58 <alicebobandeve> renlord: I swear, I'd marry her
03:38:54 <nikitalita[m]> alright
03:39:08 <nikitalita[m]> successfully transferred my pixel 2 to my pixel 4
03:39:16 <nikitalita[m]> that was a bit of an ordeal
03:39:37 <BalooRJ> nikitalita: Using GOS backup feature?
03:39:38 <nikitalita[m]> is there a reason  that the grapheneos backup doesn't store contacts data?
03:39:43 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
03:40:15 <renlord> nikitalita[m]: ask in #seedvault
03:40:30 <renlord> the grapheneos backup uses the seedvault implementation
03:40:40 <alicebobandeve> nikitalita: for privacy reasons, I'm assuming. Just export .vcf from contacts app and restore in new phone
03:41:01 <renlord> i personally use nextcloud to backup contacts
03:41:06 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, I couldn't figure out how to export it from the app
03:41:23 <BalooRJ> I use Etesync. But the app can export from vcf
03:41:26 <nikitalita[m]> fortunately, i had a local backup before i did this and I added no additional contacts before this
03:41:33 <renlord> just push on the .vcf file and there should be an intent
03:41:38 <alicebobandeve> Or self host nextcloud
03:41:40 <renlord> then you can open it with contacts to import
03:41:50 <BalooRJ> does Nextcloud support CardDAV?
03:41:54 <nikitalita[m]> if I do nextcloud, I wanna do it right
03:41:57 <renlord> BalooRJ: no
03:42:03 <nikitalita[m]> it'll take me some time to figure out how
03:42:10 <renlord> oh wait yes it does
03:42:16 <renlord> i use card/caldav with nextcloud lol
03:42:43 <refragable[m]> for matrix users https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#seedvault:matrix.org
03:43:07 <BalooRJ> lol. I'll have to check it out. Haven't ventured into Nextcloud yet.
03:49:06 <BalooRJ> is anyone here using Konele for speech to text in GOS and spun up their own docker instance of an english processing server??
03:59:10 <renlord> BalooRJ: what backend do you use for this
03:59:57 <BalooRJ> I'm just curious if anyone has done it, I'd like to be able to use the Speech to Text feature in Konele in English. https://github.com/jcsilva/docker-kaldi-gstreamer-server
04:04:51 <cn3m[m]> BalooRJ: google works
04:41:12 <Knull[m]> sry - off-topic room url again? Somehow i ended up here: https://matrix.to/#/!jvIMuOYiamZdTHiTMU:matrix.org?via=matrix.org

08:21:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh
08:21:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> I did not upgrade my pixel to the latest at all
08:21:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> I unlocked and flashed right away
08:23:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> My logic is that
08:23:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> The graphene factory image already has the firmware
08:24:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also consider that I actually maintain pixel so I can fix a mess I make
08:24:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you can't, update to the latest
08:25:22 <JTL> Thanks for what you do
08:25:23 <nikitalita[m]> No, they're the device maintainer for most of the pixels on grapheneos
08:25:39 <nikitalita[m]> (All)?
08:26:02 <erhcetua[m]> and here i am, flashing stock then graphene when i wanna do a full clean o3o
08:26:21 <JTL> nikitalita[m]: You mean strcat? He's the main developer, but anupritaisno1[m] is helping with Pixel 4 support
08:26:23 <nikitalita[m]> Just follow the instructions to the letter
08:26:26 <JTL> iirc
08:26:35 <nikitalita[m]> Its hard to screw up
08:26:52 <theultron[m]> Do we have any ball park estimate on number of Graphene users?
08:27:05 * JTL shrugs
08:27:06 <erhcetua[m]> yeah it's not like you are using twrp in order to flash
08:27:36 <theultron[m]>  * Do we have any ball park estimate on number of Graphene users? Matrix have close to 1K users. If we assume that 50% users are here on matrix consider being tech savy; the user shouldn't be more than 2k.

08:28:54 <erhcetua[m]> i think there are more than 1k users for sure, just that some don't bother with community
08:29:23 <erhcetua[m]> ikr, got a dumpling rotting on my desktop
08:29:38 <erhcetua[m]> twrp is so dirty when you think back
08:30:57 <erhcetua[m]> it is

08:31:17 <erhcetua[m]> it's on phone AOSP

08:45:04 <erhcetua[m]> with powershell
08:48:03 <erhcetua[m]> don't touch anything until script says "press a key to exit"
08:51:37 <za_warudo-vilfp8> If the powershell wasn't closed, you can just do `fastboot flashing lock`
08:51:51 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Otherwise set the PATH again
08:52:02 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Nice
08:52:17 <za_warudo-vilfp8> If there is a yellow warninh
08:52:18 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It's normal

09:44:28 <nikitalita[m]> hoo boy
09:44:47 <nikitalita[m]> lemme put it to you like this:
09:44:54 <nikitalita[m]> don't use visual voicemail
09:46:12 <erhcetua[m]> i said that, but honestly i don't use it personally
09:46:28 <erhcetua[m]> given i hardly have calls and stuff, it should work OOTB i think
09:47:08 <nikitalita[m]> there's a visual voicemail reference app in AOSP, but I don't think it works with any carrier because it's just a reference
09:47:48 <nikitalita[m]> ah
09:47:58 <nikitalita[m]> I mean, you could dial in and use a phone recorder
09:49:02 <nikitalita[m]> hmmm
09:49:13 <nikitalita[m]> that's a good question, actually
09:49:22 <nikitalita[m]> cn3m?
09:49:37 <erhcetua[m]> natively you can't
09:49:42 <cn3m[m]> ^
09:50:16 <erhcetua[m]> maybe with a third party app
09:50:56 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, I dunno if the permissions model actually allows you to
09:57:35 <nikitalita[m]> i just do it manually
09:57:51 <nikitalita[m]> use a computer to transfer the pictures and shit
09:57:56 <nikitalita[m]> contacts and texts have to be exported
09:58:01 <nikitalita[m]> signal does backups
09:58:07 <nikitalita[m]> (also please use signal)
09:58:56 <nikitalita[m]> i really recommend signal for sms stuff
09:59:28 <nikitalita[m]> Briar, gajim should be able to be backed up
10:00:29 <nikitalita[m]> I believe so?
10:00:32 <alzxjm[m]> persistentpixel: EteSync is an amazing service that will sync your calendar, contacts, and tasks automatically.
10:00:56 <alzxjm[m]> End-to-end encrypted. Free 2 week trial and $24 a year. Can't recommend it enough.
10:01:29 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <persistentpixel[m] "Can I connect a HDD dock with US"> Not sure about 4?
10:01:43 <nikitalita[m]> here, I'll check right now
10:01:47 <za_warudo-vilfp8> As far as I've heard here, nope...?
10:04:07 <nikitalita[m]> persistentpixel: no, I just tested it, it just tries to charge those
10:04:13 <nikitalita[m]> USB flash drives work
10:05:06 <nikitalita[m]> Tried a couple, neither worked
10:05:52 <nikitalita[m]> Android doesn't have wide-ranging usb support, especially when it comes to storage. It'll support USB drives and that's about it
10:07:07 <dallemon[m]> persistentpixel: if your old phone has usb-c you can probably just connect the two phones. that's what i did with my pixel 2 xl and pixel 4 xl
10:07:27 <nikitalita[m]> As for exporting sms, I dunno; I always just used signal backups. Signal will automatically import your sms when you use it, then will give you an option to create a backup
10:07:39 <nikitalita[m]> which is encrypted
10:08:05 <nikitalita[m]> just make sure to write down the password and double check it when it gives it to you, it doesn't make you confirm it :P
10:09:30 <nikitalita[m]> honestly, sms is so bad for privacy, everything is unencrypted and open to snooping; if you have people you regularly communicate with over SMS, i'd just get them to use signal, it's extremely transparent, all my non-techie friends who are terrible with technology have gotten the hang of it really quickly
10:12:10 <nikitalita[m]> welp
10:12:57 <nikitalita[m]> you can still use signal to talk to your holdout friends unencrypted
10:13:11 <nikitalita[m]> just don't talk about sensitive stuff on it :P
10:13:35 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Time to reject that person  /s
10:13:44 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Kidding, try to convince her on Element, on website only
10:13:55 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Cons are the metadata leak
10:14:10 <za_warudo-vilfp8> (Welp, not so convenient though to do so...)
10:14:13 <nikitalita[m]> honestly, I'm not recommending element for anyone until they fix the web app and improve the UI
10:15:06 <nikitalita[m]> 1) right now the UI and the terrible community options give a bad first impression and it puts them off using it forever
10:15:06 <nikitalita[m]> 2) the integrations leak shit everywhere and its very easy to use this insecurely as a result
10:16:05 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Sadly yeah...
10:17:25 <nikitalita[m]> it's so sad because the protocol is solid; it's just they've made some very poor design decisions, sacrificing privacy in a bid to implement some of the more popular features of telegram and discord
10:17:37 <nikitalita[m]> and the kicker is that it's not even done well at all
10:17:46 <drossbox[m]> That's not my experience tbh. I've hosted my own home server for a couple of years and it's been great.
10:17:47 <nikitalita[m]> stickers fucking suck with the integrations
10:21:34 <nikitalita[m]> lemme put it to you this way
10:21:37 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Wait what
10:21:39 <nikitalita[m]> don't use whatsapp
10:21:41 <za_warudo-vilfp8> I was joking though lol
10:21:54 <nikitalita[m]> whatsapp is a security nightmare
10:22:11 <nikitalita[m]> it may be encrypted but the app keeps getting zero-click owned all the fucking time
10:22:21 <alzxjm[m]> nikitalita: There are people who will either use WhatsApp or SMS. I try to talk them into Signal but WhatsApp is better than SMS.
10:22:33 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Or use it in a separate profile, but it's preferable not to use it at all, since it is owned by a company that doesn't care about privacy AND security
10:23:06 <cn3m[m]> WhatsApp is fine
10:23:23 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Not too sure about facebook handling the data

10:59:58 <dredd> Right, I tried a couple of foss launchers and wasn't a huge fan, I might just stick to stock then. Thanks for the input guys!
11:00:30 <alzxjm[m]> dredd: yeah I mean I'm not an expert but it seems the launcher is highly trusted so I'd rather not use a 3rd party. I try to use as much stock stuff as possible.

15:42:07 <fluoridatedsheep> :)
15:46:14 <M86xKC[m]> Hello friends o/
15:51:02 <albedoirl[m]> üëã
16:19:37 <erhcetua[m]> greetings, enjoy your stay
16:38:20 <nickcalyx[m]> Whats viper4android
16:38:52 <nickcalyx[m]> I looked it up but the description is super vague
16:38:55 <alzxjm[m]> CalyxOS eschews some of GrapheneOS's hardening measures (such as the hardening memory allocator) in favor of maintaining the AOSP/Android security model and providing more usability. The project does invoke some GrapheneOS security measures, such as denying USB on a locked device.
16:39:32 <alzxjm[m]> brockin042: You cannot (as far as I know) root CalyxOS. Or at least you can't still call it CalyxOS. You might be able to build it (or GrapheneOS) yourself, but then it would be something different.
16:40:44 <alzxjm[m]> CalyxOS is AOSP bundled with a few cool add-ons (like the ability to make Signal and WhatsApp calls directly from the dialer) and a bunch of neat privacy apps such as CalyxVPN, Briar, Signal, etc. and it supports verified boot. It does have microG for Google Play Services compatibility, though signature spoofing is restricted to microG.
16:42:43 <alzxjm[m]> nickcalyx: Huh. Yeah it's like a fancy EQ for audio output?
16:43:31 <alzxjm[m]> I'd be tempted to just get a USB DAC/Amp or something for superior audio rather than an app that forces you to root.
16:44:12 <nickcalyx[m]> there is also panic button integration in CalyxOS üôÇ and seedvault
16:46:25 <alzxjm[m]> brockin042: Both OS's are great but I doubt you'll find anyone in these parts who will advise you to root for any reason.
16:47:53 <erhcetua[m]> root is very dangerous, don't root your phone
16:47:54 <erhcetua[m]> you don't even need it these days
16:51:02 <ThomCat[m]> There's a couple things root is still superior for (CF.Lumen, custom button shortcuts, theming), but it grows smaller with every x.0 update
16:52:55 <cdesai> Night light covers cf.lumen for the most part
16:53:11 <cdesai> We have theming too, can be enabled here as well.
16:54:13 <alzxjm[m]> You must have some fancy ears. I listen to high dynamic range FLAC files through a USB amp/dac and Sennheiser HD 650s. I can't imagine music sounding much better üòâ
16:56:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> I listen to FLAC the studio was selling out
16:56:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> 8mbps bitrate, 384 kHz and 500 mb per flac
16:57:45 <alzxjm[m]> brockin042: on CalyxOS only microG can signature spoof, rather than any app that is installed. The feature is not compatible with GrapheneOS's security standards but it's secure enough for me.
16:58:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> alzxjm: meanwhile glassrom: every app except microg can spoof
16:59:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW move to offtopic
17:00:06 <pixelusu> on roms with signatures spoofing it's usually protected by a permission that you give to app it's not 'all apps can spoof signatures"
17:00:52 <alzxjm[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "BTW move to offtopic "> Agreed. Will do.
17:01:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Apps also cannot spoof any signature they want
17:01:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> The signature is hatdcoded in the app and an app can only spoof one signature
17:01:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> * The signature is hardcoded in the app and an app can only spoof one signature
17:03:22 <alzxjm[m]> microG Services Core pretends to be Google Play Services, and it can only pretend to be that, right?
17:03:52 <alzxjm[m]> (that was the last microG question, promise)
17:07:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
17:11:33 <erhcetua[m]> what's the actual graphene offtopic  link ?
17:11:50 <alzxjm[m]> #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
17:14:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> alzxjm: can you invite me
17:15:00 <dmatrixs[m]> I cant seem find it on element on my device
17:15:10 <erhcetua[m]> same for me
17:15:13 <erhcetua[m]> i can't join with fluffychat
17:17:46 <refragable[m]> try `/join !NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org` for the offtopic room if the alias doesn't work
17:18:02 <alzxjm[m]> I just asked about invites in the channel.
17:19:14 <alzxjm[m]> I don't think I can invite. The Invite to this room button is greyed out.

18:08:16 <rond3> Hi everyone
18:09:07 <alzxjm[m]> rond3: üëã

18:10:47 <alzxjm[m]> rond3: https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
18:11:47 <alzxjm[m]> For MAC randomizaiton
18:11:54 <alzxjm[m]> Not sure about IMEI
18:12:10 <rond3> also, is there a way to make TOR Browser a default browser? I mean replacing the webkit built in because i found some issues regarding that
18:13:30 <rond3> So its randomize it , cool ! Is it only one time ? Or i can randomized  as many as i can?
18:15:51 <rond3> And last question that i need an answer for it, many exploits are public , but let say there is a 0day exploit for the browser somehow, is it gonna work ? Or there is something will surely stop it
18:19:04 <fll[m]> anupritaisno1: /join #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
18:19:43 <fll[m]> Without line break...
18:25:43 <dazinism> rond3: IMSI and imei are no longer available to apps. The cell network sees both, need an IMSI (can change Sim if you want to change that). Changing imei is illegal in many countries.
18:26:10 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/what-can-apps-see
18:28:58 <dazinism> Webview has to be available for some apps to work. Don't think there is any implementation not based on chromium. GrapheneOS Vanadium webview benefits from hardening.
18:29:48 <dazinism> Can use tor browser as your default browser, but its not nearly as secure as vanadium.
18:29:55 <faxing[m]> Does putting a semi-anti privacy app in a separate user profile with nothing else in it fully contain it, or are there any problems with that approach that I should be aware of?
18:30:05 <faxing[m]> On graphene if that makes a difference
18:30:43 <dazinism> faxing: depends what it is and what you are worried about
18:30:57 <dazinism> Also possibly how you use it.
18:31:04 <dazinism> Theres a lot to consider
18:31:44 <faxing[m]> Its Telegram, I haven't used it in a while and I just wanted to check in on someone on there
18:32:14 <dazinism> Well I guess they'll know your telephone number and who you talk to
18:32:30 <faxing[m]> I would try to get them on Signal but then they'd know my personal phone number
18:33:39 <faxing[m]> Would taking out my sim while I have it installed, then uninstalling the app when I'm done and then putting my sim back in stop them from knowing my number?
18:33:47 <faxing[m]> Also how would they know who I talk to?
18:33:57 <dazinism> You got signal registered with a different phone number?  I thought having one to one chats  on telegram let the other party know your number?
18:34:06 <dazinism> (I could be confused?)
18:34:23 <dazinism> *you got telegram
18:34:32 <faxing[m]> No, you can turn off sharing your number with people in telegram
18:34:43 <dazinism> Oh, ok.
18:35:13 <faxing[m]> Like I said, I don't use it a lot and I don't intend to use it frequently by any means, I just wanted to check in on someone who uses telegram and wanted to sort of know how to sandbox it effectively
18:35:32 <faxing[m]> I'd uninstall it after I'm done using it, as well
18:35:59 <dazinism> If its in a profile on its own they'll only know what device you have, that its on GrapheneOS and what you do on Telegram
18:36:01 <faxing[m]> If it would expose a bunch, though - it sounds like it might not be a good choice
18:36:30 <dazinism> Think thats the limit of it
18:36:41 <dazinism> Well also a bit more....
18:37:01 <dazinism> While you are using the app / have the profile active.
18:37:15 <dazinism> Best restart the phone after using
18:37:43 <faxing[m]> I was hoping that the F-Droid version wouldn't have any of that invasive stuff but I suppose I was wrong
18:38:00 <faxing[m]> It sounds like it collects a bit too much for my liking so I suppose I'll pass
18:38:02 <dazinism> See the link I posted above about what apps can see
18:38:06 <dazinism> Also https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
18:38:12 <faxing[m]> Thanks a ton for the information
18:38:18 <faxing[m]> I'll look into it
18:44:25 <faxing[m]> I use Orbot and Netguard so I might not be the best source of information if you're not planning to do that but with moderate usage I get a good probable 8 hours from 100% to 0%
18:44:52 <faxing[m]> * I use Orbot and Netguard so I might not be the best source of information if you're not planning to do that but with moderate usage I get a good probably 8 hours from 100% to 0% on my 3a XL with always on display
18:46:14 <dazinism> rond3: also see https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
18:46:14 <dazinism> and
18:46:14 <dazinism> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html
18:47:08 <faxing[m]> Oh yeah, if you're a light user you should be able to easily make it through a whole day on one charge
18:47:15 <dazinism> tamqcrg: depends a lot on apps you use. Some apps can use a lot of battery in some situations
18:47:24 <faxing[m]> I can sometimes make it through two days if I don't use my phone q ton on my xl
18:47:33 <faxing[m]> * I can sometimes make it through two days if I don't use my phone a ton on my xl
18:48:13 <faxing[m]> * I can sometimes make it through two days if I do more light usage on my xl
18:48:25 <dazinism> Notably some messengers Riot / Element also sometimes Signal (think it may depends on quality of network connection?)
18:48:56 <pixelusu> damnn 8hours of usage? but while always using it i guess
18:49:02 <pixelusu> 8 hours of non stop usage
18:49:47 <dazinism> tamqcrg: on an hour screen time I expect you'll easily make it thru a day with a 3a
18:50:06 <dazinism> The lower power processor uses less battery
18:51:34 <dazinism> If you are somewhere with a dodgy cell connection the phone can use a fair bit of power switching 2G to 4G (or whatever) repeatedly
18:52:00 <faxing[m]> 1hr 34m of usage (primarily element) and 3h 48m screen of but always on display and I'm at 89% on my 3a xl
18:52:06 <faxing[m]> If that gives you an idea
18:52:13 <dazinism> ...well I had this experience in the past with other phones
18:52:33 <faxing[m]> * 1hr 34m of usage (primarily element) and 3h 48m screen off but the always on display active and I'm at 89% on my 3a xl
18:52:54 <faxing[m]> * 1hr 34m of screen on (primarily element) and 3h 48m screen off but the always on display active and I'm at 89% on my 3a xl
18:54:00 <faxing[m]> Settings, battery, then I see my screen on at the bottom and my always on display time when I click the three dots in the top right and click battery usage
18:54:04 <erhcetua[m]> where can i report a bug ? personnal dictionnary is borked on stock keyboard
18:54:21 <faxing[m]> * Settings, battery, then I see my screen on at the bottom and my always on display time I find when I click the three dots in the top right and click battery usage
18:54:36 <erhcetua[m]> saying it here is a bit pointless i think, as it will get drown by messages
18:54:53 <dazinism> tamqcrg: if you are going to use element disabling notifications (theres an option to do this in the app menus) helps reduce battery drain.
18:55:29 <dazinism> *to do this in the settings menus in the app
18:55:31 <pixelusu> oh yea if you use both element and signal is battery is done lol
18:55:41 <pixelusu> those 2 are very power hungry
18:55:51 <pixelusu> with notifications on
18:56:02 <dazinism> Or force stop the app when you dont need it
18:56:17 <dazinism> Signal sometimes doesnt drain much, sometimes does
18:57:12 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <pixelusu "oh yea if you use both element a"> Element used 12% of my battery, Signal only used 2%
18:57:50 * dazinism sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/AmGFaSwugQWxohGaVsxgXyHd >
18:57:52 <pixelusu> on my phone is about 20% for each app and phone battery reduced to one day or less instead of about 3
18:58:37 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Element used 12% of my battery, "> And Signal was used for longer than Element. I think Element eats so much battery because it constantly scans for new messages, instead of a longer interval like 15 minutes
18:58:45 * dazinism sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/muKiZgIKAKKeSeBHnrRwqmrl >
18:59:21 <dazinism> lol... multiple reply fail...
19:01:18 <faxing[m]> I would say hold out for the 4a but the 4 still isn't even supported so it could be a good while before that device is even usable
19:01:35 <faxing[m]> The 3a is perfectly stable from my experience, though
19:03:26 <alzxjm[m]> Pixel 4 is supported.
19:03:49 <faxing[m]> It is, it's just still marked as "experimental" last time I checked, and is less stable than the other devices
19:04:13 <faxing[m]> * It is, it's just still marked as "experimental" last time I checked, and is less stable than the other devices (most notably the 3 and 3a)
19:04:26 <alzxjm[m]> It's not experimental on the website
19:04:48 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <alzxjm[m] "It's not experimental on the web"> Not anymore
19:04:58 <faxing[m]> Hm, alright - was recently then. My bad
19:04:58 <cn3m[m]> "Support for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL is currently less mature, but those along with the upcoming Pixel 4a will become the recommended devices due to longer support and incremental security improvements for the device support code and firmware."
19:05:02 <cn3m[m]> this is what the site says
19:05:12 <cn3m[m]> as of a few weeks ago
19:05:13 <grindlefang[m]> Hello
19:05:36 <faxing[m]> Ahhh alright, that might be what I saw
19:05:43 <BlackWinnerYoshi> Although, I still bought a Pixel 3a XL because Pixel 4 XL is too expensive ~~and too much of a flex~~ for me
19:06:26 <faxing[m]> Lol
19:06:42 <grindlefang[m]> I've built an eng version of graphene os and flashed it onto a Pixel 3A (sargo). I'm trying to run some AT commands to get it to output the ciphering indicator for the LTE connection, but its not working . This seems to work fine on a Pixel 3A running AOSP.
19:06:50 <grindlefang[m]> echo -e "AT+CRSM=176,28589,0,0,3\r" > /dev/smd7
19:06:55 <faxing[m]> I got my 3a xl cause I got it new for $329 so I thought it was a good enough deal to get one
19:06:59 <grindlefang[m]> This is the command I'm running. But it doesn't give any output
19:07:04 <grindlefang[m]> Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening?
19:07:21 <grindlefang[m]> Does Graphene OS have rules disallowing communication with /dev/* files or the rild?
19:31:18 <erhcetua[m]> hello
19:32:10 <Knull[m]> anyone got protonmail notifications working? kinda dumb that it relies on Google services
19:32:36 <cn3m[m]> <m_b_[m] "Anyone know if this vuln is in G"> why wouldn't it be
19:32:52 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS hardly does anything against logic bugs
19:33:07 <cn3m[m]> tightened SELinux rules, but I can't see how that would apply
19:37:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: too tight tbh
19:38:07 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <Knull[m] "anyone got protonmail notificati"> And that's probably why it's not available on F-Droid. I'll probably replace it with Disroot/`/e/`/NixNet/Riseup mail, since ProtonMail doesn't allow IMAP/POP3 with free accounts anyway
19:38:57 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <anupritaisno1[m] "cn3m: too tight tbh "> I haven't noticed any changes with hardened SELinux, so what's the problem?
19:39:07 <Knull[m]> I have paid account. Their VPN is on fdroid but no mail.. üòî
19:39:25 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <Knull[m] "I have paid account. Their VPN i"> Their mail app is kinda trash anyway
19:39:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Somebody tag renlord for me
19:39:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/253
19:41:15 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: pretty sure you just did it. Typing the name is still same as tag (pilled name) on matrix
19:43:55 <dazinism> Also they are mainly on IRC
19:45:10 <dazinism> So a user name mention probably pings them
19:45:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wherever he be
19:45:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Who's they btw
19:46:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Is renlord a plural being?
19:49:14 <dazinism> They is often used for singular and has been for centuries
19:50:44 <dazinism> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they
19:55:21 <pixelusu> wow i didn't know that
19:57:29 <pixelusu> even them and their can be used in singular omg pretty srange
19:57:34 <pixelusu> *strange
19:57:55 <ThomCat[m]> English is hard
19:58:21 <dazinism> Not for a native speaker, although it depends a bit on context, sometimes it can feel awkward
20:01:09 <mrxx_0[m]> Hey,
20:01:09 <mrxx_0[m]> I was wondering by curiosity, with Android 11 coming out really soon
20:01:09 <mrxx_0[m]> Is Daniel planning to upgrade Graphene to Android 11 (I think yes), how much time does it take to do it (to understand and to have an idea)  and is he already working on it ?
20:01:41 <mrxx_0[m]> My message is just to get info :)
20:01:49 <dazinism> It takes a fair bit of work
20:02:02 <dazinism> Previous years its been a few weeks
20:02:13 <dazinism> Ideally people will help
20:02:18 <mrxx_0[m]> OK that's what I wanted to know
20:02:47 <dazinism> Its definately appears a stressful load of work for Daniel
20:03:16 <mrxx_0[m]> It will not be done by snapping fingers
20:03:44 <dazinism> Hopefully we have a few more people now who will be able to take on some of the work
20:03:57 <mrxx_0[m]> Yes I understand, I don't know what amount of time/work/resources it needs
20:04:16 <mrxx_0[m]> To port to A11
20:05:48 <dazinism> <Vicarious[m] "There are many people that are n"> I blame the autocorrect and getting distracted
20:06:08 <ThomCat[m]> Android 11
20:08:37 <ThomCat[m]> [Oh, the Samsung Galaxy A11 is definitely a thing.](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a11-10132.php)
20:09:22 <ThomCat[m]> Wow, that is budget AF
20:10:58 <faxing[m]> If I install GCam, and revoke it's network permissions, block it with netguard, and only give it the permissions that it explicitly requires, are there any privacy problems that could arise or that I should be aware of over just using the stock Open Camera application?
20:12:04 <ThomCat[m]> [Is this no longer true?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bkhzr2/gcam_and_grapheneos/)
20:12:18 <alzxjm[m]> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
20:12:31 <alzxjm[m]> That's a tiny app that fakes the part of Google Services Framework that Gcam needs.
20:13:12 <pixelusu> the default gcam use google photo for viewing you need a patched one to be able to use custom gallery
20:13:23 <alzxjm[m]> It works flawlessly.
20:13:37 <alzxjm[m]> OK, not flawlessly. pixelusu is correct.
20:13:43 <I3^RELATIVISM> thats a boldstatement
20:13:54 <alzxjm[m]> It works OK.
20:14:25 <alzxjm[m]> The taking pictures part works, afaik, normally.
20:14:40 <I3^RELATIVISM> ahah nice correction
20:34:28 <faxing[m]> I can't find install instructions for that gcam thing
20:34:43 <faxing[m]> Or if you can fully uninstall it if you no longer want it
20:35:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw
20:36:16 <alzxjm[m]> faxing: Download the APK from releases.
20:36:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Somebody on grapheneos please install synching
20:36:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Confirm it does not crash
20:36:50 <alzxjm[m]> anupritaisno1: It was crashing for me this morning. Did you change something?
20:36:55 <faxing[m]> Oh it won't show that for me on mobile so I wasn't sure
20:37:08 <faxing[m]> I'll get in on my PC and transfer it, thanks
20:37:37 <alzxjm[m]> It will show up in your apps list and you can uninstall it at your leisure.
20:38:13 <faxing[m]> And then I can just install gcam from aurora, orrr?
20:38:29 <faxing[m]> * And then I can just install gcam from aurora, or do I get the apk from somewhere?
20:38:50 <faxing[m]> * And then I can just install gcam from aurora, or do I have to find the apk from somewhere?
20:39:10 <faxing[m]> * And then I can just install gcam from aurora, or do I have to find the apk somewhere?
20:41:05 <alzxjm[m]> faxing: I think the one I downloaded from Aurora was out-of-date and didn't have the Pixely features. I used `adb pull` to get the stock one off my spouse's Pixel, just to make sure I was getting the real deal.
20:41:14 <alzxjm[m]> But things might be different now.
20:42:48 <faxing[m]> Oh I don't have another pixel so I'll have to hope the aurora one is good enough
20:43:14 <faxing[m]> Is there any benefit to installing it in its own user profile? Or would it be the same thing essentially?
20:44:59 <nickcalyx[m]> I don't think you can get it from aurora
20:45:10 <faxing[m]> Yeah you can
20:45:15 <nickcalyx[m]> can you ?
20:45:23 <faxing[m]> I just had it pulled up
20:45:29 <faxing[m]> So I think so
20:46:19 <alzxjm[m]> I think that one is really outdated.
20:46:37 <alzxjm[m]> The one I pulled from a current Pixel is version 7.4.something
20:46:46 <alzxjm[m]> Looks like the Aurora store verison is like 4.something
20:46:58 <faxing[m]> As long as nightsight functions and it takes better photos than open camera, it doesn't matter a whole lot to me
20:47:10 <nickcalyx[m]> yeah  it would probably be fine
20:47:31 <alzxjm[m]> You could probably find an up-to-date one on APKMirror
20:47:42 <faxing[m]> Yeah, I might look there
20:47:55 <faxing[m]> thats where i got it a few years back for my oneplus 6
20:48:22 <alzxjm[m]> Vicarious: What device?
20:48:27 <faxing[m]> Is there any benefit of installing it on it's own user profile, though? Or would it be the same either way?
20:50:14 <pixelusu> who is that Vicarious guy that people are speaking about since like 2 days there is no Vicarious user
20:50:58 <pixelusu> is that one more bug of the bridge to matrix?
20:52:46 <alzxjm[m]> Vicarious: Wow weird. Syncthing was crashing on launch this morning.
20:53:01 <alzxjm[m]> On the August GrapheneOS. I'm back on CalyxOS now.
20:53:10 <alzxjm[m]> (I need to get another phone for GrapheneOS stuff)
20:56:49 <VicariousIRC> Can you see me now, pixelusu?
20:57:42 * alzxjm[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/lcmAsKqZmPmjKMjFyejHZEFr >
20:57:52 <pixelusu> yea
20:58:05 <alzxjm[m]> Right after you go through the setup wizard.
20:58:08 <alzxjm[m]> Grant storage/network permissions, etc.
20:58:46 <VicariousIRC> You may have accidentally (or purposefully) blocked me. Check your blocked or ignored list!
20:59:31 <pixelusu> no you were not on the list it's a bug with the irc bridge
20:59:39 <pixelusu> on the user list
20:59:47 <faxing[m]> Should I install all of the Pixel stuff on a different user profile just for that, or would that not make a difference?
21:00:52 * alzxjm[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200806-170035.png (73KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/UUsMsgwYTIZKXIybYOMiJVeq >
21:00:56 <alzxjm[m]> faxing: Gcam
21:01:10 <alzxjm[m]> Thsoe are the permissions for Gcam, that is.
21:02:02 <faxing[m]> So would there be any benefit to using a different user profile for it?
21:02:08 <alzxjm[m]> So, if you don't want Gcam doing those things in your main user profile, a separate profile might be appropriate.
21:02:21 <faxing[m]> Alright, thanks a ton
21:03:23 <alzxjm[m]> FWIW, most of those permissions are also used in the stock AOSP camera app. Open Camera is much better.
21:03:42 <alzxjm[m]> It does not require any network access at all.
21:04:22 <alzxjm[m]> It can access Bluetooth settings and pair with Bluetooth devices, but otherwise the permissions are much more straightforward.
21:04:26 <faxing[m]> The network stuff wouldn't matter though if I didn't give it the network permissions and I blocked it with NetGuard though, right?
21:04:39 <alzxjm[m]> So maybe Open Camera in your user profile and Gcam for the special stuff in a different profile?
21:04:48 <faxing[m]> also I don't use bluetooth and keep it disabled all of the time except for very rare cases
21:05:05 <faxing[m]> <alzxjm[m] "So maybe Open Camera in your use"> Thats a good idea, thanks
21:05:08 <alzxjm[m]> Vicarious: Gcam constantly takes exposures while open so that the shutter button is instantaneous. It makes Open Camera seem to take forever.
21:05:15 <VicariousIRC> You're right, problem with the bridge. Can't see my messages here either
21:05:32 <refragable[m]> pixelusu: the matrix-irc bridge is overloaded so sometimes it doesn't send messages from new users from the matrix side. It'll look like people are talking to themselves.
21:05:45 <pixelusu> :D
21:06:27 <pixelusu> yea it happen too often, i think there is no point of using irc so
21:07:25 <VicariousIRC> Take the red pill and join us in The Matrix
21:07:31 <alzxjm[m]> faxing: I don't think Netguard adds anything on top of GrapheneOS's Network toggle, but I could be incorrect here.
21:08:51 <retry0x> what's a good matrix app?
21:09:00 <pixelusu> element
21:09:53 <pixelusu> there isn't many, the other others are either buggy or based on older version of riot
21:10:39 <alzxjm[m]> retry0x: The F-Droid Element app is best in my experience.
21:11:02 <alzxjm[m]> The Aurora version didn't handle notifications correctly.
21:55:11 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, I can't wait for pixel 4a support
21:55:32 <nikitalita[m]> a very good budget phone at only $350 with long term support
21:55:57 <nickcalyx[m]> I hope mine shows up soon
22:03:41 <nikitalita[m]> I started using grapheneos on a pixel 2 as my daily driver almost immediately
22:03:47 <nikitalita[m]> I was surprised how easy it was to switch
22:03:57 <cn3m[m]> You can also run stock with gapps disabled on one profile and enabled in another
22:04:07 <nikitalita[m]> (granted, I don't really consume a lot of content on my phone and most of my friends already used secure open source messaging apps)
22:04:32 <cdesai> the most annoying thing about disabling play services on stock would be all the notifications you get from the google apps complaining
22:04:41 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
22:04:54 <cdesai> it's good that they have a dedicated notification channel for each
22:05:23 <cn3m[m]> <cdesai "the most annoying thing about di"> you can mute those alerts specifically
22:05:25 <cn3m[m]> from the UI
22:05:34 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: per-app!
22:05:49 <cn3m[m]> true
22:07:49 <nikitalita[m]> Basically, I've found open source replacements for pretty much everything that I need
22:08:15 <nikitalita[m]> And the lyft web app works just fine for calling a ride share
22:09:12 <M86xKC[m]> cn3m you got a nice collection of devices brother :)
22:09:45 <cn3m[m]> oh my session list?
22:10:08 <nikitalita[m]> and if I have to use social media, I got newpipe for youtube videos, twidere for a twitter client, Twire for twitch, etc.
22:10:10 <M86xKC[m]> yeah :)
22:10:43 <nikitalita[m]> The only thing I haven't found is an open source app for android like OBS that allows you to stream to the livestreaming services
22:12:19 <M86xKC[m]> btw I appreciate your help to grapheneOS and good luck üëç
22:12:46 <cn3m[m]> ^ cheers
22:20:12 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
22:20:23 <nikitalita[m]> there are a bunch of proprietary blobs in pretty much every computing device nowadays
22:21:02 <cn3m[m]> <JaaDee[m] "I'm having trouble finding infor"> nothing is fully open source even the ancient phones Replicant use have closed boot chains to some degree
22:21:07 <cn3m[m]> though
22:21:28 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS isolates and hardens everything it can
22:21:37 <cn3m[m]> for example all blobs run in user land in a HAL Sandbox with full sandboxing
22:21:39 <nikitalita[m]> The baseband can't be completely shut off because it's responsible for the wifi and bluetooth radio also, but the cellular radio can be stopped from transmit/receive and it stays that way
22:21:42 <cn3m[m]> hardening*
22:21:44 <cn3m[m]> not sandboxing
22:21:53 <cn3m[m]> <nikitalita[m] "The baseband can't be completely"> Airplane mode turns it off
22:23:14 <nikitalita[m]> JaaDee: https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
22:24:20 <nikitalita[m]> pixel 4 support landed early last month
22:24:35 <nikitalita[m]> so that was about 9 months or so
22:31:01 <nikitalita[m]> https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nearly-50-percent-of-all-smartphones-affected-by-qualcomm-snapdragon-bugs/
22:34:04 <nikitalita[m]> strcat: Is grapheneos vulnerable to this? If not, might be a great promotional opportunity
22:35:53 <cn3m[m]> they said it is patched
22:35:57 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has the latest patches
22:37:25 <nikitalita[m]> I'm just wondering if the hardening to the OS meant if it was vulnerable in the first place
22:37:46 <M86xKC[m]> are there any good matrix client for android yet?
22:37:51 <nikitalita[m]> because apparently the vector is an app running a privilege escalation attack: https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-safemode/dc-safemode-speakers.html#Makkaveev
22:38:06 <nikitalita[m]> M86xKC: Element for android is... usable
22:49:59 <erhcetua[m]> <M86xKC[m] "are there any good matrix client"> fluffychat
22:59:39 <dazinism> Element is not so great for me. Think maybe because I'm in loads of rooms
23:05:14 <albedoirl[m]> <dazinism "Element is not so great for me. "> Agreed.
23:12:30 <kelozar> hello. im new and looking to pick up a pixel to test graphene os. wondering is there any major differences or benefits of pixel 3 vs pixel 2
23:12:31 <kelozar> ty
23:13:27 <nickcalyx[m]> Pixel2 support from Google ends in October so there's that
23:14:00 <faxing[m]> Pixel 3 (I'd recommend getting the 3a and not the 3) will be supported two years, as opposed to the few months left of the 2
23:14:21 <kelozar> why would i need google support? can i download any apps with apks on graphene
23:14:30 <kelozar> only looking to test some wallets for bitcoin
23:15:07 <faxing[m]> If google stops pushing security updates and all of that, the device is no longer supported under graphene
23:30:24 <cn3m[m]> sorry everyone
23:31:03 <alzxjm[m]> cn3m: was it more trolls and gore?
23:31:53 <cn3m[m]> yes
23:32:22 <alzxjm[m]> Glad I disabled URL previews and thumbnails.
23:32:37 <cn3m[m]> me too
23:32:44 <cn3m[m]> I recommend it to everyone here
23:35:28 <pixelusu> damn i missed again those trolls why i don't see them on irc?,  trolls please pm me with your stuff
23:36:00 <nikitalita[m]> ugh
23:36:19 <nikitalita[m]> cn3m: scroll up, you missed one
23:37:01 <cn3m[m]> nikitalita: can you copy the time stamp?
23:37:44 <nikitalita[m]> cn3m: accept my dm
23:38:20 <cn3m[m]> Firefox on windows huh
23:39:06 <cn3m[m]> analtenderloin: please block image previews
23:39:12 <cn3m[m]> we have people on it all the time
23:39:19 <cn3m[m]> or access irc
23:39:20 <cn3m[m]> we can't do much
23:39:24 <cn3m[m]> I am sorry
23:39:43 <cn3m[m]> you have to block images on your end
23:39:51 <nikitalita[m]> unfortunately, matrix doesn't have technical features like roles in chatrooms that are required for embeds
23:40:11 <cn3m[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "is there anyway to setup the roo"> I tried I could manually approve everyone, but that would take me several hours
23:42:11 <nikitalita[m]> copperheadOS people
23:42:38 <nikitalita[m]> bascially the head of that project is a vindictive asshole who sics them on grapheneos
23:43:00 <cn3m[m]> Most people here think it is Coppperhead Limited. Coppperhead Limited says it is someone framing them. It is one of those two. People are referencing me in the user name it is highly targeted
23:43:22 <cn3m[m]> ^
23:43:37 <cn3m[m]> it is definitely not random
23:44:50 <cn3m[m]> retry0x: yeah let me screenshot my settings one sec
23:45:43 <cn3m[m]> check the bottom setting make sure it is off
23:45:44 * cn3m[m] uploaded an image: image.png (87KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/NWPiJYDoXgNHYbtFRsWLUiYt >
23:46:11 <cn3m[m]> fair warning to everyone
23:46:30 <cn3m[m]> if you spam a bunch of pictures and I don't immediately recognize your name I am banning you
23:46:47 <cn3m[m]> since I can't see the images and I am not clicking on them if it takes too long
23:47:06 <cn3m[m]> #1 I don't want to see that shit
23:47:06 <cn3m[m]> #2 it takes too long
23:47:15 <cn3m[m]> so explain before dumping images
23:47:16 <cn3m[m]> or I will ban you
23:48:48 <cn3m[m]> retry0x: I can't find it on the android app
23:48:50 <cn3m[m]> you might have to try fluffy chat?
23:49:16 <nikitalita[m]> >:O
23:49:46 <cn3m[m]> at this point whenever I see someone join I just sit on ban with the reason already typed in xD
23:50:00 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, this is starting to get really obnoxious
23:50:50 <cyredanthem[m]1> Use IRC
23:50:52 <nikitalita[m]> like, discord solves this by allowing embeds to be a permission assignable to a role
23:51:11 <nikitalita[m]> matrix doesn't have that
23:51:14 <cn3m[m]> <xohoh[m] "well don't ban me i just joined "> okay I was hovering over the button
23:51:15 <nikitalita[m]> you have admins and mods
23:51:18 <nikitalita[m]> thats it
23:51:21 <cn3m[m]> I didn't though
23:51:24 <cn3m[m]> that was tense
23:52:03 <nikitalita[m]> sigh
23:52:24 <nikitalita[m]> i'm wondering if we should even bother with matrix for public rooms
23:52:36 <nikitalita[m]> this shit is publicly logged anyway
23:52:45 <cn3m[m]> wow I am the most power hungry mod here I have banned more people than every mod ever combined
23:52:55 <nikitalita[m]> and discord has irc bridges
23:52:56 <cn3m[m]> /s
23:53:17 <cn3m[m]> fuck it we should move to reddit chat /s
23:55:21 <cn3m[m]> sorry guys
23:55:22 <cn3m[m]> I was slow asking for help
23:55:22 <cn3m[m]> from techlore
23:55:42 <cn3m[m]> I will get this figured out
23:55:48 <nikitalita[m]> ok
23:55:52 <nikitalita[m]> are there any other mods online
23:56:04 <cn3m[m]> no it is just me
23:56:10 <nikitalita[m]> sigh
23:56:15 <refragable[m]> <xohoh[m] "oh i see them now that i'm on ma"> yep https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200806#c4670135
23:56:29 <nikitalita[m]> there's no fucking way to disable embeds on mobile, no
23:56:42 <nikitalita[m]> christ, element sucks so fucking much
23:56:49 <cn3m[m]> nikitalita: use FluffyChat
23:57:01 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
23:57:06 <nikitalita[m]> use another client
23:58:00 <nikitalita[m]> this is another reason I don't recommend matrix to anyone
23:58:11 <nickcalyx[m]> IRC sucks in some ways but at least its mature
23:58:17 <nickcalyx[m]> Matrix is too young
