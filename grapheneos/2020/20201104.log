16:59:25 <kradav[m]> Aloha o/ are builds ever pulled, if serious issue[along the lines of damaging or wiping data on device] is reported?
17:00:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hi kradav[m], the builds should be tested prior to going out to stable.
17:00:52 <TheJollyRoger> Note though, that by design, you can't actually downgrade or revert to an older version of the operating system. The security chip is designed to prevent this to mitigate downgrading or rollback attacks.
17:01:28 <TheJollyRoger> r0tt0r[m]: Attestation server might not yet support it at the moment. Help is needed from the community, unfortunately.
17:02:04 <jpds> r0tt0r[m], TheJollyRoger: The auditor version in the beta channel has support for the 4a
17:03:11 <TheJollyRoger> jpds: I'll have to check attestation server.
17:03:46 <r0tt0r[m]> <jpds "r0tt0r, TheJollyRoger: The audit"> i updated the apk manually beforw advised not to though it worked and i verified the shown hashes and info
17:04:03 <r0tt0r[m]> * i updated the apk manually beforw advised not to though it worked and i verified the shown hashes and info. if needed i can redo
17:04:31 <kradav[m]> Not being able to rollback is a feature I'm looking forward to [as I eventually migrate to GOS]
17:05:20 <TheJollyRoger> kradav[m]: yep! It's a big draw of the security chip.
17:07:16 <TheJollyRoger> r0tt0r[m]: got it. If you're worried about getting a counterfeit version of the app, I'd say that's not a big issue; Android security policies only allow an app to be updated if -- and only if -- it was signed by the key that first installed it. So if it was a counterfeit version of Auditor, it won't install and you'll get an "App was not installed" error.
17:07:53 <r0tt0r[m]> <TheJollyRoger "r0tt0r: got it. If you're worrie"> oh well that is good to know
17:09:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The way Android works is that within each .apk file, there's a digital signature file and a digital certificate contained in it that validates the entire package, down to the very last bit. When you first install an Android app, the operating system will pin the certificate that came with the .apk, and not allow that .apk to be updated unless future versions of the app match that same
17:09:22 <TheJollyRoger> certificate.
17:10:05 <TheJollyRoger> So even if I was to push counterfeit updates or send you a counterfeit apk, without that private key, your phone will reject them, unless I was to compromise the app /before/ you installed it.
17:10:16 <TheJollyRoger> It's quite elegant.
17:11:21 <TheJollyRoger> If I recall correctly there is a way to roll over the certificates now with future certificates validated by the previous one.
17:19:25 <cenapatop689[m]> how do I add blah dns Japan to bromite browser https://blahdns.com/
17:20:31 <TheJollyRoger> cenapatop689[m], you might have to ask the bromite community about that.
17:23:32 <cenapatop689[m]> Ah
17:23:56 <cenapatop689[m]> I have it. Jp is down singapor works
17:24:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Bromite isn't really a part of GrapheneOS. A few people here might use it though, we'll see if someone does pipe up.
17:32:24 <Kurai> cenapatop689[m] https://www.bromite.org/doh
18:13:35 <cenapatop689[m]> Kurai: I have it done
18:15:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If I recall correctly there is a"> There always was
18:18:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger in the past if you wanted to change an app's signing key
18:18:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> You would sign the app with both the old and the new key
18:19:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> With v3 the old signature has to sign the new signature and only the new signature is actually signing everything
18:20:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let's say you wanted to change the signature again, then with v3 you make a linked list where the first key would have to sign the one after it and that key has to sign the new key
18:21:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> * With v3 the old key has to sign the new (public) key and only the new key is actually used for signing everything
18:21:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why? Because see the old approach
18:21:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> The old approach is sign with both keys, then the next release should only be signed by the new key
18:22:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> This means that applications that check your signature will need to update the public key they need to check when you change your signature
18:22:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> With v3 that doesn't happen
18:23:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since the old key has to tell the system about the validity of the new one every release and you have to maintain the chain
18:24:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Apps can keep using the old signature to check if your app is not tampered with
18:28:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Though this also means they should switch to the new signature soon
19:35:44 <strcat[m]> eglssm: unless you're going to submit appropriate wallpapers and boot animation zip (based on what we want) via pull requests and make sure it's all done properly
19:35:49 <strcat[m]> eglssm: then it involves substantial developer time
19:36:02 <strcat[m]> it's not just about making an animation, it has to be in the right format without errors
19:36:58 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: unlocking the SIM is just to unlock the SIM, you can take the SIM card out of the phone... it's not a feature to secure the OS in any way
19:37:42 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: I don't see how storing data on the SIM card could possibly help secure the OS, by the time it's asking you to unlock the SIM, the OS has been verified and booted up, there is no point of it trying to self-verify itself at that point beyond verified boot
19:38:30 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: we want a boot animation but of course we have to like the result and it has to be in the proper format, spec compliant
19:40:58 <cenapatop689[m]> strcat: just an idea
19:41:22 <strcat[m]> there is a far superior security chip built into the phone (Titan M) along with a secure element on the SoC (SPU)
19:48:31 <strcat[m]> need people to test alarms with the Clock app with the November Beta release
19:48:40 <strcat[m]> I need to know if there are any regressions
19:48:52 <strcat[m]> someone reported an issue but it is not clear if it is a regression and I'm missing details on it
19:49:33 <strcat[m]> it's not expected to work properly before the initial unlock because it doesn't have complete Direct Boot support - that's expected, and is a very minor issue, since apps can't be expected to have Direct Boot support anyway
20:10:46 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: oh I see, that makes sense.

21:15:57 <strcat[m]> the way it's done, you don't need to know how to use the terminal
21:16:16 <strcat[m]> you just need to run the commands in the guide, and avoid doing things not in the guide like installing third party fastboot tools / drivers
21:17:11 <strcat[m]> we went out of our way to get the packages for these tools, etc. fixed in Arch Linux and if people want other Linux distributions to have proper packages they'll need to file bugs with the distributions and push the maintainers to fix it

21:19:45 <strcat[m]> if anything you'll have more problems on most Linux distributions
21:19:59 <strcat[m]> because desktop Linux doesn't have a working approach to USB devices
21:20:20 <strcat[m]> so you have to have udev rules for each kind of USB device (which are not all present by default) to access devices as non-root
21:20:41 <strcat[m]> and then there's the chance you'll make mistakes like trying to use broken distro packages, etc.
21:20:47 <strcat[m]> it's not going to make anything easier
21:21:11 <helpiaminstallin> wait so fastboot is supposed to come with standalone ADK tools for Windows, right?
21:21:12 <strcat[m]> the instructions work fine on Windows and macOS if you follow them to the letter with nothing skipped
21:21:34 <strcat[m]> helpiaminstallinggrapheneosona4a: follow the guide's instructions on obtaining fastboot
21:21:44 <helpiaminstallin> I see nothing on Windows so far
21:21:47 <strcat[m]> helpiaminstallinggrapheneosona4a: you should be following the section on obtaining fastboot as your first step, have you done that?
21:22:09 <strcat[m]> helpiaminstallinggrapheneosona4a: you should not be downloading or installing anything from your browser, etc.
21:22:22 <strcat[m]> you should not be installing any SDK or fastboot software, especially not third party software
21:22:31 <strcat[m]> do exactly what is explained in the guide and it will work
21:22:37 <strcat[m]> don't improvise, don't come up with your own approach
21:22:39 <strcat[m]> follow the official guide
21:22:57 <helpiaminstallin> okay
21:22:58 <strcat[m]> start at the top, follow the obtaining fastboot section, and make sure to use the same terminal window for the whole process - don't open another part way through
21:23:18 <helpiaminstallin> so I didn't see a certain command and that appears to have given me the platform-tools folder that I couldn't find before
21:23:19 <helpiaminstallin> thank you
21:23:34 <helpiaminstallin> i'll keey you updated if something else pops up
21:23:49 <strcat[m]> it has you download platform-tools with curl and unzip it with `tar xvf` (on Windows, which has bsdtar)
21:24:08 <strcat[m]> and then it has you add it to the current shell's Path environment variable
21:24:20 <strcat[m]> and then it has you run `fastboot --version` (without changing directories) to make sure that worked
21:24:34 <strcat[m]> and then as long as you use the same terminal window to follow the rest of the instructions it will work out fine
21:25:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> helpiaminstallinggrapheneosona4a pm me
21:27:17 <helpiaminstallin> how do i pm in irc
21:27:33 <helpiaminstallin> nvm i got it
21:27:36 <strcat[m]> in most clients, /query NAME
21:27:45 <strcat[m]> or click their name in the name list if it's a graphical client
21:28:13 <strcat[m]> often /msg is to send 1 message, /query is to open a chat window
21:28:17 <strcat[m]> depends on client, it's not consistent across all
22:00:54 <TheJollyRoger> If you're still having trouble, call my name and I can try and walk you through it.
22:01:13 <JTL> Good ol TJR
22:01:15 <JTL> Nice having you back
22:02:59 <dazinism> Hey TheJollyRoger 👋
22:07:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy JTL, ahoy dazinism!
22:07:34 <TheJollyRoger> Good to see ye again, shipmates! P.-)
22:07:52 <JTL> Likewise
22:16:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> helpiaminstallinggrapheneosona4a had his issue solved
22:16:32 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
22:16:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger also you didn't join the new dev group
22:16:52 <TheJollyRoger> I'll try to be a bit more attentive XP.
22:17:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's matrix only
22:17:41 <helpiaminstallin> yes it is solved
22:18:08 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, huh.
22:18:30 <TheJollyRoger> Currently I'm having a few problems with Matrix, I'll try to see if I can get that fixed.
22:20:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just imagine though
22:21:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> You ever see a chat where a developer personally installs the OS for you
22:21:18 <TheJollyRoger> Ehehehe. ^_^.
22:21:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> xD
22:21:28 <TheJollyRoger> P.-)
22:21:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> helpiaminstallinggrapheneosona4a don't forget to verify your installation using attestation.app
22:22:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ehehehe. ^_^."> Now you have activated the trap card
22:23:59 <TheJollyRoger> The what?
22:24:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger there is no escape, thou shalt be paimon'd https://youtu.be/1exK34r_BaU
22:25:18 <TheJollyRoger> Bwahaahaha
22:59:30 <timont[m]> Quick thanks to devs making this
23:01:33 <timont[m]> After using this rom for 6 months i can say im very happy with it, thanks

23:03:10 <timont[m]> Anyway is this your job or homie
23:03:27 <timont[m]> Hoppy?*
23:05:06 <jpds> timont[m]: It's an open source project
23:05:15 <timont[m]> Sorry for the spam this app very buggy
23:23:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hey timont[m], for the lead developers it is very much a full-time job.
23:25:14 <renlord> hello TheJollyRoger, welcome back
23:25:21 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy renlord! o7
23:25:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, it be good to be back! With a yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!
23:27:50 <JTL> renlord: \p

23:29:08 <TheJollyRoger> fubuki-chan_gets_wasted.gif
23:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> timont[m]: Glad to hear you've been liking GrapheneOS! Since it's a job for the developers but they aren't paid for it, if you can spare the money, consider sending some to the devs, since that's what funds development.
23:47:55 <timont[m]> <TheJollyRoger "timont: Glad to hear you've been"> Will do :)
23:57:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr-harr! \o/ Awesome! Donors keep this project going!
