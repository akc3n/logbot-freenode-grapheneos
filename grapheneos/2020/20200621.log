01:15:32 <radixed9[m]> Qwexi: If you are interesting in testing or ideally developing there are lots of people to talk too
01:43:36 <interceptingfist> <plsbrespectfulgu "would you say it renders shelter"> I was wondering the same thing
01:49:06 <qyo3462572445[m]> Shelter has its own uses I think
01:54:40 <furofuro_01[m]> A little off topic, what could be the reasons VPN-only data consumption app-wise toggle isn't apparently available in GOS?
01:55:13 <furofuro_01[m]> Is there something that isn't secure in implementing such permission, besides the network toggle itself
01:55:55 <strcat[m]> furofuro_01: if you want to force traffic through the VPN, you should set it as always-on with the block option
01:56:14 <strcat[m]> if you want apps to bypass it, use a VPN app with support for that - although it's not generally advisable
01:56:53 <strcat[m]> furofuro_01: we aren't going to implement misleading features giving a false sense of security
01:56:54 <strcat[m]> we don't do that, as a general rule

02:24:21 <angtheephemeral[> Is this on?
02:24:42 <TheJollyRoger> angtheephemeral[: Yes, but Matrix has been having a number of quality-of-service issues lately.
02:25:13 <TheJollyRoger> From time to time the Matrix to Freenode bridge has been known to silently discard messages from one side to the other and vice versa.
02:26:13 <angtheephemeral[> Does anyone else see it perpetually loading (the symbol) when they enter the chat room on Matrix?

02:27:15 <TheJollyRoger> Server must be under very heavy load.
02:28:01 <TheJollyRoger> This is partially why I sometimes stay on the IRC side but in the end I ended up joining via both Matrix and IRC.
02:29:46 <TheJollyRoger> Between a rental VPS running a chatting client so I can remain connected around the clock, and Matrix, I get roughly 70% of the messages sent to me here :D
02:30:43 <concat[m]> TheJollyRoger / JollyRoger Yeah I assume that's probably because your bridge is using matrix.org homeserver, really poor latency
02:31:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
02:31:58 <TheJollyRoger> I don't really feel like changing it at this moment though, so in the end I just join via IRC and call it a day.
02:32:42 <concat[m]> You good bro.
02:33:36 <renlord> why dont you just use IRC?
02:33:56 <TheJollyRoger> Since when one goes down I just fall back to the other and vice-versa :P.
02:34:23 <renlord> does matrix.org have good funding?
02:34:38 <concat[m]> renlord The problem is mainly just the userbase.
02:34:43 <concat[m]> I personally just self-host
02:35:18 <concat[m]> It probably does have good-enough funding if I just had to guess
02:36:22 <renlord> matrix is incredibly challenging to self-host
02:36:31 <renlord> the issue is rich media
02:37:00 <concat[m]> I haven't bumped into obstacles with Synapse yet

02:57:03 <TheJollyRoger> Hey concat[m] awesome.
04:58:30 <plsbrespectfulgu> has anyone went to the effort of removing microphones from pixels? 3&3a specifically
04:59:53 <TheJollyRoger> Don't think so. The whole "remove the microphone" approach is sort of overrated. If the phone is compromised to the point where you'd need to physically excise hardware, the battle's largely lost.
05:01:01 <TheJollyRoger> If you're removing the microphone to earn extra Nerd Credit, by all means be my guest, it's your phone and your money. But if you're doing it to meet a threat model, it requires a lot of extra thought: have you considered that the speaker is essentially a reverse-polarity microphone? Or the sensors?
05:02:21 <rioot[m]> Which is better browser for android, Vanadium or Bromite? And how to install uMatrix Add-on on any of them? Thanks
05:02:49 <TheJollyRoger> rioot[m]: Just use Vanadium. It can take advantage of the hardening and sandboxing and memory safety improvements specific to GrapheneOS.
05:03:02 <proof_jr[m]> <rioot[m] "Which is better browser for andr"> Vanadium, made to mimic chrome
05:03:56 <proof_jr[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If you're removing the microphon"> what about cut wired headphone?

05:07:42 <TheJollyRoger> proof_jr[m]: no, malicious code won't respect it.

05:09:07 <proof_jr[m]>  * so you're screwed if using not hardened device and os?
05:09:32 <TheJollyRoger> plsbrespectfulgu: While I can appreciate the psychological reassurances provided by hardware off switches, in the real world I'm far less convinced that they would contribute meaningfully to what we've already got; if the phone is compromised to the point where you need to actually excise functionality with a soldering iron, you've got bigger problems, namely what happens when you need your
05:09:33 <TheJollyRoger> phone to do things like say /have a private conversation with another person via an E2EE voice chat/?

05:11:15 <concat[m]> Are you advocating for this or saying to avoid it? Your sentence is ambigious.
05:11:17 <TheJollyRoger> proof_jr[m]: "ask the user to exercise good judgement" and putting the responsibility onto them is what got us into the mess of not preemptively mitigating exploits and not building in security as a part of the operating system.

05:25:43 <furofuro_01[m]> I've considered that as well, but it seems that it doesnt work in blocking off sound recognition
05:26:11 <TheJollyRoger> furofuro_01[m]: THe microphone plug doesn't switch off the microphone plug, likely it just tells the operating system "hey something's plugged in, could you recognize that?" and leaves the rest to the host to determine.
05:26:53 <proof_jr[m]> probably only works if physical switch happens when headphone connected
05:27:20 <proof_jr[m]> like a switch in an electrical circuit
05:27:59 <furofuro_01[m]> Yeah, that makes sense. Sadly, I can't really block it off...
05:27:59 <furofuro_01[m]> (Welp. If only sites stop recording voice without permissions...)
05:30:03 <furofuro_01[m]> It's my plan soon on GrapheneOS, for closed source app reasons on other profiles, to block off voice recording (esp. Zoom)
05:30:12 <furofuro_01[m]> when running in background
05:31:48 <furofuro_01[m]> Not sure how to deal with that threat model of mitigating sound recording being used as identification on some sites.
05:31:48 <furofuro_01[m]> I had confirmed from my other account that it still records sounds even without permission toggled.
05:32:14 <proof_jr[m]> progressive web apps?
05:34:27 <furofuro_01[m]> Will try that... I'm using web app wrappers and Bromite for those sites
05:35:09 <furofuro_01[m]> Will never use social media sites app though
05:35:57 <TheJollyRoger> furofuro_01[m]: switch off microphone permission to your web browser.
05:36:11 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't trust Vanadium's permission to deny audio.
05:36:48 <TheJollyRoger> The permissions on Android are enforced by SELinux Mandatory Access Controls. Breaking them would require /breaking the entire Linux Kernel/.

05:39:17 <furofuro_01[m]> Maybe the problem was caused by my browser before in an older Huawei phone... or on an offical LineageOS
05:39:17 <furofuro_01[m]> Not sure how they still got a voice recording
05:40:24 <furofuro_01[m]> * It's my plan soon on GrapheneOS, for closed source app reasons on other profiles, to block off voice recording (esp. Zoom).
05:40:24 <furofuro_01[m]> Edit: I don't have GrapheneOS yet, in the near future I'll have a Pixel for it.
05:41:06 <TheJollyRoger> Unless you do something like say... install some dodgy "Kustum ROM!!1shift+1" that rolls back the SELinux policies in the name of increased user permissiveness for people who want to play sysadmin with their phones, or some other Android OEM vendor that doesn't care about security and doesn't do what Google says (and then lies about it), the permissions toggles in Android are enforcing.
05:43:13 <furofuro_01[m]> ^ Reason I'm itching to switch on GOS soon.

06:23:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, using GPG.
06:23:43 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, ah, openkeychain uses gpg

06:47:42 <nickcalyx[m]> especially now that adb backup is being deprecated.. and regular users can't or won't want to do that kind of backup anyway, and it just isn't elegant or straight forward

06:49:40 <TheJollyRoger> dq[m]: we don't support root on GrapheneOS.
06:50:54 <TheJollyRoger> Also, those default connections are made to camouflauge your device as any other Android device on the network. Disabling the default connections will make your device stand out because it's no longer making them, increase the uniqueness of the device's fingerprint and make it easier for your network provider to track your device.
06:54:28 <dq[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Also, those default connections "> TheJollyRoger: My DNS server blocks all these DNS request anyway. And the grapheneos time server clearly shows its grapheneos. That's why I am okay to just disable connectivity check.
06:55:37 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, your device. Root's not supported though.
06:56:58 <dq[m]> I read on FAQ but still want to disable connectivity check. I have done this on Replicant and Lineages.  Thanks TheJollyRoger for your in info.
09:09:55 <dq[m]> How do I stop app from starting at startup on Grapheneos? I want some of my app not to start by itself on each boot.
09:14:39 <yolotro[m]> is that even possible without root? i would like to know also because not using grapheneos atm but i have some apps that always start and i dont want them to start without me launching them
09:19:42 <yolotro[m]> i see some apps on the gplay wich allow that but they require admnistrator permission and are closed source + ads
09:19:49 <yolotro[m]> maybe there is something on fdroid
09:21:59 <yolotro[m]> "SuperFreezZ" on fdroid maybe
09:29:04 <prisonplanet[m]> For me it lacks several vital features in GrapheneOS to be perfect, here they are:
09:29:04 <prisonplanet[m]> 1) In LineageOS, I can selectively allow or block the use of the network for Wifi, cellular data, and VPN. That means I can limit an application to use the internet ONLY THROUGH THE VPN. Without VPN enabled the application can never connect to the network.
09:29:04 <prisonplanet[m]> I know there is a setting in Network - Advanced - VPN - Block all connexion without VPN, but this block all system wide connexion to the 'network without VPN rather than selected app

09:30:04 <prisonplanet[m]> 2) GOS doent include permission control to block application launching on startup
09:31:29 <prisonplanet[m]> 3) GOS doenst have other unlocking method than fingerprint like pattern or weaker pin code (alongside my long and complex encryption password)
09:31:59 <prisonplanet[m]> If these issues were adressed, GrapheneOS would be absolutely perfect
09:33:15 <dq[m]> prisonplanet: Yes, I am experimenting with NextDNS VPN app. Internet doesnot work at all if I enable Block connection without VPN. and even if I just enable Always-on VPN and disable the Block connection without VPN, it still leaks DNS.

09:34:50 <prisonplanet[m]> <dq[m] "prisonplanet: Yes, I am experime"> Yes, the setting "Block internet without VPN" is good but its block all system wide network acces to all application. It would be much better to add the possibility to block network without VPN to app permission level
09:35:49 <yolotro[m]> the screensht is not leaks, it's normal behavior
09:35:57 <dq[m]> dq: Internet doesnot work at all if I enable Block connection without VPN after reboot or startup.
09:37:19 <dq[m]> yolotro: this is my DNS server(Pihole) at home, but it should have gone to nextdns server instead of my home dns server.
09:37:29 <prisonplanet[m]> <prisonplanet[m] "Yes, the setting "Block internet"> This feature is integred in LOS, adding this in GOS should not be difficult I think
09:40:24 <yolotro[m]> the screeenshot it's the feature that check if you have internet on the device, i think that it's normal that it don't pass through vpn
09:41:27 <yolotro[m]> but i'm not expert, maybe someone else knows better about this
09:43:53 <yolotro[m]> i think it's related to the feature that display a little X on the signal bar if internet is not working

09:44:53 <marquisderad[m]> Hi
09:47:56 <marquisderad[m]> I'm looking for some advice on where to look or how to go about developing a feature for Graphene that would allow a dummy key to be used. For example, depending on the key entered a different profile would be loaded and have the other profiles on the device remain hidden

09:50:02 <cn3m[m]> The keys for the profiles are stored encrypted on the Titan M. It encrypts that generated key with your profile passcode. The OS never knows your password(and the Titan M doesn't store it)
09:51:07 <marquisderad[m]> Okay, so the profile itself is required to be available then yes?
09:51:26 <cn3m[m]> To do what you are suggesting the system would have to store the password. Unless you are going to try every user with the same passcode which might be problematic
09:52:02 <cn3m[m]> <marquisderad[m] "Okay, so the profile itself is r"> Could you rephrase?
09:52:25 <marquisderad[m]> For example, the profile needs to be available to switch to and attempt a login
09:53:18 <marquisderad[m]> What about a method of obscuring the other profiles available on device so that the apps installed etc are not discoverable and changing profiles is not accomplished in the regular manner ?
09:53:37 <marquisderad[m]> Could that be accomplished securely?
09:54:31 <cn3m[m]> User profiles can't (practically) detect installed apps
09:54:46 <marquisderad[m]> Yes but the admin account can see
09:54:55 <cn3m[m]> Many people have enough plausible deniability just having multiple profiles
09:55:41 <marquisderad[m]> When you say it would be problematic to attempt using the same password for each account. If there were only 2-3 accounts on the device, would it be a security concern to do this way?
09:56:03 <marquisderad[m]> I am referring to your response above
09:56:34 <marquisderad[m]> Yes I am thinking of ways to take the plausible deniability further
09:56:59 <cn3m[m]> You can do that
09:57:41 <marquisderad[m]> I could do what I originally suggested and have the system attempt the password on each account until it logs in? Yes?
09:57:48 <yolotro[m]> but it require to manually switch to a user profile, it would bebetter to be able to do that easily
09:58:05 <cn3m[m]> It's pretty easy imo yolotro
09:58:11 <cn3m[m]> What more are you looking for?
09:58:25 <yolotro[m]> to be able to do that by inputtig the probile password
09:58:36 <yolotro[m]>  * to be able to do that by inputtig the profile password
09:59:07 <marquisderad[m]> Well my idea is to have the user profiles made invisible, even on the admin profile and then have a discreet way of switching between them
09:59:23 <cn3m[m]> <marquisderad[m] "I could do what I originally sug"> You could do that.
10:00:08 <marquisderad[m]> Could I do it without manually switching user profiles? So for example by providing the key for one profile and have it appear normal
10:00:19 <marquisderad[m]> Like a dummy key in TrueCrypt
10:01:03 <marquisderad[m]> But if the other key is used then a different profile will be initiated
10:01:14 <marquisderad[m]> I appreciate the help thank you
10:03:28 <marquisderad[m]> Where do I need to look at to consider having this feature developed or what kind of roadmap should I be considering?
10:04:16 <cn3m[m]> <marquisderad[m] "Could I do it without manually s"> Yes, it would be a bit of a rewrite
10:05:00 <marquisderad[m]> I am not a developer personally but have some developer friends that would be willing to help if I can explain better what I want to accomplish with the code
10:05:13 <cn3m[m]> Users are accessible from the lock screen
10:05:23 <marquisderad[m]> <cn3m[m] "Yes, it would be a bit of a rewr"> Would it be enough of a rewrite to cause major conflicts with updates?
10:05:29 <cn3m[m]> Not sure what the point of this is
10:05:42 <cn3m[m]> <marquisderad[m] "Would it be enough of a rewrite "> I'm not sure
10:06:05 <marquisderad[m]> <cn3m[m] "Users are accessible from the lo"> I would like to obscure the other users and have them only accessible depending on which key you input
10:06:17 <cn3m[m]> You could have the passcode to be the only way to select profiles, but that wouldn't work since people couldn't use pins and passcodes
10:06:21 <cn3m[m]> Mixed
10:06:32 <marquisderad[m]> Exactly
10:06:50 <marquisderad[m]> What if I locked down the ability as only passcode ?
10:07:22 <yolotro[m]> <cn3m[m] "Not sure what the point of this "> same as the dummy password in truecrypt, that would be very suspicious to switch users profile
10:07:50 <yolotro[m]> > <@cn3m:privacytools.io> Not sure what the point of this is
10:07:50 <yolotro[m]>  * same as the dummy password in truecrypt, that would be very suspicious to use the button to switch users profile
10:09:07 <marquisderad[m]> <yolotro[m] "same as the dummy password in tr"> Yes I want to be able to provide the device and a key which opens a dummy profile and have the other profiles not viewable unless you input a particular passcode for example
10:09:18 <dazinism> The main profile is noticeably different to any other. With main profile you turn on adb and you can then, via computer, get to shared storage of all profiles
10:09:21 <cn3m[m]> What's your threat model on this?
10:09:46 <yolotro[m]> <marquisderad[m] "Yes I want to be able to provide"> oh that's even better! hidden profiles, nice

10:10:27 <marquisderad[m]> I guess that is my threat model
10:10:53 <marquisderad[m]> I want a way for the device to go directly to a user profile and not have the main profile or any other profiles visible
10:11:37 <dazinism> If someone knows what they are doing, they'd know that they were not in the main profile
10:12:22 <cn3m[m]> <marquisderad[m] "This is my concern and would lik"> Then say the Angela profile is your girlfriend's profile
10:12:27 <cn3m[m]> It's a false sense of security and privacy and adds needless complexity
10:12:37 <cn3m[m]> Two things this project tries to avoid
10:12:39 <marquisderad[m]> Yes I understand. I am thinking more for a cursory inspection and also plausible deniability. I can deny knowledge of any other profiles on the device
10:14:05 <marquisderad[m]> <cn3m[m] "Two things this project tries to"> Okay, I understand. Would even the idea of selecting a profile purely by passphrase complicate it more than necessary?
10:16:17 <cn3m[m]> <marquisderad[m] "Okay, I understand. Would even t"> That's my perspective yes
10:16:55 <cn3m[m]> Though you could talk to the developers. What I would love to see added that much simpler is scoped apps
10:16:58 <marquisderad[m]> Okay, even with access to the main profile it is my understanding that if the other user profile is protected by a strong passphrase it remains secure no?
10:17:56 <cn3m[m]> Yes
10:18:10 <marquisderad[m]> <cn3m[m] "Though you could talk to the dev"> Yes that's why I joined the community. As said I'm not a developer myself but want to put some of my resources towards the project and have friends that are developers willing to work with me if given direction
10:18:31 <cn3m[m]> Yeah just jump in
10:18:43 <cn3m[m]> That's how everyone learns
10:18:59 <marquisderad[m]> <cn3m[m] "Though you could talk to the dev"> How do scoped apps work? You mean like they have limited access to other parts of the storage or profile?
10:20:15 <cn3m[m]> Right essentially would be like running it in its own profile access wise
10:21:10 <marquisderad[m]> Yes that is a good feature, I think I misunderstood some of what I read in that I presumed this was already implemented to an extent
10:21:30 <marquisderad[m]> Like the apps being sandboxed essentially

10:26:00 <cn3m[m]> The app access is pretty strange how they are doing it
10:26:13 <cn3m[m]> Overall Android 11 is moving that way, but not a lot
10:26:42 <marquisderad[m]> Why is it strange? Is it particularly difficult to implement?

12:12:25 <defconanon12[m]> I wasn't here for the microphone conversation and I just want to talk about it. Based on Edward Snowdens tweet he states I will desolder the microphones. In a phone there is multiple microphones. In older phones they used to have microphones hidden in plain sight. One of my phones had a microphone in the battery wrapper.
12:12:30 <brenneke[m]> <jalb66 "brenneke, thanks but I finally d"> How are you encrypting on USB?
12:13:30 <jalb66> brenneke[m], I don't, it's only to move files from the smartphone to the PC. But you can use EDS lite and it's compatible with Veracrypt and others. Ii learnt this from TheJollyRoger today
12:14:18 <jalb66> USB OTG works great in my Nokia 7.1 and Pixel 3a with the devide contained in the box.
12:14:44 <jalb66> Very easy
12:15:18 <defconanon12[m]> I don't know if there is a microphone in the battery today but there is multiple. If you disconnect one then there is a few more. He goes to the extreme in my opinion when he talks about removing microphones but most of us aren't in his same position. So I think he has a right to go extreme.
12:15:27 <jalb66> Just now I moved all my photos from the smartphones to my PC
12:18:21 <defconanon12[m]> I agree with his Ethernet adapter cause he basically states WiFi is insecure. Has too many vulnerabilities compared to an Ethernet cable. It just adds another protection layer. I am not saying you can't hardened WiFi. But it will be better in the long run if you switch to Ethernet cables.
12:20:53 <furofuro_01[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I agree with his Ethernet adapte"> True.
12:22:24 <furofuro_01[m]> * True. Not only that, it is also way faster than wifi.
12:23:54 <defconanon12[m]> Yes, which makes me wonder why the people who I guess aren't that technically experienced. Want to switch to WiFi.
12:24:30 <furofuro_01[m]> (I'm not too sure if it's because of convenice or norm...)
12:25:31 <hapssmak[m]> <defconanon12[m] "Yes, which makes me wonder why t"> Because not everyone got a threat model level paranoid.

12:26:52 <defconanon12[m]> * Why do you always assume?
12:27:06 <jalb66> Many people think they are Mr. Snowden

12:27:42 <defconanon12[m]> There Snowden fanboys that would like to be Edward Snowden.

12:29:39 <hapssmak[m]> Seriously, privacy should be about stopping mass surveillance and not sharing data you care about.
12:29:39 <hapssmak[m]> Of course no one besides seriously targeted individuals should stop using WiFi. Go to r/privacy if you're that paranoid, cause they're too.
12:30:12 <defconanon12[m]> Hapssmak you are missing the point.
12:30:40 <defconanon12[m]> I never said stop using WiFi.
12:32:16 <hapssmak[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I never said stop using WiFi."> You asked why non-tech people would use WiFi over Ethernet.
12:33:07 <furofuro_01[m]> I'll take the back seat and watch for now. -eats popcorn-
12:33:39 <defconanon12[m]> hapssmak: Cause it makes sense to use Ethernet over WiFi to me. I am not saying everyone should switch back to it.
12:34:20 <hapssmak[m]> The thing that annoys me r/privacy etc is that they think privacy is a 1 or a 0.
12:34:20 <hapssmak[m]> Seriously it's not. You can eat junk food every now and then and still be healthy.
12:34:51 <hapssmak[m]> You can care about privacy and still use Google services. It's not black and white.
12:35:37 <defconanon12[m]> Yes, I find it an extreme when people remove all they're Google accounts myself.
12:36:46 <hapssmak[m]> I use Stadia etc, cause I don't care if Google know what I game. I doesn't use the Google search engine though, only when my personal choice fails.
12:36:46 <hapssmak[m]> Doesn't matter if Google get a search for me every now or then. The point of that they shouldn't get all of my searches.
12:37:13 <defconanon12[m]> I think that does make them more of an interesting person if you just mass delete your social media accounts and Google accounts.
12:37:21 <yolotro[m]> i think you mean THEIRS, they're is a contraction of "they are"
12:37:48 <defconanon12[m]> yolotro: Excuse me. Thanks for the correction.
12:39:18 <hapssmak[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I think that does make them more"> If they should target everyone who delete their SoMe they're gonna hire a lot
12:40:59 <furofuro_01[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I think that does make them more"> Quite an interesting take. It's discoiraging when people ask for mitigating measures in using privacy-invasive social media sites, and all they get is delete it or bust, it's your choice if you can't delete it
12:41:54 <furofuro_01[m]> What discourages people from caring about their privacy is the 1/0 privacy concept, instead of it being a spectrum. (Sorry kinda joined in a bit...)
12:42:19 <furofuro_01[m]> * Quite an interesting take. It's discoiraging when people ask for mitigating measures in using privacy-invasive social media sites, and all they get is delete it or bust, it's your choice if you can't delete it.
12:42:19 <furofuro_01[m]> Not everyone has the luxury to do so when necessity asks for it sometimes.
12:42:39 <defconanon12[m]> Think about it if people think that they are being targeted then the adversary would see that they just mass delete personal accounts. Thus, the adversary would have more of a chance to go after them. You could argue that I will just space out the time I delete my personal accounts. Sure, if you want to go that route. If your goal is to delete your online life I am not going to stop you.
12:43:44 <hapssmak[m]> There are lots of reasons to delete Facebook etc besides you think you're targeted
12:43:55 <hapssmak[m]> Facebooks disregard for user data is one
12:43:56 <defconanon12[m]> The 1/0 comes from TV and movies. I think people mixed reality with shows all the time. I do agree that there is a lot more than 1/0.
12:46:07 <furofuro_01[m]> In some third world country, facebook is their internet, and not everyone had a choice for an encrypted communication. It's either SMS/Sim call or Facebook Messenger, which makes it quite discouraging...

12:47:30 <defconanon12[m]> Well yeah but in my opinion if you have a Facebook account then just add fake info about yourself and leave the account forever. If you access it again Facebook knows your IP. More than just that. Every time you are in location. It is a false sense of security when there is data breaches that happen a lot on that platform alone.
12:47:38 <hapssmak[m]> People should think about their privacy, what they share and what services they use. Almost nobody should go extreme lengths
12:48:10 <hapssmak[m]> My IP isn't personal stuff.
12:48:37 <hapssmak[m]> It has probably changed several times before a breach happens
12:49:20 <defconanon12[m]> Well there is some IPs that don't change.
12:49:42 <hapssmak[m]> Yes, static. Rare for the average consumer to have that.
12:50:01 <defconanon12[m]> True I see your point.
12:50:18 <hapssmak[m]> Yes Facebook etc is following you around. But IP is far from their nr. 1 method.
12:50:22 <defconanon12[m]> * True, I see your point.
12:52:03 <hapssmak[m]> Let's be real. We don't need systems that has zero telemetry. We just need to stop making mass surveillance accepted and people should learn that services aren't free.
12:53:22 <hapssmak[m]> If you use free services, you probably pay with your data. For most people it's not clear. My friends never really believe when I tell them how much Google collect until they check their account. After that most of them disable the tracking and switch to Signal
12:53:25 <defconanon12[m]> Yeah collectively I don't think that will happen unless the majority people wake up per say.
12:54:24 <hapssmak[m]> I agree. The government will probably never stop it as long as the possibility is there. Therefore everybody should he encryption
12:54:35 <hapssmak[m]> Signal etc make mass surveillance really hard.
12:55:16 <defconanon12[m]> The internet will go off the rails when E2EE is gone. Which I hope never happens.
12:56:24 <hapssmak[m]> Can't be stopped really. Services will just love to the EU.
12:56:56 <hapssmak[m]> They have strong privacy laws and actually care about life quality, privacy and such

12:57:43 <furofuro_01[m]> "So what if they collect your data?"
12:59:24 <furofuro_01[m]> If it was my personal account, would have deleted it in a heartbeat
13:00:37 <furofuro_01[m]> The other owner of the account is unwilling to delete it tbh... -sighs-
13:00:46 <brenneke[m]> <jalb66 "brenneke, then I encrypt the fil"> OK cool, just curious. I do a similar thing except use Cryptomator as can then open on any platform. I like the new USB-C drives, no adapter required for Pixel.
13:01:20 <hapssmak[m]> I think it's because they don't get how much data they get. Google makes it really easy to see (location, apps use time and when etc, every search since day 1 of the account). Make most peopæe freak out.
13:01:20 <hapssmak[m]> Facebook just tells you what it has but it's not as visual.
13:01:20 <hapssmak[m]> People don't seem to understand that Facebook etc is a private company. Why do you give them all your messages, pictures, location and browsing habits? You for sure wouldn't give them to the pizza man. That's also just a random company.

13:05:02 <furofuro_01[m]> And delete as much as possible
13:07:03 * furofuro_01[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/mKvxWyJkfKGroNUGoRFNrdpe >
13:07:10 <furofuro_01[m]> For instance

13:12:21 <hapssmak[m]> They probably know where you live anyways if you have ever used Facebook.
13:13:21 <furofuro_01[m]> Well yeah sadly

13:14:10 <furofuro_01[m]> It's my biggest regret in life

13:15:49 <hapssmak[m]> <furofuro_01[m] "It's my biggest regret in life"> Nothing in your life would have been different if they didn't know you address. Relax
13:17:35 <defconanon12[m]> Depending on the VPN they also track when you are using a VPN and block you when they find out. Netflix is notoriously for doing this.

13:18:50 <defconanon12[m]> It depends how you setup a VPN account and what your threat model was.

13:19:38 <hapssmak[m]> Your home address. Relax
13:19:54 <hapssmak[m]> There are lots of people probably knowing it
13:20:19 <defconanon12[m]> Well a lot more than Facebook yeah.
13:20:46 <furofuro_01[m]> Well to be fair yeah, my point was I was a victim of consuming this crap social media when I wasn't privacy aware...
13:21:30 <furofuro_01[m]> Retroactively, they knew a lot. Now, they would more or less know not so much as before
13:21:55 <defconanon12[m]> I think a good bit of us were and the platforms themselves program people in a certain way of not being self aware and accept it. In my opinion.
13:22:45 <furofuro_01[m]> Pretty much
13:22:53 <furofuro_01[m]> Lucky for those who never used it
13:24:10 <defconanon12[m]> Facebook acts like they are the authority and news. A lot of people depending where you at around the world. You get your news from Facebook.
13:30:51 <furofuro_01[m]> Yeah
13:31:37 <furofuro_01[m]> We're getting a little off-topic.
13:31:37 <furofuro_01[m]> I need mitigating measures since my university uses it as platform of dissemination because many uses it
13:31:58 <furofuro_01[m]> Most probably I'll use something like Frost on GrapheneOS in the future

13:32:56 <yolotro[m]> wait you're just a student but previously u said government agencies is your threat model lol
13:33:10 <furofuro_01[m]> Well...
13:33:30 <defconanon12[m]> You know one of my instructors in a cyber security course advised me to use only Chrome and broadcast our full names on Twitch without making the stream private. furofuro_01 So I know where you are coming from.
13:33:31 <furofuro_01[m]> I could be taking masters and still be in university
13:34:33 <furofuro_01[m]> I'm telling that being in university != just a student
13:34:33 <furofuro_01[m]> Government and private administrations are threat model due to untrustworthiness
13:34:42 <furofuro_01[m]> of them handling the data in a rational way
13:35:33 <furofuro_01[m]> Also, university's surveillance
13:35:36 <defconanon12[m]> Back when I was in my institution they relied too much of letting Google and Microsoft do all the work for them.
13:35:53 <defconanon12[m]> They don't have much of an infrastructure.
13:36:52 <furofuro_01[m]> If only a security and privacy expert would stand and step up to them and change the system -sighs-
13:36:52 <furofuro_01[m]> It was supposed to be a "freedom"-type of university, but we aren't really in control of our data.
13:37:23 <furofuro_01[m]> Let Google or Microsoft handle it, not banning Facebook or Zoom as studying platform, etc
13:37:36 <defconanon12[m]> They always get you on something.
13:37:45 <furofuro_01[m]> (Or rather, forcing students to join some fb group)
13:38:07 <furofuro_01[m]> <defconanon12[m] "They always get you on something"> It's more or less mitigation and compromises at this point.
13:39:14 <furofuro_01[m]> * Let Google or Microsoft handle it, not banning Facebook or Zoom as studying platform, etc
13:39:14 <furofuro_01[m]> Edit: Not fully blaming them though, our country has poor internet access.
13:39:24 <defconanon12[m]> In one of my prior institutions they pushed fingerprinting for getting and paying for lunch. Then we used in one of my earlier institution a social media education platform that had a massive data breach.
13:39:46 <furofuro_01[m]> I had a hunch that they (government) rather keep this to have their people in control, thus I always treat them as threat model.
13:40:28 <furofuro_01[m]> * I had a hunch that they (government and oher agencies) rather keep this (poor internet access, bad privacy and security protection laws) to have their people in control, thus I always treat them as threat model.
13:41:48 <furofuro_01[m]> Thankfully, they (university) have their own education platfom website, although I'm not too fond of their hosting server, nor too sure about its security against data breaches.
13:42:34 <defconanon12[m]> Huh I wonder if they are protected of even the basic attacks?
13:43:14 <furofuro_01[m]> I'm not even sure lol, I am curious and wanting to try, but I rather not get kicked out if I knew how to do it
13:44:32 <furofuro_01[m]> They use third-party scripts (including google(dot)com)
13:44:38 <defconanon12[m]> That is the problem you shouldn't get kicked out you should be congratulated for finding a vulnerability.
13:44:58 <defconanon12[m]> Mainly by the IT staff.
13:45:32 <furofuro_01[m]> Sadly, there is still politics over rational decisions...
13:45:44 <furofuro_01[m]> It's easier said than done
13:46:17 <furofuro_01[m]> Though I might try on legally contributing on such thing if I had the knowledge
13:46:43 <defconanon12[m]> If you are afraid of being kicked out and you ever find a vulnerability then you shouldn't give yourself the credit. Just say someone told you. That is just my advice. They might ask you questions on who and where but act like you don't know. Play dumb.
13:47:37 <furofuro_01[m]> Thanks for the advice
13:48:01 <faxing[m]> Or use a random string of characters for your pseudonym and make sure to always connect over tor
13:48:21 <faxing[m]> then you could take credit with drastically lowered risk of being caught or it linked back to you in any way
13:48:38 <defconanon12[m]> Heh or that. Use Tor correctly and learn from prior mistakes.
13:49:58 <defconanon12[m]> When using Tor it is all about knowing and proving you aren't leaving behind digital footprints.
13:56:50 <strcat[m]> going to be dropping the experimental Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL support and cancelling any plans to support the Pixel 4a soon due to lack of progress
13:57:27 <strcat[m]> people need to step up and help rather than it always devolving into me doing all the work
13:57:56 <strcat[m]> another week left and then scrapping this
13:59:29 <defconanon12[m]> I wish I could help.
14:00:17 <furofuro_01[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I wish I could help. "> Go study Java for now?
14:01:50 <defconanon12[m]> I am pretty sure it more than just Java right? I want to know how I can help. Do I just need to learn programming languages? Which ones? I want to at least be at an intermediate level to contribute more than I am currently.
14:02:06 <strcat[m]> paintedman: none of the workarounds for the Wi-Fi issues are correct or working so I rolled them back
14:02:12 <strcat[m]> doesn't appear that this is going to be properly resolved
14:02:35 <strcat[m]> I'll be moving the Pixel 4 repos to GrapheneOS-Archive and reverting changes elsewhere at the end of the month

14:02:54 <strcat[m]> the changes to the kernel driver aren't right
14:03:05 <strcat[m]> and don't make sense
14:03:09 <strcat[m]> and they don't have commit messages explaining why that would make sense
14:03:25 <strcat[m]> there's supposed to be this wlan_boot sysfs entry
14:03:37 <strcat[m]> boot_wlan

14:10:14 <faxing[m]> oh support for pixel 4 ok
14:10:43 <faxing[m]> i got super super worried because I just bought a pixel 3a for the sole purpose of flashing with graphene like 3 days ago
14:11:00 <strcat[m]> there are no device maintainers for the Pixel 3a
14:11:16 <strcat[m]> it will be dropped soon if that doesn't change

14:11:35 <faxing[m]> well ****
14:12:01 <furofuro_01[m]> I'm also in the process of getting one soon (3a). If my laptop can handle it, and me studying how to do android development... (Can't give any promises sadly)

14:14:05 <faxing[m]> Well--
14:14:27 <faxing[m]> If Graphene goes then what are people who want the utmost privacy and security going to do/use
14:14:47 <faxing[m]> Graphene honestly seems like the only viable option
14:14:50 <strcat[m]> if they wanted it they would have contributed
14:15:14 <faxing[m]> Well many people can't contribute directly or financially
14:15:20 <faxing[m]> It's not necessarily their fault
14:15:53 <furofuro_01[m]> It's the lack of attraction on getting developers sadly...
14:16:37 <furofuro_01[m]> In a practical way, it's preferred that those who would help him are the ones who already had the experience in androi development
14:17:29 <furofuro_01[m]> I doubt trying to start learning android development now would do that much help, but it may bring forth talented peeps
14:17:29 <furofuro_01[m]> (With slight probability),

15:24:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well you'd have to know coding to understand the rest so simultaneously is not the answer
15:24:53 <faxing[m]> From my understanding it takes around a year to get the extended basics so to speak and multiple to be good so I figured that'd take the longest
15:25:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> First you need to find out what you want to work on
15:25:52 <faxing[m]> My plan was to work on whatever the project needed the most help with at the time
15:26:03 <faxing[m]> Is that not what I should do?
15:26:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's not how it works
15:26:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you could learn everything in the world why need more people
15:27:08 <faxing[m]> I mean learn what they need the most now and hope its what they still need then
15:27:13 <faxing[m]>  * I meant learn what they need the most now and hope its what they still need then
15:28:02 <faxing[m]>  * I meant learn what they need the most now and kind of hope its what they still need then
15:28:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's never the case
15:28:48 <faxing[m]> Then what should I try to learn
15:29:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do you go to a dentist and tell him you have a problem with your vision?
15:29:07 <faxing[m]>  * Then what should I try to learn that would be the most beneficial to the project
15:29:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's exactly how this works
15:29:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> People who have in depth knowledge on one particular section are needed right now
15:30:25 <faxing[m]> But I don't know what section I should dedicate my time towards
15:30:32 <proof_jr[m]> then us beginning coders won't be much help to project?
15:31:02 <faxing[m]> The project might not even be around by the time I've learn all of this since it'll likely take many many years but hopefully it'll at least be a helpful life skill lmfao
15:31:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> "faxing" (https://matrix.to/#/@faxing:matrix.org): if you want to do android apps learn java and start reading the docs
15:31:31 <faxing[m]> alright, thanks
15:31:45 <faxing[m]> I was unaware they needed help with the apps, so thanks for the info
15:31:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you want to do kernel work you should read of on C, the arm64 ISA and know at least a few basics of operating systems
15:31:49 <proof_jr[m]> <faxing[m] "The project might not even be ar"> that's me, planning to learn coding as side hobby but discovering pretty much has to replace main job
15:31:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's also compiler work to be done like porting stack probes
15:32:28 <faxing[m]> I don't even know what that means lol
15:32:29 <faxing[m]>  * I don't even know what that means ngl lol
15:32:32 <faxing[m]>  * I don't even know what that means ngl
15:32:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or you could dedicate yourself to selinux/hardened malloc and other sections

15:33:00 <proof_jr[m]> which part has lowest barrier to entry?
15:33:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> "proof_jr" (https://matrix.to/#/@notmyname723:matrix.org): none
15:33:33 <faxing[m]> I'll probably dedicate myself to java for the apps, as I feel like it'll have the most value after this project is inevitably gone
15:33:38 <faxing[m]>  * I'll probably dedicate myself to java for the apps, as I feel like it'll have the most value after this project is inevitably gone one day
15:33:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you're speaking after this project stuff
15:34:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kotlin/dart are getting popular
15:34:10 <concat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Do you go to a dentist and tell "> Yes, and turns out I had eye cavities. Good dentist used his eye retractor with his dental mirror to resolve it.
15:34:48 <faxing[m]> Well I wanted to learn it to help graphene but this sounds like a lot and I can't imagine the project still being around once I've learned all of this
15:35:01 <faxing[m]> it's already on sort of thin ice now
15:35:34 <faxing[m]> i just don't see it being around in 3-5 years if I've even gotten enough experience to help them out by then
15:39:45 <strcat[m]> why do you talk about it like you're the only person who could help?
15:40:02 <strcat[m]> it's not about you
15:40:35 <faxing[m]> what?
15:40:44 <concat[m]> He is? I didn't get that impression.
15:40:58 <faxing[m]> i wasn't at all?
15:40:59 <faxing[m]>  * i wasn't at all
15:41:35 <concat[m]> Uhh probably just str on his high horsey.
15:41:55 <faxing[m]> that just seems unnecessarily aggressive, I was just asking for ways I could help the project most effectively, I not once said it was just about me in any way
15:42:03 <faxing[m]>  * it just seems unnecessarily aggressive, I was just asking for ways I could help the project most effectively, I not once said it was just about me in any way
15:42:31 <strcat[m]> yet you talk about the project dying and not being around because of the length of time it would take you to learn?
15:43:58 <concat[m]> I mean, he was talking about the plausability of it not existing in the future from what I understood.
15:44:22 <concat[m]> Not necessarily that because of his contributions that it'll remain alive.
15:44:44 <faxing[m]> I was referring to you among many others saying the project is lacking funding and code contributors and may not be around for too much longer, so I was trying to find a coding language that could help the project if the project was still around once I was proficient in everything I needed to know to help, and also one that could not only do that but also serve a purpose and be useful outside of the project as well
15:44:59 <faxing[m]>  * strcat, I was referring to you among many others saying the project is lacking funding and code contributors and may not be around for too much longer, so I was trying to find a coding language that could help the project if the project was still around once I was proficient in everything I needed to know to help, and also one that could not only do that but also serve a purpose and be useful outside of the project
15:44:59 <faxing[m]> as well
15:45:13 <concat[m]> faxing We don't need paragraphs now about it
15:45:23 <concat[m]> I think it was just a matter of getting rubbed the wrong way with your remarks
15:45:31 <proof_jr[m]> project lacks devs and we lack coding skills
15:45:42 <faxing[m]> And thats perfectly fine, I just felt the need to explain myself
15:45:46 <faxing[m]>  * And thats perfectly fine, I just felt the need to explain/defend myself
15:46:26 <strcat[m]> people could just step up as device maintainers and start doing that work and then support for those devices wouldn't be in question anymore
15:46:53 <proof_jr[m]> you can't become a device maintainer without necessary skills
15:46:56 <strcat[m]> if what ends up happening is that people only step up for the Pixel 4 then ONLY the Pixel 4 will be supported
15:47:18 <proof_jr[m]> unless you're able to maintain a device using organic chemistry knowledg
15:47:22 <proof_jr[m]>  * unless you're able to maintain a device using organic chemistry knowledge
15:47:35 <proof_jr[m]> if so, sign me up
15:47:35 <strcat[m]> I don't know what people are actually going to step up to help with and companies are generally not interested in helping with older devices unless they started with them
15:47:52 <strcat[m]> so it is up to the community to support anything but a newer device that a company is interested in using and paying developers to support
15:48:00 <strcat[m]> proof_jr: luckily you aren't the only person the community
15:48:02 <strcat[m]> it's not all about you
15:49:23 <proof_jr[m]> I, like many others, want project to succeed therefore I'm stepping up to contribute
15:49:27 <concat[m]> strcat Yeah, no need to be rude about it though. I'm sure he just wants to help. Never did he say his presence alone is the only solution to keep Graphene alive, just that he wishes to help but it'll take time and the future won't be certain for the project.
15:49:48 <concat[m]> Your attitude could be what could deter people from wanting to help
15:49:57 <faxing[m]> <strcat[m] "people could just step up as dev"> You still need a lot of the same or similar knowledge to be a device maintainer
15:50:00 <strcat[m]> or it could be the people always discouraging others from helping
15:50:22 <strcat[m]> easy solution is banning people who repeatedly do this
15:50:48 <strcat[m]> disrupting conversations about help that's needed and about development
15:51:02 <faxing[m]> <concat[m] "Your attitude could be what coul"> My thought exactly. I love the work he's doing but he seems overly/unnecessarily agressive to people genuinely asking about ways they can help effectively.

15:52:13 <strcat[m]> I don't see people who want to help, I see people concern trolling from anonymous accounts
15:52:46 <concat[m]> Be more direct, is that just a general statement or are you pointing fingers at someone during this conversation?
15:52:53 <strcat[m]> and trying to discourage others from helping
15:52:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> 🤦‍♂️what the hell did this start
15:52:59 <concat[m]> anupritaisno1 lol true
15:53:17 <faxing[m]> <strcat[m] "if I'm asking for development he"> I was looking to become a developer for the sole purpose of helping the project and asking what the most effective things to do that would be
15:53:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> "concat" (https://matrix.to/#/@concat:spitetech.com): honestly I just see laziness
15:53:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let's say the project wasn't there in 4-5 years
15:53:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> So what?
15:54:07 <faxing[m]> exactly ^^
15:54:07 <proof_jr[m]> let's discuss this in new room
15:54:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> You were there helping and you now have a skill that's actually useful
15:54:14 <proof_jr[m]> to not clog up chat
15:55:41 <concat[m]> anupritaisno1 I'm all about action rather than talk, I agree. But I don't think it's entirely wrongful of them to have some form of concern about the future. I think both parties have a better way of going-about for this situation.
15:55:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> "faxing" (https://matrix.to/#/@faxing:matrix.org): my only advice to you is to find something you like to work on
15:55:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Learn it properly
15:55:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Contribute using the skills you get
15:56:51 * faxing[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/favOnvwIEHMXshsXoahwhIxA >
15:57:19 <concat[m]> Yeah, and if GrapheneOS ceases to exist in the future you can apply the skills for any other project for Android hardening that would exist or create your own.
15:57:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> "concat" (https://matrix.to/#/@concat:spitetech.com): what this guy said ^
15:57:39 <concat[m]> There'll still remain some form of real-world use for these skills.
15:57:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oops xD
15:58:14 <faxing[m]> That was really my main question, was what the best thing for me to learn would be to not only have a skill for graphene, but something that could benefit me in the future after graphene
15:58:22 <faxing[m]> so thank you both for your advice and help
16:00:16 <concat[m]> faxing Java has a good market share in general. Android knowledge may be trivial but Java skillset is always being seeked for. That's what I'd additionally like to add.
16:00:40 <faxing[m]> Thank you very much, that's really helpful
16:00:56 <faxing[m]> I'll focus on learning Java
16:11:44 <nickcalyx[m]> I don't think it would take 4 or 5 years to learn some app development skills in java
16:12:25 <nickcalyx[m]> I think it could be done in under a year
16:12:36 <jalb66> What if every member here pays some dollars monthly and that money is used to hire some developers?
16:13:12 <strcat[m]> who is going to manage that? and who will be hired?
16:13:13 <jalb66> I don't want this project to die
16:13:24 <jalb66> strcat[m], you can decide
16:13:26 <privacy_based_li> Hi everyone!
16:14:02 <strcat[m]> also a few dollars is not going to add up to an engineer's salary
16:14:02 <privacy_based_li> First year cs student here, excited to contribute in as many ways as possible
16:14:33 <strcat[m]> if 600 people gave $5/month that wouldn't be nearly enough to hire someone full time
16:14:53 <jalb66> If we are many people paying those, or even make GOS as a paid project to help monthly
16:14:55 <concat[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "I think it could be done in unde"> Maybe even under 2 months (based off personal anecdote)
16:14:56 <concat[m]> I was eleven when I learned Java.

16:22:45 <strcat[m]> if they aren't already a contributor super enthusiastic about contributing and willing to make huge sacrifices
16:22:46 <concat[m]> strcat You aren't.
16:22:59 <strcat[m]> if you want to hire someone not associated with the project then it's going to have to be a competitive salary
16:23:01 <strcat[m]> and not part-time, unreliable work which leads to nothing productive getting done
16:23:10 <strcat[m]> and they have to be a good fit for it and able to be productive working remotely

16:24:02 <strcat[m]> I can't propose to someone that they should come work on the project for 20% of what they earn atm
16:24:13 <concat[m]> strcat Your employers would likely consist of pseudo-volenteers. Those who would be comfortable working under those conditions for a certain cause. Hypothetically speaking such employment would be managable but the income as stated would remain very abysmal.
16:25:21 <concat[m]> Speaking non-hypothetically the workplace wouldn't be appealing and you will not enconter anyone seeking hirement.

16:44:57 <strcat[m]> concat: as I said if I move on to something else, this is over, for good, and money I get from that new job is not going towards it
16:44:58 <concat[m]> anupritaisno1 The same fate will bestow with the current situation and the approach to postpone until healed because theyre "someone steps up" or "we die". And I think trying to get back in business if nobody steps up could be plausable contraire to discontinuing GrapheneOS permanently.
16:45:40 <strcat[m]> and if the project is dead there isn't going to be a community of people actively working on it or supporting it
16:45:41 <strcat[m]> doesn't make any sense
16:45:44 <strcat[m]> your suggestion is to kill the project and somehow that helps, I don't get it
16:46:04 <strcat[m]> again just seems like concern trolling to me
16:46:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): are you alright BTW?
16:46:37 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "your suggestion is to kill the p"> It isn't, that's a strawman.
16:46:38 <strcat[m]> no
16:47:05 <concat[m]> My suggestion is that if nobody steps up the consequences would be inevitable regardless, and to stop support early and attempt to gather appropriate resources externally.
16:47:42 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "and if the project is dead there"> It's not about the community, if it was we wouldn't be in this situation now.
16:48:01 <strcat[m]> not sure what that is supposed to mean
16:48:13 <strcat[m]> really no idea what you are talking about
16:48:14 <strcat[m]> at all
16:48:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Me neither
16:48:33 <concat[m]> It means that the community is playing little roles with what's going on.
16:48:57 <concat[m]> Not sure why that's really hard to grasp. Unless someone does step up.
16:48:58 <strcat[m]> I am not sure what you think is going on
16:49:54 <concat[m]> strcat It's quite clear what I'm trying to say, the community isn't in your favor now and it doesn't seem like it would be later.
16:50:09 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you mean by that
16:50:23 <strcat[m]> I don't get what you are talking about
16:50:24 <strcat[m]> from the start
16:50:25 <strcat[m]> it is not making any more sense as you go on
16:50:25 <concat[m]> strcat You'll be in a situation where discontinuation would be the best option due to the lack of support, but I'm saying you can attempt to reform it in the future after discontinuation.
16:50:55 <concat[m]> Tell me what's confsuing about my statements.
16:50:56 <concat[m]> Should I structure it one-by-one as we go?
16:50:58 <strcat[m]> there is not going to be any reviving it if it has to be discontinued from lack of support / success
16:51:11 <strcat[m]> it would just be over
16:51:25 <strcat[m]> it makes no sense to start over
16:51:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> "concat" (https://matrix.to/#/@concat:spitetech.com): delaying the resolution for the mess created  is going to end up in more mess created that needs solving later on
16:52:11 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "it would just be over"> That's a mentality, not an objective fact. If you discontinue the project, then you have more time to collect proper resources and start over.
16:52:40 <strcat[m]> I am not sure how it's helpful to talk about these things and turn my requests for help into trying to convince me to discontinue it
16:52:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's easy to ask someone to just quit because you're not in the same situation as them
16:53:00 <nickcalyx[m]> Someone might fork it at that point and continue on, you never know
16:53:01 <concat[m]> I'm saying: why not do such if the opportunity strikes?
16:53:01 <strcat[m]> just derail discussions and try to deter people from contributing
16:53:02 <jalb66> Not a solution
16:53:04 <strcat[m]> opposite of helping
16:53:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> "concat" (https://matrix.to/#/@concat:spitetech.com): that's not opportunity, just plain gambling
16:53:20 <strcat[m]> when I ask for help that's not an invitation to give uninformed advice
16:53:33 <concat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It's easy to ask someone to just"> Nobody's telling him to quit, it's about the inevitable day he will quit if the situation remains the same as it is now.
16:54:10 <strcat[m]> if the project was discontinued it would not be restarted
16:54:13 <strcat[m]> I would not gather resources to revive it that makes no sense
16:54:32 <strcat[m]> it is not in a position to obtain the necessary resources if it is not active
16:54:43 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "I am not sure how it's helpful t"> Where'd you get the idea that this was a proposition to quit? It was rather a proposition to press the restart button rather than the shut down button as you are proposing if the project "gets discontinued". I did not bring that up in the first place.
16:54:45 <strcat[m]> you don't solve anything by discontinuing it
16:54:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): how about selling refurb devices with the OS installed?
16:55:07 <strcat[m]> 'pressing a restart button' is supposed to do what
16:55:08 <cn3m[m]> concat: why do you always come here and criticize a project you don't use?
16:55:10 <strcat[m]> throw away everything
16:55:11 <strcat[m]> all progress
16:55:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys stop
16:55:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Everyone
16:55:16 <strcat[m]> let the people who want to destroy it win
16:55:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seriously
16:55:29 <strcat[m]> and that accomplishes what
16:55:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Instead of killing everything and starting from scratch
16:55:34 <strcat[m]> makes it way harder to ever get any resources to develop it if it is dead
16:55:37 <jalb66> anupritaisno1[m], some people are doing that, maybe strcat[m] could do it with better results, he's the developer
16:55:45 <strcat[m]> how is that a helpful suggestion
16:55:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Think about how we can promote the project
16:55:50 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "I would not gather resources to "> If you're not going to do anything else with your life after Graphene gets discontinued, then I suppose you're right. But I assumed you were going to try to find some other form of income, and if sustainable could be used to rescrape the project back together.

17:10:32 <concat[m]> You're not defending against anything, you're disagreeing with a hypothesis which is a conversation.
17:10:57 <strcat[m]> I can't follow it
17:11:09 <concat[m]> If anything I am defending myself from someone who is influencial in a populated public channel calling me a troll and instigator.
17:11:09 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you're trying to say
17:11:21 <cn3m[m]> You're too damn critical of the responses. This is a great project many of people put a lot of work into and people benefit every day. Please stop you're my friend
17:11:21 <strcat[m]> I didn't call you a troll and instigator
17:11:45 <strcat[m]> I said that those were the actions

I'm fine if you disagree with that.

17:26:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm kind of with him on that one "cn3m" (https://matrix.to/#/@cn3m:privacytools.io)
17:26:47 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "and I don't understand what you "> Contribute to the discussion when someone earlier mentioned future of Graphene, something like that is how it began.
17:26:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> But that's the only way I know it works
17:27:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> "cn3m" (https://matrix.to/#/@cn3m:privacytools.io): basically the problem is that when you load a kernel module you're loading it from the filesystem and this means the filesystem is already up
17:27:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> But when it is built into the kernel
17:27:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> The module comes up before the filesystem
17:28:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is a problem not just on sd855
17:28:21 <strcat[m]> they have a sysfs API that's supposed to be used to signal when it's ready when it's built into the kernel
17:28:28 <strcat[m]> but these changes are disabling that and hacking this into a different API
17:28:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sd865 needs this hack too
17:28:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically that °
17:29:04 <strcat[m]> so I don't really understand why we can't use the intended sysfs api
17:29:15 <strcat[m]> use 1 / 0 instead of ON / OFF, point the path to that as they seem to expect
17:29:27 <strcat[m]> but for some reason the sysfs api wasn't showing up when I tried
17:29:28 <strcat[m]> not sure what's up with that
17:29:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> "cn3m" (https://matrix.to/#/@cn3m:privacytools.io) this whole mess happens because nobody tested qcacld as a built in driver
17:29:35 <strcat[m]> but seems like what needs to be fixed, maybe it's config option, dunno
17:29:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: but they made this sysfs api for this use case
17:29:48 <cn3m[m]> So AOSP works, but GrapheneOS doesn't?
17:29:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> The correct fix "cn3m" (https://matrix.to/#/@cn3m:privacytools.io) is to fix the sysfs api
17:30:03 <strcat[m]> I don't know if it's broken or just not enabled right
17:30:06 <strcat[m]> maybe it was an selinux policy issue
17:30:07 <strcat[m]> dunno
17:30:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> But sadly I am clueless as to what's wrong
17:30:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it seems that this commit is actually needed at least as a hack
17:32:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> "cn3m" (https://matrix.to/#/@cn3m:privacytools.io): ideal solution is Qualcomm fixes this
17:32:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): another thing is
17:32:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why does the prebuilt work?
17:33:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> If our own commit works do we assume the prebuilt does the same thing?
17:33:45 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yes but they probably do it to make the module work properly
17:33:47 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: basically
17:33:53 <strcat[m]> when you use the module you're supposed to use /dev/wlan
17:34:05 <strcat[m]> when you build it in you're supposed to do this via the sysfs interface
17:34:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes I get it
17:34:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've read that code
17:34:24 <strcat[m]> the reason they made the sysfs interface is the /dev/wlan interface isn't available before the driver is up
17:34:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> But I don't know why it is broken
17:34:25 <strcat[m]> so the 2 hacks we applied to the kernel driver
17:34:37 <strcat[m]> 1st one disables sysfs code (maybe we can revert that already)
17:34:45 <strcat[m]> 2nd one hacks the initialization into /dev/wlan
17:34:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> They are making it behave as a module impl
17:35:04 <strcat[m]> yeah
17:35:15 <strcat[m]> but it's clear it's not supposed to be like that
17:35:19 <strcat[m]>  /dev/wlan isn't supposed to be there before init
17:35:37 <strcat[m]> or at least not usable
17:35:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Honestly we should label.those commits with big [workaround] tags
17:35:54 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it works now
17:36:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> And mention them in the issue
17:36:15 <strcat[m]> but this just seems really broken
17:36:31 <strcat[m]> it makes this API available when driver is down
17:36:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): well I'm sorry if I'm not of much help.
17:36:55 <strcat[m]> I think the right approach is reverting the commits
17:37:04 <strcat[m]> and using the /sys API for 1 and 0
17:37:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> 1) I don't have the device
17:37:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> 2) while I can read and understand kernel code I've no past experience in coding the kernel
17:37:04 <strcat[m]> strings
17:37:08 <strcat[m]> and then figuring out how to make sysfs come up
17:38:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): it's not you think, that's how it works on my old devices
17:48:52 <treiz[m]> hello
17:52:08 <cn3m[m]> Hello
17:53:44 <fdsrgheq[m]> Hello
17:54:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hello
17:54:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> We playing this game now?
17:54:07 <gozimas[m]> Hello
17:54:10 <jalb66> lol
17:54:17 <treiz[m]> I'm now, trying to flash my 3axl and ran into an issue
17:54:31 <treiz[m]> *new
17:54:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay what's the issue
17:55:28 <treiz[m]> I get to the step to run flash-all.bat and cmd opens and crashes
17:56:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Probably means you don't have adb installed
17:56:39 <treiz[m]> I'm using the portable version, I'll try the installed version
17:57:09 <jalb66> Follow the guide in the webpage and use Powershell
17:57:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Feel free to ask "treiz" (https://matrix.to/#/@treiz:matrix.org) I'll help you get it installed
17:58:12 <treiz[m]> yeah, I was following techlore's video
17:58:28 <treiz[m]> haven't flashed a rom in a long time
17:58:35 <jalb66> Follow the guide too, many peoplee followed that video and it miss some things
17:59:20 <jalb66> In Windows you must use Powershell
18:07:41 <TheJollyRoger-M> treiz: if you use the portable version of adb/fastboot, you will likely end up with a "fastboot too old" error or if you force it, something that won't boot. You'll want to follow the official instructions.
18:08:31 <faxing[m]> Just follow the text guide exactly and you should be fine. Videos like that can become outdated quickly as well
18:10:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> "treiz" (https://matrix.to/#/@treiz:matrix.org): anyway if you absolutely can't get it working you can try my alternative guides
18:10:49 <TheJollyRoger-M> treiz: I can give you a hand once I return to the computer.
18:11:30 <treiz[m]> looks like I missed the step of downloading the platform tools >.<b
18:11:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> "JollyRoger" (https://matrix.to/#/@JollyRoger:matrix.org): Google's web flasher is open source?
18:13:26 <TheJollyRoger-M> <anupritaisno1[m] ""JollyRoger" (https://matrix.to/"> I didn't know google had a browser based utility!
18:17:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW in all this argument today I've forgotten to make dinner
18:19:21 <dazinism> Go eat your supper!
18:25:44 <treiz[m]> I'm not making any headway with powershell
18:27:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> "treiz" (https://matrix.to/#/@treiz:matrix.org): use my method
18:28:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Extract the image-whatever.zip
18:28:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot flash boot boot.img
18:28:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot flash avb_custom_key avb_pkmd.bin
18:28:30 <jalb66> anupritaisno1[m], where is your method?, I'd like to read it :)
18:28:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot reboot recovery
18:28:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> adb sideload the full OTA
18:29:12 <hypokeimenon[m]> Is a small name ARM arch CPU usually a better bet for security than an x86 CPU?
18:29:18 <strcat[m]> or just ./flash-all.sh
18:29:41 <strcat[m]> it auto reboots to fastboot mode now too (in the dev branch)
18:29:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> "jalb66" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_jalb66:matrix.org): actually there's an option in img_from_target_files to generate a bootable only image
18:29:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> The -z flag enables it
18:30:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well I use it to my advantage
18:30:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Shipping just a boot.img and sideloading a full OTA is about 300 mb smaller than getting a fastboot image
18:30:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also the amount your computer needs to verify is minimal
18:31:08 <strcat[m]> yeah because the format is bad
18:31:10 <strcat[m]> if you turn off compression for the inner zip
18:31:21 <jalb66> Can you tell me the link?
18:31:27 <strcat[m]> and the outer part .tar.xz instead of a zip
18:31:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> You need to just verify a small file containing a boot.img and the recovery handles all the verification
18:31:28 <strcat[m]> it's smaller than an ota
18:31:54 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the issue with the factory images format is that the inner zip has compression enabled, and zips do per-file compression not overall
18:32:07 <strcat[m]> and zip is DEFLATE
18:32:10 <strcat[m]> OTA uses better compression
18:32:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Think OTA does puffin right?
18:33:02 <strcat[m]> it uses a mix of xz and other things
18:33:19 <strcat[m]> although ppl are generally downloading a delta
18:33:25 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS always releases a delta from past release -> currenmt
18:33:33 <strcat[m]>  * GrapheneOS always releases a delta from past release -> current
18:33:35 <strcat[m]> and that's used by the updater if it's available
18:33:57 <strcat[m]> if we do really close releases then we try to make multiple deltas
18:34:02 <strcat[m]> current -1 to current
18:34:05 <strcat[m]> and also current -2 to current
18:34:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway there's an option to make a zip with just a recovery
18:34:42 <strcat[m]> if you look at the archive
18:34:53 <strcat[m]> we used to disable compression for the factory images inner zip
18:34:54 <strcat[m]> and then use .tar.xz for outer
18:35:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://github.com/GlassROM/glassrom-landing/releases/download/20200605-guacamole/fastboot-image-bootable-only.zip
18:36:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just 26 mb, only kernel
18:36:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> 800 mb for the OTA
18:36:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Compared to 1.2 GB for fastboot
18:36:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> img_from_target_files -z

18:39:37 <cdesai> Wait do incremental updates not work at all in taro?
18:39:41 <cdesai> Twrp*
18:40:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> "cdesai" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_cdesai:matrix.org): ?
18:40:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes broken on purpose
18:41:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> In fact twrp is the reason why anything other than glassrom uses an older encryption format
18:41:32 <jalb66> What is glassrom?, another system?
18:41:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> On the oneplus 7 pro
18:42:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> "jalb66" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_jalb66:matrix.org): you use it to get close to grapheneos security on devices where porting it isn't possible
18:42:39 <jalb66> Oh I didn't know it, thanks
18:42:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is usually due to nonstandard hardware additions that cannot be easily added to grapheneos
18:43:49 <jalb66> With the same security and verified boot?
18:44:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Verified boot does exist
18:44:27 <jalb66> Ok
18:44:31 <dallemon[m]> strcat: i completed the regular cts the other day on the pixel 4 xl, i'm going to run another tonight with my new build that i just finished (started around 1300 CET). would you like the results compiled into a gist using this template: https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/For%20Testers/Android-10-cts-report-template.txt
18:44:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Some of the security work needs help porting
18:44:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mostly the selinux policy
18:45:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> "dallemon" (https://matrix.to/#/@dallemon:matrix.org): yes
18:45:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Definitely do that
18:45:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Would help a lot
18:45:36 <TheJollyRoger> dallemon[m]: be sure to check the example as well, and include what error messages it prints.
18:46:02 <dallemon[m]> TheJollyRoger: of course :)
18:46:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> "dallemon" (https://matrix.to/#/@dallemon:matrix.org): send me a copy too in pm
18:46:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will need it for reference
18:46:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also please check everything related to WiFi in the CTS verifier app
18:47:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> We used a hack to get WiFi working and need to catch obvious gotchas
18:47:19 <dallemon[m]> anupritaisno1: full report or based on the template?
18:47:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Eventually that hack will be dropped
18:47:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Base off the template
18:48:25 <dallemon[m]> the source i have must be from just before the wifi fix/hack :/
18:48:46 <strcat[m]> dallemon: wifi is just now working
18:48:47 <strcat[m]> today
18:49:11 <dallemon[m]> ah, and my sources are approx 7hrs old
18:49:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can just repo sync
18:49:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> make installclean
18:49:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> rm -rf release-whatever
18:49:52 <nokkuda[m]> Is GOS pure AOSP or does it also have some Lineage cherry picks?
18:49:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> And rebuild quickly
18:50:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> "nokkuda" (https://matrix.to/#/@nokkuda:matrix.org): no lineage here
18:50:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> I think we have a few in network stack
18:50:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> But nothing specific
18:50:59 <TheJollyRoger> nokkuda[m]: GrapheneOS has never used Lineage as an upstream provider. GrapheneOS does incorporate some things from other projects, such as SeedVault for doing encrypted backups.
18:51:53 <nokkuda[m]> I'm going to reinstall my pixel3a, but not sure yet whether I go for LOS or GOS. I did use Copperhead in the past.
18:52:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> "nokkuda" (https://matrix.to/#/@nokkuda:matrix.org): go for grapheneos
18:52:08 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, here's the million dollar question then:
18:52:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you want security
18:52:31 <TheJollyRoger> Do you want /actual/ security, not just a bunch of theatrics, menus, and tweakables? If so, go for GrapheneOS.
18:53:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> "nokkuda" (https://matrix.to/#/@nokkuda:matrix.org): problem with lineage is that they treat pixel as hobby devices
18:54:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nobody cares about maintaining pixel until they go EoL
18:54:10 <nokkuda[m]> Well yeah. Security is Graphene's main selling point :) but I'm surely going to miss Magisk/AdAway et al.
18:54:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Personal DNS filter
18:54:39 <nokkuda[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Nobody cares about maintaining p"> Yeah the pixels dont get much love currently.
18:54:40 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the NetworkStack change is mine
18:55:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): ah okay
18:55:14 <nokkuda[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Personal DNS filter "> With VPN? I use dnscrypt proxy on the desktop with blacklist support
18:56:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Huh
18:56:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): either I was really tired or I saw a few more commits on network stack the other day
18:56:34 <strcat[m]>  nokkuda I recommend reading the main page on the site and the FAQ
18:56:38 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: those were also my changes, just rolled back
18:56:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm not sure anymore
18:56:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh okay
18:57:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> "nokkuda" (https://matrix.to/#/@nokkuda:matrix.org): grapheneos is meant to be used on a locked bootloader so magisk is out of the question
18:58:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Besides we absolutely can't support it
18:58:06 <nokkuda[m]> I did. Seems like I have to read again. But can I use a Dns filter even when using the VPN's Dns?
18:58:27 <nokkuda[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] ""nokkuda" (https://matrix.to/#/@"> I'm aware of that
18:58:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Magisk causes issues like boot races which can destabilize graphene's security
18:58:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> But mostly are an annoyance
18:59:05 <treiz[m]> woot!  it's flashing
18:59:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> The problem is that magisk is on /data
18:59:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> And /data is mounted like almost dead last
18:59:51 <strcat[m]> nokkuda: yes read the FAQ entries about DNS
18:59:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> So magisk has to kill boot processes, load modules and restart them after
18:59:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sometimes it doesn't restart them correctly
19:00:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> This can cause issues and several have been documented
19:00:14 <strcat[m]> it would totally defeat the purpose of verified boot
19:00:16 <strcat[m]> so no point of trying to mix them
19:00:47 <strcat[m]> among other things
19:00:59 <nokkuda[m]> Well I think I'll give Graphene a try next week. Maybe I can manage without Magisk and all the bells&whistles ;)
19:02:04 <TheJollyRoger> nokkuda[m]: having verified boot, being able to take advantage of the full hardware security features on your phone, proper OTA updates, and full, production-quality releases is going to vastly outweigh the extra Power User cred.
19:02:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> "nokkuda" (https://matrix.to/#/@nokkuda:matrix.org): well there's other issues
19:02:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Down the road enabling yama is planned
19:02:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's already enabled on glassrom BTW
19:03:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> And yama breaks magisk hide completely
19:03:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> The reason is that magisk calls ptrace_attach on processes and yama blocks processes from calling ptrace for security reasons
19:03:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Magisk having absolutely zero error handling keeps on retrying the ptrace call
19:04:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Causing magiskd to use 100% of 1 CPU core
19:04:20 <nokkuda[m]> Thx for the explanation.
19:04:20 <nokkuda[m]> As browser, do you recommend Bromite?
19:04:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Bromite and vanadium are the only recommended browsers
19:05:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> For security that is
19:05:46 <TheJollyRoger> nokkuda[m]: just use Vanadium.
19:06:15 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium and GrapheneOS were developed in parallel to take advantage of the security improvements specific to each other.
19:06:18 <TheJollyRoger> Use them together.
19:06:37 <nokkuda[m]> Does it have ad blocking feature (it's an absolute must have for me)?
19:06:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> "nokkuda" (https://matrix.to/#/@nokkuda:matrix.org): I advise you read the wiki. It has answers to most frequently asked questions
19:07:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> "nokkuda" (https://matrix.to/#/@nokkuda:matrix.org): bromite does
19:07:12 <nokkuda[m]> Hence my question
19:07:38 <nokkuda[m]> I'm happy with Bromite on stock ROM already
19:09:30 <treiz[m]> Phone flash complete, thanks for the help!
19:10:55 <nokkuda[m]> Well thanks to all, I'll give it a try and report back in case of issues/questions.
19:10:55 <nokkuda[m]> Bye
19:11:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> "nokkuda" (https://matrix.to/#/@nokkuda:matrix.org): you should read the official website instructions
19:11:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Many of the questions you asked are already answered there
19:11:41 <nokkuda[m]> I will. Don't remember all the fastboot commands ;)
19:13:01 <jalb66> treiz[m], congrats!
19:13:18 <jalb66> Don't forget to lock it
19:13:42 <treiz[m]> I did
19:13:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> > Don't forget to lock it
19:13:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> I laughed
19:15:24 <jalb66> 😀
19:30:52 <nikoleos[m]> Hi, is there a grapheneOS compatible api or app as alternative to google maps api like mapbox or osmand in microG , an api that is madatory for some app ?
19:35:49 <cn3m[m]> nikoleos: https://bubu1.eu/openpush/ this is the only attempt I've seen
19:45:21 <faxing[m]> should I enable 'Lock SIM card'?
19:45:52 <faxing[m]> I've heard people saying to enable it but without any explanation to why
19:47:16 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m]: Sim Card Lock simply means that someone'll have to enter the pin if they take your SIM card out and stick it into another cellphone.
19:47:51 <faxing[m]> So it's a good protection for sim swapping?
19:48:08 <TheJollyRoger> If you believe your adversary would surrepticiously remove the SIM card from your phone and place it into another phone, yes.
19:48:41 <faxing[m]> eh couldnt hurt
19:48:41 <TheJollyRoger> However it will do /nothing/ if they call up your service provider and trick the kid being paid $8.50 an hour to say "Have you tried turning it off, then back on again?" into porting out your number to another card.
19:48:42 <faxing[m]> thanks for the info
19:49:08 <TheJollyRoger> So the attack vector for it is extremely narrow. Yes, it can't hurt, just there are some limitations to it.
19:49:37 <faxing[m]> yeah
19:49:47 <faxing[m]> unlikely for it to help but just a step ill take for the hell of it
19:49:48 <faxing[m]> thanks
19:49:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you're welcome!
19:50:09 <nikoleos[m]> > nikoleos: https://bubu1.eu/openpush/ this is the only attempt I've seen
19:50:09 <nikoleos[m]> I think its more about Google cloud messaging previously called firebase than Google maps api coming builty many apps with included maps and location
19:50:34 <gozimas[m]> If you lose your phone in any way, its good to have on.
19:50:47 <TheJollyRoger> gozimas[m]: yeah, good point there!
19:52:20 <TheJollyRoger> I think that sometime in the future, given the horrors of authentication via phone numbers, phone service providers that hold large amounts of personal data should do a better job than relying on publicly available information like what's my birthday and the last four digits of my credit card.
19:52:36 <TheJollyRoger> Like hey, maybe an attestation from your Yubikey over the WebUI!
19:53:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> "TheJollyRoger" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org): is that possible?
19:53:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Connecting an s-key to your phone
19:54:06 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: Yes, but not over the customer service line. It would have to be done from a desktop or from a phone equipped with NFC or that supports U2F.
19:54:42 <TheJollyRoger> However, what could be done would be if you call in asking your number to be ported out, the staff need to place it in queue and give you exactly 24 hours to log on via the WebUI, click "Approve Port Out" and then plug in your Yubikey and attest.
19:54:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> So android supports Fido U2F?
19:55:17 <TheJollyRoger> Android does, but the U2F implementation in it is currently handled via Play Services.
19:55:46 <strcat[m]> the issue is Chromium uses a library in Play Services for it
19:56:05 <strcat[m]> it really shouldn't be in Play Services, should be a separate library
19:56:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
19:56:20 <strcat[m]> the reason it's there is to take advantage of Play not needing to request access
19:56:21 <strcat[m]> I guess
19:56:28 <TheJollyRoger> Oh :(
20:00:43 <Cyrinux[m]> Somebody using a app for find phone if steal or lost?
20:01:14 <nickcalyx[m]> Good question
20:04:19 <strcat[m]> Cyrinux: if it's stolen and they're not an idiot, they'll turn it off
20:04:55 <strcat[m]> I don't think there is any privacy-respecting app for this
20:04:57 <cn3m[m]> The FAQ covers anti theft in depth

20:05:27 <fluoridatedsheep> <strcat[m] "does Signal have a location-shar"> according to mr robot, yest
20:05:28 <strcat[m]> anyway you would want end-to-end encryption to another device you control that's equally secure
20:05:29 <fluoridatedsheep> > <@strcat:matrix.org> does Signal have a location-sharing feature?
20:05:29 <fluoridatedsheep>  * according to mr robot, yes
20:05:34 <Cyrinux[m]> <strcat[m] "I don't think there is any priva"> I can selfhost services if needed
20:06:19 <fluoridatedsheep> <strcat[m] "anyway you would want end-to-end"> i think they wrote their own script for it though when i come to think about it
20:06:35 <strcat[m]> seems there isn't one
20:06:41 <Cyrinux[m]> Im agree
20:06:52 <strcat[m]> and whatever they have seems to depend on Play
20:06:55 <strcat[m]> I'd recommend just not using anything for this atm
20:07:09 <M0xC0ncord[m]> There are free and open source self-hostable solutions for location tracking. That's the only thing I can think of but it would never offer the other features that some anti-theft services provide like remote commands or remote wiping.
20:07:59 <EssentialChaos[m> <M0xC0ncord[m] "There are free and open source s"> Could that be handled by some other software?
20:08:01 <cn3m[m]> You could, but you shouldn't
20:08:01 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Could that be handled by some ot"> Yes but I don't know of any such.
20:09:11 <M0xC0ncord[m]> All it would take is writing an Android app that provides an agent of sorts that implements those, and likely making that app a device admin. Then you write a webUI or something to interface with any agents that call back to it. Self-hosted malware basically.
20:09:12 <nikoleos[m]> > Somebody using a app for find phone if steal or lost?
20:09:12 <nikoleos[m]> I use phonetrack with my self hosted nextcloud instance in case of loosing my device. If steal , they will turn it off so not effective
20:09:13 <M0xC0ncord[m]> But malware is all about intent in my opinion.

20:14:03 <strcat[m]> still don't think it's particularly useful
20:14:12 <strcat[m]> if it's actually stolen they can and will turn it off if they aren't an idiot
20:14:13 <strcat[m]> and even if they ARE an idiot
20:14:16 <strcat[m]> if they regularly steal phones they will have figured out to turn them off
20:14:57 <nikoleos[m]> > I don't think it should really be a self-hosted service per se but rather E2E encryption to another client
20:14:57 <nikoleos[m]> I wander if a nextcloud can be E2E encrypted , i use to think yes because of https and encrypted data possibility , but i'm just a begginer in open source and security world
20:17:22 <Cyrinux[m]> So for example 'private lock' and regular backup are maybe the solution. And money to buy another phone if this happen.

21:40:20 <TheJollyRoger> privacy_based_li: those are the original Mk. I debugging cables. The Mk. Is are discontinued now.
21:40:44 <TheJollyRoger> privacy_based_li: in all honesty, I don't think they'd turn much of a profit and might even entail a bit of financial risk for us because either...
21:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> Either we do low volume production which means they'd turn out horribly expensive,
21:41:11 <TheJollyRoger> or we try to economize on scale but that means tying up a large amount of money in inventory that will sit on the shelf.
21:41:21 <privacy_based_li> no you guys dont have to pay me or anyone anything
21:41:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah?
21:42:03 <privacy_based_li> Ill get them designed, manufactured and sell them, and whatever money I get I will donate ALL of it to the project
21:42:18 <privacy_based_li> Consider that as my contribution
21:42:25 <privacy_based_li> What say?
21:43:48 <privacy_based_li> And oh ill make sure the t-shirts are cool and everyday wear
21:43:50 <privacy_based_li> with sick designs
21:44:14 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. I appreciate the enthusiasm! But I think we'll have to wait a bit on that. There are some laws around this sort of thing as well as the trademark I don't want to run afoul of at this very moment so I'll have to look into it at my end.
21:44:32 <TheJollyRoger> Since I don't know anything about this at this moment.
21:45:13 <privacy_based_li> Yeah ofcource
21:46:14 <privacy_based_li> TheJollyRoger: Also, you are?

21:46:38 <privacy_based_li> I'm new here so will take some time getting familiar
21:46:42 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just something of a friendly face on the IRC and the debugging cable guy.
21:46:58 <privacy_based_li> Hi Peter, pleasure talking to you
21:47:01 <privacy_based_li> ohkay
21:47:04 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy shipmate!
21:47:21 <privacy_based_li> : )
21:47:54 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I'm currently trying to pick up Java so I can learn more, but actually my area of expertise is mechanical design, mostly part design.
21:48:08 <privacy_based_li> Also, the GrapheneOS logo is copyrighted right? or can I use it freely?
21:48:30 <TheJollyRoger> So, think crankshafts, gears, connecting rods, plastics injection and blow-molding, that sort of thing.
21:48:49 <privacy_based_li> Nicee
21:49:11 <strcat[m]> privacy_based_lifeform: well it can be considered a trademark

21:49:48 <TheJollyRoger> dallemon[m]: ehehehe, that too X3.
21:49:58 <TheJollyRoger> I was a mechanical technologist before I turned to piracy :D
21:51:29 <privacy_based_li> <strcat[m] "people are free to design stuff "> okay, I'll get started with the designs atleast, caz its gonna take a few months maybe to finalize the designs. I'll conduct a survey with a bunch of designs. Can I have the permission sir?
21:52:44 <privacy_based_li> I'll email you the designs first before starting the production and when you give the green light I'll get them to production. Okay?
21:53:44 <TheJollyRoger> privacy_based_li: if you're interested in doing cases, let me know, so we don't end up duplicating work. However, take note that I use Siemens PLM NX11 to do the majority of my designs.
21:54:55 <privacy_based_li> Oh I'd love to do the cases but I dont have a supplier for that. You got any?
21:55:36 <TheJollyRoger> I don't; I originally was planning to have the prototype produced by a contact I knew through work, but I've since lost my job.
21:56:20 <privacy_based_li> oh.. im sorry
21:56:48 <TheJollyRoger> Oh ahahaha no no no it's all alright, I'm doing okay and this has given me a lot more time to try to figure out what I want to do.
21:57:10 <privacy_based_li> Great😊
21:57:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
21:57:44 <privacy_based_li> Alright, so I'll fly off to some work
21:57:52 <TheJollyRoger> Cheers and good luck!

22:03:47 <zozu[m]> Hi there, just a quick doubt, say eventually in the coming months the pixel 4 gets official graphene support. And in the mean time the 4a comes out, Will the same wait and effort have to be applied to the 4a like we're seeing now for the 4, or can we expect a much faster delivery for official support?
22:04:22 <TheJollyRoger> zozu[m]:  it'll depend on the community.
22:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, GrapheneOS is not a business where you pay the money in exchange for a service. GrapheneOS is an open-source project where the idea is that everyone can put in something together, collaborate, and in the process produce something more than the sum of their individual contributions.
22:05:32 <zozu[m]> What I mean to ask is, Will it take the same effort as any new pixel will?
22:06:18 <TheJollyRoger> Well, it's likely that the Snapdragon 855 SoC will end up being very different than the 730.
22:06:22 <TheJollyRoger> But I don't know.
22:07:32 <dazinism> iiuc Think the 4a would be easier once 4 is done... but it needs someone to step up and do the work
22:08:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It'd also be an ongoing commitment to ensure that the phone can be maintained.
22:09:01 <zozu[m]> Considering the 4a may be coming out later this year, is it worth the wait, or would we realistically only se support for it later next year?
22:09:14 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know.
22:09:16 <zozu[m]> Okay, makes sense
22:09:36 <TheJollyRoger> I mean, lemme put it this way.
22:09:43 <jknsec[m]> I wish I could contribute to development directly. I'll try to donate and try to advocate for the project so I'm at least doing something.
22:10:04 <TheJollyRoger> Let's say I put on my phone and go for a jog, and while I'm out there my phone slips out of my pocket and smashes down a flight of concrete steps.
22:10:38 <zozu[m]> Okay
22:10:52 <TheJollyRoger> I can tell you right there in that contingency that I would not hold out for a 4 or 4XL, I would immediately buy a 3a to replace it the moment I get home.
22:11:14 <TheJollyRoger> Because that's a time-sensitive matter.
22:12:06 <zozu[m]> But say you have a really old iPhone and you've been waiting to get a good new phone for a while, and your very privacy and security orientated?
22:12:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> "TheJollyRoger" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org): highly unrealistic
22:12:19 <TheJollyRoger> Then you'll have to make that call.
22:12:31 <zozu[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Because that's a time-sensitive "> (Becouse there, you need a new phone asap!)
22:12:43 <zozu[m]> If it was you?
22:13:09 <jknsec[m]> Doesn't 3a have support until 2022?
22:13:16 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: huh. I keep it in a rubber case and screen protector... but you think it'd survive smashing down a set of concrete steps? I'm not willing to test that out...
22:14:01 <TheJollyRoger> jknsec[m]: yes, it's still got a good amount of time left of firmware updates!
22:14:36 <zozu[m]> Yes! I know, and I'm really inclined to get it soon. My only issue with the 3a is that it's not waterproof
22:14:46 <zozu[m]> Or even resistant
22:14:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...:(
22:15:12 <zozu[m]> And becouse I'm stuck with a really old phone, this was gonna be my big perchase
22:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> To be fair though, my Pixel 3 had its USB slot severely damaged by water that got into the USB.
22:15:57 <TheJollyRoger> The problem with it is that the water tends to get into that USB slot and stay in there so if you get it wet you have to pull it out as quickly as you can and immediately blow the water out of the little slot.
22:16:06 <jknsec[m]> "It's water resistant"
22:16:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
22:17:00 <strcat[m]> zozu: it has some water resistance but not very good and not certified
22:17:05 <strcat[m]> but it does have sealed speakers and some attempts at sealing other stuff
22:17:13 <jknsec[m]> So is the 4/4a going to be better from 3/3a from a security hardware perspective or about the same?
22:17:13 <strcat[m]> mostly just not certified for it
22:17:15 <strcat[m]> and maybe they skimped on some of it
22:17:23 <strcat[m]> jknsec: better
22:17:29 <TheJollyRoger> New chip?
22:17:33 <strcat[m]> but mostly from the newer SoC
22:17:38 <TheJollyRoger> Oh makes sense.
22:18:04 <strcat[m]> it doesn't change much else relevant to security but the SoC generation changes a lot
22:18:28 <TheJollyRoger> I wonder if they're going to use the same Titan M chip?
22:18:31 <jknsec[m]> Yeah
22:18:58 <jknsec[m]> Also looking forward to Android 11
22:19:22 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Knowing Google I'd expect same or better
22:19:34 <TheJollyRoger> Whew!
22:20:17 <jknsec[m]> TheJollyRoger Not sure. I think it's roughly the same as last gen if I'm not mistaken? Maybe slightly better?
22:20:39 <jknsec[m]> Tbh if there are any major chip developments they'll probably be in the 5 maybe
22:48:05 <madaidan[m]> How does the kernel SELinux domain work? It's not like you can confine ring 0.
22:49:52 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <madaidan[m] "How does the kernel SELinux doma"> If the machine has a strict and properly configured SELinux policy, I think the only logical step to further exploitation is to attack the kernel directly, to which there are no SELinux protections.
22:50:26 <M0xC0ncord[m]> I don't know much about SELinux's kernel protections, if any, though.
22:50:39 <renlord[m]> There's none
22:51:22 <madaidan[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m] "If the machine has a strict and "> That's not what I'm talking about. I'm asking what https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/+/refs/heads/master/public/kernel.te is
22:53:10 <M0xC0ncord[m]> I'm going to guess that the kernel domain is for kernel operations that adhere to the same types of access that userland applications can. I.e. if the action requested by the kernel is synonymous with some access that can be done in userspace on some object, it can be assigned a domain and treated like a regular process by the policy.
22:53:40 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: the kernel has threats associated with processes which are confined by the domain for that process (since it's doing operations on their behalf, etc.)
22:53:58 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it's not the code that's confined it's the operations it does
22:53:59 <strcat[m]> that have security checks
22:54:08 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: the kernel domain is for the same stuff when not associated to a userspace process
22:54:37 <strcat[m]> including when the kernel spawns userspace helpers
22:54:38 <strcat[m]>  * madaidan.: the kernel has threads associated with processes which are confined by the domain for that process (since it's doing operations on their behalf, etc.)
22:55:03 <strcat[m]> a userspace helper runs in that domain
22:55:24 <strcat[m]> but also the stuff the kernel does itself not associated with a userspace process, where it's doing operations the same way as userspace would via the kernel
22:55:33 <strcat[m]> hope that makes sense
22:55:38 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: the purpose of it is to stop the kernel from ACCIDENTALLY screwing stuff up
22:58:14 <madaidan[m]> Ah, that makes sense
22:58:15 <madaidan[m]> Thanks
22:58:22 <madaidan[m]> That domain has always confused me
23:13:06 <dazinism> strcat: you OK if I see if the izzyondroid repo will add your builds of Auditor?
23:14:00 <dazinism> ... as they picked up PDFViewer, thought they may be interested
23:15:15 <dazinism> Would hope it will get the app and wider project some more attention.
23:26:42 <gozimas[m]> Does anybody know a KeePass app for Android that support Yubikeys challenge - response?
23:28:21 <krillchump[m]> None of the FDroid ones work?
23:29:13 <gozimas[m]> Nope
23:29:27 <krillchump[m]> :(
23:30:54 <strcat[m]> dazinism: it's fine if they redistribute my builds
23:31:36 <strcat[m]> the releases have to be signed with my keys for them to be compatible with the official releases and server due to how the attestation security model works
23:32:04 <strcat[m]> can't be bypassed (without exploiting the OS each boot, and that doesn't bypass the hardware checks, just software ones, which are clearly separated into 2 sections)
23:33:52 <dazinism> strcat : its what they did with PDFViewer so thats cool..
23:34:31 <dazinism> Do you know if you get many people using attestation server with devices other than Pixels?
23:34:58 <renlord> strcat[m]: is that kernel domain specific to when a userland process makes a syscall?
23:35:07 <dazinism> Or roughly how many folks have devices set up with the server?
23:35:12 <strcat[m]> renlord: no that's not what it's for
23:35:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: when a userspace process makes a syscall, the domain for the userspace process applies
23:35:37 <strcat[m]> the kernel domain is when there isn't a userspace process involved
23:35:58 <dazinism> Interested if theres been much interest outside GrapheneOS users
23:36:12 <strcat[m]> each userspace thread has a kernel thread - the normal domain applies to what those do on behalf of the userspace process
23:36:22 <strcat[m]> the kernel domain is for kernel stuff not done on behalf of a userspace process
23:36:44 <strcat[m]> it is not to contain the kernel - that wouldn't make any sense, it is to mitigate bugs
23:36:51 <renlord> ok
