05:38:06 <moaaz47> Hello all!I've compiled the grapheneos for Pixel 3xl (crosshatch). All the steps including the ones for extracting the vendor images and compiling the kernel beforehand were performed successfully. The build also completed successfully. But I cant seem to successfully boot from these compiled images. Flashed system.img, boot.img, vendor.img,
05:38:07 <moaaz47> dtbo.img etc with and without erasing the avb custom key and then flashing the avb_pkmd.bin file ( which i think is the root of the issue ). I've tried flashing the factory images obtained from google itself, and then flashing again these compiled images as guided by some users. I still get this warning when the mobile tries to boot up but ends up
05:38:07 <moaaz47> in bootloader showing this error:"Enter reason: No valid slot to boot"The compiled factory images of grapheneos available here (https://grapheneos.org/releases#crosshatch-stable) run perfectly well, just need to run the flash-all.sh bash file. What am I missing, whats wrong with the images built by me? Can anyone kindly help me out here?
05:39:18 <strcat[m]> moaaz47: flash the factory images instead of trying to do it by hand
05:39:37 <strcat[m]> you should be using the full build process including generating signed factory images
05:39:54 <strcat[m]> unless you just want to do development builds for testing and then you need to understand what you're doing beyond what's written there
05:40:16 <moaaz47> Build the tool needed to generate A/B updates:m brillo_update_payloadGenerate a signed release build with the release.sh script:script/release.sh crosshatch
05:40:29 <moaaz47> These commands dont run successfully
05:40:58 <strcat[m]> okay well the reason it doesn't work is you aren't finishing the build process
05:41:04 <strcat[m]> and you're trying to come up with your own way of doing it
05:41:13 <strcat[m]> so complete the process and don't skip any steps like generating signing keys
05:41:18 <strcat[m]> and read the error messages if it shows them
05:41:40 <strcat[m]> if you closed the shell you need to set up the environment again and I'd recommend just removing `out` and starting over if you've deviated from the instructions
05:41:58 <strcat[m]> can't help you since we don't know what exactly you did and you aren't showing any errors from what went wrong during your attempt to build it
05:42:07 <moaaz47> I just started compilation from the start again and removing the out directory.
05:42:09 <strcat[m]> so perhaps just start over, and don't skip any steps or come up with your own way of doing it
05:42:20 <moaaz47> I'll stay in touch and share my erros
05:42:31 <moaaz47> errors*
05:42:40 <moaaz47> thankyou!
05:44:33 <strcat[m]> the issue is probably just that you tried to use a new shell without setting up the environment
05:44:46 <strcat[m]> so you'll probably succeed doing it again and making sure not to do that
05:45:00 <strcat[m]> if you do start a new shell you need to source envsetup.sh and use choosecombo again
05:45:13 <moaaz47> okay thankyou, now i have a specific question. Im using make instead of the "m" command
05:45:26 <strcat[m]> you should follow exactly what it says
05:45:33 <strcat[m]> using make instead of m doesn't make much difference
05:45:37 <strcat[m]> but just do exactly what it says
05:45:51 <moaaz47> okay!
05:46:02 <strcat[m]> if you haven't set up the environment, `m` won't be available, which is a good thing, since it will stop you from making that mistake
05:47:43 <moaaz47> so the build command given as "m target-files-package" can be run as: "make target-files-package"
05:55:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <moaaz47 "in bootloader showing this error"> You're running the flash-all.sh "bash" file?
06:00:02 <moaaz47> there's none in the out folder so first i flashed individual files and then tried using the same falsh-all.sh as the one in the stable releases, with that ofcourse I made a similar zip for the "fastboot -w --skip-reboot update image-crosshatch-2020.08.07.01.zip" command
06:01:10 <strcat[m]> just use `m` like the instructions say
06:01:14 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't be deviating from them
06:01:29 <strcat[m]> and you should be using `flash-all.sh` with the factory images not coming up with your own way to flash
06:01:41 <strcat[m]> if you deviate from them you're on your own without support
06:02:10 <strcat[m]> follow the instructions on generating signed factory images
06:02:30 <strcat[m]> if you want to make a production release matching the ones on the site. finish following the instructions to that point
06:02:35 <strcat[m]>  * if you want to make a production release matching the ones on the site, finish following the instructions to that point

08:17:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> <osmon[m] "Regarding the Always On Display "> There will be burn in regardless
08:17:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> You just have to wait for QLED displays to be available
09:16:59 <strcat[m]> moaaz47: you're not following the instructions correctly if you don't have `m`
09:17:20 <strcat[m]> you should be sourcing script/envsetup.sh followed by choosecombo and then only using that shell to do the build
09:17:28 <strcat[m]> that's what I was saying earlier
09:17:54 <strcat[m]> the issue you had is likely that you didn't do that - you tried to do stuff in other shells, and ran make there, so you may not have built for the target you think either
09:18:07 <strcat[m]> my suggestion remains clearing out/ and carefully following our official instructions
09:18:23 <strcat[m]> don't alter them - you don't know better, if it says use `m`, use `m`
11:55:11 <oxlur> Hello, Can you kindly help me make my pixel 3xl more secure? I want to lock the oem_unlock options or if not that the whole developer options so that no one can flash my device
11:55:53 <jpds> oxlur: You should be able to do that yourself?
11:56:24 <oxlur> yes
11:56:28 <oxlur> so set a sort of password for developer options / oem unlock?
11:56:33 <oxlur> is it possible?
11:56:49 <jpds> No, just set a password/PIN on the whole device
11:58:38 <jpds> If they're already physically holding your device while it's unlocked - it's kind of game over from a security perspective
11:59:54 <oxlur> what if I make a secondary user. And of course that user wont be able to access developer options but the admin will always have to login once after device boot for the cecondary user to be able to lgin and use the device.
11:59:55 <oxlur> secondary* login*
11:59:56 <oxlur> so.... cant we solve this issue? (of not being able to login to secondary (limited) user directly)
12:00:22 <jpds> What are you trying to accomplish?
12:02:35 <oxlur> to be able to give the device to another person without the fear of him being able to flash any os of his own or delete / format my device
12:03:07 <jpds> I don't think that's possible as they have physical access
12:03:30 <oxlur> but oems like samsung and huawei lock their bootloaders with password
12:03:46 <oxlur> cant that be done by a common man?
12:03:47 <Autopsy[m]> But that's Samsung and Huawei.
12:03:51 <Autopsy[m]> These are Pixel devices.
12:07:14 <oxlur> so the most secure way is to just relock the bootloader after installing grapheneos and then disable oem_unlock option in developer mode and just hide developer options.
12:08:11 <Autopsy[m]> Right, so...
12:08:41 <Autopsy[m]> When you set up a guest user or another user, they cannot enable developer mode to switch on OEM unlocking.
12:09:17 <Autopsy[m]> And when you switch users, you have to input your password/pin.
12:09:32 <Autopsy[m]> Biometrics are turned off.
12:09:36 <oxlur> yes and thats very secure. but everytime the device boots, it needs the admin user to login before any secondary user
12:09:46 <Autopsy[m]> Until you unlock with password/pin
12:09:55 <Autopsy[m]> So don't reboot?
12:10:28 <oxlur> thats not really a solution  :\
12:11:18 <Autopsy[m]> But, what you want cannot be done, so you're going to have to compromise somewhere.
12:11:35 <marlow11[m]> Is there a way to allow screen shots in vanadium private browsing?
12:11:52 <Autopsy[m]> <marlow11[m] "Is there a way to allow screen s"> Third party app?
12:12:08 <marlow11[m]> Nope just stick GOS

12:12:31 <marlow11[m]> Oh okay
12:12:45 <marlow11[m]> That's annoying
12:13:32 <marlow11[m]> Not much of a privacy benefit if you can get around it with a third party app...
12:14:23 <jpds> marlow11[m]: You can just open the website in a non-private tab and take a screenshot
12:15:19 <marlow11[m]> This is a sensitive document reciept of information only supplied once.
12:15:22 <Autopsy[m]> Yeah... It's incognito and private for a reason.
12:15:31 <Autopsy[m]> So you can't screenshot it.
12:15:44 <Autopsy[m]> Try another app, or do what jpds says.
12:17:07 <marlow11[m]> Too late. I can't get the info back, no way to reopen in another browser. Bummer :-/
12:17:38 <Autopsy[m]> Use another phone to take a photo lol
12:17:39 <oxlur> should have taken a picture from the cam of another phone

12:23:57 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> And make a pull request
12:25:41 <zyxt128[m]> @oxl
12:28:14 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> I want to ask some experienced devs (building Vanadium) here if testing Vanadium TriChrome apk as user apk (by different package name) is enough?
12:30:44 <oxlur> so just putting the file bootanimation.zip in the /system/media before building grapheneos will be enough to change boot animation?
12:31:35 <Autopsy[m]> Give it a go and report back!
12:31:43 <oxlur> on it
12:32:57 <zyxt128[m]> oxlur: Techically, you can "lock" the adb with a key in order to block any PC to access the phone, but you have to modify the source code for that

12:35:06 <oxlur> but enabling oem unlock and flashing new rom doesne need adb.
12:35:13 <oxlur> doesnt*
12:35:16 <oxlur> right?
12:35:24 <zyxt128[m]> Ow sorry, you want to block the flashing
12:35:29 <oxlur> yes
12:35:44 <zyxt128[m]> I though you wanted to block the adb access
12:35:50 <zyxt128[m]> sorry my bad
12:38:36 <oxlur> no thank you still, learnt a new thing
12:59:14 <oxlur> so anyway... is there a way to run a script at boot with or without rooting? and is root possible on pixel 3xl
13:33:50 <erhcetua[m]> rooting is a nogo in grapheneOS and even in general, it destroys your device security
16:39:28 <dazinism> oxlur: think you need to look at device admin. Can android.os.UserManager.DISALLOW_OEM_UNLOCK

21:54:51 <Autopsy[m]> Worst case, reinstall GrapheneOS. But, update to the latest Google stock version first, using this website: https://developers.google.com/android/images
21:57:27 <stupidmonkeyqeq[> I have rebooted with netguard disabled, no change. I have also rebooted after disabling tether hardware acceleration disabled also with netgaurd disabled
21:58:25 <stupidmonkeyqeq[> I will verify install and proceed from there. I appreciate your help Autopsy
21:59:53 <Autopsy[m]> Yeah, no worries. Btw, the admin and mods of this channel are devs (most of them) so if what I suggested hasn't worked, hit them up
22:31:29 <dazinism> If its booting with verified boot working I don't think reinstalling will help. Kinda has to be identical to every other install.
22:32:03 <dazinism> Thats the whole point of verified boot
