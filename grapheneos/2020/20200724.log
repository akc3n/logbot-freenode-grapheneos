07:30:38 <dazinism> ghostcat unless they are controlling the android vpn functionality apps can't see anything about what other apps are doing on the network any more
07:31:51 <dazinism> ghostcat also for what apps can see https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/what-can-apps-see
08:23:57 <dazinism> ghostcat actually an app with network permission can scan 127.0.0.1 and see if you have any ports open
08:24:49 <dazinism> Can see if orbot or tor browser are running on the device - even if in a different user profile
08:43:31 <jalb> dazinism, I have some doubts about using a VPN app in the main user. If I use another user/profile I'm only connecting with a direct connection (not with the VPN app that I haven't installed it there), so... the question is if MEANWHILE  I'm using this other user/profile, are the apps with Network access connecting with the VPN app in the main profile yet?
08:47:03 <jalb> Because we know that in the main profile the internet connection is always working
08:47:14 <jalb> Even if we're not in that profile
08:47:31 <jalb> But I'm not sure if it's only a direct connection or the VPN.
08:50:05 <tvg[m]> Hey I'm unsure about something
08:50:06 <tvg[m]> Is managing persmissions through Settings -> Apps -> Persmissions thorough enough for decent privacy? Or is there an app in the F-Droid store like NetGuard (which I'm already using) that properly manages these permissions?
08:50:06 <tvg[m]> For example: I turned on Location, but only allowed 'when app is in use' on OsmAnd and no other app is allowed. I'm wondering if this is doing the job
08:57:50 <pikey[m]> Thanks. Well its been a constant and major problem so I guess I need to rule out hardware and installation now. Schism once mentioned that he had some wifi issues which he only solved by reflashing from  scratch. I don't fancy that as I have to learn how to fully back up and restore may data and files (100gb). But I guess I have no option now as this problem seems unique to me. If that doesn't solve then I have a pixel
08:57:50 <pikey[m]> 3a I was going to sell but I could flash that and compare to rule out hardware.
08:58:55 <pikey[m]> Aaagh. Took me ten minutes to send that msg! Had to disconnct and change vpn settings etc!
09:08:22 <renlord> strcat[m]: RE: sensors permission

10:39:45 <dazinism> jalb: I'm not totally sure about how networking works with different user profiles and VPNs. Daniel has said something about only one profiles VPN connection being able happen at a time.
10:40:33 <dazinism> Dont know what happens to connections from other profiles in this case. Guess the way the VPN app / connection is set up can effect things
10:41:31 <dazinism> Also unsure about how main and work profile VPNs are handled. The OS shows if you have a VPN active on each.
10:45:25 <dazinism> Guess could test with two VPN services that you could read the connection logs from - pihole or something
11:13:18 <jalb> dazinism, ok thanks
11:14:48 <jalb> When you use and install the VPN app (in this case Mullvad with wireguard) in the main profile then only in this profile is active and working. When I change to another user I can only see WIFI or data connections
11:15:46 <jalb> But who knows what's behing in the main profile with Network while I use another profile
11:18:08 <jalb> *behind
11:29:28 <dazinism> jalb: I think (but may be mistaken) that if you dont start a VPN service in another profile then network connections in the main profile would keep running through the VPN in the background
11:29:59 <jalb> Thank you dazinism, I think that could be the case

15:25:22 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> try checking fastboot devices
15:25:40 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> `fastboot devices`
15:26:23 <marcf75> nothing came up
15:27:20 <marcf75> showing my ignorance but just to make sure.  i've done everything in my system32, would i need to run that command somewhere else.   Probably a dumb question

15:27:47 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <marcf75 "showing my ignorance but just to"> Should have been on Downloads folder
15:29:09 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Also, better if the factory image folder and platform-tools folder are separaye
15:29:11 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Also, better if the factory image folder and platform-tools folder are separate
15:29:33 <marcf75> got it!
15:30:27 <marcf75> Because all the commands that you sent over are exactly what I used because I copied from the graphene instructions.

15:33:06 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> If nothing comes up on fastboot devices, it won't flash anything at all
15:36:31 <marcf75> nothing is showing for that.  but since I can view the device on the laptop, wouldn't that mean that the phone is properly connected?
15:38:32 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Something is off with the connection I guess
15:38:56 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> If the command:
15:39:00 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> fastboot devices
15:39:02 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> is typed
15:39:05 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> The result should be
15:39:17 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> AHXODBWYXK          fastboot
15:39:41 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> well, but that's assuming
15:40:04 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> marcf75: $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path" is dome
15:40:12 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * marcf75: $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path" is done
15:40:31 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> And has checked for fastboot --version
15:41:02 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * AHXODBWYXK          fastboot    (this is a sample, your device has different set of lettters)
15:41:07 <marcf75> yes, that was done last night.
15:41:29 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * AHXODBWYXK          fastboot    (this is a sample, your device has different ID)
15:41:30 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> try doing it again?
15:41:37 <marcf75> just did
15:41:47 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> (Assuming you transferred the folder(s) on the Downloads)
15:42:19 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <marcf75 "just did"> still nothing!
15:42:26 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * still nothing?
15:43:35 <marcf75> I think my friend may hop on this chat because he actually knows what he's talking about.   maybe with your knowledge of the actual rom, he might be able to help me with this later
15:44:33 <marcf75> Yeah, nothing.   I ran that command and nothing.
15:46:37 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Ah welp, can't help beyond that, except to try install bonito's fastboot drivers, if fastboot device detects nothing
15:46:57 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Idk where to find it, try searching it on duckduckgo.com
15:49:31 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> It's odd, really. It should have worked out of the box among the recommended OS to flash GrapheneOS
16:09:36 <grindlefang[m]> is building vanadium from source still broken? It's been broken the last week or so at least
16:10:10 <cdesai> no it's been fixed
16:10:31 <cdesai> building wasn't broken anyway
16:26:04 <strcat[m]> renlord: most apps don't need sensors
16:26:20 <strcat[m]> renlord: but I'm not going to be dealing with users installing apps and not understanding why stuff doesn't work
16:26:25 <strcat[m]> until they go enable sensors access
16:27:03 <strcat[m]> it COULD be disabled by default but apps do not know it exists
16:27:10 <strcat[m]> since it's a GrapheneOS extension
16:27:17 <strcat[m]> so they won't request it like they do for permissions that are standard
16:27:25 <strcat[m]> so users will have to know to go into settings and enable it
16:27:34 <strcat[m]> I think expecting users to do that is overestimating them
16:27:53 <strcat[m]> instead people who know what they're doing can toggle it off after installing apps
16:28:22 <strcat[m]> renlord: also we don't know which apps in the base OS use sensors right now, we'd need to start actively reviewing that
16:28:26 <strcat[m]> and it may change across releases
16:28:29 <strcat[m]> who is going to do that?
16:28:41 <strcat[m]> and how would we handle that?
16:28:52 <strcat[m]> teach them to request the permission? sounds like a fair bit of work that's hard to maintain
16:29:04 <strcat[m]> and the apps using it may be low-level infrastructure
16:29:32 <strcat[m]> like whatever part of the phone call infrastructure tells the OS to turn off the screen when the proximity sensor detects it's held up to your face
16:30:01 <strcat[m]> stuff like that can't request permissions it has to be built into how the OS works
16:30:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: anyway none of this seems worth it, too many issues
16:30:16 <strcat[m]> we'll have to start dealing with people regularly asking why stuff doesn't work
16:30:25 <strcat[m]> with it being explained they need to go enable sensors access before an app can use sensors
16:30:36 <strcat[m]> who is going to volunteer to start providing substantial support here and elsewhere
16:30:41 <strcat[m]> and dealing with emails I forward to them
16:31:07 <strcat[m]> it's totally possible to have this disabled by default and it WOULD BE if I expected people to be able to handle it
16:31:47 <strcat[m]> I had to go out of the way to make complicated changes to make the Network and Sensors permissions we add enabled by default
16:32:55 <cdesai> one thing that could help here is logging - i.e. keep it enabled by default and just see what uses it
16:33:51 <cdesai> that would handle the system apps atleast.
16:34:21 <strcat[m]> cdesai: only if we use all functionality
16:34:28 <strcat[m]> maybe the CTS would trigger enough
16:34:43 <strcat[m]> in my experience there will still often be edge cases
16:35:12 <strcat[m]> cdesai: for system apps we could stop giving them the permission to have the toggle at all
16:35:23 <strcat[m]> cdesai: and just manually add it and request it where needed
16:35:29 <strcat[m]> we do not have the resources to do that and maintain it
16:35:36 <strcat[m]> that is ideally what would be done
16:35:37 <strcat[m]> we can't do it
16:35:39 <cdesai> strcat[m]: yeah but it'd be easier to just whitelist the few that need it for a start.
16:35:47 <strcat[m]> can't maintain that
16:35:54 <strcat[m]> going to cause problems and going to change across versions
16:35:59 <strcat[m]> who is volunteering the time to do this
16:36:09 <strcat[m]> ongoing commitment and need to be available for every update for at least 12 hours
16:36:21 <strcat[m]> I won't make the change unless people commit to helping maintain it
16:36:34 <strcat[m]> I will reject patches causing a maintenance burden like this for me even if others write the initial version
16:36:47 <cdesai> fair
16:36:55 <strcat[m]> it's a commitment to spending time on every release going through all the changes and making sure nothing else will need it
16:36:59 <strcat[m]> and doing a lot of work for major releases
16:37:04 <strcat[m]> and it's more than just logging + testing
16:37:12 <strcat[m]> I expect manually searching and reviewing all uses of the sensors APIs
16:37:26 <strcat[m]> for every release (minor releases can just look at the diffs)
18:48:03 <darkhart6[m]> Hi everyone, I have an installation question. I just got a Pixel 3a today, updated to the latest version of Android, and installed GrapheneOS. I believe I proceeded through the installation correctly, except I somehow attempted to install the version GrapheneOS meant for the Pixel 3XL (they're next to each other on the download page, idk I must have miss clicked). So now the Pixel 3a attempts to boot into Android,
18:48:03 <darkhart6[m]> but gets stuck on the splashscreen. I already relocked the bootloader and the phone isn't displayed when I run 'adb devices' on my PC. I have the correct version of GrapheneOS downloaded on my PC, is there another way to unlock the bootloader so I can install it?
18:48:56 <overheadscallop[> power off the device completely, then hold power + vol down to get into fastboot mode
18:49:50 <darkhart6[m]> Works fine, but 'Device state: locked'
18:50:30 <overheadscallop[> plug the phone into your computer and try `fastboot flashing unlock`
18:51:19 <darkhart6[m]> Dude I fucking love you
18:52:00 <darkhart6[m]> So then I should be able to install the correct image without issues?
18:52:05 <overheadscallop[> yes
18:56:20 <darkhart6[m]> Successful boot, tysm!
18:57:19 <cn3m[m]> welcome to the family
18:58:41 <darkhart6[m]> I did, for some reason I thought the phone had to be recognized by my PC through adb for it to work... idk I think I'm having an off day
19:03:20 <dazinism> Knull: the included keyboard is the most secure.
19:03:28 <dazinism> Theres two options with swype style input that folks use AnySoftKeyboard or Google keyboard.
19:04:20 <dazinism> Theres potential issues with either depending on how you feel about things
19:04:39 <dazinism> Folks who use gboard tend to turn networking off
19:05:06 <dazinism> Deny the network permission before first launching the app
19:05:57 <dazinism> Depends on your definition of safe
19:06:50 <dazinism> Denying it network makes it unlikely it would be sending data off anywhere
19:08:04 <dazinism> I've never tried it, but think theres a reasonable argument to be made that you can use it without letting it send data back to G
19:08:49 <odisaben[m]> I do miss swipe texting....
19:11:32 <strcat[m]> doesn't work if it resolves the name itself or uses an IP
19:11:50 <strcat[m]> and good luck blacklisting all possible domains since there's no set limit on that
19:12:04 <strcat[m]> not a viable way to do anything
19:12:46 <cn3m[m]> one good test is to install bromite set a custom dns in side of it, but have privatedns blocking google(nextdns)
19:12:57 <cn3m[m]> you will have no problem accessing google from bromimte
19:13:02 <cn3m[m]> any app can do that
19:13:08 <cn3m[m]>  * you will have no problem accessing google from bromite
19:13:36 <dazinism> Not really
19:13:58 <cn3m[m]> the disable networking means it can only talk to other apps it can't connect directly
19:14:07 <dazinism> The keyboard app then cant get direct network access
19:14:27 <cn3m[m]> they are unlikely to try to get data out through other apps(contrary to popular opinion) google isn't an evil all seeing eye
19:16:30 <strcat[m]> for example it's still capable of opening a URL in the browser
19:16:38 <strcat[m]> also... it's a keyboard, it's highly trusted
19:16:51 <strcat[m]> if you don't trust a keyboard don't use it
19:16:51 <dazinism> ..well they have got a bit of a reputation which isnt completely unearnt
19:16:59 <strcat[m]> disabling network doesn't make it safe if you don't trust it
19:17:54 <cn3m[m]> Your keyboard is now your clipboard manager
19:17:56 <strcat[m]> keyboard has access to the clipboard at all times (unlike other apps which can only access it when focused) and you are entering all your text through it
19:18:01 <strcat[m]> and it's what provides autocorrect on text boxes
19:18:15 <strcat[m]> keyboard has access to all text in text boxes you edit with it
19:18:29 <strcat[m]> if you don't trust an app don't make it your keyboard
19:18:42 <strcat[m]> disabling network just means it can't make a network connection itself
19:18:59 <strcat[m]> or via stuff that enforces INTERNET permission like DownloadManager
19:19:16 <strcat[m]> it won't
19:19:26 <strcat[m]> we aren't developing swipe support for a keyboard that's not what we do
19:19:34 <strcat[m]> AOSP keyboard isn't actively developed beyond bug fixes
19:19:37 <strcat[m]> it's not getting any major features or changes
19:19:46 <strcat[m]> it is what it is
19:19:56 <strcat[m]> we don't develop keyboards
19:20:21 <cn3m[m]> <knull[m] "Best case scenario, graphene key"> AnySoftKeyboard is Apache licensed
19:20:28 <cn3m[m]> you could install that
19:20:39 <cn3m[m]> just install that
19:20:51 <cn3m[m]> It isn't great, but if you increase the height it can be passable
19:21:49 <EssentialChaos[m> Btw, do AOSP apps have separate repos?
19:22:17 <EssentialChaos[m> I tried to search the other day and couldn't find them for some reason
19:24:22 <madaidan[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "I tried to search the other day "> Not everything is on the GrapheneOS github org. It only includes the repos that it changes. Look at the official repos.
19:25:22 <EssentialChaos[m> I meant the upstream
19:25:41 <EssentialChaos[m> Ok, I'll look again
19:25:58 <hypokeimenon[m]> Do people actually swipe on keyboards? That sounds a bit too futuristic for me.
19:26:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> I'm happy thumbing away at the keys.
19:26:40 <cn3m[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Do people actually swipe on keyb"> yes for many many years
19:26:45 <cn3m[m]> it is so much faster
19:26:51 <EssentialChaos[m> I've never tried swiping, but it seems rather uncomfortable to me
19:27:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> > it is so much faster
19:27:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> I can imagine.
19:27:33 <odisaben[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Do people actually swipe on keyb"> I use it...I can type without looking at the keyboard and not miss too many words...
19:27:55 <cn3m[m]> hypokeimenon: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/swype-vs-iphone-typing-sw_n_368850
19:27:58 <odisaben[m]> Just have to be close
19:28:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> <odisaben[m] "Just have to be close"> Yeah, I've used the feature before. I understand at the surface level how it saves time, I just never thought people widely adopted it.
19:29:29 <cn3m[m]> the first verison of Swype in 2010 dominating even the iPhone 3GS(not a bad typing phone at all!)
19:29:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cn3m[m] "hypokeimenon: https://www.huffpo"> guce.advertising.com refused to connect. 😏
19:30:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> Anyway sorry, this is off topic.
19:30:34 <cn3m[m]> https://youtu.be/pTooBnKAdSw
19:30:52 <cn3m[m]> So yes, even AnySoftKeyboard in Beta is worth using
19:31:00 <cn3m[m]> Swiping is so much better
19:31:06 <cn3m[m]> it is like homerow vs hunt and peck
19:32:49 <odisaben[m]> <cn3m[m] "Swiping is so much better"> That in fdroid?
19:33:06 <cn3m[m]> yes
19:33:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> AnySoftKeyboard should be
19:33:18 <cn3m[m]> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard/
19:33:31 <cn3m[m]> raise the keyboard height
19:33:39 <cn3m[m]> turn on the beta swyping
19:33:45 <cn3m[m]> don't use power saving mode
19:33:57 <cn3m[m]> this is the worst way to get into swype as the keyboard sucks
19:34:11 <cn3m[m]> it is far worse than Gboard
19:38:31 <knull[m]> Agreed but fuck Google. I think i can live with this,  just downloaded it
19:38:31 <knull[m]> Ty
20:35:30 <alzxjm[m]> cn3m: Does voice typing on Gboard work with Graphene?
20:35:42 <alzxjm[m]> Sorry - didn't mean to ping you cn3m
20:46:38 <ruddo[m]> GrapheneOS does not come with Gboard and Gboard requires Google play services.
21:36:45 <cn3m[m]> <ruddo[m] "GrapheneOS does not come with Gb"> that is false
21:36:56 <cn3m[m]> not required
21:37:02 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m] "cn3m: Does voice typing on Gboar"> nope requires online junk
21:37:18 <cn3m[m]> wait well could be that I blocked net
21:38:26 <wreck[m]> gboard complains if you don't have play services+framework available, i just tried it yesterday
21:38:43 <wreck[m]> (not on GOS, but i disabled the play services apps)
21:40:05 <cn3m[m]> if it is disabled sure, otherwise it just works
21:40:22 <cn3m[m]> and you can disable the notification on other Android systems with it disabled
21:40:51 <alzxjm[m]> I just disabled microg on Calyx and Gboard works perfectly fine. Voice typing and swiping.
21:41:14 <wreck[m]> it wasn't immediate... it took a while for it to notice it was gone
21:41:14 <wreck[m]> and then it started nagging me
21:41:22 <wreck[m]> still works just fine though
21:41:35 <alzxjm[m]> I disabled the Google play services complaint for all of the apps that were complaining.
21:41:52 <wreck[m]> makes sense, forgot about that method
21:42:12 <wreck[m]> better than what i did, which is block network access to the play services app with netguard
21:43:04 <wreck[m]> i'm on poor-mans de-googled android though... just disabling all the apps i can. don't have a pixel to install GOS to so i just lurk here for tips and tricks.
21:44:03 <wreck[m]> the thing that's throwing a wrench in everything is that i'm still very dependent on google voice... but that's a story for a different room
22:07:28 <aeonsolution[m]> hey everyone, if there is anyone interested with Vanadium development please reach out
22:07:44 <cardinal[m]1> Wow, guys thank you so much. I didn't know you could use gboard with gOS. I couldn't find any keyboard with a good swiping feature...
22:15:53 <knull[m]> What about weather apps? Anyone find good privacy alternatives?
22:17:29 <cardinal[m]1> I am using Forecastie from Fdroid
22:41:08 <RickZA> Could anybody please give me a hand understanding why my remote attestation is failing ? I have setup everything accordingly as per the tutorial
22:44:54 <dazinism> RickZA: somebody had fails recently related to previously trying Android 11 preview on their device
22:45:42 <RickZA> Could you link me anything to help solve the issue ? I havent installed any other Android, i had a successful attestation upon first installing & havent installed anything that would compromise the device
23:03:18 <nickcalyx[m]> Another alternative besides gboard,that has swipe is AnySoftKeyboard from fdroid
23:21:09 <Cyn[m]> I've personally found Microsoft SwiftKey to be my keyboard of choice on mobile with net guard blocking all connectivity of the app
23:38:00 <LinusArchTips[m]> why not just disable network access from the permission manager?
23:45:16 <zaxxa[m]> Anysoftkeyboard used to have so many entries in fdroid, it confused me tbh and the settings UI is a mess
23:52:37 <jneplokh> <Cyn[m] "I've personally found Microsoft "> As stated, use the Network permissions toggle instead of NetGuard. Far better
23:56:41 <knull[m]> <zaxxa[m] "Anysoftkeyboard used to have so "> The settings are pretty sloppy
