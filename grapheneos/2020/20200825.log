00:05:26 <aeonsolution[m]> Vanadium is both the browser and the webview, you might be able to install the browser but the issues you come across will be for you to resolve since the goal of Vanadium is be both the hardened browser and webview for GrapheneOS
00:06:55 <aeonsolution[m]> there are policies in GrapheneOS that work in synergy with Vanadium's hardening, there is a lot more detail in it than i can describe, but the logs and the devs could provide more insight
00:08:04 <aeonsolution[m]> this explanation is a huge simplification that leaves out a lot of technical details
00:33:54 <dcosk[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "Vanadium is both the browser and"> I know, only i'll want know if this, will be possible
00:36:16 <aeonsolution[m]> its possible to install it, theres no gurantee itll work and you'll have to do the updates on your own since Vanadium doesnt have a dedicated update server. it gets updates when GOS gets a new release
00:37:37 <aeonsolution[m]> like i mentioned before, the issues you come across will be for you to resolve because Vanadium isn't developed for OSes other than GrapheneOS at this point in time
00:43:29 <faxing[m]> Still can't get it to work
00:44:13 <faxing[m]> Every time I get a voicemail, I go to the voicemail tab - nothing, i click on the new voicemail notification - it calls the voicemail box and I can retrieve my voicemails
00:44:29 <faxing[m]>  * Every time I get a voicemail, I go to the voicemail tab in the phone app - nothing, i click on the new voicemail notification - it calls the voicemail box and I can retrieve my voicemails
00:44:48 <faxing[m]> I'm using the stock phone app for Graphene
00:47:13 <dcosk[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "its possible to install it, ther"> How its possible? I want to try it. Dont care if dont work. I read a awesome words about this browser
00:48:31 <strcat[m]> Vanadium is for GrapheneOS
00:48:57 <strcat[m]> we don't make builds for other OSes and we include functionality for it in the OS rather than the browser
00:49:01 <strcat[m]> such as the hardened allocator in the OS
00:49:35 <dcosk[m]> <strcat[m] "Vanadium is for GrapheneOS"> Okey. No more questions.
00:53:15 <faxing[m]> I know my carrier is compatible with Visual Voicemail, so I don't need to do anything with my carrier, I should just be able to do it all from the phone, right?
00:53:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dcosk[m] "Okey. No more questions. "> You'll find it on glassrom too. It replaces the (now) dead glassrom browser
01:14:30 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a tags were finally pushed in case anyone is interested in working on that
01:14:35 <strcat[m]> need android-prepare-vendor support of course
01:22:30 <aeonsolution[m]> im building the Pixel 4a right now with this tag https://android.googlesource.com/device/google/sunfish/+/refs/tags/android-10.0.0_r45
01:23:21 <aeonsolution[m]> cdesai shared the info
01:24:14 <cdesai> Tracking progress on #AOSPAlliance
01:25:31 <brockin042[m]> Pixel 4a for graphene? Its the only reason why I haven't bought one as of yet.
01:27:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: there's one thing you really need to track
01:27:42 <cdesai> What
01:28:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Did you fix the DTC issue
01:28:23 <cdesai> Merged revert for now
01:28:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Here's basically what happens
01:28:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> I did a boot to recovery
01:28:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Recovery complained it could not find misc
01:28:58 <cdesai> Check gerrit I left a comment for options for coral that wouldn't affect other devices.
01:29:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tried flashing
01:29:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Failed
01:29:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Understood what was up
01:29:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Storage never initialized
01:29:28 <cdesai> Ah
01:29:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Restoring dtbo fixed it
01:29:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Was DTC issue from that commit
01:30:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also idk what exactly that commit does
01:30:21 <cdesai> Its off topic here anyway but I merged a revert already
01:30:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> But I've been struggling with this for 4 days
01:31:07 <cdesai> :(
01:31:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically clean build + that commit -> doesn't boot
01:31:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> dirty build + reverted -> doesn't boot
01:31:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Clean build + revert -> boots
01:31:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk why but this is the reason I've been struggling with it for all that time
01:32:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also cdesai I for one ain't going to the lineage gerrit
01:32:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> They aren't going to support glassrom stable kernels anyway
01:33:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I am not using that messed up kernel lineage has for op7
01:36:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_device_google_wahoo/+/271045
01:37:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Adapt this instead
01:39:29 <cdesai> No that won't work
01:40:04 <cdesai> That's prebuilts which is too old and $out isn't set when BoardConfig is included
01:42:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> ...
01:42:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just edit it to what you did in vendor
01:43:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's exactly how it's done on grapheneos
01:43:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's exactly how lineage implements linkage again clang lld for the kernel
01:43:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> * That's exactly how lineage implements linkage against clang lld for the kernel
01:45:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> It should look like
01:45:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> TARGET_KERNEL_ADDITIONAL_FLAGS := \
01:45:57 <anupritaisno1[m]>     DTC=$(KERNEL_BUILD_OUT_PREFIX)$(DTC)
01:47:12 <cdesai> Go ahead, try that.
01:48:04 <cdesai> Kernel_build_out_prefix just isn't available, the variables it needs just haven't been set when the build system includes boardconfig
01:48:25 <cdesai> If it was so simple why would I even do that change.
01:48:33 <cdesai> And again, this is all off topic for this channel
01:48:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Solution 2: just update DTC and call it a day
01:56:52 <faxing[m]> No settings that I see on my carriers website.
01:56:58 <faxing[m]> Anyone have any ideas?
01:57:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> faxing: Verizon visible?

01:58:16 <faxing[m]> Pixel 3a XL running GrapheneOS
01:58:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can't do much for that sadly
01:59:33 <faxing[m]> Oh
01:59:37 <faxing[m]> Okay, Thanks
01:59:44 <faxing[m]>  * Okay, thanks anyway
01:59:52 <aeonsolution[m]> what are you trying to do faxing
02:00:08 <faxing[m]> I'm just trying to get Visual Voicemail to work
02:00:21 <faxing[m]> I've been trying all of today and a while yesterday with no success
02:00:27 <aeonsolution[m]> brockin042: don't get your hopes up, this is a first for me and i see the learning process being very painful
02:00:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: if you have a 3a I can point you to the direction you need to look in
02:00:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> But I can't do anything without the phone myself
02:01:05 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah i have a pixel 3a too
02:01:13 <aeonsolution[m]> cool, i can help there
02:01:19 <faxing[m]> So now after trying to troubleshoot on my own for this long I figured I'd try and hope that someone here could help
02:01:54 <faxing[m]> whenever I get a voicemail I just get a notification to call my voicemail box but when I go to the voicemail tab in the stock phone app i see nothing
02:02:05 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: anything helps
02:02:15 <faxing[m]> it works if I call the voicemail box but it's a pain if I don't have to
02:08:18 <aeonsolution[m]> let me see what i can figure out
02:19:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh great

10:44:33 <arept> hello anyone here?
10:48:49 <cn3m[m]> arept: yes
10:49:34 <arept> i want to install graphene on a refurbished pixel 3a. Propably buying it online. Since you need a unlocked device, is there a way to see if it is unlocked, in the settings or something? Is there anything else important it needs for the installation to work?
10:53:22 <pikey[m]> I just make SURE the phone was purchased NEW UNLOCKED. So long as that's the case it should be fine. I buy my phones second hand and if I can't verify it was factory unlocked I give it a miss.
10:55:06 <arept> so i should just ask for a pic of something proving it is unlocked like the manual or sth
11:01:31 <arept> is there something that ships with the phone that proves its unlocked?

11:21:36 <Autopsy[m]> Like, it sounds like they're trying to phish you.

11:45:34 <rafff[m]> What version of riot are you using, just got now a message to install element and uninstall riotx?
11:58:17 <dazinism> rafff: riot and RiotX are discontinued, likely best installing element
11:59:16 <dazinism> there are other matrix clients by other developers, but element is OK(ish) and under heavy active development
11:59:32 <dazinism> its basically RiotX with a new name
12:00:17 <dazinism> The other option that is also OK(ish) is fluffychat

12:06:36 <applescruff_53[m> I am going to re-install GOS. When I first got this phone I installed GOS before I did anything with it. Afterwards I did download some questionable apps which I uninstalled soon after. Then while using Vanadium this pop up page appears from yourphoneboost.com with the message Cleaner Update for Phone is recommended. Your phone Phone can work faster. We released a Cleaner update, and it is recommended for every
12:06:36 <applescruff_53[m> phone. Mistakenly, I clicked on it, after it repeatedly came on every time I used that browser. When I finally clicked on it, it change screens but didn't seem to be doing anything. I restarted the phone and stopped using Vanadium. Now I'm convinced this phone has been inflected. I opened Vanadium this morning and first thing this same page appears with a countdown clock to update. I'll be back on after new GOS
12:06:36 <applescruff_53[m> is installed.
12:07:57 <ruddo[m]> How about you change the home page of the browser, or erase the browser's app data, and try again?
12:08:54 <applescruff_53[m>  It is persistent and not responsive.

17:41:38 <blueuser[m]> once you have done it the first time to install grapheneos and relocked the bootloader, do you need to connect to internet the next times that you want to unlock it?
19:13:04 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <blueuser[m] "why new pixels require to connec"> You mean the Pixel 4[a] [XL]? Because to my knowledge, Pixel 3[a] [XL] doesn't do that. About what kind of informations that sends, it might be some stuff that identifies the device, but I am not sure

19:28:57 <bkeys> Hello guys, I ran fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability on my new pixel 3 xl (which is unlocked) and it is returning 0
19:28:57 <bkeys> Is there any hope for me to put GrapheneOS on this device?
19:29:38 <bkeys> I can enter developer mode on a clean factory reset, then go into the developer options and the OEM unlock is greyed out
19:29:45 <bkeys> And the bootloader confirmed that it is LOCKED
19:30:27 <jpds> bkeys: Is this a Pixel from Verizon?
19:30:31 <bkeys> No
19:30:59 <bkeys> The bootloader says nothing about it, there is no verizon logo physically on the device
19:31:10 <bkeys> No verizon logo at boot or anything like that; it was also listed as unlocked
19:39:02 <Autopsy[m]> <bkeys "No verizon logo at boot or anyth"> When people sell unlocked, they usually mean sim free, not bootloader.
19:39:14 <Autopsy[m]> Most people don't care and/or have no idea about that stuff.

19:44:20 <Autopsy[m]> Quick way to get IMEI is *#06* from the dialer.
19:47:33 <Autopsy[m]> Also look at the original box, if it came with it, and see if it says anything.
19:51:01 <bkeys> nikitalita[m]1: Yes it came used
19:53:07 <bkeys> Autopsy[m]: Where would I put in the IMEI number?
19:56:08 <bkeys> Nevermind I see it

On my Pixel 3a running GOS I think they stopped showing up sometime in the past couple days, and I can't really figure out what's happening. The in-app and out-of-app settings for notifications are both on, and I just redownloaded the APK from their site to make sure I didn't accidentally update it through Aurora, but I'm still not getting any.
19:59:41 <bkeys> My guess is I am going to have to return this thing?
20:00:03 <nikitalita[m]1> it's possible it's a verizon phone and its just not showing the logo, and its also possible it's a verizon phone that was soft-unlocked and then sold on as an unlocked phone (not sure if you can actually do this with Pixel 3s though)
20:00:23 <bkeys> I mean doesn't Verizon usually stamp their logo on phones they lock?
20:00:24 <nikitalita[m]1> bkeys:  either way, use the tool that autopsy linked
20:00:29 <bkeys> I did
20:00:34 <bkeys> That tool is not saying anything about Verizon
20:03:04 <Autopsy[m]> You'll have to use a Google account... Either make one up or use the one you have (assume you have one, most people do), then follow the web page and input the IMEI when Google tells you to
20:03:12 <bkeys> I did that
20:03:15 <bkeys> I already did that
20:03:20 <bkeys> It is not saying anything about Verizon
20:03:27 <Autopsy[m]> Disclaimer, I've never used it - I'm merely suggesting what someone already has previously.
20:04:15 <bkeys> I know but I cannot find any evidence that this phone was locked by Verizon
20:04:35 <bkeys> I signed in using a google account, the oem unlock is still greyed out
20:10:03 <Autopsy> So it is still greyed out
20:10:08 <nikitalita[m]1> bkeys: i'd just return it
20:10:09 <Autopsy> Have you updated to the latest version?
20:10:30 <bkeys> Autopsy Yes it is the lastest version
20:10:35 <bkeys> nikitalita[m]1: I probably will end up doing that
20:10:47 <bkeys> I am talking with google customer support confirming or denying my fate
20:10:47 <nikitalita[m]1> there are a number of things that could have happened here, none of them good
20:10:55 <Autopsy> Yeah, for sure.
20:11:06 <Autopsy> Have you tried factory resetting yet, just in case?
20:11:31 <nikitalita[m]1> do you have a sim card in this now? if so, which network?
20:11:32 <Autopsy> You can use Google's web page to flash the latest update and whatnot
20:11:41 <bkeys> Yes SIM card, Visible
20:14:33 <bkeys> Is this something I can avoid or am I just gonna have to keep ordering and returning phones until I get a good one?
20:15:03 <Autopsy> @bkeys no, what you can do is ask the seller to check to see if OEM unlocking is able to be toggled on or off prior to them selling the phone.
20:15:18 <bkeys> Yeah other than that I mean
20:15:23 <bkeys> No keyword to look out for
20:16:01 <Autopsy> Nothing, really. You got the 3XL, yeah?
20:16:05 <bkeys> Yes
20:16:51 <Autopsy> All variations use the same G013C code, regardless.
20:18:10 <Autopsy> If the item has the box in the eBay listing (as an example) look at the photos and see if anything mentions Verizon. Also see if the seller has listed it being used on Verizon in the past. Other than that, you're just going to have to do what I said regarding asking them to toggle the OEM switch. You *may* have to guide them through that, though, as they might not know what they're doing.
20:19:18 <Autopsy> As a side note.. The IRC / Matrix Bridge is a bit buggy. There aren't many Matrix messages coming through, at least from my side.
20:20:04 <blueuser[m]> it have been buggy for months now
20:20:12 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, you could make the seller show the oem unlock option on the phone
20:20:12 <nikitalita[m]1> I've been burned on stuff like this before; I got an iphone that was sold as unlocked but it was actually just jailbroken and soft-unlocked, which meant that after a factory reset it was locked again.
20:20:13 <nikitalita[m]1> in general i just dont trust used phones if i'm going to be using this as my daily driver
20:21:37 <bkeys> Well is there a way I can buy a Pixel 3 XL that is certain to be OEM unlocked?
20:21:37 <Autopsy> Sorry we can't be any more help than that, bkeys :(
20:21:44 <bkeys> It is fine y'all have been helpful
20:22:05 <nikitalita[m]1> bkeys: why a pixel 3 xl specifically
20:22:19 <bkeys> I am going up and down eBay asking all the 3 XL sellers if their phone is OEM unlocked
20:22:23 <Autopsy> Well, Google have stopped shipping them a while back. Apart from having potluck with the device, it's just asking the seller.
20:22:24 <Autopsy> Haha
20:22:31 <bkeys> nikitalita[m]1: I like bigger screens, I want GrapheneOS support, and it needs to work on Visible
20:22:45 <bkeys> 3 XL does all of those
20:23:03 <blueuser[m]> better wait for the 4a no? it will have much longer support
20:23:14 <bkeys> I am not at all a heavy phone user
20:23:24 <bkeys> I live out in the country and 99% of this thing will just sit there and be a wifi hotspot
20:23:34 <nikitalita[m]1> bkeys: again, the only real way to know for sure is if they actually show you a picture of the settings screen showing that the oem unlocking option is toggleable
20:23:53 <Autopsy> *Duelling Banjos intensifies*
20:24:30 <bkeys> I will be certain to ask for screenshots if any of them say yes
20:24:47 <botter_otter> man, love duelling banjos
20:25:02 <bkeys> I love banjos in general
20:25:34 <Autopsy> bkeys, if it makes any difference, I usually go for sellers that are obviously just selling them because they've got an upgrade. A lot of the time, those are the nicer ones to communicate with.
20:26:14 <botter_otter> btw, a question for anyone who knows, since I don't know really anything about rooting: can I root my grapheneOS pixel 3a? That is, will rooting it delete data/brick the phone?
20:26:57 <botter_otter> ik that magisk by itself supports the 3a, I'm just not aware if having grapheneOS on it will mess with the rooting or vice versa
20:27:03 <Autopsy> Unsupported here, botter otter
20:27:37 <botter_otter> ? as in grapheneOS doesn't support rooting, or this isn't the place to ask, or?
20:31:43 <nikitalita[m]1> both
20:31:58 <Autopsy> While rooting can be done, it pretty much negates the security that is built into GrapheneOS. Using it will mean bypassing the verified boot, and having a tonne of extra attack surface.
20:32:03 <nikitalita[m]1> not recommended to root your phone at all
20:32:14 <Autopsy> The question is: Why do you want to root your phone?
20:32:29 <bkeys> Guise, so if the seller says it is "Verizon unlocked" then I want to avoid it, yes?
20:32:41 <Autopsy> bkeys, yes
20:32:45 <nikitalita[m]1> yes
20:32:49 <botter_otter> nothing important, just was going to if it was convenient/not an actively bad idea to do
20:32:56 <nikitalita[m]1> it may not be locked to verizon, but the bootloader is still locked
20:33:04 <botter_otter> if it opens up a bunch of security vulnerabilities then I won't root it
20:33:10 <bkeys> That is what I thought
20:33:59 <Autopsy> botter_otter, no worries, it's totally normal to ask. Tbh, before GrapheneOS, I genuinely thought root was the answer to my prayers regarding privacy and security; how wrong I was.
20:34:19 <botter_otter> anyway, thanks for the info
20:35:40 <bkeys> The seller of the device I have now does not accept returns, but it is eBay so there is some hope I will not get burned
20:35:52 <bkeys> I guess worst case I resell it
20:40:42 <derpy> possible to change the allowed amount of fingerprint reader attempts?
20:42:55 <nikitalita[m]1>  * first one
20:45:01 <nikitalita[m]1> I don't think so
20:45:17 <nikitalita[m]1> I believe that may be controlled by the hardware?
20:52:35 <derpy> nikitalita[m]1 that a reply to my question? sry not sure
20:53:50 <nikitalita[m]1> derpy: yes, that's right. I dont think you have the ability to set the number of attempts, at least I don't see it on the Pixel 2
20:54:17 <blueuser[m]> it's hardcoded in source but maybe it's different for pixels with titan m idk
20:54:54 <derpy> pixel 3a here... would be a good question for one of the main devs...
20:55:10 <derpy> having the right balance seems key for security & convenience
20:55:23 <derpy> I think 3 attempts and then failing to the pin code forever is ideal
20:55:44 <derpy> that way if you get caught having to unlock it you could purposefully use the wrong finger :)
20:55:53 <derpy> and the conveniently forget your pin code
20:57:10 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, I think the Titan-Ms rate-limit PIN and password entry on the Pixel 3-4s, not sure if that extends to fingerprint attempts
20:57:21 <Autopsy[m]> Let's check pins
20:57:53 <Autopsy> 5 times and it locks for 30 seconds
20:58:03 <Autopsy> Incorrect using the pin 5 times ^
20:59:02 <Autopsy> And 5 times for face unlock causes the face unlock to be disabled.
21:01:41 <derpy> so in the time of an hour someone could try all of your fingerprints
21:01:52 <derpy> so if you don't want that attack vector you have to not use the fingerprint scanner at all
21:01:54 <derpy> :(
21:02:16 <derpy> Damn... Will have to look into if it can lock fingerprint scanner after x attempts -> pincode
21:02:38 <Autopsy[m]> Try another finger a few times.
21:03:10 <derpy> so it does say "too many attempts. fingerprint disabaled"
21:03:13 <derpy> I wonder how long
21:03:21 <Autopsy_2> Indefinitely
21:03:24 <derpy> oh sweet
21:03:30 <derpy> ok so it is smart
21:03:33 <derpy> just 5 attempts is the max
21:03:36 <derpy> not bad
21:03:51 <derpy> just gotta get the person torturing you to use your index fingers or something
21:03:52 <derpy> haha
21:04:22 <kickstart> use a toe
21:04:33 <derpy> hahha security master!
21:04:37 <kickstart> the torturer will never guess
21:04:46 <kickstart> :')
21:05:12 <blueuser[m]> oh that's a grapheneos feature
21:05:52 <blueuser[m]> on non graphene roms it just lock the fingerprint for a moment and allow you to use it again after a while
21:06:21 <blueuser[m]> or after 20 attempts it block it indefinitely
21:06:37 <blueuser[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/8d09d1c7e37b75d1731fb9031fbfbd5c7f99aecc
21:06:45 <kickstart> use a password
21:08:31 <blueuser[m]>  * oh that's a grapheneos change
21:29:46 <kryptonymous[m]> <bkeys "nikitalita: I like bigger screen"> When I installed GOS 2+ months ago, Visible service would not work with GOS. Search the logs above for "Visible". Hate to see you go to all the trouble of finding a non-Verizon Pixel 3XL (which I also have incidentally) only to find the service won't work. FWIW I switched to PureTalk USA- low cost, high data, great coverage in my region. YMMV. Good luck.
21:30:43 <nikitalita[m]1> I believe that's been recently fixed
21:30:55 <nikitalita[m]1> Search for Verizon in the os issue tracker
21:32:42 <kryptonymous[m]> That could be true- I have no idea. Since it was no longer relevant to my situation, I didn't follow up. But I do try to scan this board almost every day and hadn't noticed any talk of Visible. But you're right- a search is in order.
21:51:04 <jpds> derpy: You can also enable the lockdown feature in Display > Lock screen display
21:51:20 <derpy> jpds right, tnx
21:51:30 <jpds> Hold down the power button, hit Lockdown, no fingerprints
21:51:47 <derpy> blueuser[m] didn't know about it... its a good choice, glad to have GOS
21:52:49 <derpy> jpds if I hold power, I see: power off, restart, screenshot, emergency
21:53:20 <blueuser[m]> you need to enale lockdown in settings if i remember
21:53:30 <blueuser[m]>  * you need to enable lockdown in settings if i remember
21:53:57 <derpy> ah got it tnx
22:14:24 <dazinism>  @freenode_bkeys:matrix.org did you have a network connection when you tried to do the OEM unlock toggle?
22:23:27 <blueuser[m]> I and another guy have been censored when we spoke about that  exactly 3H ago lol " Pixels do not require it" "go read the faq"
22:23:52 <blueuser[m]> the other guy said only newer devices such as the 4a require it

22:31:38 <BlackWinnerYoshi> real suspicious
22:32:05 <blueuser[m]> what do i mean, anyways it seems to be a part of the anti theft feature that grapheneos do not use
22:32:50 <blueuser[m]>  * what do u mean, anyways it seems to be a part of the anti theft feature that grapheneos do not use
22:34:37 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <blueuser[m] "what do i mean, anyways it seems"> Yeah, sounds like the most logical explanation to this
22:37:48 <strcat[m]> Autopsy: your response earlier about Magisk, etc. is not really correct since if you are using any of those things you aren't using GrapheneOS in the first place since major portions of it are replaced with other things
22:38:06 <strcat[m]> it's not just that it cripples the security model and adds substantial attack surface
22:38:24 <strcat[m]> it is not GrapheneOS, it cannot use the official updates, it cannot be locked with verified boot since it isn't GrapheneOS and isn't signed with the GrapheneOS keys
22:38:29 <strcat[m]> Auditor will show that it isn't GrapheneOS
22:38:51 <strcat[m]> Autopsy: also the throttling for unlock attempts is not simply a 30 second lockout every 5 tries - that's wrong
22:39:28 <strcat[m]> derpy: the information above about unlock attempts and fingerprinting unlocking is wrong
22:39:58 <strcat[m]>  * derpy: the information above about unlock attempts and fingerprint unlocking is wrong
22:40:05 <Autopsy[m]> <strcat[m] "Autopsy: also the throttling for"> The first five tries are. I didn't say every five tries.
22:40:54 <strcat[m]> fingerprint unlocking has a hard limit of 5 attempts on GrapheneOS
22:41:28 <strcat[m]> the primary unlock method has an exponentially increasing lockout timer with hardware enforcement (for decryption) up to 1 day
22:42:12 <strcat[m]> the only differences compared to the stock OS is that the hard lockout for fingerprints is 5 instead of 20 and the non-managed password length limit is 64 instead of 16
22:43:54 <strcat[m]> blueuser: posts containing misinformation are removed from the Matrix scrollback history
22:44:02 <strcat[m]> it's likely that the IRC logging will be ended
22:45:21 <strcat[m]> it's not
22:45:51 <strcat[m]> if you aren't on GrapheneOS the official GrapheneOS updates via the official update client will not work
22:45:56 <strcat[m]> if you modify the OS it is not GrapheneOS
22:46:06 <strcat[m]> you will not have functional updates and Auditor can confirm that it is not GrapheneOS
22:46:27 <strcat[m]> this channel is about GrapheneOS, not derivatives/forks of it
22:46:31 <Autopsy[m]> Daniel
22:46:36 <Autopsy[m]> Can you root GrapheneOS?
22:46:44 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you mean
22:46:58 <strcat[m]> if you build a userdebug build it has `adb root` and `su` for `adb shell` but that's a debug build, not a production release
22:47:22 <Autopsy[m]> Can a user root GrapheneOS?
22:47:29 <Autopsy[m]> Is it recommended? No.
22:47:35 <Autopsy[m]> Can they? Yes.
22:47:40 <strcat[m]> no, they can't
22:47:42 <strcat[m]> that's not GrapheneOS
22:47:52 <strcat[m]> unless you mean making a userdebug build
22:47:54 <Autopsy[m]> And I'm saying that's semantics
22:47:58 <strcat[m]> it's not
22:48:07 <strcat[m]> Auditor can be used to check if something is running GrapheneOS
22:48:21 <strcat[m]> if it does not say it's GrapheneOS in Auditor, it's not GrapheneOS
22:48:29 <strcat[m]> a fork / derivative of GrapheneOS is not GrapheneOS
22:48:32 <Autopsy[m]> And you won't get updates and auditor says it isn't GrapheneOS. Yes. I get that.
22:48:33 <strcat[m]> this channel is not about forks / derivatives
22:48:40 <strcat[m]> because it isn't GrapheneOS
22:48:56 <strcat[m]> if you replace substantial components of the OS that is not GrapheneOS
22:49:29 <strcat[m]> if you replace the boot partition including the init system and SELinux policies, that really isn't GrapheneOS anymore
22:49:33 <strcat[m]> it is a fork
22:49:35 <strcat[m]> and it's off-topic here
22:49:48 <Autopsy[m]> Hence why I said it isn't recommended.
22:49:59 <strcat[m]> it isn't GrapheneOS or GrapheneOS related - it's about forks
22:50:24 <strcat[m]> forks should have their own channels
22:51:29 <Autopsy[m]> Gotcha. So rooting = fork. Therefore, no longer GrapheneOS. Not recommended etc.
22:52:00 <strcat[m]> making substantial modifications to the OS including replacing the core OS partition, init, SELinux policies, etc.
22:52:03 <strcat[m]> is making a fork
22:52:12 <strcat[m]> that is not GrapheneOS anymore
22:52:16 <strcat[m]> it's simple
22:53:56 <strcat[m]> the only way that user-accessible root accessible is made available is via `adb root` and `su` in a userdebug build (i.e. a development build for developers)
22:54:17 <strcat[m]> there is never app-accessible root or root accessible to the high-level OS / application layer
22:56:13 <strcat[m]> if people are taking GrapheneOS and applying substantial modifications like replacing the boot image with a Magisk boot image then they are not running GrapheneOS
22:56:23 <strcat[m]> they may be confused and think they're running it, but they're really not
22:56:59 <strcat[m]> this channel is only about the upstream GrapheneOS project and support is only provided to people using that or working on that
23:19:29 <cdesai[m]> One can think of this as closer to stock
23:19:50 <cdesai[m]> You wouldnâ€™t ask Google for help with using magisk on stock
23:21:22 <cdesai[m]> In the same vein, you shouldnâ€™t ask help with rooting or any such modifications here, since the OS is shipped as a full set of unmodifiable images
23:33:27 <nickcalyx[m]> But i need root to change the icon shape
23:56:15 <andresbs[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "But i need root to change the ic"> I think Lawnchair allows to change icon shapes for the launcher
23:58:49 <nickcalyx[m]> I was only kidding, at the reasons people come up with sometimes to justify undermining the security model
