00:06:15 <analtenderloin[m> <Terrel357 "OsmAnd is definitely the winner "> Yeah but you can't search locations by name near as well as g maps which is kind of important to be practical
00:09:04 <dazinism> Find if you move/zoom the map to the area first it works ok with street names
00:16:30 <Terrel357> If you know the address or do a search for it in your browser you can find the plus code...... https://plus.codes/map/ ........drop this code in OsmAnd and it will take you right there. Its listed under coordinates search and the OLC is the type. Much easier and more accurate than a address.
02:33:31 <sukiyakiwestern> There's no way to use startpage as a default search engine in vanadium is there
02:40:49 <aeonsolution[m]> i think there is a way, let me check sukiyakiwestern
02:48:20 <sukiyakiwestern> Thanks in advance. Its not the end of the world, but it kinda sucks not having search engine parity between phone and PC. Iirc chromium on PCs requires an extension these days
02:57:45 <aeonsolution[m]> that's weird that it needs an extension, let me see if i can add another search engine
02:58:15 <aeonsolution[m]> the way it goes, you can add any search engine by going to the search engine site and looking for something
02:58:49 <aeonsolution[m]> the only thing vanadium doesn't do is add them to the user-facing side in the settings because that is handled upstream
03:00:16 <aeonsolution[m]> said another way, the list on the path: Vanadium->...->Settings->Search engine
03:00:22 <aeonsolution[m]> is handled upstream
03:00:56 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, just confirmed
03:01:09 <aeonsolution[m]> Qwant can be added but Startpage can't
03:01:35 <sukiyakiwestern> Well I assume another reason it requires that is because the domain doesnt show your query. Its always https://www.startpage.com/sp/search
03:01:51 <aeonsolution[m]> when you use a new search enginer, the path I gave above creates a new list of search enginers under "Recently visited"
03:02:05 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] when you use a new search engine, the path I gave above creates a new list of search enginers under "Recently visited"
03:02:47 <aeonsolution[m]> i don't know sorry
03:03:29 <sukiyakiwestern> Yeah, I think its just not possible. No worries. Not worth giving up vanadium anyway. I think its way of doing searches doesn't work natively on modern chromium
03:03:34 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] when you use a new search engine, the path I gave above creates a new list of search engines under "Recently visited"
03:03:48 <sukiyakiwestern> It used to. I remember it showing up as recent
03:04:10 <sukiyakiwestern> As in, chromium doesn't detect its a search engine
03:04:53 <aeonsolution[m]> that's a bummer
03:04:58 <sukiyakiwestern> Wonder if there would be a way to bake in startpage compatibility into vanadium
03:05:30 <sukiyakiwestern> Probably requires too much deviation from chromium's codebase
03:05:54 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, doing that would deviate from upstream. the defaults are based on user traffic
03:06:57 <sukiyakiwestern> I'll just give it up altogether, having that extension probably makes my fingerprint glow in the dark anyway
03:07:12 <aeonsolution[m]> you can try installing bromite and seeing if it accepts the search engine
03:07:32 <aeonsolution[m]> if it does, maybe i can research how they were able to fix that issue
03:08:07 <sukiyakiwestern> Thanks for checking aeonsolution. Also nah, bromite doesnt. Same issue. I'll double check but I went back to vanadium because native apps launch way faster on the 3a for me
03:09:19 <sukiyakiwestern> I really think it's just the way start page functions. Like I said, the domain never changes from https://www.startpage.com/sp/search no matter your search query. How would chromium be able to serve up results without an extension that alters how it functions?
03:10:43 <aeonsolution[m]> you're welcome, well if you do see something that they do that vanadium doesnt have yet, i can port it over and wait for the approval from the devs
03:11:20 <aeonsolution[m]> i wish i knew more to give you some feedback, i can only go on what i can find in the logs and issues sadly
03:11:51 <aeonsolution[m]> from what i saw, chromium overcomes that by using the extension now
03:14:22 <sukiyakiwestern> Yep, its all good. As far as I'm concerned that signs startpage's death sentence. The extension in chromium is way too unique. I could be wrong but on older versions of chrome wasn't there the ability to just add a search engine by manually entering the domain in an option? I haven't been following development but that clearly left at some pont.
03:15:17 <sukiyakiwestern> And just checked, bromite has the same issue. Don't sweat it, its a problem on their end. Though a search engine not detected as one is kinda appealing in itself, lol
03:18:23 <aeonsolution[m]> you can set it as a startpage tho
03:18:31 <aeonsolution[m]> as a workaround
03:18:44 <aeonsolution[m]> lol i made a pun
03:19:00 <sukiyakiwestern> Yeah, I will. I just use and abuse the search widget on my homepage. Oh well
03:19:18 <aeonsolution[m]> ah, right, right
03:20:36 <sukiyakiwestern> Wouldn't be an issue if startpage's app wasn't straight out of 2009. Duckduckgo ain't to bad anyway
03:41:31 <sukiyakiwestern> hey aeonsolution
03:41:36 <sukiyakiwestern> Just found a workaround
03:41:55 <sukiyakiwestern> Once you search on duckduckgo with the !startpage bang, it shows up as a recent engine
03:53:49 <sukiyakiwestern> the domain switches with a !bang by making the domain a more traditional url. Like https://www.startpage.com/do/dsearch?query=startpage&cat=web&pl=opensearch&language=english
04:22:39 <aeonsolution[m]> nice, i just confirmed it too
04:23:13 <aeonsolution[m]> 1. start on the duckduckgo search engine page
04:23:31 <aeonsolution[m]> 2. type "!startpage bang" in the search and search
04:24:01 <aeonsolution[m]> 3.  go to path: Vanadium->...->Settings->Search engine
04:24:35 <aeonsolution[m]> 4. add "Startpage.com - English"
04:26:18 <sukiyakiwestern> exactly. Problem solved. Albeit way more roundabout then it should be lol. If anything it makes me appreciate ddg bangs more
04:26:56 <sukiyakiwestern> To be clear !start pageanything will do it
04:27:04 <sukiyakiwestern> Oof !startpage anything
06:11:27 <funkythings[m]> !s is enough to reach startpage, btw
09:02:48 <jalb> Hi. One question: do you take any risks to your smartphone (in privacy or security) when you change to the Beta release channel?, are updated more frecuently?. is it possible that my smartphone can make weird things?. I'm thinking to change and so report if there's some problem. Thanks
09:03:05 <jalb> *updates
10:30:02 <dazinism> jalb: you get updates quicker, but take the risk there may be some bugs. Every build is still tested to make sure that new updates can be recieved
10:30:32 <dazinism> So bug fixes can still be pushed out to you
10:31:14 <jalb> dazinism, thanks, but I suppose that not a real harm to the smartphone, am I right?
10:31:24 <jalb> Only weird behaviour?
10:32:07 <dazinism> Yes, beta builds are tested before being pushed
10:32:31 <jalb> Thanks!
10:32:40 <dazinism> i think its highly unlikely that their would ever be any harm to a phone
10:33:00 <jalb> Then it's ok
10:33:19 <dazinism> i'm not sure that there has ever been any weird behavior yet
10:33:32 <dazinism> i've been on betas for some timw
10:34:29 <jalb> Great
10:34:41 <dazinism> time. Before betas existed a few years back, there had been some trouble, thats why all builds are now tested
10:34:47 <dazinism> also why there is a beta channel
10:36:09 <dazinism> that issue blocked the ability for updates to be pushed to the phone.
10:37:04 <dazinism> *some phones. People had to download updates to a PC and sideload them
10:37:10 <jalb> Yeah, it's better they are tested
10:38:43 <dazinism> *download the next update, which fixed the issue

13:44:30 <wood123> Hello,
13:44:31 <wood123>  I'm not sure how to submit a request though git so I'll try it here. Could we remove provisioning for tethering from the carrier by adding net.tethering.noprovisioning=true to the build properties at compile time.
13:49:19 <renlord> wood123: os_issue_tracker pls
15:05:30 <strcat[m]> wood123: consequences of that have to be tested across multiple carriers
15:05:47 <strcat[m]> not necessarily enough and may cause problems
15:05:51 <strcat[m]> won't merge untested patches
15:22:04 <strcat[m]> sukiyakiwestern: the domain doesn't need to have search in a GET query string to be added as a search engine
15:22:18 <strcat[m]> sukiyakiwestern: any search engine supporting proper open search metadata can be added as one, some just don't do it properly
15:23:07 <strcat[m]> it's the responsibility of the search engine not Chromium to implement this
15:23:37 <strcat[m]> Chromium doesn't detect them it just handles https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch and not every search engine bothers to set it up
15:23:41 <strcat[m]> some just do it wrong and don't test it
15:25:08 <strcat[m]> startpage is just buying capacity from Google and sending along the searches through Google and they probably just lack the technical capability to set this stuff up properly
15:25:12 <strcat[m]> ecosia has similar issues
15:25:29 <strcat[m]> even duckduckgo is largely just based on bing
15:30:36 <retry0x[m]> Strcat: which do you use?
15:54:18 <galyoninion[m]> Hello, everyone
15:55:09 <galyoninion[m]> I gave Reddit a place to discuss for future users.

16:14:38 <palone[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "OsmAnd+ is the winner here: http"> Seriously. OSMAnd offline actually works. While gmaps completely shits the bed
16:18:26 <erhcetua[m]> it's a good thing that latest build sets DDG as default on vanadium
16:18:40 <erhcetua[m]> prior that there wasn't ddg anywhere
16:20:53 <strcat[m]> erhcetua: it has had it for a long time and it was always possible to add it as a search engine
16:21:01 <strcat[m]> because they have the open search engine metadata done properly
16:21:06 <strcat[m]> as do other major search engines
16:21:17 <erhcetua[m]> yeah i know, but by default it wasn't there
16:21:19 <strcat[m]> just not minor poorly maintained ones like startpage
16:23:36 <strcat[m]> galyoninion: what you're doing there is counterproductive - you're not in a position to be making recommendations to other projects and you'll end up creating conflicts and drawing more attacks on this project
16:23:37 <strcat[m]> please don't
16:23:50 <strcat[m]> people need to focus on working on GrapheneOS
16:24:10 <strcat[m]> stuff unrelated to GrapheneOS is off-topic here
16:45:42 <sukiyakiwestern> thanks for the explanation strcat. I just prefer startpage results, probably because they're google's. Pretty easy to tell its their fault. I'm just going to start using !bangs for everything now, though.
17:45:37 <theultron[m]> I know this is bit off-topic but I think I will get an proper answer here. What sort of attack surface does a userdebug build add? I understand you can run root commands via ADB. But it's disabled by default iirc. Does it weakens SELinux policies or just add few additional policies for debugging?
18:06:33 <nickcalyx[m]> theultron: I believe it means that the signing keys are the default userdebug keys and that you don't really get protection from verified boot because anyone can sign updates
18:08:41 <theultron[m]> Ah! It makes sense now. 🙂
19:55:57 <tadreadpiraterob> I apologize if this question has been answered, but does graphene OS provide support for wireless emergency alerts
20:04:29 <nickcalyx[m]> Yes thats built into aosp
21:55:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> <sukiyakiwestern "thanks for the explanation strca"> This is off-topic so if you feel like you want to reply, please do so in #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  but bangs are almost no different to conducting the search on the site itself.

23:09:33 <takhar[m]> Does Grapheneos have any control or even visibility into what the baseband processor is doing? I am pretty sure the answer is no but I wanted to know if the community had any insight.
23:09:59 <cn3m[m]> <takhar[m] "Does Grapheneos have any control"> GrapheneOS uses Pixels which have a huge focus on IOMMU
23:10:04 <cn3m[m]> let me try to find a good tweet on it
23:11:10 <takhar[m]> <cn3m[m] "GrapheneOS uses Pixels which hav"> Gracias!
23:11:36 <cn3m[m]> so effectively yes
23:11:43 <cn3m[m]> that is a big choice in device
23:11:56 <cn3m[m]> that is why the project recommends Airplane mode confidently
23:13:56 <takhar[m]> <cn3m[m] "that is why the project recommen"> OK, so it will shut down the ability to ping the towers in the background in airplane mode? I usually use a faraday bag but it would be good to have a bit of a fallback.
23:44:24 <renlord> takhar[m]: why not just turn off your phone?
23:49:29 <robocat[m]> <renlord "takhar: why not just turn off yo"> Its like locking your car, u lock, and the pull the door handle to make suee
23:50:12 <robocat[m]> Its just a backup and makes u feel slighty better knowing ur device is in a faraday pocg
23:52:22 <dq[m]> Hi Team,
23:52:22 <dq[m]> Is it possible to recover deleted SMS/MMS from GrapheneOS. I accidentally deleted a very important MMS.
23:56:48 <takhar[m]> <robocat[m] "Its just a backup and makes u fe"> Exactly. Additionally I may want to use a local application without pinging the tower.
