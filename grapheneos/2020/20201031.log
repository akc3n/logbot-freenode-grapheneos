00:03:26 <louipc> oh its not your server?
00:19:41 <Woodpeckerswife> Does anybody know if it’s possible to attach devices to the pixel 4 phone’s USB (e.g. audio line out, HDMI, RJ45, SD card adapter, etc.. ) Some Android Phones have the possibility to use them like a Notebook -> attach a keyboard, mouse and HDMI to it.. Is any of that possible with GrapheneOS & Pixel 4? Thanks for your answers. (I tried looking
00:19:41 <Woodpeckerswife> else where, but could’t find any answers..)
00:20:44 <Woodpeckerswife> And thanks for the great OS !! It really feels good to use! Thanks to all the devs and helpers!
00:27:36 <strcat[m]> Auditor app version 22 released: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases/tag/22
00:27:39 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1322334252315398144
00:29:58 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/jl8q8b/auditor_app_version_22_released/
00:33:11 <strcat[m]> you can upgrade to this on the Pixel 4a to try the new Auditor support for it
00:33:16 <strcat[m]> either on the stock OS or GrapheneOS
00:33:25 <strcat[m]> https://attestation.app/ is already updated
00:42:53 <poisonoushydra> Does anyone else have issues with Gadgetbridge since the switch to Vanadium webview? I am no longer able to configure any watchfaces on my Pebble Time Steel since the 10/23 update :(.
01:02:33 <mateusfmcota> Does the kernel has to be compiled separately before everything else with AOSP?
01:24:34 <strcat[m]> AOSP has kernel prebuilts so building it is optional
01:24:45 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS only has prebuilts for the Pixel 4, 4 XL and 4a though
01:26:02 <strcat[m]> similar to how you don't have to build Vanadium, and the whole toolchain is provided in order to have reproducible builds
01:26:17 <strcat[m]> kernel and Vanadium have their own complex build systems and take a long time to build
01:26:23 <strcat[m]> which is why
01:37:24 <alex-resist> strcat I have a 4a running Graphene. Should I just download the auditor apk and try it out?
01:39:59 <poisonoushydra> Is there any way to switch back to the default WebView? It is getting annoying that so many apps break every time it gets switched over and then reverted back again a week later.
01:40:31 <anonhat[m]> <rosebushactivism "At this point we should really j"> I'm looking into that. Our main focus should be on having an open source, isolated baseband, and an open source silicon root of trust.
01:41:48 <user83> Which carrier do you recommend for a burner phone in the US running Graphene? I don’t wanna pay monthly just for a SIM card to set up Signal and maybe a bit of data I can recharge whenever I need to so I can use it on the go.
01:48:13 <nightjar[m]> <user83 "Which carrier do you recommend f"> Mint mobile allows people to buy prepaid SIM cards with cash iirc. I haven't used them yet but want to eventually.
01:48:58 <nightjar[m]> You can also get prepaid SIM cards of all different types in some pharmacy stores.
02:07:51 <user83> Tbh I think it’s a bit expensive just for a burner phone. Is there any prepaid SIM card provider you’d recommend that's cheaper? I really just need it to set up Signal mainly.
02:46:38 <zachmartin[m]> Stupid ass zucc zucced my IG, caught the hard ban via my device ID or Mac address, can't create a new one on this GrapheneOS Pixel 3. If I hard reset my OS, will it change my Mac so IG won't know my device?
02:55:34 <zachmartin[m]> <user83 "Tbh I think it’s a bit expensive"> If you don't really need a data plan, you can get a $30 Straight Talk SIM plan from Walmart that has a sim card for every major carrier.
03:34:57 <anonhat[m]> <zachmartin[m] "Stupid ass zucc zucced my IG, ca"> Mac addresses should already be randomized by default. Probably a device fingerprint, which is almost impossible to change.
03:35:36 <redibc[m]> I have a good deal on the sim card
03:36:56 <redibc[m]> https://www.ebay.com/itm/3-MONTH-SIMPLE-MOBILE-50-PLAN-90-Days-Preloaded-with-50-Plan-150-Value/143344389573?hash=item215ffdcdc5:g:KM4AAOSwDg1bSPbF
03:37:55 <anonhat[m]> Ebay? Sounds sus...
03:38:08 <redibc[m]> I've used these mw 6 times never had a problem
03:38:24 <redibc[m]> After the plans over just get a new sim
03:39:00 <redibc[m]> I'm trying to use jmp xmpp and csip for the calls
03:39:12 <anonhat[m]> If it's from an unknown third party on the internet, how do you know the SIM doesn't have malware on it?
03:39:15 <redibc[m]> They say its bad to use your phone number for calls
03:39:21 <zachmartin[m]> Why would you get a sim delivered to your address? That defeats the purpose of a burner.
03:40:02 <redibc[m]> Why does it have to be to your address? It comes in the normal simple mobile card and you pop it out
03:40:23 <zachmartin[m]> Go park away from Walmart, walk over in full mask and gloves, since that's okay now, and pay cash at the electronic section for a sim card kit.
03:40:39 <redibc[m]> Then you send the ebay seller the info and they activate it and you get the text from the provider that its active
03:40:41 <anonhat[m]> A po box or drop address would solve that problem. The trustworthiness of the source is what concerns me.
03:41:14 <zachmartin[m]> Agreed. Most don't have drop addresses and PO box requires an ID to get one, bad idea.
03:41:29 <redibc[m]> Just use someone else's house and get it there
03:42:03 <zachmartin[m]> Masked up and cash is the better bet
03:42:04 <redibc[m]> Ebay it to someone tell them a box is going there and wait out there house and get it
03:42:36 <zachmartin[m]> Bad idea, that can still lead back you.
03:42:44 <redibc[m]> How
03:42:55 <anonhat[m]> But it's still from an unknown source on the internet...
03:43:06 <zachmartin[m]> Can't trust people, eliminate all human interaction as much as possible.
03:43:31 <redibc[m]> I think they activate this through someone that works at simple mobile they just say you paid and activate it
03:43:48 <redibc[m]> Yea people suck
03:44:00 <anonhat[m]> Suspicious.
03:44:03 <redibc[m]> But they aren't looking for a guy ordering a sim card off ebay
03:44:31 <zachmartin[m]> Stupid, masked up, cash, use someone else's WiFi to activate, turn off WiFi and never turn it back on again, never use your own WiFi.
03:44:36 <redibc[m]> Do you know how many times I've broke the law on camera? Like 1000
03:45:03 <anonhat[m]> That's moronic.
03:45:13 <redibc[m]> Yea I didn't care but it was worth it
03:45:20 <zachmartin[m]> Right
03:45:44 <redibc[m]> Do you ever call people using your phone number? They can trace that to
03:45:55 <zachmartin[m]> Nope.
03:46:06 <redibc[m]> What do you use
03:46:17 <zachmartin[m]> Always on VPN, WiFi always off. Data only.
03:46:19 <anonhat[m]> Why even use a phone for Instagram? It's much easier to change fingerprint data on a computer.
03:46:38 <zachmartin[m]> Bc I need to be mobile with it.
03:46:40 <redibc[m]> You are right. Computers are way safer. The cell towers are the insecure part
03:47:05 <anonhat[m]> Get a hotspot from calyx institute. Unlimited 4G.
03:47:26 <zachmartin[m]> That's still connecting to the same towers as a data plan.
03:47:48 <redibc[m]> Yea every plan uses the same network and the nsa has it all logged
03:48:23 <anonhat[m]> But your client device will be easier to anonymize.
03:48:51 <anonhat[m]> And the baseband will be physically isolated from your laptop.
03:48:51 <redibc[m]> Have you ever used jmp for voip?
03:49:09 <anonhat[m]> No.
03:49:25 <redibc[m]> When you have to make calls what do you nor.ally use
03:49:35 <redibc[m]> For someone that isn't going to be using encryption
03:50:11 <redibc[m]> Have you ever been arrested?
03:50:47 <redibc[m]> I've been to fed prison
03:53:17 <anonhat[m]> I've been arrested, yes. For most calls, I just use the standard dialer.
03:53:18 <zachmartin[m]> I use Keybase or Signal
03:53:35 <zachmartin[m]> Signal for encrypted calls.
03:53:45 <redibc[m]> With signal you use your own number though
03:53:57 <redibc[m]> What do you use to get different ones?
03:54:14 <anonhat[m]> I prefer jitsi for encrypted calls. No account needed.
03:54:17 <zachmartin[m]> That doesn't matter, I have a burner that can't be traced back to me.
03:54:47 <redibc[m]> What allows it to. to not be traced to you?
03:55:10 <zachmartin[m]> I don't log into anything or connect to anything that I have ever logged into on my personal phone.
03:55:37 <redibc[m]> What about triangulation
03:55:58 <zachmartin[m]> Finding me and tracing it back to be digitally are different.
03:56:01 <redibc[m]> If its next to your phone all the time they already know
03:56:20 <zachmartin[m]> Not unless GrapheneOS is all a sham
03:56:53 <redibc[m]> Okay that's why I want to get different VoIP numbers for different things
03:57:04 <zachmartin[m]> And I don't go mobile with both together because then both devices would connect to the same towers on the same path.
03:58:48 <redibc[m]> To get additional voip numbers what service do you think is the best?
03:59:00 <redibc[m]> In terms of privacy respect
03:59:03 <zachmartin[m]> None, get a true burner.
03:59:12 <redibc[m]> Okay
04:00:47 <zachmartin[m]> Just my opinion, I def don't recommend calls unless encrypted. Interested if anyone has any other suggestions to your question.
04:08:03 <zachmartin[m]> Like no "hacker" could figure out who I am on this phone but the NSA could track down my sim to the Walmart I bought it, get the timestamp the sim was bought then watch the footage of me buying it, then watch me leave and walk away from the building. But I parked pretty far away around no cameras that I know of, of course they would probably find a way but no normal person is going to be able to connect this device
04:08:04 <zachmartin[m]> to me as a person.
04:09:27 <CarpeDiem[m]> If your sec threat is that great don't use a phone at all IMO
04:10:13 <zachmartin[m]> I gotta have a phone lol
04:10:40 <CarpeDiem[m]> I know, it's hard but not impossible to live without one these days
04:11:00 <zachmartin[m]> It is when you use it to make money and survive.
04:11:44 <CarpeDiem[m]> Yeah I've been in that boat and realized my phone was tapped by feds ( on graphene )
04:11:56 <CarpeDiem[m]> So they can defiantly screw you by cell towers.
04:12:17 <redibc[m]> Yea good to know
04:12:26 <CarpeDiem[m]> My data and calls where forwarded to a unknown number, turns out it was LEA
04:12:52 <redibc[m]> How did feds tap the graphene phone? What did you get tapped for to? How did you find out?
04:12:56 <CarpeDiem[m]> *#21# saved me jail time I gjibk
04:12:59 <CarpeDiem[m]> Think*
04:13:22 <CarpeDiem[m]> My phone battery was dying in a  few hrs
04:13:24 <zachmartin[m]> Yeah, I believe it. Double encrypting packets only takes them a little longer to decrypt but still better than nothing, and I'm more worried about random hackers than the gov. Fuck the feds.
04:13:28 <CarpeDiem[m]> All my messages where being red
04:13:51 <CarpeDiem[m]> Getting calls from numbers that were not numbers apparently
04:13:52 <zachmartin[m]> <CarpeDiem[m] "All my messages where being red "> On what app?
04:13:59 <CarpeDiem[m]> Wire messenger
04:14:07 <zachmartin[m]> Hmmm
04:14:07 <CarpeDiem[m]> +
04:14:11 <CarpeDiem[m]> Threema
04:14:20 <redibc[m]> Do you always use tor on graphene?
04:14:25 <CarpeDiem[m]> This is off topic
04:14:35 <CarpeDiem[m]> Not at all anymore I've abondeonded
04:14:44 <CarpeDiem[m]> Ship
04:14:45 <zachmartin[m]> I asked the question there and no one replied.
04:14:47 <zachmartin[m]> And who cares, no one is talking here anyways.
04:14:53 <CarpeDiem[m]> But I ran VPN and then for
04:15:01 <CarpeDiem[m]> Tor*
04:15:23 <redibc[m]> Do you think the feds can tap into you if you are on graphene vpn and tor? Can they see the tor activity through a tap?
04:15:42 <CarpeDiem[m]> If you're using mobile data mhmmm
04:15:57 <CarpeDiem[m]> That's why I use airplane mode only now and WiFi strictly
04:16:17 <CarpeDiem[m]> Disable it to send a LTE text or make a call
04:16:28 <redibc[m]> Yea good idea to
04:16:33 <zachmartin[m]> Your own WiFi thru your ISP?
04:16:49 <CarpeDiem[m]> Are u in aus Zach?
04:16:51 <redibc[m]> I didnt know that they could intercept the tor traffic and decode it

04:18:10 <CarpeDiem[m]> Ahh. You may find a similar product in the USA
04:18:12 <CarpeDiem[m]> Yea mate
04:18:16 <CarpeDiem[m]> And I did
04:18:22 <CarpeDiem[m]> Not get arrested ( yet )
04:18:37 <redibc[m]> I got arrested here in the us
04:18:48 <CarpeDiem[m]> Been a few months I'm just waiting.. But my phone was fairly clean when it was buggd so I'll be OK I think
04:18:55 <zachmartin[m]> If they tapped you, you would have got a visit. Doubt you really got tapped.
04:19:25 <CarpeDiem[m]> I was only buying weed at that time, would have been a waste of money to.raid me
04:19:31 <CarpeDiem[m]> Very off topic now lel
04:19:40 <zachmartin[m]> They don't tap ppl for bud anymore lol
04:19:47 <CarpeDiem[m]> I know.
04:20:02 <CarpeDiem[m]> Didn't say that's all I did.wrong :(
04:20:20 <CarpeDiem[m]> But at that time I believe I was out already
04:20:26 <zachmartin[m]> Move it to off topic if you want
04:20:27 <CarpeDiem[m]> They were too slow
04:20:55 <CarpeDiem[m]> Yes don't want strcat to bN me
04:20:56 <CarpeDiem[m]> Lel
04:24:27 <anonhat[m]> To be clear, grapheneOS isn't intended to protect you from law enforcement. Or even most forms of surveillance. So its usefulness as a tool of criminal enterprise is dubious.
04:27:14 <CarpeDiem[m]> Get in touch with the big fish and get a cipher tel. Gg
04:27:45 <louipc> no
04:28:47 <zachmartin[m]> <anonhat[m] "To be clear, grapheneOS isn't in"> Its definitely better than google and apple keylogging everything you type.
04:29:12 <louipc> just stop typing
04:29:15 <louipc> problem solved
04:31:09 <null[m]> But no one at google is going to sift through the actual billion users in their DB to find some random dealer for some Australian cops lol.
04:31:09 <null[m]> If you're a whistleblower, or a terrorist, then maybe.
04:31:43 <louipc> you dont need much typing to blow the whistle tho do you?
04:31:47 <CarpeDiem[m]> Confirmed alkydah
04:32:02 <louipc> maildrop, walk away all sly
04:32:05 <louipc> alls good
04:32:28 <anonhat[m]> Well... Google has been known to provide location data for user accounts in a general area when requested by police.

04:34:18 <null[m]> My point still stands. Why would they go through that effort, for a mere drug dealer, in another country, for local law enforcement, in another country.
04:35:02 <null[m]> I'm talking about key logging specifically here since that's the example you gave.
04:35:10 <louipc> anyway sounds pretty #grapheneos-offtopic to me
04:40:05 <lurkercheckwrong> <anonhat[m] "To be clear, grapheneOS isn't in"> The former is no brainer, but the latter seems controversial?
04:41:14 <louipc> lurkercheckwrong: not really
04:41:26 <lurkercheckwrong> or does the latter also holds true for iOS?
04:41:32 <null[m]> I think it definitely lowers your attack surface as a criminal.
04:41:32 <null[m]> But if the feds want to get you, they'll get you regardless, graphene or not

04:42:36 <anonhat[m]> GrapheneOS is still being developed. It isn't as secure as some people think it is, but it's getting better.
04:42:55 <louipc> yea most form of surveillance meaning sms and phone calls can still be monitored by phone companies
04:43:04 <louipc> all dns requests
04:43:17 <louipc> everything not covered by tls
04:43:54 <lurkercheckwrong> <louipc "everything not covered by tls"> dns over tls is quite moot on preventing the isp to see the websites visited
04:44:43 <anonhat[m]> For instance, executable space protection is only enforced in base packages by default. True virtualization based sandboxing is quite far out. And there aren't even encrypted communication apps included by default. It's still a work in progress.
04:45:01 <louipc> not sure what you mean by 'quite moot'

04:46:02 <anonhat[m]> DNSSEC is the only type of DNS encryption you should trust.
04:46:16 <lurkercheckwrong> <zachmartin[m] "Not when you use a VPN that offe"> At that point, one would use the VPN instead
04:46:49 <null[m]> Well... Yeah I think that's what they were saying.
04:48:22 <zachmartin[m]> Yeah, VPN always on. Everyone should be doing that.
04:48:38 <louipc> privacy only comes with user behaviour and habits
04:49:02 <louipc> because a vpn will shut down to protect little old you?
04:49:25 <lurkercheckwrong> <louipc "privacy only comes with user beh"> Sounds about right. GrapheneOS has a higher ceiling than any other android-based OS though
04:50:23 <lurkercheckwrong> <louipc "privacy only comes with user beh"> Don't know about that, maybe it is a critical factor, but there is a limit based on the OS
04:50:44 <lurkercheckwrong> otherwise, why develop GrapheneOS /s
04:51:08 <anonhat[m]> But if government surveillance is within your threat model, a VPN isn't enough. They're very vulnerable to timing and correlation attacks. Even Tor is theoretically vulnerable.
04:51:20 <lurkercheckwrong> Just kidding, privacy and security improvements are desirable (which GrapheneOS offers)
04:51:58 <louipc> because if you're not broadcasting to the world then you can have some hope of privacy by having secure device where data is secure

05:14:23 <anonhat[m]> > Also, there are good reasons why apps like Signal is not bundled (like conflict of interest in developing the app)
05:14:23 <anonhat[m]> Android's sandbox already relies upon Linux's user ID system to isolate apps. So, instinctively, I don't think using separate Android user accounts will make much more of a difference. However, newer versions of android do come with per-user file-based encryption by default, which may help keep application data private from other user accounts. But memory isolation would still be a concern.
05:44:38 <rosebushactivism> Is Android Nearby Share still connected to Google Play Services, or would it be able to work on GrapheneOS? As an alternative, could it be implemented without Google Play Services in any way?

07:19:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> We haven't shipped version 22 yet
07:34:56 <r0tt0r[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "We haven't shipped version 22 ye"> oh so i shouldnt update the apk manually?
07:37:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
07:38:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> We do not have a clear decision whether we should support out of band updates for system apps in this manner
07:38:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> In case of problems we will just ask you to factory reset
07:57:19 <lurkercheckwrong> <anupritaisno1[m] "We do not have a clear decision "> Well, it shouldn't be installed if the apk is tampered anyways by mitm or not??
08:16:22 <Woodpeckerswife> Is it possible to attach devices to the pixel 4 phone’s USB (e.g. audio line out, HDMI, RJ45, SD card adapter, etc.. ) Some Android Phones have the possibility to use them like a Notebook -> attach a keyboard, mouse and HDMI to it.. Is any of that possible with GrapheneOS & Pixel 4? Thanks for your help. (I tried looking else where, but could’t
08:16:22 <Woodpeckerswife> find any answers..) And thanks for the great OS !! It really feels good to use! Thanks to all the devs and helpers!
08:20:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes you can
08:22:01 <somenerd[m]> Are there any requirements to be met before moving on with the roadmap (on the website), like resources or some other goal?
08:35:43 <anonhat[m]> Are there ever...
08:35:43 <anonhat[m]> The bottom line: We need people. Devs, testers, maintainers, etc. Mostly devs.
08:36:16 <somenerd[m]> yeah
08:38:55 <dazinism> This is a bit old but, I think, mostly still accurate. Stuff that needs doing
08:39:03 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os
08:39:45 <somenerd[m]> what is "hub.libranet.de"???

09:21:46 <voodoo> Hi, is it possible 2 change imei number on grapheneos?
09:24:49 <CarpeDiem[m]> Negative
09:25:10 <CarpeDiem[m]> Buy a new device if you want a new imei T.T
09:27:36 <voodoo> Well thats expensive if i would wanna random imei every few days 2 stay anonymous 2 the carrier
09:28:11 <voodoo> On samsung phonesnwith androidnit is possible with root, it would be nice if graphene had this 2
09:31:57 <r0tt0r[m]> <voodoo "On samsung phonesnwith androidni"> besides its in most countries its illegal
09:34:23 <r0tt0r[m]> * besides its in most countries illegal
09:37:47 <voodoo> Not illegal in my country, but it s clear now that with graphene it s not possible, just dont understand why it hides imei from apps whike the biggest risk is carrier spying location of phone etc
09:46:53 <dazinism> The hiding of identifiable information from apps is an AOSP
09:47:26 <dazinism> feature
09:49:16 <dazinism> Imagine a robust implementation of IMEI changing, that did everything a user expected, would be considered for GrapheneOS
09:50:09 <dazinism> As I understand it theres is more than the imei which would let a carrier know that it is the same device.
09:51:09 <voodoo> If i change imei and sim card at the same time i think the carrier would think it s a new device
09:51:30 <voodoo> That is my understanding dont know if i m wrong
09:51:36 <dazinism> Would have to look carefully at the way that the baseband and cell tower communicate to identify anything that could lead to a device being identified
09:52:59 <dazinism> Looking at what was involved in implementing proper WiFi anonymity would give an idea of what could be involved (it was more than just the mac address)
09:55:21 <dazinism> I'm pretty sure for something to be considered for GrapheneOS there would have to be no way a carrier could work out it was the same device
09:56:28 <voodoo> If that would be possible and implemented in the future it would be 1 of the best things for grapheneos
09:56:57 <cUmUc> multiple work profiles
09:57:06 <CarpeDiem[m]> Won't happen. I've offered big donations asking for it to be implemented
09:57:20 <CarpeDiem[m]> Devs said not interested
09:58:06 <cUmUc> bigoof
09:58:35 <cUmUc> yeah that seems a bit out of scope tbh
09:59:00 <CarpeDiem[m]> ItS iLleGaL
09:59:46 <voodoo> Not in every county, many country s it is legal
10:00:09 <CarpeDiem[m]> I know but that's what I get tossed at me when I've asked
10:00:43 <CarpeDiem[m]> Even when I said I'd pay upwards of $2000
10:00:54 <CarpeDiem[m]> But meh :)
10:00:56 <dazinism> If someone implemented it well, I  could see it being considered
10:01:14 <dazinism> Don't know that 2000 would cover the dev time
10:01:42 <CarpeDiem[m]> Yeah I've heard it before fa
10:01:46 <CarpeDiem[m]> Daz :p
10:02:10 <CarpeDiem[m]> Strat explained it to me
10:02:12 <dazinism> Also, i don't think existing devs have got the bandwidth(hours in the day) to take something like that on
10:02:25 <CarpeDiem[m]> Mhmm ^
10:02:44 <CarpeDiem[m]> That's the big factor I've been told
10:02:46 <CarpeDiem[m]> Man hours
10:03:06 <CarpeDiem[m]> Which I completely understand
10:03:20 <dazinism> If you really want it could find someone to so the work and pay them
10:03:50 <dazinism> Maybe look for people who already do work/understand baseband stuff
10:04:53 <CarpeDiem[m]> Not a bad idea daz. Im not as interested now as my threat level is much less these days
10:04:59 <dazinism> Its a whole different thing to making android builds
10:05:10 <CarpeDiem[m]> No need to be fucking with imei numbers.

10:37:23 <r0tt0r[m]> another sidequestion related apps that hold screen active, fe. an app for streaming lets call it netflax. i start to play something and fall asleep. how can i force screenlocking after a certain time lets say 30 mins?
10:39:29 <r0tt0r[m]> when in that time wifi goes off, an error is showing and next morning screen still open
10:41:19 <dazinism> trismous: yeah, legal in some (guess most notably the USA). The lack of legality everywhere makes it less useful/desirable. Not quite sure where it is/is not legal.
10:44:10 <louipc> you'd have to start a new project where it is legal.
10:44:29 <trismous[m]> Also iirc it is backed into the firmware of the modem
10:45:08 <trismous[m]> Probably not something yiu could easily access from the OS level
10:46:08 <trismous[m]> Question is if the modem doesn't have restrictions in place blocking it from running with different IMEI than the one it was manufactured with

12:13:28 <somenerd[m]> (just wondering, not really a serious q)
12:30:34 <ramol[m]> I have a question about the code and the authenticity etc. not sure how to phrase it, a simple background and how it came about is I watched a documentary recently stuxnet, and just made be question, is it possible that the OS has hidden back doors developed by governments (nsa, etc.) the fact that graphene is based on stock android
13:08:59 <dazinism> somenerd: download the apk from github or add the izzyondroid fdroid repo (not updated there yet, but I think should be soon)
13:09:48 <dazinism> Updates for apps have to be signed with the same cert

13:14:34 <strcat> CarpeDiem[m]: "I've offered big donations asking for it to be implemented" - no you haven't, $2000 is not a substantial amount of money for that, it probably wouldn't even cover a hardware setup to test that kind of feature (an emulated cell tower to analyze traffic)
13:33:00 <anonhat[m]> <strcat "ramol: you can read the document"> That's not the type of response that will win hearts and minds.

13:51:31 <nscnt> </3
14:02:29 <anonhat[m]> It just came off as abrasive. That's my point. If we want more people to adopt the OS, we have to put on a happy face. Even with the uninitiated. We were all there at some point.

16:30:12 <burnerburnbabybu> Hello. My Galaxy S8's screen just went kerplunk and I need a new phone. I learned about GrapheneOS from The Hated One and I'm interested, but the only affordable model for me that would work is the Pixel 4a. I've heard some discussions about 4a being close to official release so I was wondering if it would be good to buy a Pixel 4a now and simply
16:30:13 <burnerburnbabybu> boot it with GrapheneOS when it gets released. Also, would I be free to use the 4a as I wish until the non-experimental release is public, and then install GrapheneOS?
16:34:34 <grapheneoeoeo> Just got a Pixel 3a. Should I update to android 11 before installing?
16:34:56 <burnerburnbabybu> how did you get a carrier-unlocked 3a?
16:35:26 <grapheneoeoeo> overstock refurb
16:36:13 <burnerburnbabybu> You trust the phone you got? If so then I suppose I'll get one there.

16:58:03 <burnerburnbabybu> it's experimental right?
16:58:11 <burnerburnbabybu> does that impact its privacy or ability to perform?

16:58:31 <burnerburnbabybu> ah okay then. So what does it affect?
16:58:53 <strcat[m]> it means it's experimental, that's it

16:59:20 <burnerburnbabybu> i mean what is the difference between experimental and not?
16:59:33 <burnerburnbabybu> I'm just confused is all

17:00:03 <picat> "bugs: you tell me" perhaps
17:00:21 <strcat[m]> it's not as heavily used / tested as other devices
17:00:36 <burnerburnbabybu> Okay. Thanks for explaining.
17:00:44 <strcat[m]> I don't understand the confusion, I think it's pretty clear that experimental means it's still experimental
17:00:59 <burnerburnbabybu> I just didn't know. But thanks for explaining.
17:01:10 <strcat[m]> there are still stable and beta channels for it and a beta testing process

21:06:17 <jpds> burner2014: You can use any carrier
21:06:45 <burner2014> So I just put the SIM card and go to the AT&T store after doing everything on Graphene right?
21:06:47 <burner2014> Just making sure.
21:07:02 <burner2014> I'd rather ask a newb question than blow $350
21:07:31 <jpds> Assuming the phone isn't locked to a contract with a specific carrier, yes, everything will be fine
21:07:58 <burner2014> I'm going to buy it without a carrier right from the Google Store so I can add a carrier later.
21:18:23 <CarpeDiem[m]> <strcat "Carpe~Diem: "I've offered big do"> This isn't my first account here. I burn them on the regular and I indeed did a few months ago
21:31:29 <louipc> if you have the money maybe you can take the project on yourself
21:31:59 <louipc> grapheneos is open source anyway
21:42:04 <strcat[m]> Carpe~Diem: what you describe there is not a big donation in the context of funding that kind of feature, as I explained
21:42:21 <strcat[m]> so no, what you said isn't true, and doesn't have to do with you using earlier accounts or not
21:46:22 <strcat[m]> you also made false claims about the position of the project on it
21:48:38 <strcat[m]> also paying someone for a service (development) is not a donation, that's contract work
21:49:16 <strcat[m]> a donation doesn't have strings attached where you receive something in exchange for it
21:50:11 <strcat[m]> and if you want to pay for contract work, it's going to need to cover obtaining the necessary equipment and paying the developer for their work
21:50:37 <strcat[m]> I can't recall any serious offer from anyone to do that - but let me know if I'm wrong
21:53:35 <peertopeer12[m]> well worded @strc
21:55:43 <strcat[m]> no one can say they offered to make a donation to the project in exchange for something - because that's not a donation, and we cannot legally accept it as one
21:57:13 <strcat[m]> at least in Canada, even given basic tangible rewards to crowdfunding contributors is problematic
21:57:14 <louipc> yea thats a good point too
21:57:24 <strcat[m]> it's a way to to turn it into a sale instead of a gift
21:58:58 <strcat[m]> I'm personally not interested in doing contract work - if you want to pay for something to be developed, you'll need to find a developer (or more than one) to pay and work out a contract with them
22:00:26 <strcat[m]> and money can't be paid to the project or myself to influence decisions, etc.
22:01:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) check pm
22:03:35 <strcat[m]> if you want a feature you can file an issue on the tracker explaining it and making a technical argument for including it
22:03:51 <strcat[m]> and then either implement it yourself or find someone you can pay to implement it
22:04:00 <strcat[m]> if the feature is accepted as something that's desired
22:11:08 <r0tt0r[m]> <louipc "good question"> worked flawlessly
22:11:32 <r0tt0r[m]> dunno how to verify if im on beta now
22:11:59 <louipc> sweet. another good question
22:13:23 <strcat[m]> the stable and beta channels are release channels for obtaining updates
22:13:34 <strcat[m]> an actual release is not in any way inherently a 'beta' or 'stable' release
22:13:49 <strcat[m]> it initially goes out via the testing channel, then beta, then stable - it's the same release through all of that
22:14:08 <strcat[m]> most of the time, the current beta channel release is the same as the current stable release
22:14:29 <louipc> i see. that is currently the case it would appear
22:14:33 <strcat[m]> and it's only when problems are found and a release is cancelled that it doesn't make it through to the stable channel
22:14:55 <r0tt0r[m]> ok makes sense
22:44:42 <r0tt0r[m]> <louipc "sweet. another good question"> under systemupdate it shows channel beta
22:51:56 <nightjar[m]> <user83 "Tbh I think it’s a bit expensive"> Apparently you can get two one-week Mint Mobile trial cards on Amazon for $5. You need to activate them with the mint mobile app (there might be another way, don't know) but after that, you can use them for a week to set up accounts anywhere. You should be fine for Signal but if you set up accounts anywhere else make sure to enable software/hardware token 2FA and
22:51:56 <nightjar[m]> subsequently delete the phone number of the account. I have heard that that method with Google, Facebook, etc. accounts will allow one to use then long after the one-week trial period for the number has expried. Michael Bazzell talked about it on his podcast. Also, if you want anonymity you can pick them up physically from an Amazon locker from a new burner Amazon account on a non-local IP address, or you can order
22:51:56 <nightjar[m]> them to a UPS box or something using a masked debit card (Abine Blur, Privacy.com, etc).
22:52:29 <nightjar[m]> You could also try jmp.chat or anothrr VOIP servicd if you just need a number for signal because they are cheap.
22:52:45 <nightjar[m]> service* lol
