00:14:29 <SilverSurfer666> If using second profile, daniel micay says its best to keep the first profile empty and use the second one
00:15:37 <SilverSurfer666> But if i put apps like whatsapp banking and stuff on the first but never use them, and than put the apps also in the second profile but there i wil use tham is that still safe? Or is t going to mess uo something because i have the same apps in 2 profiles?

07:03:20 <Liakde[m]> It's not yet officially on GrapheneOS, to be clear
07:03:25 <somenerd[m]> * Wait, did you compile microG with the OS?
07:03:25 <Liakde[m]> But it does work
07:04:11 <Liakde[m]> with Dylanger's pull request, to make microG work as user app and limit its "sig spoofing" on the app itself only iirc?
07:05:04 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah it limits it to our specific build

07:07:16 <Liakde[m]> <Dylanger[m] "nop"> While it's true that it works, it doesn't remove the issues of microG itself (on privacy, as it still sends to Google servers, and on security, which is being attempted to mitigate in GrapheneOS in the future per conditions in https://nitter.net/GrapheneOS/status/1331408302065004544#m)

07:29:41 <Liakde[m]> The point of supporting it only as a user app is to choose whether to install or not install microG
07:31:21 <Liakde[m]> a reason that it takes a while is probably on improving the security and privacy of microG itself to reduce its liability when it is ready to be supported in the OS itself
07:31:21 <Liakde[m]> But it depends on the developers to provide two builds or just one, but that'll take longer imho

Do you have any idea what I can do to make it running?

13:33:07 <gnost[m]> question, maybe I'm misunderstanding how to use remote attestation but I keep getting emails saying failed to provide valid attestations within <timespan>. Does this mean my device is failing attestation or am I not providing one (in case there's something on my end I'm not doing)?
13:33:58 <somenerd[m]> https://attestation.app/tutorial#scheduled-remote-verification
13:34:14 <somenerd[m]> I believe you scheduled attestation?
13:34:31 <gnost[m]> yes I followed those instructions and set it up
13:35:13 <gnost[m]> it doesn't say if I need to do anything to provide valid attestation. I just have it set up according to those instructions and I receive the emails saying the error I previously mentioned
13:36:11 <gnost[m]> the time period I set  up was longer than 24 hours in case that helps.
13:37:15 <somenerd[m]> Does auditor have network access?
13:38:07 <somenerd[m]> (I'm not well versed on the topic, but from what I could tell, the server queries the app for attestation)
13:38:25 <somenerd[m]> (I may be completely wrong on this though)
13:38:39 <gnost[m]> not always but I set it up for the time period to be longer than 24 hours so it has network access at some point within that time
13:38:52 <somenerd[m]> I meant the permission
13:39:05 <gnost[m]> I believe so but I'll verify
13:40:02 <gnost[m]> it does
13:41:21 <Liakde[m]> <somenerd[m] "Does auditor have network access"> It needs that for remote attestation, and yes it has network permission
13:49:15 <gnost[m]> according to some issues on the attestation server git repo Daniel Micay recommends doing a local verification and seeing what fails
13:49:45 <gnost[m]> gonna try that and will let you all know if that sheds any light on the issue
14:02:36 <gnost[m]> "Successfully performed strong paired verification and identity confirmation"
14:02:54 <gnost[m]> with two separate devices as the auditor
14:03:11 <gnost[m]> * with two separate devices as the auditors
14:03:39 <gnost[m]> so it appears to be an issue sending attestations
14:04:52 <somenerd[m]> maybe a firewall?
14:05:34 <gnost[m]> other than orbot as a full device vpn, no firewall app or anything in use
14:05:57 <somenerd[m]> I think the domain is https://attestation.app
14:08:03 <refraction[m]> So, I was trying to download an attachment from an email (It's a picture), but GOS just opened the Gallery app and didn't download the image.
14:08:29 <refraction[m]> Already checked permissions but doesn't seem to have anything wrong.
14:09:00 <refraction[m]> Anybody have any ideas as to what I did wrong?
14:09:55 <gnost[m]> have you, in the past, set it to always open images in gallery
14:11:58 <refraction[m]> Already checked Default Apps in Settings - Nothing indicates that I have set it to always open images in gallery
14:35:31 <refraction[m]> So, since it apparently opens up a neutered version of Gallery (Only options are to Set Photo As... or Print), any ideas?
14:37:13 <refraction[m]> Settings in the main Gallery app also seem to only open up to a black void. Is this intentional?

18:26:04 <cyanlemons[m]> hey, how feasible would it be to build some sort of triangulation-resistant GSM firmware by just adding slight delays to the RTT when communicating with a cell tower?
18:26:16 <cyanlemons[m]> maybe not for a pixel, but for any GSM module in general
18:26:35 <cyanlemons[m]> if you have random delays added to the RTT, presumably the triangulation wouldn't be as precise, and would be stuck to an area of ~500m, rather than ~10m
18:32:36 <dar_gomml[m]> in assume you'd have to consider signal strength too then
18:34:14 <cyanlemons[m]> hmm, yes, perhaps the cell tower would know your distance just based off how powerful of a frequency your device is sending
18:34:43 <cyanlemons[m]> in which case, perhaps you could have the GSM module intentionally submit a lower-powered frequency, to match the additional random delay you add to your RTT
18:37:08 <cyanlemons[m]> that way, your new RTT is now artificially delayed with just a simple sleep, and then it is also paired with lower-power radio frequency that would line up with what the cell tower would except for a signal strength given your RTT

19:06:38 <Liakde[m]> oh just put it that way
19:07:18 <dakotah[m]> Ah, I thought you were a kde dev possibly.
19:08:00 <SnowmanPC> Is the command just "fastboot devices"
19:08:37 <dakotah[m]> yes
19:09:25 <SnowmanPC> nothing
19:09:36 <SnowmanPC> no return
19:10:16 <SnowmanPC> I know it's installed, when I do `fastboot --version` I get "fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874"

19:11:15 <SnowmanPC> yeah, I feared that would be the problem, the page warned that you need a high quality usb cable...
19:11:43 <dakotah[m]> Oh ok. Did you enable usb debugging on the phone first?
19:11:43 <dakotah[m]> Typically I do that then adb devices to get the authorization pop-up. After that I adb reboot fastboot then fastboot stuff.
19:12:12 <SnowmanPC> no I was in the bootloader menu
19:12:25 <SnowmanPC> but when I opened the main os, I could connect over usb
19:12:34 <SnowmanPC> and see the files and all that
19:13:01 <dakotah[m]> Then it would not be the cable.
19:13:06 <SnowmanPC> oh okay
19:13:21 <SnowmanPC> yeah in device manager it says the Pixel 3a XL is connected
19:14:25 <dakotah[m]> On linux if the udev is not correctly set up you have to run fastboot as root. Potentially a similar thing? Try an admin ps console.
19:14:33 <Liakdeuser[m]> <SnowmanPC "I know it's installed, when I do"> You tried it already on all your ports and usb cable combination?

19:15:37 <SnowmanPC> I'll try running as admin
19:16:20 <dakotah[m]> <Urija[m] "Is it possible the Windows user "> It would matter in some cases. I do not know why it sometimes matters for Windows though.

19:21:17 <FukY> Silly question having only partially followed the conversation: is your phone sitting in the boot menu? I.e. are you starting at a red/yellow triangle or fastbootd?
19:21:25 <SnowmanPC> yes
19:22:05 <SnowmanPC> red triangle "Fastboot Mode"
19:22:15 <SnowmanPC> "Device state: Locked"
19:22:53 <Liakdeuser[m]> Unfortunately, you might have to try it on another pc
19:23:08 <Liakdeuser[m]> It's probably some bad quality ports or usb cables
19:23:28 <SnowmanPC> well that's annoying. If it doesn't work on my brothers pc ill try buying another cable...

19:45:08 <dontaskme[m]> <SnowmanPC "yes"> I had to d/l a USB driver from google to get it to work for me. Wouldn't get past the 'waiting for device' message no matter what I did
19:45:09 <SnowmanPC> but fastboot in powershell says there's no fastboot devices connected
19:46:10 <Liakdeuser[m]> <SnowmanPC "Device manager clearly recognize"> Fastboot needs a good quality usb cable probably, and it means the drivers are installed too, removing that to possible cause of problems
19:46:46 <SnowmanPC> so the most likely problem is that I need a better usb cable
19:46:51 <SnowmanPC> Any recommendations?
19:48:18 <dontaskme[m]> I had exactly the same issue. Fastboot devices would see the device but wouldn't allow me to unlock the bootloader. Got the USB driver and it worked 1st time
19:49:13 <SnowmanPC> no
19:49:25 <SnowmanPC> when I do `fastboot devices` there's nothing
19:49:26 <hdksv7391[m]> Updating drivers helped for me
19:49:40 <SnowmanPC> how would I do that besides windows update
19:50:11 <hdksv7391[m]> Theres "Additional updates" in the updates menu
19:50:14 <SnowmanPC> which is up-to-date
19:50:44 <SnowmanPC> >Theres "Additional updates" in the updates menu
19:50:46 <SnowmanPC> ohhh
19:50:51 <SnowmanPC> found it
19:52:37 <hdksv7391[m]> Using Linux to flash Graphene is easier tho.. Would sugest that rather than fighting with Windows
19:53:17 <snowmanpc76> well regardless of fastboot, my bluetooth finally works
19:53:32 <snowmanpc76> so that's great
19:58:26 <dontaskme[m]> <SnowmanPC "how would I do that besides wind"> https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb
20:01:05 <SnowstormPC> It worked!
20:01:47 <Liakdeuser[m]> Which solution worked?
20:02:01 <SnowstormPC> I just needed to update all the drivers. there was something specifically for android something or other
20:02:17 <SnowstormPC> think it was a fastboot thing
20:04:04 <Liakdeuser[m]> Great stuff, then, it was installed but outdated, guess you can do fastboot flashing unlock now?
20:04:16 <Liakdeuser[m]> * Great stuff, then, it was installed but outdated, guess you can do "fastboot flashing unlock" now?
20:04:25 <SnowstormPC> yep it's unlocked now
20:04:40 <SnowstormPC> thanks for your help guys
20:05:42 <Liakdeuser[m]> Hope the flashing went well then
20:06:47 <SnowstormPC> I unlocked it, about to flash it
20:17:02 <SnowstormPC> :DDD
20:17:13 <SnowstormPC> I'm in GrapheneOS setup now
20:17:19 <SnowstormPC> Thanks guys
20:20:28 <SnowstormPC> >If you have a backup from your last LineageOS phone, you can restore it here.
20:20:39 <SnowstormPC> Uhh is graphene based off lineage?
20:21:55 <nscnt> No it isn't. It's based on nothing else but AOSP
20:22:14 <SnowstormPC> then why does it say that
20:22:28 <nscnt> GrapheneOS uses the SetupWizard from LineageOS. The string wasn't changed yet
20:22:36 <nscnt> *hasn't been
20:22:41 <SnowstormPC> oh
20:22:49 <SnowstormPC> so that part WAS based off lineage ;)
20:23:18 <nscnt> Yes, but you asked whether GrapheneOS is based on LineageOS and it isn't
20:23:33 <SnowstormPC> yeah okay
20:23:37 <nscnt> c:
20:23:51 <SnowstormPC> anyway, I'm gonna go
20:24:15 <SnowstormPC> um why im i in italics now
20:24:33 <SnowstormPC> I hit something on my keyboard. Oh its back to normal now
20:24:34 <SnowstormPC> lol
20:24:53 <SnowstormPC> Anyway, now that my phone has the proper OS imma setup everything
20:24:57 <SnowstormPC> bye bye
20:25:02 <nscnt> Bye
20:31:23 <pythagonist[m]> Hello everyone! I've got a question about Graphene and it's app compatibility.
20:35:07 <pythagonist[m]> Situation: I live in Austria, I've got a bank Account there bla bla bla. There's an App, you need it to make online payments etc. Now the problem: The app gets an error, which is technically because of no usable Google Services. I don't know much about bank apps, but do they commonly use Google for some stuff? I really need this app, else I'm kinda f*****.
20:35:07 <pythagonist[m]> App name: "Mein Elba"
20:39:36 <thestranger> My banking app works fine
20:40:27 <thestranger> If yours is depending on google play service than it wont work
20:48:31 <ash[m]1> shoutout to the grapheneos devs, y'all make a badass mobile os
20:50:23 <grapheneos_user_> They're great. One of the only people whose OS is decent for security.
20:52:41 <pythagonist[m]> <thestranger "If yours is depending on google "> The problem is, I don't really know. They won't tell me. The only thing I know, is, that they also have their app in the Huawei Appstore, which apps are independent with google. I've already tried this one too, also nothing.
20:53:19 <pythagonist[m]> Maybe I need to give it special permissions? I don't know :(
20:55:44 <r00st3r[m]> Bigger question: any way to determine in advance if non open source apps use Google play services?
20:56:34 <ash[m]1> aurora store shows them
20:56:41 <strcat[m]> r00st3r: GrapheneOS doesn't have Play services  so none do
20:56:53 <strcat[m]> an app being able to use Play services when available doesn't imply any functionality will be missing without it
20:57:06 <strcat[m]> some fully implement alternatives for when it's unavailable, others don't
20:57:06 <ash[m]1> ye
20:57:08 <ash[m]1> I use discord
20:57:14 <ash[m]1> and it requires play services
20:57:17 <ash[m]1> and I have zero.issues
20:57:51 <strcat[m]> a common issue is apps not bothering to implement push (or at least polling) for events from the server without FCM available
20:57:54 <strcat[m]> but they can, and many do
21:00:17 <pythagonist[m]> Mh... so no one could help me?
21:00:24 <Golli[m]> <ash[m]1 "and it requires play services "> Discord only requires Play services to send you notifications.
21:01:45 <Golli[m]> pythagonist: Does it not run without Play services?
21:02:24 <pythagonist[m]> <Golli[m] "pythagonist: Does it not run wit"> It does run, but at a specific verification point, it gives me an error
21:02:43 <Interested> Does GrapheneOS have a recommended TTS engine?
21:02:58 <r00st3r[m]> <strcat[m] "r00st3r: GrapheneOS doesn't have"> I've got some critical apps for work that I'd like to know in advance about
21:03:35 <strcat[m]> Interested: no, we don't have a recommendation, the functionality does work though
21:03:39 <strcat[m]> and there are options available
21:03:44 <Golli[m]> <pythagonist[m] "It does run, but at a specific v"> I imagine it'd be to gather specific device information for "security" reasons.
21:04:14 <pythagonist[m]> hopefully yes
21:04:33 <pythagonist[m]> I'll gonna talk to my bank soon, I just hoped for help here
21:05:03 <pythagonist[m]> Quick info about all the google trackers in this app(Maybe it helps?):
21:05:12 * pythagonist[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201226-220314.png (137KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/AVXIWBvuqaDFBEWcgTNZVmKU/Screenshot_20201226-220314.png >
21:05:56 <Golli[m]> If they are using it for security reasons, then they won't change it.
21:06:37 <Golli[m]> What trackers it uses won't help, I'm afraid.
21:06:41 <Interested> I'd rather not use anything Google, including TTS.  I believe Pico went away some time ago... haven't found one since that was satisfactory.  Most seem to have not any recent development activity.
21:08:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google is just ðŸ‘Œ
21:08:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Good apps
21:11:52 <strcat[m]> Interested: rfvoice, flite and other alternatives exist
21:12:01 <strcat[m]>  * Interested: rhvoice, flite and other alternatives exist
21:12:13 <strcat[m]> pico tts is dead
21:12:36 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/RHVoice/RHVoice is still developed
21:12:37 <strcat[m]> use that
21:12:47 <ash[m]1> > <@golli:matrix.kiwifarms.net> Discord only requires Play services to send you notifications.
21:12:47 <ash[m]1> > It still runs perfectly fine (albeit without notifications) without Play services.
21:12:47 <ash[m]1> ye thats my point, some apps "require" it
21:12:48 <ash[m]1> but run fine
21:12:51 <strcat[m]> not an official recommendation
21:13:25 <Interested> If flite works, that would be fine.  i couldn't make it work with some versions of lineageos.  understood on rhvoice.  just looking for something functional for osmand.
21:13:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just use googletts, be happy
21:13:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not an official recommendation
21:13:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just my opinion
21:14:35 <Interested> whenever something is not in AOSP, i have to wonder... closed source usually means we are the product.
21:15:46 <strcat[m]> it's not available in AOSP because their official implementation uses a Google service
21:15:50 <strcat[m]> and AOSP does not include Google services
21:16:24 <Golli[m]> Not always, but it's better to be safe than sorry.
21:16:25 <strcat[m]> AOSP also isn't meant to provide implementations of a bunch of user-facing apps available elsewhere
21:16:30 <strcat[m]> and I'm not sure why you would want that
21:21:28 <carl3> hello
21:23:22 <carl3> hello
21:26:05 <strcat[m]> carl3: hi
21:26:36 <carl3> trying to install graphene os, windows 10, onto a pixel 3a. trying to unlock bootloader, but when i type fastboot flashing unlock on the cmd, it says < waiting for any device > . help. am i retarded?
21:27:19 <strcat[m]> use a better USB cable
21:27:25 <strcat[m]> ideally use the one that comes with the device
21:27:31 <strcat[m]> look at the information on USB in prerequisites
21:28:57 <carl3> I have tried a samsung USB, and also the one which came with the device, the same problem each time
21:29:28 <strcat[m]> with what kind of USB port / computer?
21:29:29 <strcat[m]> use the cable that came with the device
21:29:54 <strcat[m]> carl3: is the phone in the bootloader menu per the instructions?
21:30:19 <strcat[m]> describe what's on the phone screen
21:30:36 <carl3> the phone is in fastboot mode. Device state:locked.
21:30:54 <carl3> It matches the tutorials which i have watched
21:31:07 <strcat[m]> what kind of USB port / computer?
21:31:26 <carl3> I am currently doing USB C to USB C. which is the cable which came with the 3a device
21:31:51 <strcat[m]> but is it a USB-C port directly on a laptop or a desktop motherboard?
21:32:01 <carl3> directly on a laptop
21:32:21 <strcat[m]> if possible try a different computer - probably some kind of USB issue
21:32:47 <strcat[m]> carl3: is your OS up-to-date?
21:33:00 <strcat[m]> Windows comes with a proper fastboot driver nowadays but maybe it's out-of-date
21:35:04 <carl3> I am on my 2nd laptop and second USB wire. No my OS is on android 10, I have the option to update to android 11, however the tutorials all used 10
21:38:50 <strcat[m]> carl3: I was talking about Windows
21:39:10 <strcat[m]> the official install guide expects that you update the OS on your computer and the phone
21:39:32 <strcat[m]> carl3: the *only* guide you should follow is https://grapheneos.org/install, third party install guides are inaccurate
21:39:47 <strcat[m]> > Windows 10, macOS Catalina, Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are the officially supported operating systems for installing GrapheneOS. You should make sure your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding with these instructions. Older versions and other Linux distributions usually work, but if you encounter problems try using one of the officially supported options.
21:39:56 <strcat[m]> > It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running into bugs, missing features or other differences in older firmware versions. You can either update the device via over-the-air updates or sideload a full update, which for Pixel phones can be obtained from the full update package page.
22:06:53 <Snowman> So I just installed it and uh...there's no app store. Do I just...install F-Droid?
22:07:38 <LinusSexTips[m]> If you want to, yes
22:07:57 <LinusSexTips[m]> There's also the Aurora Store which you can get off F-Droid for Play Store apps
22:08:22 <joehandcockandja> <Snowman "So I just installed it and uh..."> Are you good my man
22:08:29 <Golli[m]> F-Droid for open-source stuff/repo's.
22:08:29 <Golli[m]> Aurora Store if you want to install apps from the Play Store.
22:08:29 <Snowman> >If you want to, yes
22:09:40 <joehandcockandja> R u ok
22:09:41 <Snowman> Well what else would I do, unless I install ALL my apps directly from an apk lol
22:09:55 <joehandcockandja> Then why did you ask, nerd
22:11:56 <Snowman> I guess I was just wondering why fdroid isn't installed by default
22:12:35 <joehandcockandja> Out of scope
22:12:55 <Golli[m]> It's a third-party app.
22:12:59 <strcat[m]> Snowman: doesn't meet our standards and isn't what we're going to be using for automated updates of built-in apps
22:13:14 <Golli[m]>  * It's a third-party maintained app.
22:13:16 <strcat[m]> Snowman: it has too many usability and security issues
22:13:22 <strcat[m]> and it isn't a reasonable basis for something better
22:13:26 <strcat[m]> too much cruft and legacy code
22:13:47 <strcat[m]> Snowman: as a general rule we do not bundle third party apps: https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps
22:13:47 <dazinism> Snowman: check out https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
22:14:05 <strcat[m]> Snowman: we'd rather not include more apps that some people don't want to have
22:14:07 <Snowman> Then what SHOULD I use? Thats what I wanted to know
22:14:19 <strcat[m]> and the F-Droid privileged extension is not something we can whitelist
22:14:32 <strcat[m]> because F-Droid doesn't meet the security requirements for those kinds of privileges
22:14:35 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't respect device management
22:15:10 <strcat[m]> Snowman: we don't provide an official recommendation - use F-Droid, Aurora Store, or whatever else you want
22:15:46 <dontaskme[m]> <carl3 "I am on my 2nd laptop and second"> Try updating the USB driver. I had the same issue and it worked for me
22:15:59 <strcat[m]> eventually we'll provide our own first party repository for a few apps where we want to offer our own builds
22:16:20 <strcat[m]> and for out-of-band updates to apps like Vanadium with a different release cycle than AOSP, rather than needing to do OS updates for those
22:16:38 <strcat[m]> dontaskme: updating the OS should already provide a working driver
22:16:46 <strcat[m]> don't recommend installing something else before trying to update the OS
22:16:59 <strcat[m]> unless you've already installed something like that and the old version of it is what's causing the issue
22:18:07 <Snowman> > "it has too many usability and security issues" well if its bad, then what should I do? I'm legitimately asking, just try to install all my apps from apk?
22:19:51 <strcat[m]> Snowman: it not meeting the standards for bundling it in the OS doesn't mean we recommend against using it
22:19:52 <strcat[m]> not what was said
22:20:11 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps
22:21:19 <strcat[m]> Snowman: this isn't an area where this is official advice: F-Droid, Aurora Store or an app that self-updates like the Signal website apk are all reasonable choices
22:21:30 <strcat[m]> does not mean they meet the standards to be bundled in the OS
22:21:58 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier, we're going to be providing our own first party repository + app for using it
22:22:06 <strcat[m]> not F-Droid
22:30:48 <thestranger> When are you going to bring out the app and repo? Is t soon or a long term plan?
22:33:25 <thestranger> strcat[m]: hope anytime soon?
22:34:12 <strcat[m]> thestranger: depends on whether we find a good developer to implement it
22:34:27 <strcat[m]> we have funding to implement assorted things without developers to pay to do it
22:34:34 <strcat[m]> it's hard to find people to work on things
22:36:14 <qubits> strcat what do you rhink about develiopment of mdm e2e for grapheneos, Is that a serious consideration
22:36:35 <qubits> think*
22:36:49 <strcat[m]> you keep asking this
22:36:53 <strcat[m]> you've had answers already
22:37:11 <strcat[m]> qubits: are you going to fund development of it?
22:37:28 <qubits> What was the answer, it was not clear to me. You told we could consider doing it
22:38:19 <qubits> I could help depends of the cost and time frame thatis needed and the plan aswel features included
22:40:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> thestranger: we do regular releases and only ship when it is ready
22:40:50 <strcat[m]> qubits: I suggest starting by paying a developer to fix https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/78
22:41:04 <strcat[m]> qubits: can do that upstream in Seedvault, doesn't need to involve us
22:41:48 <strcat[m]> qubits: I told you that an E2E encrypted device manager is something we'd be interested in but we certainly do not have the resources to do it, and asking over and over about it isn't appropriate
22:42:16 <Pratyush[m]> strcat:  control brother leave it.
22:42:16 <Pratyush[m]>  as of now other stuff like jan security patch, wifi-calling support, that microg layer and other simller stuuf is more importent
22:42:21 <strcat[m]> qubits: unless you're going to start providing us with development resources including hiring at least 2 developers, it's pretty unlikely to happen any time soon
22:43:03 <thestranger> Qubits want to make a buisness model from grapheneos and sell devices with a manager on it, thats why he s asking it the whoke time
22:43:05 <strcat[m]> 1 developer to work on things other than this, 1 developer to work full time on device management
22:43:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "qubits: I suggest starting by pa"> BTW check internal chat
22:43:47 <strcat[m]> thestranger: yeah and the lack of use for individuals is why we're not going to focus on it
22:43:58 <strcat[m]> it's only interesting to organizations with deployments of devices they own
22:44:08 <strcat[m]> and they should be supporting GrapheneOS development
22:44:23 <thestranger> Yes agreed, no individual will use it
22:45:16 <qubits> Okay you need 2 developers, and what else. No indivduals will be useing thats is true, it is commercial of course. I think it can also help this project
22:46:02 <strcat[m]> okay so we need 1 developer to work on implementing an E2E encrypted device manager app + service full time
22:46:09 <strcat[m]> and 1 developer to work on other things
22:46:16 <strcat[m]> and if the companies interested in this want it they can pay for that
22:46:30 <strcat[m]> I'm sure I can find someone to work on it full-time
22:46:40 <strcat[m]> if money is available for that
22:46:49 <qubits> I have also 1 developer available
22:47:35 <strcat[m]> I'll post on Twitter right now saying we're looking to hire a full-time developer for 60k USD/year (or whatever it is) to work on end-to-end encrypted device management, remote work, all their code will be open source with no copyright assignment, if that money is being offered
22:47:55 <strcat[m]> won't take long to find someone that has a record of productive open source work who I trust to actually get the work done
22:47:56 <strcat[m]> if there is actually money available
22:48:05 <strcat[m]> but as far as I know the money for that is not available
22:48:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> 60k USD a year what the heck lol
22:48:38 <thestranger> Good developers are expensive
22:49:01 <joehandcockandja> 60k at the least
22:49:20 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: 60k/year is a bargain enabled by remote work
22:49:34 <strcat[m]> people in bay area, etc. earn 150k/year with little experience
22:49:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: 60k/year is a bar"> What the heck
22:49:39 <strcat[m]> so you can't really compete with those salaries
22:49:49 <strcat[m]> but there is no reason someone has to live in such a ridiculously expensive place
22:49:54 <strcat[m]> to do remote work
22:51:07 <thestranger> Qubits saw 60k and changed to quitebits
22:51:09 <qubits> Okay i have companies that are interested but can we make it pay per device model? And will this project take more then year to finish?
22:51:18 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: rent in SF for a single bedroom apartment is $1500+ USD/month
22:51:19 <thestranger> Ow there he is my bad
22:51:28 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: then people in the US have $500-1000/month to pay for their health insurance
22:51:39 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: food, electricity, water, etc.
22:51:46 <strcat[m]> and they're having the state/federal government take income taxes
22:51:50 <abumubarak[m]> Can I hide apps on the home page?
22:51:57 <joehandcockandja> The us is a third world country
22:52:21 <thestranger> They are getting 600/dollar covid releave
22:52:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: rent in SF for a "> Uwot m9
22:52:50 <Pratyush[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: rent in SF for a "> mine is way to cheaper 100$ USD for 2BHK in india
22:53:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> $60k is probably what my current house is worth
22:53:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe less
22:53:47 <strcat[m]> so according to this calculator if you earn 80k in California, you pay $20,911 of income taxes
22:53:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> What the fuck
22:54:04 <joehandcockandja> Haha, this guy has a house. I can't tell by that that you don't live in the USA
22:54:36 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: so then for a single bedroom apartment that's ~20k/year in san francisco
22:54:36 <thestranger> Here you can only buy a garage box to park your car for 60k , damnnn
22:54:45 <joehandcockandja> No one can afford houses here :D
22:54:50 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: so 40k/year just for rent and taxes from that 80k/year salary
22:54:55 <qubits> I think i can for sure find the funds but it must be commercial product , if it is open source it doesnt make sence for investors
22:54:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: so then for a sin"> Thanks I'm never moving to the US
22:55:05 <strcat[m]> health insurance another 8k/year
22:55:17 <strcat[m]> so down to 32k/year from that 80k/year now
22:55:32 <joehandcockandja> Well that's kind of a stretch
22:55:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: tbh I thought the taxes I paid were bad
22:55:43 <strcat[m]> now add in electricity, water, transportation (it's not like they have usable public transit there)
22:55:44 <joehandcockandja> If you make 80k you'd have like 60k at the end of the year
22:55:45 <thestranger> 8k a year for health insurwnce is insane
22:55:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> But the shit you mention oh god
22:55:53 <strcat[m]> joehandcockandjames: that's what I just said
22:55:55 <joehandcockandja> If your living within your means
22:56:01 <strcat[m]> joehandcockandjames: 20k for taxes, 20k for rent
22:56:03 <hypokeimenon[m]> <qubits "I think i can for sure find the "> lol
22:56:08 <strcat[m]> so you realize how expensive rent is in a city?
22:56:09 <joehandcockandja> Okay, I'm Sorry
22:56:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: and if rent is that much, how much is ownership?
22:56:34 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: for what, a small condo?
22:56:42 <strcat[m]> SF is kinda weird because of earthquakes so there aren't big buildings
22:56:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> What's a condo?
22:57:03 <thestranger> Appartment
22:57:05 <joehandcockandja> Condom without the m
22:57:06 <thestranger> Small one
22:57:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <joehandcockandja "Condom without the m"> Nice
22:57:33 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: an apartment that you own and the building is owned by an entity owned by the owners of the individual condos
22:57:39 <thestranger> Joehandjobcock is funny
22:57:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> <thestranger "Small one"> I thought you were a strcat impersonator
22:57:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: an apartment that"> Yes
22:57:54 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: condos have condo fees covering the shared costs of the building
22:58:00 <strcat[m]> so sure, you own it
22:58:13 <strcat[m]> but you pay property taxes now (since you own it) and you pay condo fees (usually not that much)
22:58:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Is the situation better in CA?
22:58:37 <joehandcockandja> The situation for everything is worse in CA
22:58:41 <strcat[m]> and since it costs 1.5 million or whatever in a city you probably have a mortgage that costs as much as rent would be (but in 25 years or whatever you end up fully owning it)
22:58:47 <strcat[m]> joehandcockandjames: he means canada
22:58:48 <joehandcockandja> except for weed and gay people
22:58:48 <strcat[m]> not california
22:58:57 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I mean it depends what you mean
22:58:57 <joehandcockandja> Oh my bad
22:59:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: I mean it depends"> $8k for health insurance is just crazy lol
22:59:19 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: living downtown or in the core of a big city is expensive
22:59:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: worse than US?
22:59:42 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no I'm saying in general
22:59:48 <strcat[m]> in western countries, in general
23:00:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> So is it as expensive as US?
23:00:05 <strcat[m]> getting pretty offtopic now
23:00:11 <strcat[m]> it's not about US vs. Canada
23:00:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: kk
23:00:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm just like sheesh, people be making and blowing so much money like
23:00:57 <strcat[m]> developers are expensive
23:01:15 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: people fresh out of university who get hired with little experience in bay area, ca can get 150k+ / year
23:01:20 <strcat[m]> but it's not as much as it seems due to all the costs
23:01:23 <thestranger> Qubits want a manager thats not open source to use for his buisness
23:01:34 <thestranger> That what i m understanding
23:01:45 <strcat[m]> well anything we develop would be open source
23:02:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: people fresh out "> >you guys are getting hired meme
23:02:24 <strcat[m]> companies are pretty silly to base themselves there
23:02:33 <strcat[m]> pay people insane salaries which go to ridiculously high cost of living expenses
23:02:44 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's part of companies not believing in remote work
23:03:00 <strcat[m]> they want to have an office somewhere considered fancy near other tech companies, etc.
23:03:08 <strcat[m]> and force everyone to relocate there and work in the office
23:03:13 <jpds> That's all changed this year
23:03:31 <strcat[m]> yeah out of necessity
23:03:34 <strcat[m]> but not completely
23:03:57 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: since we're looking for people to do remote work
23:03:58 <strcat[m]> we can ignore all that
23:03:59 <thestranger> Crazy owning some towers there and renting them
23:04:09 <strcat[m]> we only need to offer a good salary for working somewhere with a low cost of living
23:04:16 <strcat[m]> not SF, NYC, Toronto, Vancouver, etc...
23:06:29 <thestranger> India
23:07:07 <joehandcockandja> Who's gonna tell him
23:07:10 <thestranger> They have some high level techs and are much cheaper i think
23:07:32 <strcat[m]> thestranger: property taxes are pretty high and you pay taxes on income from renting
23:07:51 <strcat[m]> people owning buildings, etc. in big cities like Toronto / Vancouver are mostly doing it to invest in real estate
23:08:07 <thestranger> Hmm didnt know the taxes are so high there
23:09:09 <thestranger> What do you think about the end to end encryption law in the EU they want ?
23:09:28 <strcat[m]> I only need to be concerned with what happens in Canada
23:09:28 <thestranger> I was reading about bann on end to end encryption or building backdoors
23:09:42 <strcat[m]> right now Canada is much better in this regard than the US, EU, UK, Australia
23:09:49 <thestranger> So if the law passes people in the EU are still able to download grapheneos
23:09:53 <strcat[m]> perhaps because they are just slower to do things
23:10:26 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is essentially based in Canada
23:10:26 <thestranger> And end to end apps like signal
23:10:49 <qubits> That law will never pass
23:10:51 <thestranger> Okey nice even if they block it can srill use vpn to download it
23:10:52 <strcat[m]> our servers are in Canada and I'm in Canada, so the legal entities involved in GrapheneOS (myself and a future non-profit org) are based here
23:11:04 <strcat[m]> seriously doubt anything is going to be blocked
23:11:13 <strcat[m]> UK and Australia? sure
23:11:49 <joehandcockandja> We discussed this yesterday in the off-topic, none of these laws are gonna  pass ever or even be effective really if they did
23:12:09 <thestranger> Okee nice
23:12:28 <joehandcockandja> They'd be almost impossible to enforce, its always like two conservatives float a horrible idea about encryption and then the privacy and security community always blows it out of proportion
23:14:15 <thestranger> Loving the possibility of multiple profiles
23:14:34 <thestranger> Using grapheneos for a while but am using 2 profiles since 2 days
23:14:50 <thestranger> Got me al hyped up
23:16:35 <Golli[m]> Would love a Clone User feature for it.
23:17:19 <joehandcockandja> Kiwifarms ðŸ˜³
23:17:19 <JS[m]> Would a Pinephone be able to handle Graphene OS?
23:17:21 <thestranger> My admin profile is empty, only use the second one
23:18:36 <thestranger> Wonder if i install apps on the main but dont use them, and have the same apps on the second profile , wil the data be stored in the same folder and will t affect security? Because daniel sayd admin should be used only to make new profiles
23:19:07 <joehandcockandja> The data is completely separate
23:19:28 <joehandcockandja> None of the profiles have access to the others
23:19:32 <thestranger> I still want the admin profile to look like its the profile i use to trick people, and only use the second
23:20:17 <thestranger> So for example, if i have signal on bith, the signal data / folders are separate
23:20:49 <joehandcockandja> Yeah but you can't do that unless you use two phone numbers
23:20:52 <thestranger> Because uodating apps if affecting both profiles so thats strange
23:21:02 <joehandcockandja> It'll just unregister the other
23:21:25 <thestranger> Yeah i know i have 2 numbers, sorry 3/number i also use 1/on molly
23:22:27 <thestranger> But when i update apps in 1 profile , they are uodated in both how s thaat possible if everything is sepparated?
23:22:54 <Golli[m]> <JS[m] "Would a Pinephone be able to han"> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html
23:23:03 <Golli[m]> They do not meet the requirements for GOS.
23:23:08 <strcat[m]> JS: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
23:23:17 <strcat[m]> doesn't meet many of the security (or privacy) requirements
23:23:29 <strcat[m]> could make an unofficial port to it
23:23:48 <strcat[m]> won't have full functionality and the device is inherently not going to meet reasonable security standards or offer features like the Wi-Fi anonymity
23:24:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Won't even pass CTS
23:24:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Good luck
23:25:37 <strcat[m]> won't have basic security features like the hardware keystore, modern SoC exploit mitigations, verified boot
23:26:01 <strcat[m]> won't have the various forms of hardware encryption support documented in https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
23:26:08 <strcat[m]> (which doesn't go into all the details)
23:33:00 <blk> Where can I read about the recommended multi-user setup?
23:34:37 <strcat[m]> blk: we don't have a specific recommended setup
23:34:59 <strcat[m]> we have advice like what's stated in https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption about the advantages of only using the owner profile to fully activate the device after boot + manage other profiles
23:36:09 <strcat[m]> i.e. using a secondary profile as your main profile so that you can boot up and use the device with it kept at rest
23:36:37 <strcat[m]> if you want to divide things up further by taking advantage of user profiles acting as isolated workspaces, you're free to do that
23:36:41 <strcat[m]> there's more information on it provided there
23:37:51 <blk> got it, thanks.
23:42:11 <strcat[m]> it's easiest to use only the owner profile, a nice step up is that setup of a secondary profile as your main profile, owner mostly unused except if you don't want to unlock your main profile
23:42:37 <strcat[m]> so for example, maybe you're in a public place and don't want to enter your main profile passphrase, but need to use the phone for something, if your main profile is separate you can do that
23:42:51 <strcat[m]> and you can keep it at rest by not having it logged in at all
23:44:49 <blk> appreciate the use case. I am not too familiar with Android's multi-user support. Do you have to navigate into Settings to switch to the guest account whenever you wanted to use it, or is it more streamlined?
23:45:00 <strcat[m]> no you can switch via the notification dropdown menu
23:45:12 <strcat[m]> including at the lockscreen
23:45:24 <strcat[m]> blk: I wouldn't use the standard guest account, just make your own profiles
23:45:55 <strcat[m]> Owner profile is the main one, add your own Main profile or whatever and use that for everyday usage and then you can keep it at rest while still using the phone - that's the advice we give there
23:46:27 <strcat[m]> maybe you want to use an app that refuses to work without Contacts access, you could do that in another profile without any shared data like contacts entered
23:46:34 <strcat[m]> totally up to you how you use the feature
23:47:00 <strcat[m]> user profiles are isolated workspaces (no shared data or app communication across them) with their own encryption keys based on their lock method
23:47:28 <strcat[m]> owner profile has to be logged in on boot to make the device fully functional - thus the benefits of using a different profile as your main one
23:47:30 <Golli[m]> Is there a way to transfer your settings, apps, app data, etc from the Owner account to another account?
23:47:30 <Golli[m]> Or is manually the only way currently?
23:47:44 <strcat[m]> adb backup/restore
23:48:29 <strcat[m]> or use the functionality in apps like Signal/Molly for doing it
23:49:06 <Golli[m]> I'll have a try with adb since there's a lot there to do otherwise.
23:49:27 <blk> that was my next question. I missed this advice when I first setup GrapheneOS, and I am using the default owner account.
23:51:29 <strcat[m]> blk: nothing wrong with that, this is just advice for a higher security setup where you can use the device without unlocking your main profile
23:51:49 <strcat[m]> we expect that most users just use the owner profile
23:54:28 <Golli[m]> Turns out adb backup has been deprecated.
23:54:28 <Golli[m]> Searching online only seems to bring back responses for full device backup, not profile to profile. You wouldn't happen to know of a way?
23:55:49 <blk> str8t[m]: thanks for your help
23:56:05 <blk> strcat[m] ^
23:56:28 <strcat[m]> Golli: deprecated doesn't mean it doesn't work
23:56:52 <strcat[m]> Golli: Seedvault will be usually for this eventually
23:56:55 <strcat[m]>  * Golli: Seedvault will be usable for this eventually
23:58:42 <Golli[m]> I'm assuming Seedvault is currently out of the question until a future release then?
