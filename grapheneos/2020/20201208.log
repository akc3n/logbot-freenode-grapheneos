00:17:13 <fixed_it> Does anyone have a recommendation for how to sync contacts that are on a google account to grapheneos's dialer?  Is there a way to do that with a different app acting as a bridge since gapps or microg aren't present?
00:21:36 <Adam17761776> Can you just save phone numbers to the local addressbook/text document?
00:23:41 <fixed_it> Yeah but I'd also like to have syncing enabled so if I lose my phone then I know my contacts are backed up somewhere besides my phone.
00:23:55 <Dylanger[m]> <Adam17761776 "red team field manual?"> Read the fucking manual
00:25:12 <Adam17761776> Oh nice
00:25:32 <Adam17761776> So should I have my SIM card in the phone during flashing or out of the phone
00:37:00 <Adam17767> hi
00:37:16 <Adam17767> DO I need to have the SIM Card In the Phone or out of the phone during flashing graphene os?
00:37:28 <sb13x[m]> fixed_it:  For my contacts whenever I update or add any I simply export them as a .vcf add them to a container in EDS Lite and upload the container to Dropbox via Vanadium
00:38:03 <jpds> Adam17767:  It doesn't matter
00:38:04 <sb13x[m]> Adam17767: doesn't matter, although I did mine without and set up before putting it in.
00:38:11 <Adam17767> Nice
00:39:19 <Adam17767> If I brick the device how do I re-install default android rom
00:39:19 <strcat[m]> December update is the 1st quarterly release for Android 11, so a lot more changes than a usual monthly update
00:39:33 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS sources updated already other than the kernels which aren't pushed to AOSP yet
00:40:18 <strcat[m]> and now is the time for people to step up to develop and maintain support for the Pixel 4 5G / Pixel 5
00:40:24 <strcat[m]> since now they're in the main branch
00:40:50 <strcat[m]> not a device branch anymore since new devices get rolled into the main one in the next quarterly release after their launch
00:41:21 <Adam17767> If I brick the device how do I re-install default android rom
00:41:59 <strcat[m]> Adam17767: not clear what you mean, the flashing process for stock OS is the same
00:42:04 <strcat[m]> explained in the install guide
00:42:28 <Adam17767> A video would be really nice
00:42:36 <Adam17767> Has anybody tested using : https://www.reddit.com/r/CalyxOS/comments/j44aeb/introducing_device_flasher_a_simple_way_to/
00:42:39 <eenno[m]> <fixed_it "Does anyone have a recommendatio"> Check out Etesync. I've used it for contacts and calendar the past two years.
00:42:46 <strcat[m]> a video would just show copy-pasting the exact commands
00:42:50 <strcat[m]> Adam17767: it's not supported / recommended
00:42:55 <Adam17767> Has anybody tried it
00:42:59 <Adam17767> and got it to work
00:43:01 <strcat[m]> copy-pasting the commands from the install guide is all that a video would show
00:43:01 <Adam17767> for Graphnee
00:43:11 <madaidan[m]> The guide is there for a reason...
00:43:11 <strcat[m]> Adam17767: we don't provide official support it
00:43:24 <strcat[m]>  * Adam17767: we don't provide support for it
00:43:26 <Adam17767> Has anybody used the flasher with Graphene successfully
00:43:38 <Adam17767> Just like, do you know of anybody who has used it
00:43:48 <strcat[m]> if you want help with 3rd party software you need to ask in their channel
00:44:01 <Adam17767> Alright I have my Google Pixel 4a fully updated
00:44:16 <Adam17767> Enabled OEM Unlocking
00:44:23 <Adam17767> Now I need to set USB Debugging yes/no
00:44:35 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install
00:44:41 <strcat[m]> don't do anything not mentioned there
00:44:44 <strcat[m]> do exactly what's there
00:44:47 <strcat[m]> don't follow unofficial guides
00:44:52 <Adam17767> Alright thanks
00:44:57 <strcat[m]> no mention of enabling USB debugging or using adb there
00:44:58 <strcat[m]> so don't
00:45:06 <Adam17767> Unlock the bootloader to allow flashing the OS and firmware:fastboot flashing unlock
00:45:12 <Adam17767> Thats done ^ on the phone itself right
00:45:20 <strcat[m]> follow the guide there
00:45:36 <jpds> Dude, you've been told like 7 times now to follow the guide
00:45:45 <madaidan[m]> Lmao
00:46:02 <strcat[m]> a lot of work has gone into making it clear and covering every corner case
00:46:13 <strcat[m]> across each of the officially supported OSes
00:46:22 <strcat[m]> it works properly on each of those if followed correctly, i.e. doing exactly what it says
00:46:37 <Adam17767> I just want to ask experts to make sure Im doing everything right
00:46:41 <strcat[m]> you do not need to change the instructions at all, just follow them exactly as it says with the relevant device name + release version
00:46:46 <strcat[m]> the experts wrote the guide
00:46:56 <strcat[m]> it covers 100% of what you need on the supported OSes
00:47:06 <fixed_it> eenno: Have you tried nextcloud?  I was debating nextcloud for contacts and calendar vs Etesync since it seems connecting to a google account is deprecated in Davx5
00:47:14 <strcat[m]> no additional command you need to run or anything like that
00:47:15 <strcat[m]> it's all there
00:47:27 <Adam17767> Can firmware updates occur once Graphene OS is installed
00:47:30 <fixed_it> Yes
00:47:47 <strcat[m]> Adam17767: GrapheneOS provides full updates, this is covered in the docs
00:49:10 <Adam17767> Im on the Unlocking the Bootloader Stage
00:49:53 <Adam17767> Has anybody tested if ProtonVPN or IVPN work with Graphene OS?
00:49:59 <Adam17767> .apks
00:49:59 <eenno[m]> <fixed_it "eenno: Have you tried nextcloud?"> No. Just tried it for storage. But I'm not using it any longer.
00:50:17 <Adam17767> might be good to just write down the phone numbers onto paper
00:50:37 <eenno[m]> * No. Just tried it for storage. But I'm not using it any longer.
00:50:37 <eenno[m]> I get that Etesync doesn't work with Google, it was more if you were looking for alternatives (as in just exporting all your contacts etc to Etesync and start using that - with a calendar/contacts app of your choice of course). But I understand it as you want to continue using Google but have it synced to your phone running GOS?
00:50:43 <Adam17767> Also which app-stores do you guys use? F-Droid?
00:50:51 <br_led[m]> <Adam17767 "Im on the Unlocking the Bootload"> yes protonvpn works using openvpn. never tried their app
00:51:01 <Adam17767> Their app is great
00:51:07 <Adam17767> Im hoping touse Wireguard with Mullvad .apk
00:51:21 <eenno[m]> Their app works on GOS
00:51:32 <Adam17767> Amazing
00:51:44 <fixed_it> eenno: I was considering nextcloud or Etesync as an alternative.
00:51:53 <Adam17767> "fastboot flashing unlock" So i type that into my pixel
00:52:00 <br_led[m]> <Adam17767 "Has anybody tested if ProtonVPN "> yes protonvpn works using openvpn. never tried their app
00:52:04 <Adam17767> Then Plugin the USB to Pixel cable
00:52:07 <fixed_it> I was going to do exactly that, export my calendars and contacts and upload them to etesync
00:52:09 <eenno[m]> <eenno[m] "Their app works on GOS"> Proton that is, mullvad I have no idea about
00:52:26 <strcat> Adam17767: you need to follow the install guide on the site
00:52:35 <strcat> Adam17767: I have doubts that you'll be able to do it
00:52:47 <strcat> Adam17767: may be best not to try flashing your phone with another OS
00:53:02 <Adam17767> Thats why Im asking experts here for simple clarification methods
00:53:13 <eenno[m]> <fixed_it "I was going to do exactly that, "> Ah. Then it should work. Etesync has a weird UI that's all. But it's been working flawless for me since I set it up.
00:53:16 <strcat> the supported installation method is at https://grapheneos.org/install
00:53:21 <strcat> you're asking questions answered on the site
00:53:27 <Adam17767> Alright just asking for clarification
00:53:27 <strcat> you need to consult the site before asking here
00:53:28 <Adam17767> thanks
00:53:54 <strcat> in the future we want to implement WebUSB-based flashing but right now that is the only available installation process
00:54:09 <fixed_it> eenno: Ideally I'd be able to get some bridge app working but it looks like google broke caldav and carddav so have to use something else.
00:54:14 <strcat> if you follow an unofficial process / guide, it's highly likely you'll soft brick the phone, and you can't get support for that here
00:54:33 <Thatcher[m]> Anyone know what 'Cat Controls' is? It appears under the Device Controls menu when I hold the power button to power off Graphene
00:55:12 <strcat> Thatcher[m]: you enabled the version easter egg
00:55:37 <Thatcher[m]> Ah, crap!
00:55:42 <Adam17767> If I soft-brick how do I fix it
00:56:00 <strcat> Thatcher[m]: it's not a bad thing it's just a tiny joke program in AOSP
00:56:29 <strcat> you enable it by opening the version and pressing on it repeatedly
00:56:39 <Thatcher[m]> strcat thank you for clarifying that. I thought I had a hacked version or something lol
00:56:51 <strcat> you can disable it
00:57:02 <Adam17767> Can somebody here detail Graphene OSs LTE Only Mode
00:57:07 <Adam17767> And other IMSI Catcher protections
00:57:08 <strcat> look up android 11 easter egg, or just in general rather than the specific version one
00:57:15 <strcat> Adam17767: covered in the usage guide
00:57:30 <Thatcher[m]> strcat i will do that. Thank you!
00:57:31 <strcat> it's also explained there that the purpose is attack surface reduction, not what you're mistaking it to be
00:58:20 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
00:58:30 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
00:58:36 <strcat> read both of those sections
00:59:06 <Adam17767> Well, LTE is the hardest Network protocl to Imsi/Stingra
00:59:09 <Adam17767> stingray
00:59:18 <Adam17767> so LTE is the most stingray-proof
00:59:21 <strcat> the cellular networks are not secure
00:59:28 <strcat> the protocol is not secure, and the infrastructure is not secure
00:59:29 <Adam17767> due to stronger base-station authentication
00:59:38 <strcat> what you're saying doesn't really make sense
00:59:44 <strcat> read what's written in the usage guide and FAQ
00:59:45 <Adam17767> Im aware, but LTE is more secure (Phone to Cell Tower) than 3g/2g
00:59:55 <strcat> it's not secure
01:00:01 <strcat> it's not "more secure"
01:00:02 <Adam17767> Ok yes, but its more secure than 3g
01:00:04 <strcat> it isn't a secure network protocol
01:00:06 <strcat> not really, no
01:00:12 <Adam17767> Alright
01:00:18 <strcat> there is not really such a thing as "more secure" when the protocol is still inherently insecure
01:00:37 <Adam17767> yes
01:00:42 <Adam17767> So Im trying to usemy phone anonymously
01:00:43 <strcat> it does not take any special knowledge to compromise it, it's publicly insecure
01:00:53 <strcat> read what's written in the usage guide and FAQ
01:00:59 <Adam17767> Do you guys know about encrypted VOIP services
01:01:12 <Adam17767> So I can use Graphene OS LTE to encrypted connect to a VOIP server
01:01:25 <strcat> we recommend using Signal for encrypted calls
01:01:26 <Adam17767> So Somebody monitoring my phones network would only see encrypted data to the VOIP
01:01:40 <Adam17767> Im trying to avoid VoicePrint Analysis
01:01:42 <strcat> covered in that FAQ section
01:01:47 <Adam17767> Which would require Encrypted Calls for all parties
01:01:51 <Adam17767> thanks =)
01:02:01 <strcat> a lot of work was put into writing the documentation on the site
01:02:10 <Adam17767> I can tell, Ill be donating soon
01:02:43 <Adam17767> This is so cool
01:02:57 <Adam17767> Graphene OS phones, VPNs, OBFS4 Tor Browser, Encrpytion, Obfuscation, Monero
01:03:09 <Adam17767> Libreboot/Purism laptops
01:03:11 <Adam17767> Coreboot
01:03:12 <louipc> would be good to talk about voip and stuff in #grapheneos-offtopic
01:03:29 <Adam17767> Ive finially acheived top level cyberpunk status
01:03:31 <louipc> yea and all that stuff :p
01:03:46 <Adam17767> I have a Tor Router OnionPi, Libreboot Laptop running FOSS Trisquel Linux OS, Graphene OS Pixel 4A
01:03:54 <strcat> Adam17767: Purism are scammers
01:03:56 <Adam17767> I spoof my MAC and Hostname and Use an offshore VPN
01:03:58 <Adam17767> Really how
01:03:58 <Adam17767> ?
01:04:03 <strcat> not permitted to promote their products in GrapheneOS channels
01:04:06 <Adam17767> I was thinking of getting the purism laptops
01:04:08 <Adam17767> yes sir
01:04:11 <strcat> Adam17767: they spread misinformation and lie about their products
01:04:12 <Adam17767> How do they scam though?
01:04:15 <Adam17767> Wow
01:04:16 <TheJollyRoger> Adam17767: Purism consistently lie about how open their products are, rebrand other people's work as their own,
01:04:19 <strcat> by lying about what their products provide
01:04:23 <strcat> lying about how technologies work
01:04:24 <Adam17767> Nice
01:04:29 <Adam17767> Have you seen Libreboot Laptops?
01:04:31 <obi[m]> Troll
01:04:34 <strcat> misrepresenting how other alternatives / competitors work
01:04:36 <Adam17767> Im seeking a laptop which disables Intel ME
01:04:42 <strcat> off-topic
01:04:44 <strcat> and again
01:04:58 <TheJollyRoger> in short, what they are are a bunch of rebranded Acers that they run me_cleaner on. They use coreboot as a frontend wrapper, really, you're not getting what you think you're paying for.
01:05:10 <TheJollyRoger> I can explain more in the offtopic channel at a later date once I finish some work.
01:05:13 <Adam17767> Wow thanks for the advice
01:05:13 <JTL> Adam17767: Most of the actual technical people involved with developing Purism projects either were fired or "rage-quit" from the company
01:05:16 <JTL> Some food for thought

01:05:36 <strcat> this channel is only for GrapheneOS and stuff directly related to it
01:08:05 <BorisTheBurger> Hello
01:08:39 <Thatcher[m]> I really appreciate all the technical documentation on graphene wwbsite. I learned so much from reading it
01:09:02 <BorisTheBurger> attempting to build grapheneos-11 for the first time, why kernel have separate build procedure?
01:09:14 <strcat> BorisTheBurger: because the Linux kernel has a complex build system itself
01:09:49 <strcat> it isn't built with the build system Android uses, and it doesn't have the same solid support for incremental / deterministic builds
01:10:19 <strcat> so, like similar things like that, it's built separately
01:10:50 <BorisTheBurger> strcat: thank you for quick response, is this a potential contribution to be made to the project, or you have decided that it will remain separate?
01:11:41 <strcat> BorisTheBurger: we aren't interested in making a new Linux kernel build system
01:11:53 <strcat> and it would be inappropriate to call out to the existing one from the Android build system
01:12:09 <strcat> we follow the way that AOSP does it which makes sense
01:12:30 <strcat> projects where it's impractical to make a new declarative build system are built externally
01:12:51 <strcat> it's unrealistic to make and maintain a declarative Android.bp build system for each Linux kernel variant
01:12:57 <strcat> and port it to the new ones
01:14:08 <Adam17767> Fastboot mode , Device state: Locked
01:14:11 <Adam17767> What do I do next
01:14:17 <strcat> what the guide says
01:14:23 <strcat> prerequisites
01:14:45 <Adam17767> How do I enter "fastboot flashing unlock"
01:15:10 <strcat> start at the top of the guide with the intro / prerequisites
01:15:27 <Adam17767> I have
01:15:34 <Adam17767> Ive enabled OEM unlocking
01:15:39 <Adam17767> Now ive booted into Fastboot
01:15:45 <Thatcher[m]> Adam17767 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0UFZjuotg
01:15:47 <Adam17767> In the Unlocking the bootloader section
01:15:47 <strcat> you haven't done the prerequisites section for getting fastboot
01:15:56 <Adam17767> yes I have fastboot on my laptop
01:16:18 <BorisTheBurger> strcat: thanks for the information, brb
01:16:59 <Adam17767> I have fastboot on my laptop
01:17:21 <strcat> Adam17767: you haven't done the prerequisites section
01:17:24 <strcat> I know you haven't
01:17:27 <strcat> read through it
01:18:12 <Adam17767> I have, Ive updated Pixel 4a firmware,
01:18:28 <strcat> unsure what you mean by that
01:18:38 <strcat> do the prerequisites section
01:19:18 <Adam17767> Yes, Laptop is up to date, Phone firmware is up to date
01:19:31 <Adam17767> I have an officialyl supported device Google Pixel 4A
01:19:38 <Adam17767> Unlocked
01:19:47 <strcat> follow the fastboot section of prerequisites
01:19:57 <strcat[m]> it's not optional
01:20:09 <strcat[m]> you still have to do it if you think you have a proper fastboot install already
01:20:19 <strcat[m]> run `fastboot --version`
01:20:26 <Adam17767> yes I have veriosn 30
01:20:36 <Adam17767> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
01:20:39 <strcat[m]> show the output of `fastboot --version`
01:20:43 <strcat[m]> okay good
01:20:47 <Adam17767> fastboot --versionfastboot version 30.0.5-6877874Installed as /home/adam/Desktop/platform-tools/fastboot
01:21:07 <Adam17767> Now ive updated pixel 4a, enabled OEm unlocking
01:21:14 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
01:21:17 <strcat[m]> so continue from here
01:21:30 <Adam17767> Yes Im on the fastboot screen
01:21:44 <strcat[m]> yes so continue from https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
01:21:45 <Adam17767> but I figure out how to type in "fastboot flashing unlock"
01:21:51 <Adam17767> Where do i type that in
01:21:58 <strcat[m]> the same way you did `fastboot --version`
01:22:18 <Adam17767> fastboot --version was on my laptop
01:22:30 <Adam17767> The bootloader is on my phone
01:22:42 <Adam17767> Do I need to plug my phone into my laptop now
01:22:51 <strcat[m]> it's not telling you to run anything on the phone
01:23:10 <strcat[m]> yes connect the phone to the computer and follow https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
01:23:16 <Adam17767> First, boot into the bootloader interface. You can do this by turning off the device and then turning it on by holding both the Volume Down and Power buttons.
01:23:26 <Adam17767> Volume Down and Power buttons., on the phone itself
01:23:53 <strcat[m]> and read what it says there after that
01:24:34 <Adam17767> So i cant connect my USB C cable to my computer
01:25:02 <strcat[m]> ok so you need a USB A to USB C cable to proceed
01:25:22 <strcat[m]> a proper high quality one
01:25:41 <Adam17767> Great
01:25:45 <Adam17767> THat will take days
01:26:52 <Adam17767> Thats mega blue balls
01:27:02 <Thatcher[m]> Why?
01:27:36 <Adam17767> I dont have the proper cables right now
01:27:52 <Adam17767> To connect my laptop to my phone
01:28:10 <Thatcher[m]> Doh!
01:28:14 <Adam17767> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DC5PPFV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
01:28:50 <strcat[m]> that should be fine
01:28:57 <Adam17767> Great thanks
01:51:28 <Adam17767> Can I load  USB with the fastboot script
01:51:43 <Adam17767> I have a USB storage device, but not a USB to USB cable
01:53:59 <louipc> eh?
01:55:30 <Adam17767> Think this cable will work too? https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GGKYKQM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
01:57:51 <louipc> no idea
01:57:59 <louipc> are u reflink farming
02:00:26 <crabman[m]> I am having issues with some public WiFi pages that require a login page.  When I attempt to connect, I get an error message, “The webpage at https://commectivitycheck.grapheneos.org/generate_2 could not be loaded because:  net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED”.  When I change my Internet connectivity check from GrapheneOS to Standard (Google), the issue clears.  I am not sure how an  Internet connectivity check from Graphe
02:00:26 <crabman[m]> is acting like a firewall for me to proceed with my WiFi login.
02:01:41 <louipc> captive portal
02:02:21 <louipc> they are probably letting google thru because its common
02:03:05 <Adam17767> Try loading ddg.gg or google.com with your Firefox browser of choice
02:03:16 <Adam17767> Which then will redirect to Captive Portal
02:03:43 <crabman[m]> I guess I need to learn what a capive portal is.  I thought a Internet connectivity check just checks connectivity, not control it.
02:04:10 <louipc> the network is controlling it and blocking the checks
02:04:32 <louipc> except for commonly used check urls i guess
02:05:30 <crabman[m]> I don't mind the checks being blocked, but why won't the login screen be displayed?
02:05:57 <crabman[m]> Is the traffic being routeed through the Internet connectivity check
02:06:29 <louipc> sometimes its just a badly implemented captive portal
02:06:36 <Adam17767> What browser are ou using
02:06:40 <Adam17767> Starbucks Wifi or?
02:06:46 <louipc> and you have to manually type their checkin page
02:08:48 <crabman[m]> This mostly happens with the LA Fitness wifi.  It is a captive portal entrance.
02:09:16 <crabman[m]> Yes, I simply hit an enter button to proceed
02:11:48 <crabman[m]> I am not using a browser per se, it is the wifi login screen from network settings.
02:12:18 <Adam17767> Hmm
02:12:30 <Adam17767> Normally the Captive Portal is displayed in-browser when loading a webpage
02:12:56 <louipc> oh maybe i misunderstood
02:13:29 <crabman[m]> Well I am sure it is a browser, but not any I opened, it is what Graphene opens under network settings.  I assume vandium
02:13:44 <louipc> but yea whenver there's a login page its an open wifi, you don't go to network settings..?
02:14:43 <br_led[m]> ? about profiles: each GOS profile can have its own vpn profile. say I have 2 profiles, one is connected to a vpn server changing my ip address, the other profile is using dns over tls. my phone then will maintain these 2 ip addresses until I take action to shut the phone off or disable one of the profiles?
02:14:48 <louipc> hmm i guess they could have some private captive portals lol
02:14:50 <crabman[m]> <louipc "but yea whenver there's a login "> Not true.  You connect to wifi, then the wifi logo indicates you need to tap on it to log in, all under network settings.
02:15:45 <louipc> that probably complicates things
02:17:26 <crabman[m]> Not sure what "that" is, but it is how most if not all captive portal logins work.  I do the same with xfinity, except I can get through when connecting there.
02:20:51 <BorisTheBurger> strcat: looking an example for 9 it appears building the linux kernel using aosp build system (plain makefile) is troublesome although feasible. btw, as I understand .mk's are now .bp's, is this a strict requirement of 11? Also, according to https://github.com/GrapheneOS/kernel_google_sunfish/blob/11/build.sh you are only maintaining build script for 4.9 among available 4.14 and 5.4?
02:20:51 <BorisTheBurger> Surprising that G doesn't improve this part of the build...
02:21:58 <BorisTheBurger> Can you point to an example of a bp which builds kernel within aosp build system? Thanks
02:22:27 <BorisTheBurger> grapheneos.org/build is a fantastic document btw
02:27:05 <BorisTheBurger> 4.14
02:27:59 <BorisTheBurger> damn https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/android-common
02:28:57 <crabman[m]> OK, is there a way to use something else than Graphene or Google for an  Internet connectivity check?
02:36:04 <Adam17767> Using standard Google OS until my cable comes in the mail
02:37:20 <Adam17767> does NewPipe, Mullvad VPN Wireguard work with GOS
02:39:38 <TheJollyRoger> Newpipe is tested and working with GrapheneOS. The userspace implementation of Wireguard also has been tested to work with GrapheneOS.
02:40:04 <Adam17767> Any VPN apps confirmed to work
02:40:14 <TheJollyRoger> The long story short, GrapheneOS will run almost anything compiled for a recent version of the API, and that doesn't have a hard dependency on Google Play Services.
02:40:50 <Adam17767> nice
02:41:05 <Adam17767> Does Graphene OS have any upcoming IMSI catcher mitigation tools
02:41:13 <TheJollyRoger> So apps like Signal, Conversations and Wire also are tested and working because all of those don't depend on Google Play Services. Signal and Wire will use Play Srevices if available.
02:41:17 <Adam17767> Such as custom cell ID Whitelisting
02:41:20 <Adam17767> nice
02:41:24 <TheJollyRoger> Adam17767: the question on IMSI catchers is answered on the Usage guide.
02:41:44 <TheJollyRoger> If you are concerned about cellphone interception, your best bet is to simply use Signal.
02:41:56 <Adam17767> LTE only mode and Signal, Yes
02:42:44 <Adam17767> Does 'Burner' App work on GOS
02:42:48 <joehandcockandja> LTE only mode made it so I couldn't call folks
02:42:49 <Adam17767> Looking for a Temp-Numbers app
02:42:50 <joehandcockandja> Isn't that the darndest thing
02:42:58 <Adam17767> That does suck
02:43:06 <TheJollyRoger> I believe one guy tried it a while back. Burner has a hard dependency on Google Play.
02:43:30 <Adam17767> Alright
02:43:39 <Adam17767> I was hoping to make calls with LTe only
02:43:43 <Adam17767> Hmmm
02:43:52 <TheJollyRoger> So if it's an app you need, your best bet is to write the developers of Burner and ask them to implement functionality that does not depend on Google Play Services.
02:43:57 <Adam17767> Can I set, "Use all Network protocols except 2G mode"?
02:44:06 <Adam17767> I just want to avoid 2G
02:44:13 <Thatcher[m]> I can make calls with Lte only mode just fine
02:44:17 <TheJollyRoger> Your best hope against cellphone interception is to simply use Signal exclusively, honestly.
02:44:19 <Adam17767> Im fine with 3g/4g/LTE
02:44:24 <joehandcockandja> Hmm I'll give it another go
02:44:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I can also call on LTE Only.
02:44:45 <TheJollyRoger> Adam17767: get your friends using it.
02:44:47 <Adam17767> GOS should have a protocol selection page :Choose Protocols: 2G, 3G, 4G, LTE with checkboxes
02:44:55 <Adam17767> Thatcher, are you on Tmobile?
02:45:03 <joehandcockandja> Yep same thing
02:45:06 <Adam17767> I got Tmobile here
02:45:12 <Adam17767> Hoping lte only mode works here
02:45:15 <joehandcockandja> Can't call with ATT
02:45:29 <TheJollyRoger> Adam17767: that can be done, if you're willing to contribute the code for it. GrapheneOS is not a business, rather it's a collaborative open source project. Features appear because people are willing to write the computer code for it and submit their code to the project.
02:45:29 <joehandcockandja> I guess they still use 4G for calls
02:45:30 <Thatcher[m]> <Adam17767 "Thatcher, are you on Tmobile?"> Yes. Tmobile here
02:45:39 <TheJollyRoger> So if you can write the UI and backend for it, you can send that code in.
02:46:44 <Adam17767> Nice!
02:46:49 <Adam17767> Im hoping LTe only works for me too
02:46:54 <Adam17767> Guys look into Simple Mobile
02:47:02 <Adam17767> It has 50 Gigs of LTE data for $50 per month
02:47:11 <Adam17767> its the most data Ive seen for prepaid service
02:47:23 <Adam17767> $50 for 60 gigs of high speed LTE per month
02:47:36 <Adam17767> with possible slowed speed after that
02:48:01 <Adam17767> The Pixel 4A speakers are angelic
02:48:10 <Adam17767> its so smooth and bass-heavy
02:48:11 <Adam17767> Rich
02:48:19 <Adam17767> These Pixel 4A speakers are wispering to me
02:48:28 <joehandcockandja> They're not that good
02:48:30 <Adam17767> "Install Graphene OS" "Use Tor"
02:48:32 <joehandcockandja> It's mono
02:48:45 <Adam17767> miles ahead of my $20 chinese phones I was using
02:49:01 <Adam17767> do both speakers work
02:49:12 <Adam17767> Or is 1 area microphone the other the speaker
02:49:13 <Thatcher[m]> Anyone here run Graphene with their internal mic/gps/camera removed?
02:49:31 <joehandcockandja> Nah
02:49:38 <joehandcockandja> Literally no point in doing that
02:49:39 <Adam17767> I think you can disable the microphone
02:49:57 <Adam17767> Then just use wired headphones with microphone build in
02:49:59 <Adam17767> built in
02:50:02 <TheJollyRoger> Excision of physical components from the phone is largely a fad/meme in privacy circles.
02:50:05 <Adam17767> Edwawrd snowden style
02:50:07 <timeistruevalue[> <Thatcher[m] "Anyone here run Graphene with th"> Open it up to take out mics and speakers. And u can just cover cameras 📷
02:50:24 <TheJollyRoger> If your phone is compromised to the point where you need to excise components from it, the battle has already been lost.
02:50:42 <joehandcockandja> It hasn't been lost but you're just a fucking dumbass for still using a smartphone
02:50:45 <joehandcockandja> At that point
02:50:52 <joehandcockandja> And I laugh at you
02:50:55 <joehandcockandja> Ha!
02:50:59 <joehandcockandja> Begone! Begone!
02:51:07 <Adam17767> So what do you use joe?
02:51:12 <timeistruevalue[> Its surface area of attack
02:51:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, it's Toxic Power User Mentality of basically "putting on a show for other people" at that point.
02:51:21 <joehandcockandja> A 4a with GOS
02:51:23 <timeistruevalue[> At end of day removing mic is safer
02:51:27 <Adam17767> I agree
02:51:34 <Adam17767> I cover my cameras
02:51:37 <joehandcockandja> not for people in this chat doe
02:51:41 <Adam17767> I put tape over the microphones
02:51:53 <Adam17767> I use headphones with mic to make calls
02:52:00 <joehandcockandja> I'm guessing everyone's threat level here is like extremely low if at all existent
02:52:17 <Adam17767> I consider my threat level NSA Targeted level
02:52:25 <Adam17767> Just for hypthoethical hardening
02:52:35 <Thatcher[m]> I worry more about deep state Google than government agencies spying on me
02:52:39 <joehandcockandja> Using anything won't protect you from the NSA
02:53:15 <Adam17767> Still, they have to hack just as fair any anybody
02:53:19 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, to anyone here, I challenge you to go live with computer science majors who have a good sense of humour, like security games, and keep something on a computer secured for them for a month.
02:53:24 <Adam17767> So using GOS is far harder to hack than Iphone for example
02:53:31 <TheJollyRoger> Either you'll lose, or they're idiots.
02:53:38 <Adam17767> I mean, a secure system is secure
02:53:52 <BorisTheBurger> TheJollyRoger: a little hyperbolic no?
02:54:03 <joehandcockandja> Sure let me just go find some comp sci majors to live with
02:54:12 <timeistruevalue[> One time I compromised my phone by pissing on it
02:54:52 <joehandcockandja> Hey anyone here a comp sci major and wanna live with me?
02:55:09 <TheJollyRoger> BorisTheBurger: I've tried it. It doesn't cost that much in time or effort to exfiltrate the private keys out of a physically airgapped computer that's had its network cards and wifi removed and is kept in a box with a $200 Assa abloy lock clandestinely.
02:55:39 <TheJollyRoger> Price of a Teensy, a resin casting kit, a MicroSD card, and a handful of USB drives you can cut apart.
02:55:49 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah, and a bottle of Everclear.
02:55:59 <joehandcockandja> Holy shit, programmer892278
02:56:04 <joehandcockandja> Dude's a legend
02:56:12 <Adam17767> Teensy still in use?
02:56:21 <BorisTheBurger> TheJollyRoger: lol what
02:56:25 <Adam17767> Teensy is OG from 2012
02:56:30 <Adam17767> I got one at DefCon
02:56:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, this was a long time ago.
02:56:34 <joehandcockandja> Holy shit, sane.one is in here too!! These guys are legends
02:56:38 <Adam17767> DefCon 2012
02:57:00 <BorisTheBurger> TheJollyRoger: no i mean it doesnt sound like a true story
02:57:03 <Adam17767> Trying to secure Default Google Pixel 4A OS
02:57:08 <Adam17767> I have a VPN
02:57:11 <Adam17767> what else can I do
02:57:32 <joehandcockandja> Nae nae
02:57:56 <BorisTheBurger> TheJollyRoger: or maybe you skipped a few words
02:58:07 <Adam17767> Ok guys whats the maximum security setup
02:58:16 <Adam17767> Tor Router, Tomato Router
02:58:22 <Adam17767> Coreboot BIOS
02:58:28 <Adam17767> Runnig Qubes/Whonix
02:58:34 <joehandcockandja> Throw away your phone and computer and never go on the internet
02:58:41 <Adam17767> Yeah but
02:58:46 <joehandcockandja> Very secure, has stood the test of time
02:58:48 <Adam17767> Whats the most way to use the internet
02:59:08 <joehandcockandja> Get binoculars and watch someone using it from far away
02:59:10 <Adam17767> most secure way
02:59:54 <TheJollyRoger> BorisTheBurger: nah, what they did was simply make an exact clone of the USB drive that was used to ferry data between the secure system and the outside system by cutting open a USB drive of the same make and model and placing a Teensy outfitted with a MicroSD card in there and covertly swapping the real one with a counterfeit and back again.
03:00:10 <TheJollyRoger> It's not hard to do stuff like that.
03:00:13 <joehandcockandja> Get your friend to go to a public library, steal a laptop or computer, get him to connect to Tor, search for the thing you needed to know, then immediately detonate the computer all while you're a mile away watching the computer screen with binoculars
03:00:14 <BorisTheBurger> oh
03:00:35 <Adam17767> Joe, great idea
03:00:40 <Adam17767> I'll just use Tails for now though =)

03:07:35 <Adam17767> Thats the typeof Reason IHackCharities Exists
03:07:39 <Adam17767> Hopefull
03:07:42 <Adam17767> Hopefully
03:07:52 <Adam17767> She knows to keep that CAT-5 Secure! mhmm
03:11:56 <Adam1776> Does google pixel 4a have Gorilla Glass?
03:12:20 <TheJollyRoger> The screen is made from Gorilla Glass 3.
03:12:44 <TheJollyRoger> The back is made of a hard glossy polycarbonate shell, if I recall correctly.
03:13:31 <Adam1776> Beautiful
03:13:57 <TheJollyRoger> Polycarbonate is the stuff they make bullet-proof windows out of, although mind you, bulletproof windows are usually an inch thick or more, depending on the threat model of the window. Regardless, polycarbonate is very strong for its weight.
03:14:39 <Adam1776> Great
03:14:44 <Adam1776> I hope the battery can last for years
03:14:50 <Adam1776> Without losing charging cycle capacity
03:15:23 <TheJollyRoger> Well, my old original Pixel, which is now an MP3 player (airplane mode only), still holds a charge well, but I've taken very good care of it.
03:15:51 <TheJollyRoger> Once I accidentally left it on and was shocked to have it blare out a "battery low!" alert about five days later.
03:16:07 <TheJollyRoger> (Then again, it's not connected to anything and has no apps)
03:16:44 <TheJollyRoger> Battery technology for smartphones has improved considerably in the last decade.
03:17:33 <joehandcockandja> I just try and keep mine between 20 and 80 percent and don't leave it charging overnight or use fast charging
03:18:17 <Adam1776> Fast Charging wears out the battery faster?
03:18:24 <Adam1776> Does GOS have a Fast-charging option?
03:18:24 <TheJollyRoger> Some of it though owes itself to software improvements: the phone's firmware governs how fast and how aggressively the phone charges and what to charge to. Similarly, when the apps aren't running, the operating system will often "sleep" them in the background and only resume them when it recieves a "hey, wake up!" from a push server.
03:18:42 <TheJollyRoger> On older handsets, it used to, but now it's best to just let your phone decide how it wants to be charged.
03:19:09 <Adam1776> Do phones last through a days usage with GOS
03:19:11 <TheJollyRoger> Because again, firmware optimizations have gotten /very/ good at this.
03:19:21 <Adam1776> Does GOS drain battery faster than stock android?
03:19:55 <joehandcockandja> By stock, do you mean android with google play services?
03:20:04 <Adam1776> yeah, fresh out of the box
03:20:14 <TheJollyRoger> Adam1776: Light usage I usually get around two days of battery on GrapheneOS on Blueline. Heavy usage though, it depends.
03:20:15 <Adam1776> does GOS have MAC randomization ?
03:20:24 <Adam1776> Whats BlueLine
03:20:31 <TheJollyRoger> Adam1776: GrapheneOS indeed has MAC randomization.
03:20:35 <TheJollyRoger> Blueline is the codename for "Pixel 3"
03:20:45 <TheJollyRoger> Crosshatch is the codename for "Pixel 3XL"
03:20:52 <TheJollyRoger> Similarly, Sunfish is the codename for "Pixel 4a."
03:21:00 <Adam1776> yes im a SunFish
03:21:55 <TheJollyRoger> Anecdotally, GrapheneOS actually is able to get more battery life than the regular android but YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY:
03:22:09 <TheJollyRoger> The reason why I say this is that some apps depend on Play Services to wake them up.
03:22:21 <TheJollyRoger> If they don't have Play Services, they may need to resort to running in the foreground.
03:22:49 <TheJollyRoger> Remember what I've said about why phones' batteries last longer: the improvements are largely in software optimization, and the phone being able to tell the processes to "go to sleep" in the background.
03:23:01 <pamachs[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Anecdotally, GrapheneOS actually"> Absolutely can confirm on 4a
03:23:06 <TheJollyRoger> Then wake up only when they're needed.
03:23:13 <TheJollyRoger> pamachs[m]: well, that's excellent to hear!
03:23:33 <pamachs[m]> Indeed
03:23:48 <Adam1776> YES
03:23:54 <Adam1776> So whats the default app list you guys use
03:23:59 <TheJollyRoger> So it depends on the apps you run. For instance, if you run some peer-to-peer messaging apps which by nature *cannot* function offline, that means the phone can't be "sleeping."
03:24:05 <Adam1776> Im hoping to use Tor Browser, Mullvad Wireguard VPN, NewPipe
03:24:09 <TheJollyRoger> If you're watching a movie, or playing a video, that means the screen needs to be turned on.
03:24:18 <Adam1776> PDF reader and Audiobooks
03:24:22 <TheJollyRoger> Both of those at the same time means draining the battery very quickly
03:24:39 <TheJollyRoger> Adam1776: GrapheneOS has its own secure PDF Reader which uses the webview/trichrome. You'll find it included with the base install.
03:24:49 <Adam1776> Amazing
03:24:56 <Adam1776> Im hoping to get 'Librevox' running
03:24:57 <Adam1776> on GOS
03:25:16 <Adam1776> Do you guys know of a trusted APK resource
03:25:19 <TheJollyRoger> So -- just remember that your phone's battery life, as well as the overall health of the battery over the years will depend largely on how you use it.
03:25:19 <somenerd[m]> > Adam1776: GrapheneOS has its own secure PDF Reader which uses the webview/trichrome. You'll find it included with the base install.
03:25:19 <somenerd[m]> that sounds convenient
03:25:23 <Adam1776> I know of Fdroid, official Developer Sites
03:26:37 <louipc> man this chats so off topic
03:26:53 <TheJollyRoger> I concur. Let's move this to #grapheneos-offtopic.
04:12:53 <Leo[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/issues/37
04:12:53 <Leo[m]> Just noticed that it is impossible for the app (Chromium) itself to notify that the `IntentDispatcher` failed, if it's gated by INTERNET permission, (see the linked pull request), without modifying something on the OS code itself, as the Chromium/Vanadium won't start if the intent has failed, thus it has to be handled in the OS level
04:14:37 <Leo[m]> It cannot be routed on gating the permission on the targetactivity of `IntentDispatcher`, as apps will still be able to open links if only `ChromeLauncherActivity` and/or `ChromeTabbedActivity` is gated with permission
04:15:27 <Leo[m]> Maybe I'm saying something too obvious here, but the issue #37 is nontrivial to resolve
04:19:55 <Leo[m]> Is this (offtopic)?
04:20:24 <somenerd[m]> It's related to GrapheneOS
04:20:31 <somenerd[m]> so I guess it's on topic
04:21:21 <rny> Leo[m]: no, not offtopic
04:29:38 <naribia> so, I'm on this part of the build (for blueline): https://grapheneos.org/build#generating-signed-factory-images-and-full-update-packages
04:29:55 <naribia> it says "The factory images and update package will be in out/release-crosshatch-$BUILD_NUMBER"
04:30:25 <naribia> and I do not see a "out/release-blueline-$buildnum" in the directory...?
04:37:50 <strcat[m]> naribia: did you successfully run script/release.sh ?
04:38:43 <naribia> strcat[m]: I ran "script/release.sh blueline"
04:38:50 <naribia> and I think it was successful
04:38:50 <strcat> naribia: and did it succeed?
04:39:15 <strcat> naribia: then it will have output it to out/release-*
04:39:23 <naribia> I believe so? only thing I noticed was I got a bunch of these: "2020-12-07 14:07:58 - common.py - WARNING : Failed to read SYSTEM/etc/build.prop"
04:39:45 <naribia> oops
04:39:45 <strcat> doesn't really sound like it was successful then?
04:39:46 <naribia> I see it
04:39:50 <strcat> but it should have made that directory
04:39:57 <naribia> yes i see it now
04:40:27 <strcat> I don't know if there's actually going to be an upstream Pixel 2 release
04:40:30 <strcat> for this month
04:40:55 <strcat> it's fully dropped from the 1st Android 11 quarterly release branch
04:41:23 <naribia> im building for pixel 3 anyways
04:41:24 <strcat> so if they do genuinely make a final update for them as was claimed by several journalists, etc. it will be based on the original branch
04:41:30 <strcat> yeah not related to what you're doing
04:41:32 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy strcat, now that it's dropped from upstream, does this mean GrapheneOS can finally cut it loose?
04:41:37 <strcat> just mentioning it here
04:41:39 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
04:41:49 <strcat> well it's officially gone from the development branch of GrapheneOS
04:41:55 <TheJollyRoger> Oh whew. Okay!
04:42:04 <strcat> it's gone from AOSP's 1st quarterly Android 11 release branch
04:42:26 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: we already had to make a device-specific branch for it but only 2 minor differences in 2 repos
04:42:27 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, I'm hoping that once it's gone, then that means the developer team will have one less burden you guys have to carry.
04:42:31 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
04:42:38 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: I mean for the last release we did
04:42:51 <strcat> we made an extra 2020-11-01 security patch release for the Pixel 2 and 2 XL
04:43:00 <TheJollyRoger> I... oh!
04:43:05 <strcat> but if they are not going to do another upstream update that is as far as it can ever go
04:43:12 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense.
04:43:42 <strcat> I don't see much point in investing substantial time in it when it can't actually anything close to a full newer security patch level
04:43:57 <strcat> can't actually reach*
04:44:07 <TheJollyRoger> yeah. It's my hope that once it's been cut loose you guys won't need to carry its dead weight anymore.
04:44:55 <TheJollyRoger> And the resources spent on it can be allocated to other things, like giving you guys a much needed break and some leisure time.
04:45:15 <strcat> doing the new Vanadium release today before the OS release too
04:45:20 <strcat> so it'll take more time than usual
04:45:28 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow. Got it. Fingers crossed then.
04:45:30 <strcat> 3rd Chromium 87 release
04:45:34 <strcat> which let me see...
04:45:58 <strcat[m]> Android: Android releases both Chrome and WebView with each release, and follows a pattern similar to:
04:45:58 <strcat[m]> 1% deployment -> 5% deployment -> 10% deployment -> 50% deployment -> 100% deployment.
04:46:07 <strcat[m]> the 3rd release they still only roll out to 10% of people
04:46:16 <TheJollyRoger> Er, you need something tested?
04:46:17 <strcat[m]> we just ship the 1st one ASAP to get security fixes out ASAP
04:46:28 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: you could test the Vanadium update if you want
04:46:29 <strcat[m]> it's pushed
04:46:38 <strcat[m]> for arm64
04:46:48 <strcat[m]> building x64 one atm (they call it by the Windows name)
04:46:57 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_external_vanadium/tree/11/prebuilt/arm64
04:47:01 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. One moment.
04:47:02 <naribia> now that I have the out/release-xxx-xxx images, does that mean I'm done? I can now flash the .zip file onto my phone? and use the generated key avb_pkmd.bin to lock the bootloader?
04:47:20 <strcat[m]> naribia: our flash-all script flashes the AVB key for you
04:47:23 <TheJollyRoger> strcat great, I'll go and get it, you want me to download it and run CTS?
04:47:32 <strcat[m]> naribia: yes you should be done as long as you did it correctly
04:47:34 * TheJollyRoger hastily boots his Pixel 4
04:47:38 <naribia> sweeeeet
04:47:43 <strcat[m]> naribia: follow the install guide with your factory images zip
04:47:50 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck naribia!
04:48:02 <naribia> right right, I previously successfully installed the prebuilds onto my pixel 3
04:48:15 <strcat[m]> naribia: yeah it's identical to that
04:48:42 <naribia> except now I've got my own signing key 0-0
04:49:28 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: I'm just letting flame update, and then I'm going to load the new Vanadium update, I can have my phone on the testing rig in a bit.
04:54:08 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta patch up the testing rig too. It hasn't been powered on in months.
04:54:26 <TheJollyRoger> *sounds of hammering, drills, and saw in the background.*
04:59:53 <strcat> CTS won't work properly atm
05:00:00 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
05:00:02 <TheJollyRoger> Uh...
05:00:08 <strcat> until we fix the use-after-free in adbd which stops it from saving whitelisted keys
05:00:21 <TheJollyRoger> Anything you want me to do to test the new Vanadium, then?
05:00:30 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: well you could run the WebView tests, etc.,
05:00:38 <strcat> but after a reboot adb will lose the whitelisted key
05:00:48 <strcat> which will break running a lot of the CTS because it relies on adb
05:00:54 <strcat> it's an upstream bug in adbd
05:00:59 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. Looks like I'll just have to run them one at a time then.
05:01:03 <strcat> it might actually be fixed in the new quarterly release
05:01:05 <strcat> probably not
05:01:17 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! I just installed all three Trichrome APKs.
05:01:18 <strcat> they fixed a few bugs we're aware of including bugs we fixed downstream
05:01:26 <strcat> may be able to remove some more workarounds we have
05:02:03 <TheJollyRoger> That'd be fantastic, if we don't have to work around upstream's problems!
05:03:11 <TheJollyRoger> The laptop is updating right now, afterwards I have to get new versions of platform tools and the CTS.
05:03:20 <TheJollyRoger> So this could take me a bit of time, but I think I remember the way.

05:43:09 <AdamCyber17> So is the 'Preffered Network type 4G LTE' Just a preferred option
05:43:15 <AdamCyber17> Or does it set LTE only
05:43:25 <AdamCyber17> And how does it work in Stock Google Pixel 4A
05:43:38 <AdamCyber17> Is it just the preferred, or the Only?
06:00:05 * Golli[m]2 uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201208-055924_1.png (40KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/200acres.org/EkvzLmQUbMTjANSwXAWQtGhT/Screenshot_20201208-055924_1.png >
06:00:23 <Golli[m]2> You can limit it to 4G only.
06:01:55 <AdamCyber17> Is that ^ Graphene OS? =)?
06:02:13 <Golli[m]2> Indeed it is.
06:02:16 <AdamCyber17> Im so ready
06:02:29 <AdamCyber17> Im just awaiting a USB A to USB C cable to interface my laptop and my Pixel 4a
06:02:56 <AdamCyber17> The Install Instructions dont say when to plug in the Cable into my Pixel
06:03:10 <AdamCyber17> What step am I supposed to plug in my laptop to phone
06:04:35 <Golli[m]2> I just used the cable that came with my other phone.
06:05:22 <AdamCyber17> Are you on Pixel 4A?
06:05:33 <AdamCyber17> I have USB to Microusb cables
06:05:43 <AdamCyber17> but I dont have any Male USb to USb cables
06:05:48 <AdamCyber17> or USB to USB-C
06:05:51 <AdamCyber17> So i ordered one
06:06:06 <Golli[m]2> Unlocking the bootloader
06:06:14 <Golli[m]2> That step.
06:06:47 <Golli[m]2> I'm on the 4 XL.
06:07:07 <AdamCyber17> nice1
06:08:06 <AdamCyber17> Hows Graphene for you
06:09:17 <AdamCyber17> What App Stores do you use etc?
06:26:58 <madd_hatter[m]> arpysco: pixel 3xl.  I have not noticed it before.  I think I just caught it with low resources and high cpu use.  But it makes you wonder if it could be exploited.
06:26:58 <madd_hatter[m]> Surprised me more than anything.  I was like..."did I just see my element lckscrn!?!  Crap I did.  Hmmmmm"
07:05:22 <TheJollyRoger> Let's see... CtsWebkitTestCases are done!
07:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> 612 ran, 610 passed, 2 failed, let's back it up and rerun the test and see what I get.
07:19:37 <Leo[m]> <AdamCyber17 "What App Stores do you use etc?"> Foxy Droid, Aurora Store, minimizing apps to install overall and per user profile
07:29:31 * Leo[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/MsITVHoUjMzzDIiTjmWLrukM/message.txt >
07:35:42 <Leo[m]> Or rarely when switching three users
07:36:56 <madd_hatter[m]> Leo:  yes but this was on a login.  GOS was locked.  IIIRC the basic scrn saver was active.  I performed standard up swipe to bring up the login window.  But for a split second the active window under the lckscrn was visible.
07:36:56 <madd_hatter[m]> If there is a way to consistently duplicate it would allow capture of data on the active window.  If that happens to be confidential/privileged info........
07:39:26 <madd_hatter[m]> I guess as a security policy never leave anything important open on the active window.
07:47:59 <madd_hatter[m]> Given how phones have the need to be on and active for typical use you'd think they would make that scrnlck strong and bug free.
07:48:00 <madd_hatter[m]> Could there not be a separate window (blank scrn image) that is activated when the phone locks so if this does happen all that would be visible would beva blank scrn and notbthe users desktop or active app window.
07:49:47 <Leo[m]> Debugging that might help btw
07:50:07 <Leo[m]> Nothing is ever bug free
07:50:22 <Leo[m]> They didn't even fix the VPN leak on secondary users upstream until recently
07:51:11 <madd_hatter[m]> Grrr.
07:53:01 <Leo[m]> Assume there's always bug somewhere in any place, maybe it lapsed on the security team reviewing the code, or is an edge case, idk
07:53:07 <Leo[m]> Try to file an issue?
07:59:29 <strcat[m]> Auditor app version 23 released: <https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases/tag/23>.

08:06:54 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo!  Awesome, awesome strcat[m]!
08:07:13 <somenerd[m]> Nice
08:07:28 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: I have good news. CtsWebkitTestCases is coming back 612 tests passed out of 612.
08:07:44 <somenerd[m]> I checked the changelog, CalyxOS support is dropped?
08:07:59 <TheJollyRoger> I ran it three times, only experienced two failures the first time, the second and third time time all 612 passed.
08:08:45 <madd_hatter[m]> strcat: great!!  Thank you for the hard work.
08:08:46 <madd_hatter[m]> You seem to get the most done during graveyard.
08:09:05 <TheJollyRoger> ...oh goodness look at the time.
08:09:18 <TheJollyRoger> o.O
08:09:29 <madd_hatter[m]> TheJollyRoger:
08:09:29 <madd_hatter[m]> EXACTLY.....
08:10:08 <TheJollyRoger> Think it's time for me to pile up the Zs then o.O
08:10:18 <TheJollyRoger> And you guys too O_O
08:10:27 <TheJollyRoger> Sleep well, me hearties!
08:10:47 * TheJollyRoger pinches out the candle on his desk.
08:10:47 <madd_hatter[m]>  GOOD NIGHT
08:15:13 <madd_hatter[m]> somenerd: Who would have thunk!?!  Curiouser and curiouser..........
08:16:20 <madd_hatter[m]> * somenerd: Who would have thunk!?!  Curiouser and curiouser..........
08:17:26 <madd_hatter[m]> > I checked the changelog, CalyxOS support is dropped?
08:17:26 <madd_hatter[m]> Who would've thunk!?!
08:17:26 <madd_hatter[m]> Curiouser and curiouser???
08:24:27 <strcat[m]> somenerd: yes, it's dropped
08:24:50 <strcat[m]> somenerd: has not been updated based on newer devices that are added + they show little interest in it and aren't contributing
08:25:54 <strcat[m]> the current entries are not correct due to them reusing keys for other devices that are whitelisted by Auditor
08:26:11 <strcat[m]>  * the current entries were not correct due to them reusing keys for other devices that are whitelisted by Auditor
08:26:34 <strcat[m]>  * the current entries were not correct due to them reusing the same keys for newer generation devices that are whitelisted by Auditor
08:32:06 <strcat[m]> I made them aware that it needed to be updated a long time ago
08:32:28 <somenerd[m]> > : has not been updated based on newer devices that are added + they show little interest in it and aren't contributing
08:32:48 <somenerd[m]> That's sad, especially because Auditor is quite useful
08:33:00 <somenerd[m]> especially for security focused projects
08:33:03 <somenerd[m]> but
08:33:18 <somenerd[m]> they should've contributed though
08:34:00 <strcat[m]> I've stopped adding or maintaining support for anything but the devices supported by GrapheneOS with either GrapheneOS or the stock OS
08:34:55 <strcat[m]> support for the stock OS on other devices depends on finding a developer interested in working on that in Auditor
08:36:46 <somenerd[m]>  * they should've contributed though
08:37:57 <strcat[m]> support for other alternate OSes will depend on those projects maintaining the support for their OS and contributing to the attestation project
08:38:37 <strcat[m]> if they just want to use it they can always release a rebranded app with their own service, with proper attributionof the service and publish their own releases of the app
08:41:03 <strcat[m]> if a project just wants to use it they can make a rebranded app and host their own rebranded instance of the service - or they can contribute back to support us doing it, especially since it requires providing support to users, including removal of their alert emails when they forget their account info
08:42:32 <somenerd[m]> Was auditor bundled with CalyxOS?
08:44:02 <Leo[m]> Nah
08:44:05 <strcat[m]> supporting stock OS devices not targeted by GrapheneOS proved to be a poor use of resources
08:44:27 <somenerd[m]> > Nah
08:44:27 <somenerd[m]> yeah didn't see a mention on the website either
08:44:43 <strcat[m]> few people interested in security use any of the expanded list of devices we worked on supporting
08:44:59 <strcat[m]> it's just not a good use of time
08:45:25 <strcat[m]> it's a GrapheneOS feature first and foremost and works best on GrapheneOS where we have verified boot and attestation enhancements for it
08:46:33 <strcat[m]> if there is actually substantial interest in using it elsewhere, whoever is interested can contribute and support it
08:49:40 <somenerd[m]> > Nah
08:49:41 <somenerd[m]> expected a mention of Auditor from CalyOS
08:49:57 <somenerd[m]> especially considering their focus on security
08:49:58 <somenerd[m]> but ok
08:50:04 <somenerd[m]>  * especially considering their focus on privacy
08:50:06 <strcat[m]> what focus on security?
08:50:10 <somenerd[m]> I edited
08:50:15 <somenerd[m]> misworded it
08:50:49 <somenerd[m]> there isn't a focus on security or hardening of the OS
08:51:19 <strcat[m]> or in making the OS more private in terms of what apps can access, etc.
08:51:38 <ruddo[m]> It'd be cool if CalyxOS features were to appear in GrapheneOS.  Oh wait we already have one of those: SeedVault.
08:51:44 <ruddo[m]> But more is better.
08:51:50 <strcat[m]> Seedvault is not a CalyxOS feature
08:51:54 <strcat[m]> it wasn't created by them
08:51:59 <strcat[m]> it existed before CalyxOS existed
08:52:03 <somenerd[m]> it was separate from Calyx
08:52:06 <strcat[m]> them contributing to it doesn't make it their app / idea
08:52:14 <somenerd[m]> I think they just contribute
08:53:04 <somenerd[m]>  * there isn't a focus on security or hardening of the OS
08:53:11 <ruddo[m]> Ah OK.  :-(
08:53:59 <strcat[m]> somenerd: it *is* separate from CalyxOS, not was
08:54:24 <somenerd[m]>  * it is separate from Calyx
08:55:17 <strcat[m]> it was created by a volunteer developer to implement a feature that had been planned on our issue tracker
08:56:22 <strcat[m]> and it's still an independent project
08:56:49 <somenerd[m]> I should really be careful with wording
09:18:25 <strcat[m]> hopefully https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1194 is addressed for matrix.org soon
11:53:26 <citypw> "fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable." anyone happens to fix this issue from recent build(flame-factory-2020.11.27.15.zip) for pixel 4?
12:08:34 <Knull[m]> damn, i already thought lurking kept me in chats
12:09:56 <somenerd[m]> yeah it kicks out lurkers
12:10:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <ruddo[m] "It'd be cool if CalyxOS features"> We aren't going to implement things that don't work
12:10:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Calyx often implements less secure solutions
12:11:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example they reuse lineage firewall which is far weaker than out network permission toggle

12:53:55 <pacman37[m]> When I opened the messaging app for the first time, I got this message: “This app was built for an older version of Android and may not work properly. Try checking for updates or contact the developer.”
13:07:13 <Leo[m]> <pacman37[m] "When I opened the messaging app "> That's just how it works when apps' targetSdk is less than 29
13:17:51 <gensu[m]> I have come to the conclusion that this OS is best for privacy and security and mean to switch soon. The one app I can't do without is navigation (Waze). I was thinking of ways to get around this. What do  you guys do?
13:19:28 <arpysco[m]> I don't use Waze 😌
13:19:52 <gensu[m]> No nav for u?
13:20:09 <arpysco[m]> I live in a cave and never go out
13:20:17 <arpysco[m]> I navigate using the sun and the stars
13:21:34 <jpds> gensu[m]: osmand+ seems to do OK in my experience
13:22:09 <gensu[m]> I was thinking of using my grapheme OS main as a hotspot and then connecting an old phone through it and using Waze on that. Is there any reason that wouldn't work or I shouldn't do that for privacy or security?
13:22:16 <arpysco[m]> the thing with osmand is it doesn't account for changing traffic conditions like waze
13:22:47 <arpysco[m]> but yeah I highly doubt waze will work without the google stuff in the background

14:26:13 <jpds> alzxjm[m]: ConnectBot
14:26:37 <arpysco[m]> <arpysco[m] "nope"> my reply to wordsmithy
14:27:45 <digiscales[m]> Which level widevine does this rom support?
14:28:40 <alzxjm[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Anyone have a good recommendatio"> Sorry meant to post this in OT
14:29:44 <Leo[m]> <wordsmithy "I started experiencing severe ba"> Could be hardware issue
14:30:26 <naribia> can I use any kernel with graphene os?
14:31:31 <wordsmith> Interesting. Had been running perfectly since I installed it on September 17th on my Pixel 3a.
14:33:11 <Leo[m]> <wordsmithy "Hello, guys! New to the channel."> Not really, battery lasts similarly here, and no indication of sudden shift of battery draining
14:34:55 <wordsmith> Hardware seems to working fine. It seemed to be abrupt. Use to get more than a couple of days. Now it drains 23% overnight without any usage. Bizzare.
14:35:35 <strcat[m]> naribia: unclear what you mean
14:35:52 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS has kernel changes and our userspace changes depend on them
14:36:05 <wordsmith> I've checked background process, but I only have Signal. Can't belive that's draining the sucker that quickly. I'm getting paranoid now. I'm thinking Pegasus is on my phone, but I'm not that important.
14:37:04 <alex-resist> Did you recently reinstall Signal?
14:37:07 <strcat[m]> wordsmith: could just be that you have a bad cellular signal and Signal would definitely be waking it while idle keep the push connection alive if you gave it the battery optimization exception
14:37:25 <alex-resist> Signal can drain the battery quite quickly when it receives a large number of messages, esp. when it can't decrypt them
14:37:47 <naribia> strcat: ok, so I'm trying to build for pixel 5, trying to figure out how to build gos kernel for p5
14:37:54 <strcat[m]> Signal doesn't have the most efficient possible implementation of this, it's decent, but doesn't throttle the check based on connection type (it should not check that the connection is still alive as frequently over IPv6)
14:38:05 <strcat[m]> naribia: need to start from the correct msm.git tag
14:38:07 <strcat[m]> and port over the changes
14:38:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> naribia: it isn't ready yet
14:38:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> I haven't pushed my kernel yet so you'll have to do a bringup yourself
14:38:44 <naribia> what does "bringup" mean?
14:39:15 <naribia> strcat: do you mean from the gos repo?
14:39:41 <wordsmith> Signal did indeed have a recent update. Very recent. It might be the culprit. Maybe I'll perform an experiment:  uninstall the sucker and check bat life.
14:40:34 <wordsmith> Thanks, guys!
14:41:28 <strcat[m]> don't really need to install it can just force stop it
14:41:29 <strcat[m]> too late
14:41:33 <strcat[m]>  * don't really need to uninstall it can just force stop it
14:41:42 <arpysco[m]> I don't think Signal updated recently either lol
14:43:49 <alex-resist> I know that people who are in large group chats experience problems after reinstalling Signal. Thousands of messages are being delivered but the key material is missing. Then it goes bonkers and the phone gets really hot, battery life is down to a few hours
14:45:12 <alex-resist> It's something to be aware of when people think their battery is damaged
14:46:50 <jpds> arpysco[m]: Signal actually run quite an aggresive release cycle
14:52:55 <BugHunter1000> jpds, which is weird, because you'd think a security-first tool would be conservative
14:53:27 <BugHunter1000> i miss the days of "its embedded, get it right asshole"
14:53:44 <jpds> BugHunter1000: They are quite conservative, but it seems that they've found a nice balance between that and being able to develop well-thought out features
14:54:23 <strcat[m]> BugHunter1000: frequent releases are required to be positioned to ship privacy/security improvements and security fixes
14:54:46 <strcat[m]> BugHunter1000: time-based (or essentially that) releases are the *opposite* of pushing out things before they're ready
14:55:02 <strcat[m]> frequent releases removes the incentive to rush features because they can just wait until the next release, which won't be far away
14:55:11 <strcat[m]> instead of rushing things into infrequent releases last minute
14:55:15 <strcat[m]> which is what most projects do
14:55:45 <strcat[m]> if a project has 1 major release per year, all the developers want to rush in their code before that's out and just fix it in bug fix releases
14:55:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah yes
14:56:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> ```
14:56:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fixed bugs
14:56:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Added more bugs to fix later
14:56:02 <strcat[m]> and if a feature is delayed it makes users unhappy
15:00:05 <BugHunter1000> i guess they only have 1 cve this year, not bad
15:00:59 <BugHunter1000> strcat[m], if you don't break it, you don't have to fix it
15:02:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> You what
15:03:13 <strcat[m]> BugHunter1000: I'm saying that developers will ship code that isn't ready when releases aren't frequent
15:03:34 <strcat[m]> if you've developed a major feature, but you need another couple weeks to stabilize it
15:03:44 <strcat[m]> and if you wait that long, the feature is delayed by a year or more
15:03:55 <strcat[m]> you have a major incentive to ship it prematurely
15:04:10 <strcat[m]> time-based, frequent releases are a good thing for stability when done properly
15:04:23 <strcat[m]> how does having far larger, more disruptive and less frequent releases help stability?
15:04:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just don't be lineageos though
15:04:36 <strcat[m]> you can use the same process for stabilizing releases either way
15:04:38 <strcat[m]> same testing
15:04:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> release everyday with 0 testing
15:04:54 <jpds> Yeah, to take a real-life example; Signal recently ported their signal-protocol library to rust, tried it in a beta release, found bugs, reverted it, and now it's in the latest beta
15:05:00 <strcat[m]> they don't do releases at all really
15:05:23 <strcat[m]> jpds: and compared to the incentive of infrequent releases to ship it anyway and fix it in the bug fix release branch
15:06:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why does this sound like windows
15:06:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Although bugs are rare to find these days
15:14:28 <BugHunter1000> strcat[m], and i'm saying if you fire developers that don't stand behind their work, they learn quickly
15:15:01 <BugHunter1000> imagine taking this attitude in actual engineering
15:15:15 <BugHunter1000> "the bridge needs a few more weeks, but we can stabilize it with enough duct tape!"
15:15:15 <strcat[m]> they don't learn quickly
15:15:24 <BugHunter1000> well then hire someone who does
15:15:37 <jpds> BugHunter1000: Firing anyone doesn't do anything

16:03:31 <joehandcockandja> It is due to a lack of google play services, most likely. Nothing to do with GOS itself

17:42:18 <ash[m]1> im gonna be picking up a phone for myself for Christmas, mine is a few years old, should i wait till graphene announces the next phone thats being supported or should i just pickup the 5
17:42:24 <ash[m]1> gotcha ty
17:42:44 <strcat[m]> ash: Pixel 4a is the best option right now, we don't have a timeline for Pixel 5 and 4a 5G support
17:42:54 <ash[m]1> er yea 4a my bad
17:43:02 <strcat[m]> I need to build the new workstation I've been planning for a while and those devices need people to step up as developers / maintainers
17:43:11 <ash[m]1> yea idk why i would expect firmware that doesnt support 5g to work on a phone which has 5g as its selling point lmao
17:43:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please approach this in a civil manner
17:43:24 <strcat[m]> ash: well the Pixel 4a 5G is a totally different phone
17:43:31 <Adam1776A> Hello mates
17:43:34 <ash[m]1> mhmm
17:45:11 <Golli[m]2> Is it possible to turn down the brightness even further on the 4 XL?
17:49:11 <steppingonyou[m]> strcat: do you know which of the new pixels have an hsm?
17:49:37 <Adam1776A> hardware security module hsm?
17:50:09 <steppingonyou[m]> yup
17:50:48 <Adam1776A> I think Pixel 4a has the Titan M security chip
17:50:51 <strcat[m]> steppingonyou: Pixel 2 and later have a secure element, Pixel 3 and later provide an HSM-based keystore implementation for use by the OS and apps via the standard keystore API
17:51:28 <steppingonyou[m]> more precisely do any new pixels use titan m equivalent?
17:51:34 <strcat[m]> steppingonyou: every officially supported device we have has an HSM-based keystore and the other secure element features, now that we don't officially support the Pixel 2 anymoer other than legacy support releases
17:51:41 <strcat[m]> steppingonyou: it's not clear what you mean
17:51:59 <strcat[m]> steppingonyou: I answered your question above
17:52:28 <strcat[m]>  * steppingonyou: every officially supported device we have has an HSM-based keystore and the other secure element features, now that we don't officially support the Pixel 2 anymore other than legacy support releases
17:53:52 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 introduced a secure element for the Weaver feature, Pixel 3 extended it to all of the current secure element features provided by all of them, there is no a newer one missing these hardware security features
17:54:00 <strcat[m]>  * Pixel 2 introduced a secure element for the Weaver feature, Pixel 3 extended it to all of the current secure element features provided by all of them, there is not a newer one missing these hardware security features
17:54:32 <strcat[m]> it's not something that varies across them
17:54:45 <strcat[m]> they just have newer revisions of it if they're newer
17:55:01 <steppingonyou[m]> i was curious about the titan m chip specifically i wasnt aware all pixels > 3 were using it
17:55:35 <strcat[m]> that's the branding for the secure element, it doesn't mean it's exactly the same chip / revision across them
17:56:01 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 and later have a secure element, Pixel 3 and later provide a much more capable, hardened and lower attack surface one
17:56:01 <steppingonyou[m]> sure
17:56:45 <steppingonyou[m]> afaik there are two variants so far?
17:57:10 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
17:57:25 <steppingonyou[m]> citadel/dauntless
17:58:14 <steppingonyou[m]> H1C2M/H1D2M
18:00:01 <steppingonyou[m]> i only have a 3a so far
18:14:30 <Tweak> Hi there
18:15:00 <Tweak> Ive got a question: is it save to download from the aurora store?
18:15:55 <Tweak> I mean when downloading from the aurora store can i still be tracked?
18:16:55 <strcat> not clear what you mean, you'll need to better define the question
18:17:16 <strcat> the Aurora Store is an alternative open source client for the Play Store
18:17:29 <Tweak> Ok
18:17:40 <BugHunter1000> Will Graphene run theoretically on any android phone or tablet, but unsupported?
18:17:56 <strcat> BugHunter1000: depends on what you consider GrapheneOS
18:18:11 <BugHunter1000> I'm not very knowledgeable, can you explain what you mean strcat?
18:18:17 <digiscales[m]> <strcat[m] "digiscales: we could try to make"> Thanks worked amazing it was my assumption altho making it clearer might be good most rom installs on other devices just use commandline
18:18:20 <Tweak> I sawe that the app that i want "intertone" has trackers
18:18:23 <strcat> I don't think it can be considered GrapheneOS without the full code and functionality
18:18:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "BugHunter1000: depends on what y"> Hmmmm
18:19:01 <BugHunter1000> strcat, What I mean is the google tracking removed, and OS hardening, that's what I think of when I think of Graphene
18:19:06 <strcat> Tweak: there is no way to detect that an app is privacy-respecting with an automated tool like that
18:19:19 <strcat> Tweak: doesn't work, and it sounds like you're being misled by it
18:19:30 <strcat> Tweak: if you don't trust an app with access to data, don't give it access to that data
18:19:35 <strcat> read our usage guide and FAQ
18:19:43 <BugHunter1000> Tweak, if you spin up a VM and download whatever you are after, you can watch it phone home with wireshark on your host
18:19:54 <strcat> user profiles can be used as isolated workspaces and are highly recommended
18:20:10 <Tweak> Ok
18:20:11 <strcat> BugHunter1000: most apps connect somewhere, doesn't mean they are invading privacy somehow
18:20:19 <strcat> and vice versa
18:20:20 <Tweak> I have to read in to it
18:20:40 <BugHunter1000> strcat Tweak - definitely true, but if it's sending data and you don't expect it to be, it's worth a quick email to the developer asking what's up
18:21:00 <strcat> and how do you know what data it's sending? you don't really
18:21:07 <strcat> you know what data it has access to
18:21:09 <strcat> that's what you control
18:21:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Hmmmm "> I'd think that grapheneos is one proper custom ROM, at last
18:21:20 <BugHunter1000> strcat, it could be encrypted so you wouldn't see it in the packet outline, but it could also be in the clear and you would
18:21:21 <Tweak> Its an app for my appartment door donstairs
18:21:22 <strcat> don't give it access to data you don't trust it with
18:21:28 <Tweak> Downstairs
18:21:42 <strcat> BugHunter1000: well, if they make any connections without authenticated encryption, that is itself concerning
18:21:49 <strcat> BugHunter1000: *regardless* of why the connections exist
18:21:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tweak: don't use those tbh
18:22:04 <BugHunter1000> Tweak, lol if you are controlling a door with someone else's code i would be extra careful..
18:22:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can do a nonce replay and those doors are open
18:22:21 <Tweak> Thanks
18:22:35 <BugHunter1000> strcat, definitely true, but when you stare into the void of bad programmers' code, it stares into you and you're never sure what to expect anymore /mood
18:22:39 <strcat> BugHunter1000: by default, Android disallows apps making connections via the standard library APIs without authenticated encryption, an app developer has to disable that security feature or use another network library if they want to bypass it
18:23:04 <strcat> BugHunter1000: app developers have to explicitly enable cleartext connections (or use an alternate network implementation)
18:23:26 <BugHunter1000> strcat, i didn't know that, but i wonder if you get a lot of people not using the regular api's, or skirting around it without thinking
18:23:45 <strcat> BugHunter1000: sure but I'm just clarifying that cleartext is an exception to the rule
18:23:55 <strcat> and an app making cleartext connections is concerning itself
18:23:58 <BugHunter1000> strcat, that's refreshing to hear :)
18:24:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> BugHunter1000: that would be their problem
18:24:20 <strcat> focus should be on controlling / limiting what the app has access to
18:24:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> We can't stop app developers from doing bullshit
18:24:33 <BugHunter1000> i used to use apple phones but these days i feel like they're fairly buggy, so i switched back to android but graphene looks rad
18:24:46 <strcat> there's a strong app sandbox and solid controls over data access, etc. along with isolated workspaces
18:25:06 <BugHunter1000> anupritaisno1[m], its true - most programmers make me so angry you have no idea
18:25:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> BugHunter1000: you are just weak then, make them angry next time
18:25:46 <BugHunter1000> strcat, in Graphene or Android, the sandbox point?
18:25:49 <strcat> if you don't trust one of the third party SDKs / libraries an app is using, don't give the app access to data you don't trust that SDK/library to handle - but it is really not a good way to figure out if apps are trustworthy
18:25:55 <BugHunter1000> anupritaisno1[m], this is the way
18:26:02 <strcat> I'm talking about GrapheneOS, not other variants of Android
18:26:22 <strcat> Android is an OS family, not a specific OS, and I'm talking about GrapheneOS (or AOSP 11)
18:26:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <BugHunter1000 "strcat, in Graphene or Android, "> Compared to AOSP we have a stronger sandbox for the base system
18:27:01 <strcat> we have a stronger sandbox for other apps too
18:27:23 <BugHunter1000> what's missing if I install GrapheneOS on a tablet?
18:27:42 <strcat> BugHunter1000: we don't have official support for any tablets
18:27:47 <BugHunter1000> strcat, i am brave
18:27:54 <BugHunter1000> :)
18:28:15 <Tweak> So basicly dont want to doenload apps for which i have to login from the aurorastore
18:28:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <BugHunter1000 "strcat, i am brave"> Your braveness has nothing to do with this
18:28:21 <strcat> so, what do you mean by installing GrapheneOS on a tablet? you mean your own port of it? you mean a generic build to run on top of vendor boot image and kernel, i.e. not a complete form of the OS?
18:28:22 <Tweak> Download
18:28:32 <strcat> BugHunter1000: it is not clear what you mean by that
18:28:41 <strcat> BugHunter1000: if you want to port GrapheneOS to a tablet, you're free to do that
18:28:47 <BugHunter1000> when you say "no support" i assume you mean "support" in the Red Hat sense
18:28:51 <BugHunter1000> you're saying it physically cannot work?
18:28:54 <strcat> no
18:29:06 <strcat> I'm saying that it's not officially supported
18:29:21 <strcat> and we do not develop support for any tablet
18:29:32 <BugHunter1000> sure so i think a brave user wanting to tinker might be happy with it, i'm not sure why it would be bad to try?
18:29:45 <strcat> BugHunter1000: please read the FAQ device support sections
18:29:50 <BugHunter1000> yes sir
18:29:52 <strcat> you have some misconceptions/misunderstandings
18:30:07 <strcat> BugHunter1000: and read over what I said above again especially in the context of those sections
18:30:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> BugHunter1000: you can glassrom then
18:30:40 <strcat> as I said above, using a generic build of GrapheneOS without specialized support for a device is *not really GrapheneOS*
18:30:45 <strcat> so you'll have to more clearly define what you mean
18:30:49 <BugHunter1000> oh so you're saying the security tweaks don't work if you port it without knowhow
18:31:02 <BugHunter1000> it's kind of a gentoo situation?
18:31:07 <strcat> no
18:31:15 <BugHunter1000> (i'm reading through the FAQ)
18:31:17 <strcat> not really what I'm saying
18:31:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> BugHunter1000: told you, glassrom it is
18:31:40 <strcat> you can make a generic build of GrapheneOS and run that on any hardware with Treble but it is not complete GrapheneOS, it's just part of it
18:31:41 <BugHunter1000> "In most cases, substantial work beyond that will be needed to bring the support up to the same standards. For most devices, the hardware and firmware will prevent providing a reasonably secure device, regardless of the work put into device support."
18:31:58 <strcat> you can run *part of* GrapheneOS on any hardware with Treble
18:32:11 <BugHunter1000> anupritaisno1[m], i'm about to scroll up and read, sorry i'm in the FAQ deep give me just a min
18:32:43 <strcat> a full port of GrapheneOS requires making releases for a device including updates (and hardening) for the device support code including the kernel, firmware, userspace components, etc.
18:32:58 <strcat> and most hardware is not going to support what's required to do a full port
18:33:05 <strcat> so you inherently can't really have actual GrapheneOS on it
18:33:39 <strcat> and I don't think running a *portion* of GrapheneOS via a generic build on random Android hardware can be considered running GrapheneOS as I said above
18:34:04 <strcat> so, sure, you can make a generic build, you can install it on some tablet, but it's not GrapheneOS, it's just part of GrapheneOS
18:34:31 <BugHunter1000> strcat, i don't think i'm personally qualified to do that alone, but if i wanted to get started on understanding the kernel hardening that goes missing when you start to do a port (and any other important things i would start out missing) could you point me to some reading materials?
18:34:59 <strcat> the FAQ, build guide and GrapheneOS GitHub organization
18:35:10 <BugHunter1000> i'll start reading thanks
18:36:02 <BugHunter1000> anupritaisno1[m], is this the project you're talking about? https://github.com/GlassROM/glassrom-landing
18:36:35 <strcat[m]> we make a specialized kernel for each device with only the required modules and with dynamic kernel modules disabled to provide the best possible Control Flow Integrity (CFI) granularity and minimal attack surface
18:36:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> BugHunter1000: yes, you'd need that if your tablet doesn't have AOSP build support
18:36:46 <strcat[m]> and that remains the case across devices where more generic kernels are available
18:37:06 <strcat[m]> for example we use different kernels on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL - stock Android uses the same build for both
18:37:23 <strcat[m]> and this will remain the case when all devices use a generic base kernel branch
18:37:37 <strcat[m]> and then there's the other device support code
18:37:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> 4,4xl,4a will soon do that too
18:37:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> They just aren't unified yet
18:37:57 <strcat[m]> we provide hardened SELinux policies for the vendor image and everything we build in it has the same hardening improvements in the compiler toolchain
18:38:28 <strcat[m]> when we have a hardware partner to make our own device, the SoC boot chain and all the userspace vendor components would be built with the same hardening
18:38:46 <strcat[m]> since SoC vendors like Qualcomm give you what's needed to do that
18:43:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: wouldn't it be better to get most of our hardening upstream so SoC vendors just pick it up?
18:43:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or is there something more to this
18:55:58 <Tweak> Sorry i closed my browser by accident
18:56:22 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: not everything is wanted by them
18:56:46 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: and device vendors already use their own build options for the SoC vendor code, etc.
18:56:51 <strcat[m]> so I don't really know what you mean
18:57:55 <strcat[m]> we want to have a proper hardware partner where we control these things and can set it all up how we want
18:58:18 <strcat[m]> with our choice of compilation options for the boot chain, our configuration for the eFuses, etc.
18:58:35 <strcat[m]> and we can more aggressively use features like firmware downgrade protection
18:58:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't see how upstreaming these addresses any of this
18:58:55 <strcat[m]>  * anupritaisno1: I don't see how upstreaming something addresses any of this
19:35:18 <BugHunter1000> strcat[m], kernel minification is a hobby of mine
19:35:33 <BugHunter1000> i am very passionate about uncomplicating software and minimal surfaces
19:35:42 <BugHunter1000> in other words: good on you :)
19:43:58 <hypokeimenon[m]> <BugHunter1000 "strcat, kernel minification is a"> Do you perhaps know a bit about microkernels?
19:53:03 <BugHunter1000> hypokeimenon[m], i'm really interested and so far i understand monolithic design in linux has a pretty good "shopping list" approach, i'm playing with gentoo at the moment - what systems do you find you like for microkernels though?
19:55:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> Oh, I was just hoping to ask whether you thought any of the ones already deep in development were likely to be usable and available to the general populace soon/now
20:19:50 <BugHunter1000> no i suck at computers
20:20:14 <BugHunter1000> hypokeimenon[m], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Microkernels
20:20:41 <BugHunter1000> symbian is sort of supported by things

20:27:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> I wonder what it would take to make multiple models of phone appear to have the same fingerprint.
20:36:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> For example, purely theoretically, what if all GrapheneOS devices appeared to be one particular model of stock Pixel? I don't know if that's even possible, but it's an interesting thought because it makes GOS devices harder to tell apart from one another.
20:37:33 <cyborgninjaneer[> The main benefit would be the ability to mimmick the most common device out of all supported devices.
20:39:02 <cyborgninjaneer[> This may not have any merit beyond a thought experiment though, due to the difficulty of doing something like that.
20:47:58 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: but they have a different SoC including a different CPU, GPU, etc. and different screen sizes
20:48:01 <strcat[m]> so how would that work?
20:55:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's what I'm wondering. There's presently no way to do that, so it would require innovation.
20:55:49 <cyborgninjaneer[> Probably with significant tradeoffs
20:57:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> I assume you'd have to slow the browser down slightly on the faster devices and "mail-slot" the resolution to make them act identical to one another.
20:57:48 <cyborgninjaneer[> Granted, that would only have to affect the browser, but still a significant tradeoff
20:58:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> I also assume there are additional challenges I'm not aware of.
21:01:15 <cyborgninjaneer[> I think Tor browser did something with mail-slotting screen res, so that's not necessarily new, but the other aspects would be pretty complicated. I'm not sure how you'd be able to come up with a robust solution unless you could fully emulate a specific device. Clearly that won't work well. Too much overhead for some devices to emulate others that are close in performance.
21:01:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> My guess is you'd need some real innovation in efficient imitation of other hardware.
21:02:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> Otherwise it's just going to hit low hanging fruit and leave devices open to performance based fingerprinting.
21:04:11 <cyborgninjaneer[> The other question (and perhaps the real purpose of the thought experiment) is whether or not this would significantly improve privacy for GOS users.
21:59:10 <steppingonyou[m]> Hi running into issue building sunfish kernel on debian system error while loading shared library "libcrypto-host.so" cannot open shared library
21:59:53 <strcat[m]> the kernel?
21:59:55 <strcat[m]> or the OS
22:00:02 <steppingonyou[m]> kernel
22:01:16 <steppingonyou[m]> on deb stretch fwiw
22:04:01 <strcat[m]> quite old
22:06:29 <steppingonyou[m]> cant lunch either transferring to a buster machine
22:07:25 <steppingonyou[m]> i see libcrypto-host.so in the out/ of a vanilla aosp build, kind of  a chickenegg type problem?
22:23:58 <Adam17761A> Hi
22:24:03 <Adam17761A> Id like to reccomend a feature for Graphene OS
22:24:10 <Adam17761A> Id like to reccomend a 3G Only mode
22:24:20 <Adam17761A> Since some cellular providors dont have LTE-calls
22:24:38 <Adam17761A> a 3G only mode would still avoid connecting to 2G-Imsi Catchers, and allow calls and texts via CDMA 3g Network
22:24:43 <Adam17761A> So, Please also create a 3G only mode
22:24:48 <Adam17761A> Avoiding 2G is the main objective
22:24:59 <haterade[m]> there is an lte only mode
22:25:13 <Adam17761A> Yes
22:25:19 <Adam17761A> Im also requesting a 3G only mode
22:25:21 <Adam17761A> In addiition
22:36:33 <joehandcockandja> No
22:36:36 <joehandcockandja> Hey anyone know when the update for today is likely to be on the main site?
23:29:30 <strcat[m]> soon
23:29:43 <strcat[m]> delta updates aren't generated yet
