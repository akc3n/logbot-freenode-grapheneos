00:00:10 <jiibus[m]>  * So with FAT32 having a file size limit of 4GB, is it possible that the seed vault backup size could exceed that?
00:02:07 <strcat[m]> jiibus: it's not a single file
00:02:29 <jiibus[m]> Oh duh, that makes sense. For some reason I was envisioning a single archive
00:02:55 <strcat[m]> it might make sense to design it differently than it is but atm it's a bunch of files
00:03:16 <strcat[m]> it's a good initial proof of concept
00:04:05 <jiibus[m]> Yea I like it for sure. How do ADB backups compare? I'm just thinking about having an off-phone back up just in case
00:06:35 <jiibus[m]> Though I could just as easily buy a dedicated USB for backups
00:06:52 <jiibus[m]>  * Though I could just as easily buy a dedicated USB for backups. but I worry about losing that lol.
00:09:47 <strcat> jiibus[m]: adb backups uses the same underlying infrastructure
00:10:06 <strcat> seedvault currently only backs up apps btw not your profile's home directory
00:10:08 <strcat> worth noting that
00:10:18 <strcat> adb backup has a way to include that as an option
00:10:19 <jiibus[m]> Ah, good to know

02:54:05 <strcat> I only have matrix because I have to manage stuff on matrix
02:54:07 <strcat> for the channel
02:54:16 <strcat> I'm in a single matrix channel - the one for this irc channel
02:55:42 <jknsec[m]> Yeah, true.

04:08:56 <qyo3462572445[m]> Signal is based in the US, briar is cool, but pretty useless considering it's android only.
04:13:43 <jknsec[m]> Limited, not useless. Signal is also the standard for encrypted messaging and has been proven to be reliable. Being based in the US kind of sucks but it's still good for the majority of use cases.
04:17:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's difficult for the US to attack Signal in a meaningful way without straight up mandating a back door.
04:18:15 <cyborgninjaneer[> For everyday users, it's quite sufficient.
04:18:19 <jknsec[m]> ^
04:18:47 <jknsec[m]> That was the goal of the EARN IT Act but that's stalled a bit.
04:19:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> Session is an interesting innovation nonetheless. It remains to be seen how good it will be in the future. I'm not sure what the situation is with it being based in Australia.

04:41:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> There's no way to have a backdoor, yet still have a secure system that is resistant to abuse. The keys to the backdoor have to be kept somewhere, and the potential for abuse is high even if the backdoor itself contains no CVEs. (And it inevitability will contain CVEs which by law cannot be fixed. I know bureaucracy.)
04:42:18 <cyborgninjaneer[> Backdoored encryption is useless.
04:42:34 <icy-sprite[m]> Wouldn't backdooring encryption hurt the people who want to backdoor it too if they want to encrypt shit
04:42:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yes
04:42:57 <jknsec[m]> Well they won't use the backdoored services
04:43:19 <travankor_> IIRC encryption is still considered “military technology” in America
04:43:45 <travankor_> so there’s arms restrictions and legislation banning it from export
04:43:59 <jknsec[m]> The US military for example has its own communication network.

04:54:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> Basically secret warrants that aren't really warrants because they violate due process.
04:54:48 <jknsec[m]> However it is important to note that those who gain power do not often let go of it easily. Much of what they do has been moved around, outsourced, etc. and many "transparency" reports and disclosures are theater in order to appease law makers.
04:54:50 <cyborgninjaneer[> They had a purpose at one point, but have been abused.
04:56:28 <cyborgninjaneer[> IIRC, NSLs are part of FISA and the evidence soon will not be admissible in court against US citizens.
04:57:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> Could be wrong about that. I'm too sleepy to double check. Feel free to check and post your findings.
04:57:34 <jknsec[m]> A company is perfectly allowed to surveil and monitor those who use their product as long as the add a little provision "by continuing to use our services, you consent to" etc. etc. and it's perfectly legal. PRISM is still a thing. Five Eyes is still a thing.
04:59:17 <cyborgninjaneer[> Corporate surveillance can be countered more readily than a global passive adversary. They just want money. PRISM is just another customer, whether they pay in cash or political favor.
04:59:49 <jknsec[m]> The laws that govern what a government can do do not apply to corporations in the same way. Why surveil US citizens yourself when you can just have private corps do for you
05:01:34 <cyborgninjaneer[> In the same thread, monetary motivation has limits, so resources used for tracking have limits too. Remember the discussion about using DNS or block lists to fingerprint users? It's more trouble than it's worth.

09:45:53 <cn3m[m]> Something WiFi based is the best
09:46:38 <cn3m[m]> USB would have to be the worst architecturally imo
09:49:15 <cn3m[m]> For example on my iPad I bought the Magic Keyboard for the interface that was a security choice (beside it being awesome)
10:36:36 <randolf[m]> is anyone able to install this app on their phone?
10:36:36 <randolf[m]> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.barclays.android.barclaysmobilebanking&hl=en_GB
10:37:53 <the0[m]> It will fail SafetyNet attestation
10:37:54 <the0[m]> there's some magisk modules that are designed specifically for banking apps
10:37:57 <the0[m]> but it's a cat and mouse game
10:38:14 <randolf[m]> how do you know it'll fail?
10:38:33 <the0[m]> because i know barclays apps refuse to run if they think the device is rooted
10:38:54 <randolf[m]> Magisk requires rooting right? I don't really want to root the device just for one app
10:39:17 <the0[m]> It does yeah, there's an app that'll let you check your safetynet status, sec
10:39:33 <the0[m]> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.freeandroidtools.safetynettest&hl=en
10:39:34 <the0[m]> this one perhaps
10:39:44 <randolf[m]> thanks, I'll take a look
10:40:03 <the0[m]> it could be something like your bootloader is unlocked
10:40:59 <randolf[m]> the problem is with this COVID thing going on, I have to stand in a queue for 40 mins every week just to get paid. But the app lets me submit the checks directly there, so I was hoping to throw it into Shelter and just use that to save time
10:41:08 <randolf[m]> My bootloader is locked, that much I know
10:43:49 <randolf[m]> I failed on (Google play services missing)
10:44:27 <randolf[m]> the only thing I can think of to solve that would be MicroG? but as Daniel said that would lower the security of my device significantly, which I don't want to do.
10:44:31 <the0[m]> ah.
10:44:45 <the0[m]> Yeah I wouldn't install that
10:44:52 <randolf[m]> so I guess I'll just wait in line every week 😅
10:45:02 <randolf[m]> it's not the end of the world at least
10:47:46 <randolf[m]> I also have one last question. How "stable" is the Pixel4 build?
10:48:08 <madaidan[m]> It's called experimental for a reason
10:48:43 <randolf[m]> I have one laying around, I actually downgraded to a pixel3 just so I could use Graphene, but if it's tolerable I'd want to move to it and help submit bugs etc
10:49:22 <the0[m]> :(
10:49:26 <the0[m]> Wear a mask for sure
10:49:51 <randolf[m]> I already do, it's a work requirement anyway.
10:53:04 <cn3m[m]> <randolf[m] "the only thing I can think of to"> You can install the microG app safely on GrapheneOS, but it almost never does what you want it to without dangerous signature spoofing. It works for Google Camera. It breaks Reddit and Discord so YMMV
10:54:41 <randolf[m]> yeah I probably won't risk it
10:54:51 <randolf[m]> I'll just live without the app
10:57:21 <jknsec[m]> One day GOS will be able to natively fake some stuff related to Google and improve app compatibility by pretending that Google no longer exists and that its servers are offline.
10:58:43 <jknsec[m]> But you know
11:01:03 <jknsec[m]> Still waiting for my improved gallery, camera app, calendar, and app store that includes updates for core system apps and Signal for some reason and that's it.
11:04:52 <jknsec[m]> Then again in all seriousness if that aspect of the project ever picked up I'm sure OWS would be happy to cooperate. Of course we need app devs and os security is much more important.
11:05:16 <cn3m[m]> <jknsec[m] "Still waiting for my improved ga"> Use the Simple apps and install Signal from their webpage
11:06:31 <jknsec[m]> I have Signal, use Etar, Open Camera, and Simple Gallery.
11:10:26 <jknsec[m]> One day that functionality can be included directly with the system and that process won't be necessary. Plus already signed versions of Signal and other highly used apps? Fuck.
11:11:09 <jknsec[m]> One day
11:13:13 <Alsatai[m]> <randolf[m] "yeah I probably won't risk it"> If you block all access of the microg core app it should be fine.. Also block gcam or whatever you are installing from accessing internet

11:41:00 <cn3m[m]> <frenchieisverige "Still better than anything?"> Depends
11:41:06 <cn3m[m]> Do you use apps you wouldn't if you didn't have a blocker?
11:41:21 <cn3m[m]> If the blocker changes your behavior ever that means it actively harmful
11:43:47 <cn3m[m]> In the case of a firewall (even GrapheneOS's option which is best) app firewalls are actively harmful as they give a false sense of privacy. The less you change with a system and the more you rely on your OS provider services the better
11:44:49 <cn3m[m]> Generally trying to constraint a trusted app more than the OS allows is generally bad
11:47:12 <randolf[m]> Pihole works as a DNS provider though, so it's actually on a network level?

14:10:19 <Cyrinux[m]> <aragorndr[m] "https://www.reddit.com/r/Graphen"> It works
14:18:39 <MysteriousWizard> Is there like a project that improves the AOSP apps?
14:18:49 <MysteriousWizard> Google really have abandoned them
14:19:31 <MysteriousWizard> Also boys, what's new about the not legacy build? I'm on a Pixel 2 XL so I can't test it lol
14:23:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> Legacy means it soon will not be updated anymore.
14:26:33 <MysteriousWizard> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Legacy means it soon will not be"> Oh no I get that, and honestly it's no loss to me
14:26:39 <MysteriousWizard> I'm just wondering what's so cool about the new build
14:27:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> Its the same.
14:28:31 <fomijafi[m]> Does anyone know if its possible to use fingerprint unlock for apps but to disable for screen lock
14:29:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> You can definitely use lockdown mode to shut off biometrics on the lock screen. Beyond that, not sure
14:29:31 <fomijafi[m]> I would like to use a pin code on the lock screen but fingerprint for my keepass database
14:29:34 <cyborgninjaneer[> I haven't tried it
14:29:54 <cyborgninjaneer[> If anything, I'd do that the other way around
14:30:07 <fomijafi[m]> Right I have that enabled but it turns off lockdown mode the next time you unlock
14:30:48 <fomijafi[m]> Well I don't want to be able to be forced to use my fingerprint to open to phone but I want the convenience of not having to type my long keepass password
14:33:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> Does keepass let you use a shorter pub?
14:33:31 <cyborgninjaneer[> PIN? *
14:35:32 <fomijafi[m]> Not that I can see, advanced unlock settings only show fingerprint
14:44:16 <AdventureCommuni> <fomijafi[m] "I would like to use a pin code o"> Yeah this is something I wanted as well
14:44:16 <AdventureCommuni> Though I use Bitwarden so I can just set a different pin for it too
14:45:15 <fomijafi[m]> Do you self host bitwarden?
14:47:54 <httplov3craft[m]> Use tasker or automate with a workflow to lock the screen and you'll have to enter the pin or password next time you unlock even with biometrics enabled.
14:49:07 <fomijafi[m]> Interesting, thanks for the tip
14:56:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> Does tasker use the device's actual lock screen or is it something weird? That sounds like a potential security risk
14:57:41 <httplov3craft[m]> Actual lock screen. It just triggers a lock for you
15:00:52 <httplov3craft[m]> Just checked, and you can check "is device unlocked" on state changed, and if "no" indicating the screen is already locked you can trigger a lock event which will put the device into "Device locked by admin" state which requires pin or password to open.
15:01:14 <httplov3craft[m]> * Just checked, and you can check "is device unlocked" on state changed, and if "no" indicating the screen is already locked you can trigger a lock event which will put the device into "Device locked by admin" state which requires pin or password to open.
15:02:13 <httplov3craft[m]> So basically use your power button as normal, and functionally disable bio on lock screen, but leave it available to apps once unlocked

15:04:33 <httplov3craft[m]> Here is what it looks like in Automate. Only permission required is "lock device and monitor failed lock attempts"
15:55:57 <thelearner[m]> Different coloured screens in the auditor app when audited, what do they all mean? Thank you.
16:00:40 <faxing[m]> Is there any way to have my Pixel 3a running GrapheneOS erase all of the data on the device after a certain number of failed passcode attempts like you can do on an iPhone?
16:03:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> faxing: an implementation by Qualcomm did exist
16:04:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> That did destruction in hardware
16:04:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's also apps that can use device admin to do so
16:12:17 <faxing[m]> What do you mean there's an implementation by Qualcomm?
16:12:53 <faxing[m]> Also I couldn't find any 3rd party apps on F-Droid that would offer than functionality without rooting the device
16:26:02 <MysteriousWizard> <AdventureCommuni "Though I use Bitwarden so I can "> You use the F-Droid version, right?
16:32:39 <strcat[m]> faxing: it's implemented by the OS
16:32:44 <AdventureCommuni> Yeah, why?
16:32:48 <strcat[m]> it's just not exposed in the Settings app ATM because no one has implemented that
16:33:29 <strcat[m]> the throttling on failed attempts (exponentially jumps up to 1 day) is hardware-based
16:33:57 <AdventureCommuni> Though Im pretty sure fdroid bitwarden is exactly the same as aurora bitwarden
16:43:56 <faxing[m]> How many attempts until the data is deleted then?
16:44:09 <faxing[m]> Since it sounds like its just forced in the OS
16:46:13 <strcat[m]> as I said there's hardware-based throttling that's always enabled
16:46:21 <httplov3craft[m]> You misunderstand. The Titan chip regulates the max number of times authentication can be attempted in a given timeframe. There is no autodelete, just throttling
16:46:21 <strcat[m]> exponentially jumps up to 1 day very fast
16:46:36 <strcat[m]> there is an OS setting for wiping after N attempts
16:46:47 <strcat[m]> but it's not exposed in the Settings UI ATM because no one has implemented that
16:46:52 <strcat[m]> it's already provided by AOSP though
16:47:09 <strcat[m]> I think they just deemed it a bad idea for regular users so it's only available to device managers
16:48:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW
16:48:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> What happens if you hit said limit?
16:48:52 <strcat[m]> which
16:48:56 <strcat[m]> the OS wipe limit? it wipes
16:49:05 <strcat[m]> as I said thought it's not exposed in Settings by default
16:49:14 <strcat[m]> but can be used by device managers
16:49:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> The throttle limit
16:59:37 <MysteriousWizard> <AdventureCommuni "Yeah, why?"> Ahh, that's fine then. The Google Play version has some nasty proprietary analytics embedded.
16:59:43 <MysteriousWizard> <AdventureCommuni "Though Im pretty sure fdroid bit"> Nope.

17:38:27 <animalchin[m]> I have another ignorant question. I just switched over from iPhone after reading about GOS. Amazed i t was so easy to put on this 3a as I've never used shell or even opened a bootloader before. Thanks and I will be donating to the cause. My question is, what's up with screenshots on Android. Everything is blocked. On iPhone I could SS all day. Is there a way to by pace the screenshot copyright block on web pages?
17:39:13 <animalchin[m]> Bypass
17:40:56 <cn3m[m]> What apps are you using? Many have a setting to block screenshots
17:41:46 <thelearner[m]> Different coloured screens in the auditor app when audited, what do they all mean? Thank you.
17:45:39 <animalchin[m]> I have open camera
17:48:15 <animalchin[m]> I didn't think open camera was involved with the screenshot. Am I mistaken? I thought it was the pixel hardware
17:48:46 <animalchin[m]> Software
18:04:35 <animalchin[m]> If you meant browser app its Vanadium
18:11:01 <nowbody[m]> If screenshots are generally disabled on Graphene OS, it is good thing
18:11:22 <cn3m[m]> nowbody: it's not and it's not a good thing
18:11:30 <animalchin[m]> Does that open a door?
18:11:55 <nowbody[m]> It would protect against specific Trojans
18:12:21 <animalchin[m]> Sweet! I didn't know that
18:12:22 <nowbody[m]> Which are after your encrypted messages for example
18:13:07 <cn3m[m]> <nowbody[m] "It would protect against specifi"> If you have an app that can take arbitrary screenshots you have bigger problems since Android 9
18:13:15 <animalchin[m]> Ahh. Screenshots can go in the toilet then
18:13:24 <cn3m[m]> Screenshots are not harmful
18:13:31 <MysteriousWizard> I use screenshots all the time...
18:13:35 <animalchin[m]> Confused
18:14:16 <animalchin[m]> If they're not bad can I unblock them on my browser?
18:14:38 <animalchin[m]> If not no worries
18:14:43 <MysteriousWizard> You can, but it's up to you I guess
18:15:39 <animalchin[m]> Does taking screenshots on a browser open up unnecessary risks?
18:16:23 <httplov3craft[m]> Screenshots are bad. As is the ability of one application to monitor the display output of another. Convenient, yes; Good, not from an operational security standpoint.
18:17:15 <strcat[m]> animalchin: GrapheneOS does not block screenshots
18:17:22 <the0[m]> strcat: you never responded to my blahaj pictures
18:18:09 <nowbody[m]> Same opinion. Some malware's do screenshots every minute or every second if they can not grab the keyboard directly
18:18:16 <animalchin[m]> I can't take screenshots on the browser. Maybe its a setting I changed
18:18:19 <strcat[m]> apps can choose to disable screenshots and showing content in recent apps if they want to make it hard to accidentally leak it
18:18:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hey I need to really get in touch with jollyroger
18:18:27 <strcat[m]> animalchin: which browser
18:18:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Did he share his gpg clearsigned contact with anyone?
18:18:47 <animalchin[m]> Vanadium
18:19:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please pm me
18:19:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you have it
18:19:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's really urgent
18:19:26 <strcat[m]> animalchin: Chromium disables screenshots in Incognito mode by default
18:20:04 <animalchin[m]> strcat:  that's it. Thank  you
18:21:16 <strcat[m]> you can disable it
18:22:51 <strcat[m]> but not via a simple setting toggle, it's basically a developer option
18:22:58 <strcat[m]> which is quite annoying to enable
18:23:11 <strcat[m]> you have to use adb
18:23:29 <strcat[m]> just part of what incognito means - it stops having a persistent history / cache, etc. including screenshots
18:23:41 <strcat[m]> since a screenshot is saved to storage
18:23:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: ims registration works for you?
18:23:57 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: haven't tried
18:24:19 <animalchin[m]> httplov3craft:  That's good to know. I figured a screen shot was just an image of the screen and didn't intertwine with the browser or other app. Learn something new everyday on here
18:24:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please check in *#*#4636#*#* > phone information > 3  dot menu > ims service status strcat
18:24:59 <strcat[m]> animalchin: apps can choose to disable it, it can be bypassed if the app is debuggable
18:25:17 <animalchin[m]> strcat:  that makes perfect sense
18:25:20 <strcat[m]> so for example in Signal disabling screenshots is a preference
18:25:46 <strcat[m]> and using the incognito keyboard mode is a preference (not support by the AOSP keyboard - we just have it stateless by default anyways)
18:25:51 <strcat[m]>  * and using the incognito keyboard mode is a preference (not supported by the AOSP keyboard - we just have it stateless by default anyways)
18:25:55 <animalchin[m]> strcat: so depending on what you want protected
18:25:58 <animalchin[m]> ?
18:26:16 <strcat[m]> Chromium uses the incognito keyboard mode and disables screenshots in Incognito mode
18:26:24 <strcat[m]> it does more than just changing how the app itself behaves
18:26:45 <strcat[m]> so for example incognito pages won't show up when viewing the app in recent apps
18:26:53 <strcat[m]> try opening a regular tab, look at recent apps with that selected
18:26:58 <strcat[m]> then open an incognito tab and look at recent apps
18:27:10 <strcat[m]> that's the same feature which disables screenshots
18:27:27 <strcat[m]> it disables the OS creating persistent images based off that app view
18:27:55 <strcat[m]> if we wanted we could add control over it in the OS but meh
18:28:02 <strcat[m]> doesn't seem worth the trouble
18:28:27 <animalchin[m]> Totally not worth the trouble
18:28:37 <animalchin[m]> Great explanation
18:28:43 <animalchin[m]> Thanks again
18:28:50 <animalchin[m]> Love this OS
18:29:28 <nowbody[m]> <strcat[m] "doesn't seem worth the trouble"> It is worth the trouble, because Trojans do screenshots for accessing otherwise secure end2end commucation
18:29:28 <strcat[m]> the Android feature lets an app mark a screen 'secure' so that the OS doesn't make persistent images of it basically
18:29:34 <strcat[m]> recent apps, screenshots, other things
18:29:48 <strcat[m]> nowbody: I don't think it's relevant to that
18:30:49 <strcat[m]> if you go out of the way to install an app providing an accessibility service and go into the accessibility settings and enable it as one
18:31:18 <strcat[m]> this doesn't make a difference
18:31:36 <strcat[m]> and I'm not sure how else an app would capture the screen other than explicitly starting screen recording
18:33:37 <AdventureCommuni> What are the benefits of Vanadium compared to Bromite?
18:34:55 <strcat[m]> explained in the usage guide
18:35:32 <AdventureCommuni> I will take a look thanks
18:44:27 <animalchin[m]> Lots of great info
18:52:53 <defconanon12[m]> Who uses Arch Linux here? Is Arch good to get into if I want to get into dev work and security? I want to put Arch on one of my laptops.
18:55:17 <cyborgninjaneer[> Idk about security but it's a good way to teach yourself about the inner workings of systemd distros. You have to set everything up manually.
18:55:32 <cyborgninjaneer[> Arch is the "do everything yourself" distro
18:55:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's as secure as you know how to make it.
18:58:22 <AdventureCommuni> If youve never used it before you might want to try something like Manjaro or Endeavor
18:58:29 <AdventureCommuni> makes it easier to start off
19:13:58 <animalchin[m]> Not that its that important but has anyone noticed a difference in battery consumption regarding Vanadium and Bromite?
19:15:11 <defconanon12[m]> Adventure Communist: I was thinking of Manjaro KDE. I know Linux a good bit and quite enjoy it.
19:16:43 <joshman[m]> <defconanon12[m] "Adventure Communist: I was think"> My daily driver. PITA to use with an external HiDPI display
19:17:52 <AdventureCommuni> Manjaro KDE is probably one of my favorite setups
19:17:59 <AdventureCommuni> Looks good, more stable than arch, still have access to the AUR
19:18:05 <cn3m[m]> Manjaro has a terrible update script and has update delays. Linux is already bad for security, but Manjaro is Debian levels of bad
19:18:35 <cn3m[m]> Use Fedora or Arch. If you can't go with Windows, macOS, or ChromeOS
19:18:57 <AdventureCommuni> lol
19:20:12 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: Well I know Debian can be bad but I didn't know Arch Manjaro KDE edition is bad.
19:20:27 <defconanon12[m]> On a security standpoint.
19:20:33 <joshman[m]> Update delays is a feature. Unfortunately.
19:20:41 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon12[m] "cn3m: Well I know Debian can be "> Yeah use Fedora KDE would be my recommendation in leui
19:20:54 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "Yeah use Fedora KDE would be my "> Fedora's Chromium package is still on version 81

19:21:59 <joshman[m]> 10 LTSB prolly better
19:22:24 <cn3m[m]> I use regular Enterprise since the Sandbox is awesome

19:23:42 <defconanon12[m]> Enterprise is very nice so far. I enjoy it.

19:25:50 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: I was actually going to put Arch on Chromebook. Think of VM booting. Is that wise? Or I can use Fedora KDE. I just want a Linux distro to play around with for security, privacy, and dev work.
19:26:08 <cn3m[m]> defconanon12: if you have a Chromebook use ChromeOS
19:26:31 <cn3m[m]> It's a reasonable OS as far as sandboxing, privacy, verified boot, and the rest
19:27:13 <EssentialChaos[m> > It's a reasonable OS as far as sandboxing, privacy, verified boot, and the rest
19:27:13 <EssentialChaos[m> And it has Crostini for Linux apps
19:27:24 <cn3m[m]> Yes and Android apps support in a container
19:27:35 <cn3m[m]> There's very little I can't do and can't do well
19:27:51 <cn3m[m]> It*
19:28:40 <cn3m[m]> ChromeOS and macOS are definitely the closest to secure and private out of the box for the desktop. I wouldn't load anything else on a device with native support for verified boot much like I wouldn't put lineage on my Pixel
19:28:43 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: Well I know ChromeOS is Linux so it will be redundant to have another one on there?
19:29:32 <cn3m[m]> <defconanon12[m] "cn3m: Well I know ChromeOS is Li"> Yeah just roll with stock you're good
19:29:46 <EssentialChaos[m> > secure and private out of the box for the desktop
19:29:46 <EssentialChaos[m> cn3m Is ChromeOS private out of the box, though?
19:30:23 <cn3m[m]> EssentialChaos: just some minor tweaks needed all the invasive bits are opt out and even open source
19:30:43 <defconanon12[m]> Yeah ChromeOS is really nice.
19:30:53 <cn3m[m]> Android on it is likely invasive, but yeah please don't destroy your security model for no good reason
19:32:31 <cn3m[m]> ChromeOS and macOS are the only devices you can buy and expect good out of the box sandboxing and reasonable verified boot. Neither are perfect, but they are actively trying unlike Linux Desktop
19:33:22 <cn3m[m]> Windows generally you need to be more careful what you buy and how you set it up for security. GNU/Linux is a lost cause on the desktop

19:45:27 <cn3m[m]> Pixelbook, MacBook, or Surface Secured Core are the way too go right now
19:46:07 <joshman[m]> Why even so many distros exist and actively get developed if security is a lost cause with Linux..
19:46:38 <cn3m[m]> That's actually offering you something security and usability wise for your money
19:46:38 <joshman[m]> <cn3m[m] "Pixelbook, MacBook, or Surface S"> Arm Macs will lead this soon
19:47:33 <cn3m[m]> Yes, but Windows 10 S on a Secured Core Surface Pro X is pretty awesome
19:48:07 <cn3m[m]> Privacy and usability is crap compared to the Arm MacBook though
19:49:50 <defconanon12[m]> anupritaisno1: What terrible customer service. Yeah wipe the partition like what Adventure Communist is saying.

19:54:40 <sivuda1[m]> * I wonder as well. Why? cn3m
19:56:06 <cn3m[m]> <sivuda1[m] "I wonder as well. Why? cn3m "> People working on Linux care about performance and compatibility. Security is not a focus. That wouldn't effect the number of distros
20:02:09 <cn3m[m]> Google is the only large contributor that takes Linux security seriously and they are constantly getting pushback. ChromeOS and Android are the only system that could be considered competitive security wise. That's after a tremendous amount of work.
20:02:10 <cn3m[m]> Grsecurity and GrapheneOS keep pushing forward for their smaller audiences. Linux scoffs at this with
20:02:11 <cn3m[m]> Work*
20:03:34 <CWO[m]> As far as the standard distros go only fedora/RHEL puts a significant amount of effort into security out of the box but it's still behind windows and macOS
20:04:24 <CWO[m]> Linux desktop hasn't yet seen its security reckoning like microsoft did 20 years ago that encouraged them to start getting serious
20:04:50 <cn3m[m]> I wouldn't call it significant, but yes RedHat deserves credit for their efforts no matter how small they truly lead the pack
20:04:55 <CWO[m]> So very few people recognise it as an issue
20:08:12 <cn3m[m]> It's so bad I got downvoted to the point a comment was hidden on PTIO for saying Linux security was over a decade behind. Which is pretty generous if you ask me
20:09:39 <EssentialChaos[m> I just thought about someone making a kind of PoC by putting a deniable vulnerability into a popular Linux software, but then realized, that it would only lead people to believe that Debian is secure, because it wouldn't get the update in time

20:18:27 <defconanon12[m]> Even if it is middle ground.
20:19:42 <defconanon12[m]> cn3m: Huh so that is why it can be easy to crack databases.
20:20:54 <defconanon12[m]> So most distros just have a lot of vulnerabilities that you can easily break it down?
20:21:55 <CWO[m]> <defconanon12[m] "So most distros just have a lot "> There are probably tons of undiscovered ones because few people look at desktop linux
20:21:59 <cn3m[m]> It starts getting really complicated comparing distros especially for server
20:22:02 <CWO[m]> And there are few mitigations
20:22:16 <cn3m[m]> If you have to trust one Linux provider it's going to be Fedora or Arch

20:27:54 <defconanon12[m]> So in the end people that use Linux security is not the main priority or not at all?

20:30:00 <CWO[m]> From a usability perspective I find linux less annoying and I'm more familiar with it
20:30:25 <CWO[m]> But I would recommend windows 2004 over it to most people
20:30:37 <cn3m[m]> macOS was great when I was on that
20:32:28 <defconanon12[m]> I like the idea of Linux and don't mind working with a CLI. I would prefer GUI and working with CLI in the background. I never really hardened a Linux distro besides Tails. Minor tweaks for Tails.
20:33:08 <AdventureCommuni> I think whonix works on windows too
20:33:42 <AdventureCommuni> If you wanted to try linux more
20:33:51 <defconanon12[m]> Whonix plus Tor browser bundle is the way to go. From what I am told.
20:33:56 <madaidan[m]> Whonix runs in a VM so the host OS doesn't matter.
20:34:01 <defconanon12[m]> I never used Whonix.
20:34:28 <radixed9[m]> If only Whonix supported Hyper-V I would use it
20:34:41 <defconanon12[m]> I think the Host OS still matters in case of hyperjacking. That is just my opinion.
20:34:48 <frenchieisverige> What about kubes os
20:35:14 <defconanon12[m]> Xen is not up to par. If I remember right?
20:36:00 <cn3m[m]> Qubes has insecure guests too much update trust in Fedora repos for dom0 and Xen isn't amazing
20:36:24 <cn3m[m]> It's better than most Linux setups

21:00:27 <cn3m[m]> Somewhat
21:00:31 <nickcalyx[m]> Granted, I haven't tried qubes in a while but when i did, it was too cumbersome. You couldn't really copy and paste between things
21:00:59 <nickcalyx[m]> I could see that it was going to make everything I do harder
21:01:51 <nickcalyx[m]> not that all I do is sitting around copying and pasting all day :)
21:03:26 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Granted, I haven't tried qubes i"> It's just an extra step too
21:03:48 <twitx[m]> I kinda wonder would using an older Version of Qubes like 3.2 still be more secure then using Debian because Qubes then has missing security updates wouldn't it?
21:04:58 <cn3m[m]> <twitx[m] "I kinda wonder would using an ol"> Qubes 3.2 is not worth using
21:05:17 <twitx[m]> <cn3m[m] "Qubes 3.2 is not worth using "> Why not?

21:06:02 <cn3m[m]> Too old
21:08:47 <TheJollyRoger> twitx[m]: the thing about software security is that with large and complex projects like an operating system that were never built for security in the first place, the security depends on the developers' ability to mitigate exploits and address bugs in a constantly changing ecosystem.

21:09:47 <TheJollyRoger> Sure, there is stuff like QMail and the reentry program that ran on the Apollo Guidance Computers, but the program running on the Apollo Guidance Computer cost an estimated $100,000 per line of code in 1969.
21:10:48 <TheJollyRoger> So by using old software, you're not gaining any security, you're essentially saying "I'm going to ignore roughly six or seven years of advances in exploits that attackers have made and give them a head start."

21:15:50 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger: Jolly, what do you use? You seem to be an Arch user but I am not sure. I checked the logs and you seem to have a great Arch Linux guide of some sort? I read some of your guides before and let's just say I am a fan lol. I enjoy your writing and you saved me in the past when I was using Tails.
21:17:17 <TheJollyRoger> Hi defconanon12[m], not quite.
21:17:38 <TheJollyRoger> I don't run an x86 computer as my daily driver, I run a POWER9 RaptorCS Talos II.
21:17:52 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, thanks, I'm really flattered to hear you've found my writings handy :)
21:18:17 <TheJollyRoger> I do keep an x86 computer around, for some specific uses, one of which is GrapheneOS, but I run a very large amount of different (and hetrogenous) systems.
21:22:03 <TheJollyRoger> My Talos II runs Gentoo, but the reasoning behind that is actually because back when I first got this computer, there were very very few of them in the wild, and binary release distributions did not support it well at the time. Fortunately, I had a number of friends that were in the same boat, and they were able to hold my hand through the process.
21:22:18 <entos> Hello, I have a question.
21:22:18 <entos> From what I understand, Signal messenger is self-updating if installed from the APK. Is this true for other applications installed via APK?

21:22:57 <cn3m[m]> > From what I understand, Signal messenger is self-updating if installed from the APK. Is this true for other applications installed via APK?
21:22:57 <cn3m[m]> It could be, but usually isn't
21:23:27 <TheJollyRoger> Signal has several different releases: one is for the Play Store App, and one is for the website app. Google Play is VERY particular in that self-updating apps that circumvent Google Play's policy of updating out-of-band will be ejected from the GPlay store.
21:23:43 <entos> <TheJollyRoger "Hi entos, no it will not be."> OK, so to update, would I need to re-download the APK's when made available? Will the applications notify me when there is an update? Thanks
21:24:19 <TheJollyRoger> (There is nothing nefarious about this; not even Google Play can undo the certificate pinning that the apps will do, so this means Google Play cannot do something like ship an update without the author's consent, unless the app authors have specifically requested Google Play take custody of their app)
21:24:31 <TheJollyRoger> entos: the applications will not notify you, you will need to check yourself.
21:25:05 <TheJollyRoger> Signal is one exception to this in that they realized that people were sideloading outside of Google Play Services, and released an official signed and self-updating app for those types as a precautionary measure.
21:25:50 <TheJollyRoger> So most of the time, apps will NOT self update unless they have been specifically written to. Signal's website APK download is one such exception, but it is the only one I know of at this point in time.

21:28:49 <CWO[m]> Moxie didn't want to compromise security
21:28:55 <httplov3craft[m]> <TheJollyRoger "(There is nothing nefarious abou"> Except for apps that Google signs for the developer...
21:29:07 <CWO[m]>  * Moxie didn't want to compromise security but eventually caved
21:29:13 <TheJollyRoger> httplov3craft[m]: yep, that's why I said specifically, that the app authors have to opt into that.
21:29:54 <TheJollyRoger> Although Google now encourages developers to let them sign their apps on their behalf, app authors are given the choice to take matters into their own hands on Google Play rather than rely on a Trusted Third party.
21:30:15 <TheJollyRoger> That's why Moxie, as CWO[m] said, wasn't leaving anything up to chance, and eventually worked this out as a compromise.
21:30:29 <defconanon12[m]> TheJollyRoger: Yeah I knew I read your Talos setup from somewhere. Cause I heard of that word. Gentoo, I heard of it. Arch users fight over Arch and Gentoo users. When I was younger I never thought I would ever talk to the man himself. Glad to see you here. ^^ You taught me why you should worry about bridges more than a VPN.
21:30:45 <httplov3craft[m]> Yeah. So stupid to trust one central authority. I hate that most apps distributed on FDroid are signed by FDroid
21:31:28 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, well... I don't really speak for Gentoo itself. I'm not affiliated with the Gentoo project, I just ended up stuck on Gentoo because it sort of fit my needs best for this particular one machine.
21:32:27 <TheJollyRoger> Although binary release distributions have since gotten much better (Void has their own dedicated PPC64 maintainer, and he's REALLY good and really talented), I'm sort of stuck with this and it works, and I feel like walking away from it would be losing a lot of hard work I've put into it.

21:58:44 <httplov3craft[m]> IMEI spoofing is illegal in many areas... Plus this is a low-level function of the cellular modem chip that might not always be exposed - in fact I'd be surprised if it was.

22:05:28 <worldwideworld[m> only 4 trackers with line but crypto.com has 14 trackers
22:05:42 <worldwideworld[m> is there a way to sandbox it?
22:09:24 <httplov3craft[m]> Why? If you're using centralized crypto wallets, what's the point... Why not use one of the MANY other wallets? They include what they include. If you don't like it, your best option is to avoid it... Anything you do to block it is cat and mouse
22:11:20 <worldwideworld[m> ok fair engouh they just have everything all in one app and there earn and the syndicates are great
22:12:48 <httplov3craft[m]> I mean you could always get a developer device without WiFi or GPS for just these applications and plug it in to a TOR router if its really that serious that you both NEED these apps and NEED to block tracking, but that sounds cumbersome.
22:13:59 <worldwideworld[m> That does sound cumbersome
22:14:03 <httplov3craft[m]> Personally, I use Signal for messaging. But if my threat model required I'd consider Briar, Jami, or Session... I don't crypto these days, but if I did I'd probably only use Monero.
22:14:48 <qyo3462572445[m]> Briar works really well as long as the other person is also on android.
22:15:15 <qyo3462572445[m]> Plus, I kinda really like their blog and forum feature. I think its an interesting take.
22:15:49 <worldwideworld[m> Crypto.com offers better rates than any bank and they have there on bank cards that went down yesterday because of wirex
22:16:36 <worldwideworld[m> Never heard of Briar, Jami or Session
22:17:26 <qyo3462572445[m]> Session is a signal fork (no phone number required ). Briar is a p2p, live only on your device messenger that goes over Tor.
22:17:47 <qyo3462572445[m]> Jami is p2p too if I recall correctly.
22:18:03 <worldwideworld[m> They are on F-droid?
22:18:20 <travankor_> who hosts the session server?
22:18:58 <httplov3craft[m]> Yes, Session, Briar, and Jami are all decentralized except the seed servers
22:20:07 <httplov3craft[m]> Session is questionable to me. Seems like they're trying to create an ecosystem around their own onion and block chain. I think it'll fail at some point, but the code can probably be ported to a proper anion like tor
22:20:24 <httplov3craft[m]> * Session is questionable to me. Seems like they're trying to create an ecosystem around their own onion and block chain. I think it'll fail at some point, but the code can probably be ported to a proper onion like tor
22:21:29 <qyo3462572445[m]> Briar has its own fdroid repository you can add. Jami is on it, and Session just DL their apk from github
22:22:59 <worldwideworld[m> I only installed Graphene yesterday would installing crypto.com make it any more secure  than having it on a regular android phone?

22:24:34 <httplov3craft[m]> All 3 have  varied levels of technical competence required beyond that of a phone number based solution... Only use if you can get enough people on to make it worthwhile. E2EE when not applied globally just casts suspicion on the traffic you put through it. That's why I prefer signal. My threat model doesn't require detachment from my identity, and my communication partners don't have the technical competency for

22:26:53 <bonerdose[m]> When trying to flash Graphene onto my pixel 3a xl, I get an error saying fastboot is out of date, even though I downloaded the latest SDK platform tools from Google.
22:26:53 <bonerdose[m]> Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong here? I extracted both SDK and the factory image, and pasted the contents of the factory image into the extracted 'platform-tools' folder, yet its still telling me that fastboot is out-of-date. The platform-tools zip is version 30.0.3-windows.
22:27:33 <httplov3craft[m]> I don't like its operational model and its code transparency used to be worse. Like Riot, group chats are not E2EE by default, and I don't know anyone than uses it, so why bother
22:28:27 * httplov3craft[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/bWBBuMKMZeCtTcWpElsLhirL >
22:28:58 <worldwideworld[m> <httplov3craft[m] "I don't like its operational mod"> Is it not open sauce?
22:29:38 <httplov3craft[m]> It is now... Most of it. I think there ?might? still be some closed source components
22:30:22 <worldwideworld[m> I thought it was open sauce but goes through a server
22:31:11 <httplov3craft[m]> Haven't been following it. Can't speak with authority one way or the other
22:32:12 <worldwideworld[m> <httplov3craft[m] "> <@bonerdose:matrix.org> When t"> It will be you have more than one all other need to be removed i had to do it yesterday, watching techlore messed me up.
22:32:34 <defconanon12[m]> It is not hard to enable E2EE on Riot. I personally use RiotX.
22:33:39 <worldwideworld[m> Do you know an open sauce cloning app?
22:34:19 <defconanon12[m]> Techlore does mess people up who follow his guide all the way through. Mainly the part where you install third party fastboot.
22:34:31 <qyo3462572445[m]> Ideally I'd like to get more friends onto matrix, since e2ee is pretty standard now and it works cross platform and doesn't have a dumbed down desktop app like signal does.
22:35:06 <worldwideworld[m> yeah running the flashboot through the folder with something that is outdated
22:35:20 <defconanon12[m]> I really enjoy RiotX even if it buggy from time to time. It is based on Kotlin.
22:36:22 <qyo3462572445[m]> Unfortunately its much easier to get people onto a new messaging platform that all they need to do is enter their phone number over a new username and password.
22:36:46 <worldwideworld[m> If he wants to make a video using windows he should use powershell with the correct commands
22:38:04 <defconanon12[m]> In my experience it is better to convince people to switch to Telegram rather than Signal. The problem with Telegram is centralized platform.
22:40:01 <nickcalyx[m]> Signal is.centralized too
22:40:19 <nickcalyx[m]> What makes telegram better
22:40:38 <jneplokh> I'd much rather switch someone over to Signal
22:40:47 <qyo3462572445[m]> I can say honestly I have way more contacts on signal than telegram. Majority I didn't even ask for them to get on signal
22:40:51 <defconanon12[m]> worldwideworld: That is what I noticed he didn't even use Powershell.
22:40:53 <jneplokh> And like telegram, it only requires the number which makes it easy
22:42:04 <worldwideworld[m>  https://signal.org/android/apk/. in the danger zone it is is still centralized?
22:44:32 <defconanon12[m]> Well a 0 day will get you on anything I suppose.
22:44:46 <defconanon12[m]> * Well a 0day will get you on anything I suppose.
22:47:53 <defconanon12[m]> nickcalyx: I know now and I think people are more likely to switch to Telegram cause of Messenger.
22:48:31 <nickcalyx[m]> I don't feel good about those Durov brothers who own Telegram
22:48:47 <defconanon12[m]> How so?
22:50:06 <worldwideworld[m> crypto.com won't open on the os says need to install with the play store is there a work around?
22:50:25 <nickcalyx[m]> I can't say there are specific reasons, they just seem sketchy to me.  I trust Moxie more.   But this could just be some bias of mine.  I don't see the Durov brothers inventing new crypto protocols and giving them away, or helping the big messenger services use strong crypto.  It's a different mindset
22:50:55 <defconanon12[m]> Sounds bias but you do you.
22:51:11 <qyo3462572445[m]> I also think its easier to switch android users onto signal since the app can be used as the default messaging app too.
22:51:26 <defconanon12[m]> I never used Telegram myself but I like the idea behind it.
22:52:24 <nickcalyx[m]> worldwideworld: run 'adb logcat' when you run the app and see exactly where it's going wrong.  then maybe complain to the authors that it's breaking on your OS
22:52:36 <nickcalyx[m]> you can show them the logs
22:52:46 <defconanon12[m]> qyo3462572445: Yeah what about IOS users though?
22:53:26 <worldwideworld[m> <nickcalyx[m] "worldwideworld: run 'adb logcat'"> Okay cheers
22:53:58 <qyo3462572445[m]> Either way, no matter what messaging app iOS uses, it will be different than their default app since Apple won't allow that to be changed  so its 6 of one, half dozen of the other for iOS.
22:53:59 <nickcalyx[m]> maybe they'll fix it.. tell them there are 1.7 million users on lineageOS that don't have google frameworks
22:54:29 <nickcalyx[m]> and you were about to recommend their app to all the lineage people and now you can't because it won't run
22:55:44 <worldwideworld[m> Is there any open sauce cloning apps?
22:56:16 <defconanon12[m]> worldwideworld: Uh Lucky Patcher I think?
22:56:40 <greenmoon[m]> Appcloner have so much interessing features but it's closed source
22:57:02 <worldwideworld[m> <defconanon12[m] "worldwideworld: Uh Lucky Patcher"> not on f-droid is it?
22:57:30 <defconanon12[m]> worldwideworld: No it isn't. You have to get it from the Lucky Patcher site.
22:58:02 <nickcalyx[m]> what does that clone
22:58:22 <defconanon12[m]> I know you can clone just don't know if it is open source.
22:59:25 <worldwideworld[m> on the site now no mention of open sauce
23:00:03 <defconanon12[m]> Clones any APKs. I made backups before using LP incased I screwed up the app itself. You can do all types of stuff with LP. It used to be on Google Play until they removed it.
23:00:32 <worldwideworld[m> there wording is for some 14-16 year old lol
23:00:42 <defconanon12[m]> Lol.
23:00:57 <radixed9[m]> It is not open source and it is primarily a piracy app. Filled with fakes and wants root
23:01:33 <worldwideworld[m> sad reacts for you lol is what is written
23:02:25 <worldwideworld[m> <radixed9[m] "It is not open source and it is "> Do you know any open sauce cloning app?
23:03:40 <defconanon12[m]> radixed9: Fakes what do you mean? If you mean fake patches yeah and it doesn't force root onto you.
23:04:04 <radixed9[m]> defconanon12: fake versions you have to be very careful
23:04:14 <defconanon12[m]> Oh very true.
23:04:19 <radixed9[m]> <worldwideworld[m "Do you know any open sauce cloni"> no, but I would trust AppCloner more than LuckyPatcher
23:04:33 <worldwideworld[m> ok thanks
23:05:18 <mxnorvak[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "worldwideworld: run 'adb logcat'"> Have you done this yourself? I'm interested to know more about why i shouldn't rely on Telegram
23:05:55 <worldwideworld[m> <greenmoon[m] "Appcloner have so much interessi"> There are a few with the same similar names can point to the right one please
23:06:55 <radixed9[m]> https://appcloner.app/ iirc
23:07:03 <worldwideworld[m> <mxnorvak[m] "Have you done this yourself? I'm"> This was not for telegram it was for crypto.com
23:07:06 <httplov3craft[m]> Shelter can let you run 2 instances - one in a regular profile, one in a work profile. They are blocked from seeing each other's data
23:07:27 <worldwideworld[m> <radixed9[m] "https://appcloner.app/ iirc"> Great thanks
23:07:48 <mxnorvak[m]> <worldwideworld[m "This was not for telegram it was"> Oh sry!
23:09:07 <worldwideworld[m> <mxnorvak[m] "Oh sry!"> Telegram is in F-droid
23:10:00 <nickcalyx[m]> > Have you done this yourself?
23:10:00 <nickcalyx[m]> Run adb logcat to see why an app is breaking? Sure
23:10:34 <worldwideworld[m> <worldwideworld[m "Great thanks"> Just installed it I remember this app am i correct that it got removed from the play store?
23:10:44 <radixed9[m]> Yes
23:11:31 <nickcalyx[m]> Those sound super sketchy
23:11:59 * worldwideworld[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/bCUAOuMOCGPlAZsSHirkeTZq >
23:12:35 <worldwideworld[m> <nickcalyx[m] "Those sound super sketchy"> It was not removed because of that
23:13:11 <worldwideworld[m>  * Can this be done from the phone or command from the PC?
23:13:39 <radixed9[m]> I never recommended that someone use that. It is a substantially better than LP
23:14:52 <defconanon12[m]> Does anyone know if LP uses a Google API still even though they are taken off the Google Play Store?
23:15:06 <defconanon12[m]> * Does anyone know if LP still uses a Google API still even though they are taken off the Google Play Store?
23:16:42 <defconanon12[m]> I have no interest in using it really anymore just curious if that is the case.
23:22:00 <worldwideworld[m> i can only run adb logcat on pc right?
23:25:02 <mxnorvak[m]> <worldwideworld[m "Telegram is in F-droid "> So?
23:26:34 <worldwideworld[m> it has to go through certain tests to show open sauce and secure right?
23:28:45 <mxnorvak[m]> As far as i know an app needs to be open source to be able to be in F-droid, however this does has nothing to do with it being secure
23:29:35 <mxnorvak[m]> *As far as i know an app needs to be open source to be able to be in F-droid, however this has nothing to do with it being secure
23:30:16 <mxnorvak[m]> And no i don't think they check the app to make sure it's secure
23:31:19 <georgeaux[m]> 7hr screentime and still 47% charge with pixel3a graphenos on 20200622 build. (Airplain mode only WiFi)
23:31:30 <faxing[m]> You're 100% right iirc
23:31:56 <faxing[m]> The only criteria for getting your app on F-Droid is being open source (essentially) iirc
23:32:09 <worldwideworld[m> <mxnorvak[m] "As far as i know an app needs to"> Okay thanks
23:36:48 <mxnorvak[m]> <worldwideworld[m "Okay thanks"> Np
