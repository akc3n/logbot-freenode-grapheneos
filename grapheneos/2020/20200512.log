00:00:26 <k-sloth[m]> If a organization has a policy to stop using FB on work place devices. Usually that's to protect the organization sensitive data. If using tor to access FB and then something like you said happens, big trouble right
00:00:49 <TheJollyRoger> k-sloth[m]: quite possibly, yes.
00:01:11 <TheJollyRoger> But it's much more likely that employers block employees from using Social Media for much less security-focused reasons:
00:01:16 <TheJollyRoger> prevention of cyberslacking.
00:02:28 <TheJollyRoger> It's crazy how much time social media can simply suck up. Company dime, too.
00:02:56 <k-sloth[m]> But your also saying if knowledgeable and use tor and the tools correctly . In the same situation I could use FB with out hurting the organization
00:03:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
00:03:11 <k-sloth[m]> > prevention of cyberslacking.
00:03:12 <k-sloth[m]> Yes that's true
00:03:52 <k-sloth[m]> OK this is very interesting. And a good awareness for me to learn
00:04:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:04:20 <k-sloth[m]> Lol feel like your teaching me better then my cyber teachers
00:04:27 <JTL> I don't spend much time in social media these days
00:04:37 <JTL> :p
00:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, well... X3... I'm flattered!
00:07:12 <k-sloth[m]> So in relations to GrapheneOS its better to use wireguard over tor?
00:07:37 <TheJollyRoger> Er... what's the use case, again...?
00:08:43 <k-sloth[m]> Everyday use. Banking webpage, govt sites,
00:08:43 <k-sloth[m]> Signal, riot,
00:09:19 <k-sloth[m]> LinkedIn (the only social I can't get rid off FML)
00:09:51 <TheJollyRoger> Well...
00:09:52 <k-sloth[m]> I use it through vanadium
00:10:08 <TheJollyRoger> For Signal, actually you may be interested in knowing that Signal's TLS certificate's actually pinned.
00:10:13 <k-sloth[m]> Or should I use through WebApps
00:10:27 <TheJollyRoger> Signal actually fronts via AWS - I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND you do not futz with Signal.
00:10:46 <k-sloth[m]> Wahhhhhh really
00:10:57 <k-sloth[m]> I did not know that
00:10:58 <TheJollyRoger> Signal actually REALLY takes security and privacy very seriously. Anything you do to it, is actually going to decrease your security and privacy more than anything else.
00:10:59 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: I wish HTTPS still had a form of certificate and/or key pinning
00:11:05 <TheJollyRoger> JTL
00:11:08 <TheJollyRoger> Aaargh, I do too X(
00:11:10 <JTL> But I'm preaching to the choir there
00:11:29 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: And Signal needs that money for the AWS bandwidth bills
00:11:31 <JTL> :P
00:11:52 <k-sloth[m]> So I use mullvad always on mode
00:12:26 <k-sloth[m]> So I take it signal traffic goes through it right
00:12:27 <TheJollyRoger> For your banking website, government sites, honestly, I would just use Vanadium.
00:12:43 <TheJollyRoger> Signal traffic should be left unmolested, unless you want to stand out on the network and be easier to track.
00:13:26 <TheJollyRoger> The decision to use AWS is not laziness: AWS hosts a HUGE amount (more than a majority) of all smartphone backends.
00:13:34 <TheJollyRoger> Followed by MS Azure and Google Cloud Platform.
00:13:40 <TheJollyRoger> It's cover traffic.
00:13:52 <k-sloth[m]> So then I shouldnt use VPN always on mode? Or set up my VPN differently
00:14:27 <TheJollyRoger> For Signal, no, it's best to leave Signal alone and let it make the decisions.
00:14:39 <k-sloth[m]> AWS is fine for now. But if the EARN IT act is passed I think a lot of people will leave
00:14:49 <renlord> on signal -- they probably thrive for sane defaults
00:14:57 <renlord> that work for *most* people's threat models
00:15:08 <renlord> if you have a unique circumstance, you need to work around it
00:16:15 <k-sloth[m]> OK that's good so I can just leave the mullvad app set to 'always on' and signal will decide how it will route traffic, is that correct?
00:16:53 <hypokeimenon[m]> Until Threema goes fully open-source
00:17:32 <JTL> That's a name I haven't heard in awhile
00:19:25 <headgas[m]> So is librem tunnel good or no good?
00:20:06 <JTL> I wouldn't use it
00:20:21 <JTL> But I think Purism has their own business related issues
00:22:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I'd rather just use my own home internet connection than Librem Tunnel. That said, I'm very blessed in that I'm with an ISP whose response to any inquests is "Get a court order, or get away from our customers!"
00:22:39 <k-sloth[m]> > Yeah, I'd rather just use my own home internet connection than Librem Tunnel. That said, I'm very blessed in that I'm with an ISP whose response to any inquests is "Get a court order, or get away from our customers!"
00:22:39 <k-sloth[m]> Wow I want that ISP
00:23:04 <renlord> sounds like a ISP that will not be in business very soon
00:24:21 <k-sloth[m]> > sounds like a ISP that will not be in business very soon
00:24:21 <k-sloth[m]> How? that doesn't make sense. Means they but their customers 1st and follow the law and know the law to protect their business
00:24:39 <JTL> k-sloth[m]: It does make sense
00:24:41 <JTL> Capitalism
00:24:48 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
00:25:01 <JTL> Putting your customers first at the expense of possible profits
00:25:45 <headgas[m]> What isp ? Well I'm paying for librem one service. I've switched over almost everything to that email so I can finally completely delete my google account.  Why is the librem tunnel bad?
00:26:01 <k-sloth[m]> Why do you need profits. A business can survive with out them
00:26:52 <JTL> If a business doesn't generate money and doesn't have sources of funding it won't be doing much
00:30:03 <renlord> k-sloth[m]: you clearly have not run a business
00:30:34 <renlord> if not for profits, why else to take on risk to run businesses?
00:30:46 <renlord> when it so much simpler/easier to just work for a paycheck
00:30:55 <k-sloth[m]> > If a business doesn't generate money and doesn't have sources of funding it won't be doing much
00:30:55 <k-sloth[m]> Yeah true, but they generating a income, which I say would be enough to make their business stable. At the same time protecting their customers sensitive data.
00:30:57 <renlord> you are expecting abnormal gains
00:31:15 <renlord> any business person looking for stable gains arent in their right mind
00:31:27 <renlord> they are better off just being an employee or a state employee
00:31:33 <hypokeimenon[m]> I dislike reading privacy policies. Especially after a company has served you an initial line about deeply respecting the importance of your privacy. subsequently rattling off a list of companies that are involved in processing your data, which they have no real control over.
00:32:00 <JTL> renlord: As I once said here
00:32:02 <JTL> "I see ideals sadly becoming less of a part over the years and [moreso] money. Look at all the people who wnat to take the "easy way out" and work for (some overhypted) VC funded startups rather then work on academic research."
00:32:09 <renlord> privacy policies are useless documents, they are just there to protect business interest and to give you (the customer) an illusion that they "care" about your privacy
00:32:30 <k-sloth[m]> What about the principal of protecting people data. For example lavabit
00:32:34 <renlord> customer privacy is at odds with business interests almost 100% of the tiem
00:33:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> <k-sloth[m] "What about the principal of prot"> Why do you think a stunt like that made the news? Most companies would just quietly comply.
00:33:20 <renlord> k-sloth[m]: if they do it right, they wont be in business for long.
00:33:52 <renlord> just face the facts and reality please.
00:34:03 <renlord> it sucks, but its true.
00:34:07 <k-sloth[m]> > > <@k-sloth:matrix.org> What about the principal of protecting people data. For example lavabit
00:34:07 <k-sloth[m]> > Why do you think a stunt like that made the news? Most companies would just quietly comply.
00:34:07 <k-sloth[m]> Yeah because they have no principals. Just wanting to make money
00:34:40 <k-sloth[m]> I know that it sucks, but I'll rather go against the grain then be a sheep
00:34:43 <headgas[m]> So why is librem tunnel not good?
00:34:50 <renlord> k-sloth[m]: then self-host your own shit
00:35:02 <k-sloth[m]> I mostly do lol
00:35:03 <hypokeimenon[m]> I don't understand. do you not live in the same capitalist-driven societies we do or something?
00:35:09 <renlord> k-sloth[m]: problem solved then
00:35:39 <k-sloth[m]> > I don't understand. do you not live in the same capitalist-driven societies we do or something?
00:35:39 <k-sloth[m]> Half yes and half no
00:35:55 <hypokeimenon[m]> self-hose your own isp lol
00:36:03 <hypokeimenon[m]>  * self-host your own isp lol
00:36:08 <renlord> even if its a communist utopia, there's no privacy for you
00:36:22 <k-sloth[m]> > self-hose your own isp lol
00:36:22 <k-sloth[m]> I can't that's why I like the sounds of Jollys ISP
00:37:00 <renlord> even if Jollys ISP existed, his ISP probably runs cables over land that he does not own, can get tapped in transit
00:37:23 <hypokeimenon[m]> <renlord "even if its a communist utopia, "> I don't know what utopian worlds you've been dreaming up, but there's no spying in mine.
00:37:46 <k-sloth[m]> > even if its a communist utopia, there's no privacy for you
00:37:46 <k-sloth[m]> Even so, it better to try and protect myself as much as possible,
00:38:10 <renlord> yes, of course. we do what we can to preserve our dignity.
00:38:32 <k-sloth[m]> Isn't that why people create things like tor, Graphene, qubes, open source etc
00:39:50 <k-sloth[m]> > even if Jollys ISP existed, his ISP probably runs cables over land that he does not own, can get tapped in transit
00:39:51 <k-sloth[m]> Agreed that's why I'm so against it. Internet was never suppose to be owned. But some how it is
00:40:59 <k-sloth[m]> > I don't understand. do you not live in the same capitalist-driven societies we do or something?
00:40:59 <k-sloth[m]> I take it your from America?
00:41:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> No, why?
00:43:55 <k-sloth[m]> Sorry I got capitalist wrong
00:45:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> That statement seems unclear on its own though lol. I meant that you seemed to be skirting around the fact that most businesses in Western civilisation are profit motivated, and they are going to do more to serve their bottom line than people's wishes.
00:45:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> I was making a joke about how you were saying they could just as easily 'do the right thing'.
00:46:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> No organisation is going to be motivated to do the right thing as long as capital is the primary measure of success.
00:46:52 <k-sloth[m]> Yeah I read it wrong. I do it a lot. Lol. Not just in western society, but most big business
00:47:22 <k-sloth[m]> > No organisation is going to be motivated to do the right thing as long as capital is the primary measure of success.
00:47:22 <k-sloth[m]> Totally agree, and hate it with a passion
00:47:24 <priv-bound[m]> Hey has anyone had an issue with downloaded Aurora store apps not shortcutting on the main pages?
00:47:38 <priv-bound[m]> Is there a way to fix this?
00:48:11 <k-sloth[m]> Uninstall then reinstalled
00:48:20 <priv-bound[m]> The app or the store?
00:48:38 <priv-bound[m]> Or the is?
00:48:47 <priv-bound[m]> Os
00:50:09 <k-sloth[m]> The store. It did it once for me. I needed one app from it but now seems ok
00:50:31 <priv-bound[m]> Rgr will try. Thx.
00:50:56 <k-sloth[m]> Buy it could be a bigger issue unsure.
00:51:00 <k-sloth[m]> *but
00:56:42 <k-sloth[m]> > I was making a joke about how you were saying they could just as easily 'do the right thing'.
00:56:43 <k-sloth[m]> I might just be naive, and a little stupid, but to me this is why I have trouble working in a organization. For me the choice of doing the right thing over money is easy. But then again I don't run a business and I have no emotional or physical attachment to money or making profits. But the world I'm force to live in I need money to survive. So I'm fucked either way lol.
00:59:57 <r3muxd> does avb/locked bootloader mean anything against qualcomm devices with firehose programmers?
01:02:11 <r3muxd> unless i'm missing something anyone with a firehose programmer can reboot your phone to EDL mode and flash their own malicious version of grapheneos
01:03:45 <zxwayland> not bad
01:27:09 <fll[m]> > unless i'm missing something anyone with a firehose programmer can reboot your phone to EDL mode and flash their own malicious version of grapheneos
01:27:09 <fll[m]> I have no idea what a firehouse programmer or edl is, but unless that malicious version of grapheneos is signed with strcat's key your data will stay encrypted
01:27:56 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: no, they can't, please don't spread FUD
01:28:45 <strcat[m]> fll: bypassing verified boot does not bypass encryption...
01:29:04 <strcat[m]> and there is obviously not some blatantly obvious bypass like that
01:29:26 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you know how i can force preserve frame pointers when compiling with rustc?
01:29:37 <strcat[m]> no
01:43:29 <strcat[m]> can someone on an up-to-date macOS version check if it has a shasum utility built-in?
01:44:01 <nickcalyx[m]> Yeah I can check
01:44:05 <JTL> darn, think the newest macOS machine I have around is 10.14
01:44:11 <JTL> does nickcalyx[m] have newer?
01:44:30 <strcat[m]> `curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.0-darwin.zip`

01:44:41 <strcat[m]> try those 2 commands
01:44:47 <strcat[m]> downloading platform-tools and verifying
01:45:01 <strcat[m]> it seems like people say it has the `shasum` perl script

01:45:10 <JTL> nickcalyx[m]: (be mindful of homeberw and other package managers that can casue false positives)

01:45:44 <nickcalyx[m]> 10.15.4
01:46:02 <JTL> Ah okay
01:46:35 <strcat[m]> oh and I also need to know if they have bsdtar as tar

01:49:00 <nickcalyx[m]> that worked
01:49:08 <strcat[m]> yeah bsdtar is nice
01:49:15 <strcat[m]> it can extract rar, zip, 7z, etc.
01:49:23 <strcat[m]> I hate GNU tar
01:49:47 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: Linux distributions use an abandoned zip implementation with the final release in 2009
01:49:48 <madaidan[m]> I hate GNU
01:49:51 <strcat[m]> http://infozip.sourceforge.net/
01:50:00 <strcat[m]> this is zip and unzip in Linux distributions
01:50:07 <strcat[m]> it has had a dozen vulnerabilities since 2009
01:50:13 <strcat[m]> so distributions apply some of the random patches floating around
01:50:15 <strcat[m]> to fix some
01:50:20 <JTL> Blah
01:50:25 <strcat[m]> anyway better to install libarchive and use bsdtar
01:50:29 <strcat[m]> alias tar=bsdtar
01:50:39 <strcat[m]> and avoid unzip, zip, unrar, p7zip
01:50:42 <strcat[m]> cause they're all dead/unmaintained
01:50:57 <strcat[m]> http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/
01:50:57 <madaidan[m]> I use those :(
01:51:16 <strcat[m]> all these things are dead projects with known unfixed vulns
01:51:17 <strcat[m]> lol
01:51:18 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: use bsdtar
01:51:44 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: use bsdtar"> I'll try that instead, thanks.
01:51:55 <strcat[m]> the one issue with bsdtar is that it autodetects the file type from the header so it can expose more attack surface - but you can check the file type first
01:52:04 <strcat[m]> and it's proper modern code that's maintained
01:52:13 <strcat[m]> GNU tar does that too though
01:52:34 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: bsdtar is just normal tar syntax but with support for a bunch of formats
01:52:45 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/wiki/LibarchiveFormats
01:52:52 <strcat[m]> it's on Windows 10 too
01:53:20 <renlord> unzip on arch has an outstanding unresolved CVE
01:53:22 <renlord> lol
01:53:32 <JTL> awful
01:53:34 <strcat[m]> so you can `tar tf archive.rar && tar xf archive.rar`
01:53:36 <strcat[m]> renlord: well it's a dead unmaintained project anyway
01:53:40 <strcat[m]> not all the issues have CVEs
01:53:47 <strcat[m]> just Linux things
01:53:56 <renlord> breaks abunch of dependencies
01:53:58 <JTL> :/
01:53:58 <strcat[m]> bsdtar is the tar implementation provided by libarchive
01:54:00 <renlord> when trying to remove
01:54:07 <strcat[m]> which is a project FreeBSD made to replace GNU tar and other tools
01:54:37 <strcat[m]> I don't have anything that depends on unzip but Android expects a basic unzip command
01:54:47 <renlord> aosp-devel requires unzip
01:54:48 <strcat[m]> it would be trivial to implement a new zip / unzip tool with compatible CLI interface using libarchive
01:55:16 <renlord> and things like sagemat
01:55:20 <renlord> and things like sagemath -> r -> unzip
01:55:30 <strcat[m]> renlord: aosp-devil has way more dependencies that you need
01:56:21 <strcat[m]> you don't need Java, etc. from the OS
01:56:49 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/master/ui/build/paths/config.go#76 this is a full list of commands that AOSP is *allowed* to use from the OS - but some of them are provided by it in PATH and just weren't removed there yet
01:57:12 <strcat[m]> if it's not on that list, it can't be a dependency
01:57:16 <strcat[m]> for the build process at least
01:57:24 <strcat[m]> renlord: the build runs in a sandbox these days
01:57:28 <strcat[m]> use namespaces
01:57:34 <strcat[m]>  * uses namespaces
01:57:55 <strcat[m]> that's in master, list is a bit longer for AOSP 10
01:58:05 <strcat[m]> but AOSP 10 had some things listed there that it provides already in the build sandbox
01:58:09 <nickcalyx[m]> I liked that comparison between the /bin/true source on Linux vs. Openbsd
01:58:19 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/android-10.0.0_r36/ui/build/paths/config.go#76
01:58:31 <strcat[m]> so for example it already has bzip2, xz, etc. in the build sandbox
01:58:33 <strcat[m]> doesn't use the OS ones
01:58:39 <strcat[m]> they just hadn't removed it from the whitelist yet
01:58:48 <strcat[m]> has m4, zipinfo, etc.
01:59:29 <renlord> looks very bloated /bin/true
01:59:40 <strcat[m]> renlord: look in `prebuilts/build-tools/linux-x86/bin` and `prebuilts/build-tools/path/linux-x86`
01:59:51 <strcat[m]> renlord: it doesn't even use commands like `rm` from the OS
01:59:57 <renlord> i see ok
01:59:58 <strcat[m]> it uses toybox
02:00:03 <renlord> so i can remove aosp-devel
02:00:12 <strcat[m]> yeah you just need a few of those tools
02:00:14 <strcat[m]> like zip and unzip
02:00:15 <renlord> oh wait, android-studio stuff needs that
02:00:25 <renlord> unless i set to prebuilt manually
02:00:35 <strcat[m]> I just use android-studio from Google
02:00:37 <strcat[m]> not a package
02:00:49 <strcat[m]> I have a standalone SDK in ~/sdk
02:01:06 <strcat[m]> and Android Studio in ~/android/studio
02:01:15 <strcat[m]> guess I could move the sdk to ~/android but that's just where I started with it
02:01:21 <renlord> do you bother to setup vim for app dev?
02:01:32 <strcat[m]> you can point Android Studio at the standalone SDK
02:01:35 <strcat[m]> instead of it installing another copy
02:01:42 <strcat[m]> renlord: I use vim but don't set anything up
02:01:54 <renlord> you can resolve package imports in your head?
02:01:56 <strcat[m]> I'm fine with just text editing and using Android Studio for more complex stuff
02:03:08 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
02:03:10 <strcat[m]> added macOS there
02:03:26 <strcat[m]> I think I'll switch Linux to using the BSD sha syntax because it's saner
02:03:46 <strcat[m]> the GNU syntax is stupid as hell
02:04:13 <strcat[m]> renlord: did you know in that GNU sha syntax, if you replace the double space with a single space, that's invalid, and SOME random versions of GNU coreutils will consider it invalid
02:04:15 <strcat[m]> also BusyBox
02:04:28 <strcat[m]> the double space is actually mandatory
02:04:38 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't say what kind of hash it is so if there's another hash with the same length it is ambiguous
02:04:56 <madaidan[m]> <renlord "looks very bloated /bin/true"> How do you even bloat that?
02:05:12 <strcat[m]> like SHA256 vs SHA512/256
02:05:22 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: all GNU tools are bloated and horrible
02:05:26 <strcat[m]> that's the rule
02:05:37 <madaidan[m]> Lol
02:05:43 <strcat[m]> GNU `true` is 39K on my system
02:05:54 <strcat[m]> int main(void) { return 0; }
02:06:06 <strcat[m]> or just an empty file set to +x
02:06:08 <strcat[m]> it can LITERALLY be an empty file
02:06:24 <strcat[m]> `touch true && chmod +x true`
02:06:33 <strcat[m]> `./true && echo 1`
02:06:56 <strcat[m]> anyway that's not really a great example, the better examples are tools that actually do something
02:07:00 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: GNU `true` is broken btw
02:07:06 <renlord> asm version of return 0
02:07:08 <strcat[m]> it's buggy / non-compliant
02:07:11 <renlord> lol
02:08:02 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: GNU `true` is broken "> It's impressive that they could fuck up something so simple
02:08:09 <strcat[m]> renlord: try running `/usr/lib/libc.so.6`
02:08:18 <strcat[m]> glibc has an entry point for some reason
02:08:18 <strcat[m]> to display information
02:08:26 <madaidan[m]> GNU/FSF really annoys me
02:08:33 <strcat[m]> anyway glibc is horrifying for many reasons that doesn't really count as one
02:08:35 <strcat[m]> that's just a funny quirk
02:08:45 <strcat[m]> it's broken, buggy and super over-engineered
02:08:48 <strcat[m]> has a lot of bugs / design flaws
02:08:51 <renlord> lol
02:09:02 <strcat[m]> all GNU software is horrible and broken as a general rule and needs to be avoided as much as possible
02:09:22 <strcat[m]> busybox and toybox aren't great especially since they copy the GNU tools
02:09:28 <strcat[m]> the BSD tools are so much better
02:09:34 <renlord> strcat[m]: i see that you have pretty much written off GNU/linux
02:09:43 <strcat[m]> well it's a shit tier OS
02:09:53 <strcat[m]> it's a super poor *nix implementation
02:10:03 <strcat[m]> when you've used the FreeBSD CLI stuff it's just a joke
02:10:07 <strcat[m]> in comparison to that
02:10:20 <strcat[m]> it's nice having tools that actually work properly and are documented on OpenBSD and FreeBSD
02:10:28 <strcat[m]> renlord: GNU doesn't believe in man pages
02:10:33 <strcat[m]> so instead they use their horrible GNU info crap
02:10:38 <strcat[m]> and make bad man pages on purpose
02:11:03 <strcat[m]> renlord: try `man cp` vs. `info cp`
02:11:09 <r3muxd> strcat[m]: i'm not saying that it can break encryption, but if it bypasses verified boot you could have an evil maid attack
02:11:17 <strcat[m]> and don't ask me how to use the keybinds in GNU info
02:11:20 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: it does NOT bypass verified boot
02:11:25 <r3muxd> ok
02:11:30 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: where are you getting that from? just made up?
02:11:39 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: there is not some blatant verified boot bypass
02:11:49 <madaidan[m]> Can we just excommunicate GNU
02:12:12 <strcat[m]> I don't know how to use GNU info because it's some fucked up emacs keybinds or something
02:12:16 <strcat[m]> how do you go half page down
02:12:57 <strcat[m]> ok it's somewhat usable if you use `info --vi-keys cp`
02:12:59 <renlord> i never use info
02:13:09 <strcat[m]> renlord: the man pages for GNU things are garbage on purpose though
02:13:13 <strcat[m]> they put the real documentation in `info` only
02:13:19 <renlord> really?
02:13:21 <strcat[m]> I don't know why they are even different
02:13:21 <renlord> lol
02:13:24 <renlord> that explains so much
02:13:31 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes look at `man cp` vs. `info --vi-keys cp`
02:13:50 <strcat[m]> the `--vi-keys` is really not very good even the binding for `g` is wrong
02:13:57 <renlord> LOL
02:14:02 <strcat[m]> at least I can go half a page down and up
02:14:12 <renlord> maybe i should replace man with a wrapper
02:14:16 <strcat[m]> renlord: but yeah now you know you've been reading shit purposely incomplete docs for years
02:14:20 <renlord> so it will print whichever page is longer
02:14:42 <strcat[m]> look at how this actually explains what stuff does and how it handles special cases
02:14:49 <strcat[m]> it's still not great documentation but it's better
02:14:53 <strcat[m]> it's almost halfway to BSD docs
02:15:11 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?cp
02:15:16 <renlord> no one comaplain aabout this?
02:15:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: the linux-man-pages project has a lot of wrong information too
02:15:48 <strcat[m]> linux-man-pages is where a lot of the kernel man pages come from
02:15:53 <strcat[m]> but it's not actually provided but the Linux kernel as a project
02:16:09 <strcat[m]> the Linux kernel doesn't provide man pages they leave it up to a third party with a lot of mistakes / inconsistencies with the implementation and official docs
02:16:27 <strcat[m]> for years it pushed FUD / cargo cult shit about the kernel CSPRNG
02:16:39 <strcat[m]> if you look at it on debian I'm sure it's old enough that it still pushes that FUD
02:16:45 <strcat[m]> and bad advice
02:16:51 <strcat[m]> and weird cargo cult made up stuff about entropy and so on
02:16:56 <strcat[m]> and the kernel is dropping completely now thankfully
02:17:14 <strcat[m]> past couple years Linux has ripped out most of that cargo cult CSPRNG stuff
02:17:36 <strcat[m]> renlord: recently, the Linux kernel will even attempt to initialize the CSPRNG when getrandom blocks instead of just waiting indefinitely
02:17:50 <strcat[m]> unfortunately /dev/urandom is a broken API, /dev/random is a broken API
02:17:55 <strcat[m]> and there's a cargo cult flag supported for getrandom
02:18:26 <renlord> does that mean that i shouldnt trust key generations on linux?
02:18:29 <strcat[m]> renlord: I think /dev/random is gone as a separate thing now
02:18:39 <strcat[m]> renlord: no just make sure it's done with `getrandom` or in late boot
02:18:52 <strcat[m]> the `getrandom` API works properly
02:19:09 <strcat[m]> https://lwn.net/Articles/808575/
02:19:15 <strcat[m]> yeah I think this landed so that cargo cult shit is gone
02:19:21 <strcat[m]> but /dev/urandom is still broken as an API
02:19:41 <strcat[m]> > Removing the blocking pool means that reads from /dev/random behave like getrandom() with a flags value of zero (and turns the GRND_RANDOM flag into a noop). Once the cryptographic random-number generator (CRNG) has been initialized, reads from /dev/random and calls to getrandom(..., 0) will not block and will return the requested amount of random data.
02:19:45 <strcat[m]> yeah I tested and this appears to have landed
02:19:56 <strcat[m]> renlord: for years the linux-man-pages project gave really garbage advice tho
02:20:16 <renlord> was it upstreamed by the NSA?
02:20:17 <renlord> lol
02:20:19 <strcat[m]> so on modern Linux, `getrandom()` and `/dev/random` are now sane (instead of `/dev/random` being a cargo cult nonsense thing)
02:20:20 <renlord> deliberate
02:20:43 <r3muxd> strcat[m]: i was reading https://alephsecurity.com/2018/01/22/qualcomm-edl-2/ , and that talks about leaked firehose programmers being able to bypass secure boot by just rewriting devinfo ("Bootloader Unlocking"), which seems to be intended functionality of the firehose programmers (being able to read/write partitions from EDL)
02:20:45 <strcat[m]> renlord: so basically `/dev/random` used to block so that each bit of random data it output would block for 1 bit of estimated entropy
02:21:08 <madaidan[m]> Entropy is arcane magic to me
02:21:10 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: > OnePlus 3T
02:21:29 <renlord> randomness is magic
02:21:32 <madaidan[m]> I just pray and hope I do stuff right
02:21:43 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: you're spreading FUD without a basis
02:21:51 <strcat[m]> OnePlus doesn't provide working verified boot in the first place
02:22:02 <strcat[m]> we don't support OnePlus devices
02:22:06 <r3muxd> i wasn't, i accept that i'm wrong but i can't figure out why
02:22:12 <strcat[m]> we support devices with a full implementation of verified boot
02:22:17 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: that article is not about Pixels
02:22:27 <r3muxd> EDL definitely exists on pixel devices and I'm pretty sure it uses firehose
02:22:56 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: and so what?
02:23:01 <strcat[m]> fastboot mode exists too
02:23:03 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean it's a verified boot bypass
02:23:09 <strcat[m]> where do you get the idea that it's a verified boot bypass?
02:23:12 <strcat[m]> you just made that up
02:23:27 <madaidan[m]> OnePlus is just shit
02:23:41 <madaidan[m]> You can't really apply their issues to other devices
02:23:50 <aeonsolution[m]> hey everyone, i've been trying to build the development branch using the 10 and tmp branches for the pixel 3a; i keep getting the same error when i run the command `vendor/android-prepare-vendor/execute-all.sh -d sargo -b QQ2A.200501.001.B2 -o vendor/android-prepare-vendor` from the "Extracting vendor files for Pixel devices" section
02:24:12 * aeonsolution[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LLUeYTveVmkuxiJHOQOjbWnz >
02:24:15 <r3muxd> yeah, but if you can unlock the bootloader without factory resetting from EDL isn't that a verified boot bypass? unless i'm missing something
02:24:35 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: you cannot do that...
02:24:37 <aeonsolution[m]> does anyone have experience with that issue?
02:24:37 <strcat[m]> you're making that up
02:24:45 <r3muxd> ok
02:25:16 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: that article is about a OnePlus 3T
02:25:18 <strcat[m]> not a Pixel...
02:25:25 <renlord> he left
02:25:31 <renlord> *they
02:25:39 <strcat[m]> r3muxd: if you read an article about a verified boot bypass on another device you should not assume that applies to another device like a Pixel - it's just wrong
02:26:07 <strcat[m]> r3muxd:  OEMs can disable download mode fully, or dynamically based on lock state
02:26:30 <strcat[m]> the fact that the hardware / firmware supports it doesn't mean it has to be enabled and it DOES NOT permit just arbitrarily unlocking the bootloader or flashing random stuff anyway
02:26:38 <strcat[m]> I don't know how you got that idea from that article
02:26:44 <strcat[m]> you're making up FUD for no reason
02:27:17 <renlord> is it possible to build on freebsd?
02:27:26 <renlord> or be productive on freebsd
02:27:35 <strcat[m]> renlord: can only build AOSP on x86 linux atm
02:27:46 <strcat[m]> maybe it can be built on the freebsd or illumos linux compat layers
02:27:49 <renlord> sad
02:28:12 <strcat[m]> renlord: they partially support building on macOS but it's incomplete and fairly broken
02:28:15 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <r3muxd "yeah, but if you can unlock the "> I think the issue you're thinking of is an old "bug" in the OnePlus 3T's bootloader from 2017(?). It was just a hidden fastboot command that had the effect of toggling the lock state of the bootloader without performing a factory reset. That's not a verified boot bypass though.
02:28:17 <strcat[m]> it can't do a proper production build
02:28:42 <renlord> is it something worthwhile to do?
02:28:49 <renlord> setting up build on freebsd
02:28:56 <strcat[m]> 0xC0ncord: that is a local-only verified boot bypass
02:28:57 <strcat[m]> renlord: meh
02:29:26 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Noted.
02:29:32 <strcat[m]> renlord: building on non-GNU Linux would be very easy
02:29:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: it may already work
02:29:57 <strcat[m]> dunno
02:30:10 <strcat[m]> stuff is linked against glibc
02:30:13 <strcat[m]> you could rebuild the prebuilts using musl
02:30:51 <renlord> sigh, this is like going down the LFS route
02:31:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: Alpine Linux is one option
02:31:19 <strcat[m]> I don't think BusyBox though and it's heavily influenced by the GNU tools
02:31:31 <strcat[m]> toybox is going to end up being much nicer but it's not very mature yet
02:31:45 <strcat[m]> Android uses toybox for the CLI stuff on the device and also in the build environment now though
02:31:52 <strcat[m]> but it has some really immature versions of some tools
02:32:04 <strcat[m]> like the mktemp version in AOSP 10 toybox prebuilt is totally fucked
02:32:23 <strcat[m]> because they used libc's implementation and glibc's is broken
02:32:47 <strcat[m]> they shouldn't have used the broken libc functions
02:32:54 <strcat[m]> I think it's fixed in the current release, maybe in AOSP master it's fine
02:32:55 <strcat[m]> let me check

02:35:44 <strcat[m]> toybox is really immature
02:35:48 <strcat[m]> that's glibc's fault kinda

02:37:49 <aeonsolution[m]> I've been trying everything in my power to figure that out. Hopefully that solves it for me!
02:38:03 <strcat[m]> renlord: busybox is garbage
02:38:12 <dan-v[m]> aeonsolution: no problem :)
02:38:14 <strcat[m]> renlord: it ONLY supports the awful GNU syntax for sha256sum
02:38:16 <strcat[m]> not BSD
02:38:32 <strcat[m]> so yeah I have to leave the Linux one using that awful syntax where 2 spaces is syntactically significant

02:44:33 <strcat[m]> renlord: I find PowerShell pretty annoying to use interactively
02:44:42 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's a far saner approach to scripting...
02:44:46 <strcat[m]> but it's too verbose interactively
02:44:57 <renlord> never done dev work on windows
02:45:08 <strcat[m]> it's also really, really annoying that on Windows, PowerShell has a bunch of misguided aliases for common *nix utilities
02:45:08 <renlord> i more or less forgotten how to use windows now
02:45:11 <strcat[m]> PowerShell on Linux doesn't have those aliases
02:45:20 <strcat[m]> so if you type `cp` it uses the *nix `cp`, if you type `curl` it uses `curl`
02:45:35 <strcat[m]> and external commands just produce strings as output
02:45:48 <strcat[m]> vs. producing properly typed / structured data
02:45:56 <strcat[m]> but it works as you would expect
02:46:05 <strcat[m]> on Windows they aliased all the common *nix utilities, etc. to PowerShell built-ins
02:46:10 <strcat[m]> that are totally different
02:46:31 <strcat[m]> renlord: so notice how in my instructions it uses curl.exe? for installing
02:46:38 <strcat[m]> because Windows 10 includes curl
02:46:39 <renlord> yes
02:46:43 <strcat[m]> but in PowerShell, `curl` is a legacy alias
02:46:46 <strcat[m]> and won't use actual curl
02:46:51 <renlord> lulz
02:47:02 <renlord> why not just tell users to use WSL?
02:47:22 <strcat[m]> PowerShell is actually far saner than Bash, etc. for scripting
02:47:33 <strcat[m]> but I find the way it takes arguments, etc. way too verbose to use interactively
02:47:42 <strcat[m]> and also on Windows specifically, there are a bunch of legacy aliases
02:47:46 <strcat[m]> Windows is still using PowerShell 5
02:47:53 <strcat[m]> the current release is PowerShell 6 which doesn't have those aliases
02:48:06 <strcat[m]> PowerShell 7 also won't have them but Windows will use 7 and just add the legacy aliases for compat
02:48:52 <renlord> if people want a verbose shell, they can always just use python interactive shell
02:48:53 <renlord> kek

02:50:19 <strcat[m]> but if you try using the native command it's insanely slow
02:50:22 <strcat[m]> what the hell is wrong with it
02:50:31 <strcat[m]> I think it reads the data byte by byte with an interpreted language
02:50:48 <strcat[m]> it's taking literally minutes
02:51:43 <strcat[m]> renlord: so they alias `curl` to `Invoke-WebRequest`
02:51:46 <strcat[m]> and `wget`
02:52:00 <strcat[m]> which is a totally different command that uses internet explorer to perform downloads
02:52:01 <strcat[m]> I am not joking
02:52:09 <strcat[m]> it takes totally different cli args

02:59:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://grapheneos.org/build#standalone-sdk are my standalone SDK instructions
02:59:38 <strcat[m]> renlord: that's the best option for this stuff
02:59:43 <strcat[m]> you can choose the path to put it at
02:59:52 <strcat[m]> and then you can point Android Studio at it instead of it downloading a separate copy of this
03:00:20 <strcat[m]> do this and then just download Android Studio and run the launcher
03:00:25 <strcat[m]> and point it at this copy of the SDK
03:00:38 <strcat[m]> Android Studio on Linux just runs out of the directory you extract it to and keeps itself updated there
03:00:54 <strcat[m]> and it can use an external SDK or external Java runtime if you tell it to do that
03:01:12 <strcat[m]> well it's not really an 'external SDK' since it's the same thing it will do itself
03:01:24 <strcat[m]> you can just point it at an existing SDK install instead of it making one itself
03:01:37 <strcat[m]> same thing either way this way you choose where to put it though
03:02:01 <strcat[m]> can also build this from the appropriate AOSP tags
03:02:06 <strcat[m]> but I don't think you want to build each of the packages

03:37:06 <strcat[m]> > Note: This SDK Tools package is deprecated and no longer receiving updates. Instead, please use the new command-line tools package.
03:37:09 <strcat[m]> alright need to migrate this

04:04:04 <renlord> yep will do
04:04:25 <renlord> i think the arch package also do weird things
04:04:30 <renlord> like installing to the /opt/ dir
04:04:42 <strcat[m]> renlord: wait one sec made 1 minor change
04:04:43 <strcat[m]> refresh it
04:04:45 <renlord> i hate packages that do weird things like that
04:04:51 <strcat[m]> renlord: remove your existing SDK installation
04:04:56 <strcat[m]> and remove existing changes to PATH for it
04:04:57 <strcat[m]> and try this
04:05:41 <strcat[m]> renlord: so basically this downloads cmdline-tools (which includes the package manager for the SDK) and sets it up at the right location
04:05:57 <strcat[m]> renlord: then it installs cmdline-tools with itself, which overwrites what you downloaded, and makes it update itself from that point onwards
04:06:09 <strcat[m]> renlord: and then you can install the other packages with it
04:06:22 <strcat[m]> renlord: also when you build apps, etc. it knows how to automatically install whatever you're missing
04:08:27 <renlord> uhhuh
04:08:39 <strcat[m]> renlord: it does everything in this ~/android/sdk directory
04:09:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: each package has a package.xml
04:09:55 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have any important state in there - you can just nuke it and start over any time which is what I just did to make the instructions
04:10:09 <strcat[m]> and when you build an app it'll install missing packages
04:10:34 <strcat[m]> so for example I just build Auditor so it installed the Android SDK Platform 29 package
04:10:38 <strcat[m]>  * so for example I just built Auditor so it installed the Android SDK Platform 29 package
04:13:01 <strcat[m]> renlord: after you successful do this, you can download android studio and extract it into ~/android/studio
04:13:11 <strcat[m]> renlord: and as long as ANDROID_HOME is set properly it will find your existing SDK and use that
04:13:18 <strcat[m]> renlord: and then it's nice and self-contained / simple
04:16:52 <strcat[m]> renlord: run `sdkmanager --list` to show what you have installed and what's available
04:17:11 <strcat[m]> it has a legacy tools package that's hidden which it will end up installing, I assume that will go away eventually
04:17:16 <strcat[m]> you can technically remove it but whatever
04:17:20 <strcat[m]> I'd just leave it
04:17:30 <strcat[m]> just don't use sdk/tools/
04:17:33 <strcat[m]> that's the legacy tools
04:28:44 <renlord> i'll be able to resume regular contributions again in june
04:28:50 <renlord> sorry about downtime
04:30:41 <analog[m]> Life gets in the way, no worries.
04:30:46 <analog[m]> Good luck with what's holding you back renlord.
04:33:21 <renlord> just been busy with semester work
04:35:19 <JTL> Good luck renlord
04:35:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://grapheneos.org/build#android-studio
04:35:26 <JTL> I'm dealing with my own things as well
04:35:28 <strcat[m]> to have Android Studio alongside the SDK
04:35:36 <strcat[m]> renlord: imo this is the best way to do it
04:35:46 <strcat[m]> and any time you want you can nuke it and install it again like this
04:35:57 <strcat[m]> as long as ANDROID_HOME is set, it will see your already have the SDK
04:36:04 <strcat[m]> and it will update it for you if you use it
04:36:09 <strcat[m]> doesn't screw it up
04:36:45 <strcat[m]> renlord: I really don't want to deal with the pain of building the SDK, Android Studio and the packages from source even though it's possible
04:37:04 <strcat[m]> I might build our own copy of platform-tools and host it though
04:37:09 <strcat[m]> so people can install it from us
04:37:12 <strcat[m]> when installing
04:37:36 <strcat[m]> it's a reproducible build anyway
04:38:18 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest.git/+/refs/tags/platform-tools-29.0.6
04:38:26 <strcat[m]> there are AOSP tags for platform-tools
04:38:46 <strcat[m]> since I got them to start tagging it instead of me needing to figure out the git revision of the manifest through detective work
04:38:54 <strcat[m]> they basically just build it from master
04:38:57 <strcat[m]> and tag the revision
04:39:35 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest.git/+log/refs/heads/sdk-release
04:39:46 <strcat[m]> I dunno how much is built from that
04:41:17 <strcat[m]> renlord: some things don't have tags just because they don't realize how helpful it is to have a public tag for releases instead of needing to somehow figure out what revision of the manifest they used
04:41:17 <strcat[m]> lol.
04:54:19 <TheJollyRoger>  Good luck renlord!
04:54:30 <TheJollyRoger> We'll see you when you return! ^_^
05:48:31 <renlord> strcat[m]: can you -O on me pls?
05:48:39 <renlord> so i can toggle on manually
05:49:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: tes
05:49:35 <strcat[m]> yes
05:50:25 <strcat[m]> done
05:50:29 <renlord> ok great
06:05:43 <shad0wbit[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): With regard to the secure boot thing, there also exists coreboot with vboot
06:05:47 <shad0wbit[m]> https://doc.coreboot.org/security/vboot/index.html
06:09:38 <strcat> most of the work is left up to the OS
06:09:57 <strcat> verifying only the kernel is not an implementation of verified boot
06:10:16 <strcat> doesn't actually accomplish anything
06:12:50 <shad0wbit[m]> Is vboot used by the Cromebooks?
06:13:26 <strcat> define what you mean by that
06:13:47 <strcat> Chromebooks have a full verified boot implementation, it consists of different components
06:13:57 <strcat> one part of it involves the verified boot implementation in coreboot
06:14:05 <shad0wbit[m]> Oh ok
06:14:08 <shad0wbit[m]> Thanks
06:15:28 <shad0wbit[m]> Is there a difference between the verfied boot of Chromebooks and a Pixel?
06:21:40 <strcat> it's a different implementation
06:38:41 <Cyrinux[m]> Hi, what about uefi and secureboot in this story?
06:39:20 <renlord> strcat: does it bother you that mutt does not do TSLA checks?
06:39:26 <Cyrinux[m]> If my bootloader is corrupted or comprised, with secureboot, i canT boot
06:39:47 <strcat> Cyrinux[m]: dunno what the relevance is
06:40:00 <strcat> Cyrinux[m]: verifying only a bootloader stage and the kernel is not useful
06:40:01 <renlord> or do you delegate mutt to use another smtp authenticator that does DANE?
06:40:11 <strcat> that's not verified boot it's called security theater and dishonest cargo cult security
06:40:13 <Cyrinux[m]> ok
06:40:25 <strcat> misleading users into thinking a security feature is implemented that is not implemented
06:41:03 <strcat> shouldn't advertise something before it's finished
06:41:31 * parazen616[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ioZYAPkVsVJvkZaARHtvUpJj >
06:42:07 <strcat[m]> parazen616: unsure what you mean
06:42:26 <strcat[m]> why are you talking about Android 5.1?
06:42:39 <strcat[m]> and I have a feeling you mean some old fork of AOSP not actually AOSP
06:42:55 <strcat[m]> Android 10 and GrapheneOS run fine in a VM if that's what you want to know
06:43:56 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-targets
06:48:35 <strcat[m]> and I'd recommend avoiding virtualbox, it's unsafe and broken
06:48:54 <strcat[m]> use kvm or hyper-v
06:50:57 <parazen616[m]> <strcat[m] "and I have a feeling you mean so"> I'd like to run another vm on grapheneOS.
06:51:39 <strcat[m]> I recommend reading the content on the site
06:52:22 <strcat[m]> parazen616:  read https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers etc.
06:52:27 <strcat[m]> read about how the application security model works
06:52:47 <parazen616[m]> Thx
06:53:08 <strcat[m]> apps run in an app sandbox and you can use user profiles as isolated workspaces with separate identities
07:01:13 <strcat[m]> renlord: barely anything does TLSA
07:01:32 <strcat[m]> mutt does basic Web PKI cert validation like most things
07:01:43 <strcat[m]> not as thorough as browsers
07:01:50 <strcat[m]> i.e. most things don't check for SCTs and so on
07:04:04 <parazen616[m]> <strcat[m] "apps run in an app sandbox and y"> That's cool.
07:10:06 <strcat[m]> third party apps don't have the necessary privileges to use hardware-based virtualization
07:13:16 <strcat[m]> certainly would be possible to make a privileged app using kvm to run VMs or whatever
07:13:35 <strcat[m]> could already use non-hardware-based virtualization like software QEMU without anything new in the OS
07:14:52 <strcat[m]> how does that help you?
07:19:08 <strcat[m]> there isn't an app available for that and we don't create builds for it (it doesn't exist so how can we?)
07:19:16 <strcat[m]> I don't think it would make sense to make one
07:19:21 <strcat[m]> rather than securing the OS
07:21:05 <strcat[m]> using virtualization to strengthen the existing sandboxes would make sense - making some app to run arbitrary VM images and coming up with a system to delegate permissions to those isn't within the scope of the project
07:21:19 <strcat[m]> and we really don't want to build GrapheneOS for yet another build target too
07:21:48 <strcat[m]> you also wouldn't have verified boot that way unless the VM app could ONLY run approved images
07:22:12 <strcat[m]> really best to just strengthen OS security instead of making things more complicated and adding functionality nearly no people are going to want / use
07:26:33 <strcat[m]> use user profiles, don't make things more complicated than they need to be
07:26:52 <strcat[m]> if you want user profiles to use virtualization as part of their implementation, provide resources/funding and find developers to work on it
07:31:45 <strcat[m]> user profiles are ALREADY fully isolated in terms of not allowing communication or data sharing
07:32:01 <strcat[m]> they are containers if you want to think about them that way
07:32:43 <strcat[m]> virtualization as part of the implementation could probably provide lower attack surface
07:32:59 <strcat[m]> hardware-based virtualization in an app is the opposite - that's increasing the complexity / attack surface of the OS, not reducing it
07:33:01 <strcat[m]> not what we do
07:38:20 <joshman[m]> Hey opsec folks. Short question. I do use my Pixel in WiFi mode only. Though I have times when I need to quickly check something. How bad is it to connect through someones hotspot just for quick signal Text for example
07:41:09 <strcat[m]> explain further what you mean by that
07:41:22 <strcat[m]> what is a 'hotspot' and who is 'someone'
07:41:32 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy first
07:52:22 <nuttso[m]> <joshman[m] "Hey opsec folks. Short question."> Threat it as untrusted network. Use vps or vpn everytime.
10:10:08 <mxnorvak[m]> strcat :I've asked this before,idk if its really a good question to be asked ,if an iphone or a pixel aren't available somewhere, what is the next best thing in terms of security, some said maybe android one phones but then they mentioned it doesn't have verified boot
10:11:55 <mmcblk0[m]> Please, what i could make a wrong if for debuging kernel i will use FTDI cable TTL-232R-3V3-AJ together with original Google Headphone Jack Adapter - Digital USB-C to 3.5mm instead using JollyRoger
10:11:55 <mmcblk0[m]> Peter-Easton android debug cable? What is your opinion can work with it?
10:12:18 <mxnorvak[m]> I've learned that OnePlus phones don't care about security so they're not an option
10:12:52 <gervarouge[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "strcat :I've asked this before,i"> Can you just get an old iPhone? They are supported so long it's fine
10:13:39 <mxnorvak[m]> Have had the experience with Xiaomi and their privacy is just horrible
10:14:14 <gervarouge[m]> Android beside Google is pretty bad for security and hardware
10:14:32 <gervarouge[m]> Samsung tries a little, but they have a history of making things worse
10:15:02 <mxnorvak[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Can you just get an old iPhone? "> I'm not asking for myself tbh, I'm looking for a Pixel and havent been able to find one, and yea maybe you can get old iphones but not everyone can get along with how restricted some things like fils transfer are in iPhones
10:15:57 <gervarouge[m]> It got a lot better lately
10:16:07 <blacklight447[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "I'm not asking for myself tbh, I"> you can get them on amazon as far as i know
10:16:09 <blacklight447[m]> or any thirdparty resellers
10:16:18 <mxnorvak[m]> Would have liked to know if Daniel thinks an option is even good enough to just be considered better than others out of the box
10:17:21 <gervarouge[m]> mxnorvak: https://www.redditcommentsearch.com/ search "Android One" "DanielMicay"
10:19:43 <blacklight447[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Samsung tries a little, but they"> yay, samsung knox
10:20:35 <mxnorvak[m]> I did and I've read what he said about android one and well it was compared to LOS , but again idk how important is verified boot in terms of having a device with at least the basics of a secure device
10:20:47 <gervarouge[m]> Samsung deserves a lot of credit compared to most. They actually had a device supported by Daniel for a while so they must be okay
10:21:13 <mxnorvak[m]> Which device?
10:21:20 <gervarouge[m]> S4
10:21:32 <mxnorvak[m]> didn't know that
10:22:10 <gervarouge[m]> I think the Samsung Galaxy Nexus too
10:22:21 <gervarouge[m]> Which barely counts

13:11:05 <strcat> renlord: when you ask it afaik
13:20:01 <blacklight447[m]> thoughts on our recommendations? https://www.privacytools.io/providers/email/
13:20:08 <blacklight447[m]> you can see our listing criteria at the bottem of that page
13:21:45 <renlord> none of them seem to work
13:21:58 <blacklight447[m]> we require: dnssec, dane, dmarc, dkim, spf, mta-sts, tls-rpt, and smtps (if you only wanna know what security extensions we require)
13:23:13 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: shouldn't allow DMARC with p=none
13:23:25 <strcat> and really p=reject should be required
13:23:31 <blacklight447[m]> btw for testing , recommend hardenize.com
13:23:53 <renlord> blacklight447[m]: trying out now!
13:23:56 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: also you *aren't* requiring working DNSSEC, DANE, DMARC, DKIM, SPF, MTA-STS by checking for it that way
13:24:04 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: because there are 2 sides to all of those
13:24:08 <strcat> receiving and sending email
13:24:27 <renlord> also throw in some recommendations for MUAs
13:24:30 <renlord> lol
13:24:34 <renlord> efail.io
13:24:41 <renlord> there's only 2 usable ones
13:24:42 <blacklight447[m]> https://www.hardenize.com/report/librem.one/1589289788
13:24:45 <renlord> k9mail + mutt
13:24:47 <blacklight447[m]> librem.one is pretty sad indeed
13:24:55 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "and really p=reject should be re"> hmm, hadent considered that, ill put it on my to fix list for today
13:25:00 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: that's only testing half the picture
13:25:16 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: so for example that's testing for DNSSEC + DANE records, which allows others to securely send email to that server
13:25:23 <strcat> it does NOT mean that they send emails securely
13:25:24 <renlord> so i'm only missing MTA-STS and TLS-RPT
13:25:50 <renlord> only 50% of emails use SMTPS
13:25:51 <blacklight447[m]> yes i know
13:25:53 <renlord> incoming
13:25:53 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: enforcing DNSSEC, DANE and MTS-STS for sending mail cannot be seen by a scan like that
13:25:58 <renlord> on my MTA
13:25:58 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: https://havedane.net/
13:26:01 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "blacklight447: also you *aren't*"> i am aware
13:26:02 <strcat> you can use that to test DANE
13:26:11 <blacklight447[m]> we only use it for a quick overview to show it to others
13:26:30 <blacklight447[m]> if it doesnt show up there, then you already know they didnt do it correctly
13:26:36 <blacklight447[m]> if it does show up correctly here, then you know its worth it to further investigate
13:26:41 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: also they should be checking SPF, DKIM, DMARC for received mail not just signing their mail
13:27:01 <strcat> i.e. they shouldn't just have it set up for sending mail
13:27:05 <renlord> so mta-sts requires a webserevr?
13:27:06 <renlord> @_@
13:27:08 <strcat> but actually check it for receiving
13:27:15 <strcat> renlord: yes but it doesn't need to be on the same host
13:27:24 <blacklight447[m]> we test these providers ourselfs
13:27:26 <strcat> renlord: it's an mta-sts.mail-domain.tld subdomain
13:27:41 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "blacklight447: enforcing DNSSEC,"> like i just told you, i know
13:27:45 <renlord> can it be a gitub page?
13:28:00 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: but it lists various providers there
13:28:07 <strcat> that I know aren't doing these things right
13:28:48 <blacklight447[m]> hardenize is only a quick outside check because if it doesnt show up there, then it means its not correct in any case, where if it does show up there, then we know atleast the outside is good, and we will spend our time checking if its done well from the inside as well
13:29:31 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "blacklight447: but it lists vari"> oh?
13:29:32 <blacklight447[m]> like?
13:29:46 <blacklight447[m]> (if there is a problem, i want to fix it)
13:30:04 <blacklight447[m]> don't wanna turn into the folks of lineage os who just close of their ears and pretend they didnt heard it
13:30:06 <strcat> use havedane.net to test how many of those actually implement DANE
13:30:30 <renlord> blacklight447[m] would have to open an account with all those providers lol
13:30:44 <strcat> and you have to send them a spoofed email to test if they actually check DMARC
13:31:45 <blacklight447[m]> as far as i know, daniel performed those inside tests
13:31:59 <blacklight447[m]> i will check with him
13:32:01 <blacklight447[m]> (daniel on our team, not strcat)
13:32:57 <renlord> can mta-sts.your-domain be a CNAME to your-domain?
13:33:10 <renlord> or mta-sts.your-domain must be an A record
13:36:01 <strcat> renlord: it can be a CNAME
13:36:27 <strcat> renlord: you need to set this up on each domain that sends email
13:36:39 <strcat> renlord: each that receives email I mean
13:37:00 <blacklight447[m]> btw strcat  do you have an example of which providers you know arent doing it correctly?
13:37:12 <blacklight447[m]> that way we can double check if we really missed it
13:37:14 <strcat> renlord: so for example I have mta-sts.attestation.app, mta-sts.seamlessupdate.app, mta-sts.grapheneos.org, mta-sts.mail.grapheneos.org
13:37:33 <strcat> renlord: and the mta-sts and tls reporting record for each
13:37:40 <strcat> renlord: tls reporting applies to DANE too
13:37:49 <strcat> renlord: it sends you records for TLS like DMARC does
13:42:09 <blacklight447[m]> so about those providers? :p
13:44:01 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: try havedane.net with protonmail
13:44:58 <blacklight447[m]> i will
13:46:22 <renlord> i'm trying to host it via github pages
13:47:11 <strcat> renlord: should work
13:47:20 <strcat> renlord: just keep in mind you need the DNS record too
13:47:25 <renlord> yeah i know that
13:47:33 <renlord> maybe hugo fucked up the sitemap or something

13:51:43 <strcat[m]> nuttso: so they actually check DANE
13:51:46 <strcat[m]> few do
13:52:11 <strcat[m]> ideally you set up both MTA-STS and DANE
13:52:16 <strcat[m]> and check both MTA-STS and DANE
13:52:33 <strcat[m]> become some providers only do one of them so if you care about security you need both
13:53:56 <renlord> needs to be a separate page
13:57:33 <blacklight447[m]> we are currently checking strcat claims, if protonmail does indeed not have it, we will have to check all the others
13:57:38 <blacklight447[m]> the onces lacking will be given a few weeks notice
13:57:55 <blacklight447[m]> tafter that, if not fixed, they shall be removed from the list
14:01:49 <renlord> ok done

14:03:06 <strcat[m]> and google will send you a TLS report for the day
14:03:15 <strcat[m]> if TLS reporting is on
14:03:46 <strcat[m]> it will tell you if they've pinned your MTA-STS policy
14:04:18 <strcat[m]> technically you could use it without MTA-STS to see if TLS is being used
14:04:23 <strcat[m]> rather than mail logs
14:04:33 <strcat[m]> but it's only really useful to see if MTA-STS / DANE are being used and so far I haven't gotten a report from a provider that implements DANE verification + TLS reporting
14:04:37 <strcat[m]> just Google for MTA-STS
14:04:57 <renlord> where does it say?
14:05:07 <renlord> when do i get the report i mean
14:05:15 <strcat[m]> renlord: it emails you reports like the DMARC reports
14:05:16 <strcat[m]> daily
14:05:18 <renlord> ok
14:05:20 <strcat[m]> if you got mails from them that day
14:05:32 <renlord> is there a way to check now?
14:05:34 <renlord> immeidately
14:06:03 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://aykevl.nl/apps/mta-sts/ can check MTA-STS
14:06:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: the TLS reporting DNS entry has an email address
14:06:13 <strcat[m]> so that's where they mail it
14:26:10 <renlord> ok all green now
14:26:51 <hitchhooker[m]> seems like protonmail aint getting all green :-)
14:27:00 <hitchhooker[m]> sends to invalid danes too
14:34:03 <renlord> mail.grapheneos.org can sell email subscription services
14:34:04 <renlord> lol
14:36:28 <renlord> this really all boils down to how robust dnssec really is
14:36:51 <renlord> if dnssec gives, pretty much all security falls apart
14:40:45 <MadCamel> arguably an improvement on the previous 100% CA based system.
15:05:35 <bseeinu[m]> TheJollyRoger is there any real resource via tor that is valuable for totally average users anyways? Or is it just not worthy in that case
15:14:36 <bseeinu[m]> Also: any favorite Mastodon instances?
15:38:12 <jacksonpollock19> Is it possible to factory reset in recovery mode if device is locked ?
15:39:58 <dazinism> jacksonpollock1993: yeah
15:40:51 <dazinism> It used to not be, but that meant forgotten password= bricked phone
15:41:38 <dazinism> Good for anti theft but not so great for forgetful folks..
15:42:23 <jacksonpollock19> Do you mind explaining how to do it please? When I boot into recovery I just get (no command) no other options
15:42:30 <dazinism> Think on stock OS you need to login to Google account to factory reset
15:43:26 <dazinism> jacksonpollock1993: use the volume buttons?
15:47:40 <jacksonpollock19> I'm not on stock OS

18:34:04 <blacklight447[m]> strcat:  we are currently retesting all the email providers.
18:34:21 <blacklight447[m]> thanks for pointing this out to us
19:20:21 <blacklight447[m]> https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/1911
19:20:33 <blacklight447[m]> i opened the issue on github
19:20:48 <blacklight447[m]> we shall post the results soon
19:29:02 <joeri_poeri[m]> would you people to consider it safe enough to use the Gboard keyboard without internet access?
19:30:15 <MadCamel> I've been using it in conjunction with netguard to block it. It works well enough. Safety.. Unsure. I get the feeling that if netguard malfunctions or is disabled it will share everything with google all at once
19:30:16 <joeri_poeri[m]> if I understand the level of security on this device if this is the only non open source and trusted app on my phone there should be no issue right?
19:36:53 <cx2[m]> <blacklight447[m] "https://github.com/privacytools/"> Nice work on transparency, and the willingness to potentially change longstanding norms, even if unpopular. My opinion isn't worth a lot, but I think it says a lot for your service.
19:38:06 <cx2[m]> <joeri_poeri[m] "would you people to consider it "> if the Stock keyboard isn't doing it for you, have you tried OpenBoard? I have personally found it to be pretty decent.
19:38:16 <blacklight447[m]> <cx2[m] "Nice work on transparency, and t"> PrivacyTools is build on transparency, its what makes us different from other sites
19:38:31 <blacklight447[m]> everyone is free to join the discussion and leave their opinions /arguments
19:38:49 <blacklight447[m]> https://www.privacytools.io/about/
19:38:51 <blacklight447[m]> fun fact, even our finacial income and spending is open

19:39:26 <blacklight447[m]> :)
19:40:00 <cx2[m]> <blacklight447[m] "PrivacyTools is build on transpa"> True. no doubt... but PTIO is also a hub... and this specific issue has the potential to stir the pot.
19:40:45 <joeri_poeri[m]> <cx2[m] "if the Stock keyboard isn't doin"> I think for me the main reason of using a keyboard other than the default one is that I didn't find a way to get my main language (Dutch) working fully with auto correct actually working ( I'm a sloppy typer)
19:40:57 <blacklight447[m]> <cx2[m] "True. no doubt... but PTIO is al"> stir the pot?
19:41:10 <gervarouge[m]> I suggested that Privacy Badger was bad and PTIO removed it after a short discussion
19:41:22 <blacklight447[m]> <joeri_poeri[m] "I think for me the main reason o"> if you need support in dutch, i can help you (hallo makker)
19:41:23 <joeri_poeri[m]> <cx2[m] "if the Stock keyboard isn't doin"> open board uses the system spell checker right?
19:41:33 <gervarouge[m]> While I have disagreements on some of their choices they are pretty transparent
19:42:09 <cx2[m]> <joeri_poeri[m] "I think for me the main reason o"> hmmm...Maybe AnySoft Keyboard? I would imagine they have your native language. I will say that I have heard mixed reviews when using it on GOS. But it's worth a shot for sure. I have used it on other devices and it worked great.
19:42:22 <hitchhooker[m]> got url to arguments why privacybadger is bad?
19:42:28 <cx2[m]> <gervarouge[m] "While I have disagreements on so"> Also agree.
19:43:36 <blacklight447[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "got url to arguments why privacy"> privacybadger isnt bad, but its usefullness is limited
19:44:23 <cx2[m]> PrivacyPossum on the other hand, so far it seems pretty neat
19:45:08 <joeri_poeri[m]> <cx2[m] "hmmm...Maybe AnySoft Keyboard? I"> yeah this is coming from anysoftkeyboard. honestly the thing I miss most is the system haptics lol
19:46:02 <cx2[m]> Admittedly, haptics are not great.... I find myself wanting to dismember this iphone, and figure out a way to stuff the haptic engine into this pixel
19:46:13 <cx2[m]> Apple takes the cake there.
19:50:52 <gervarouge[m]> I sure like Apple
19:51:33 <gervarouge[m]> I don't like the repairability, but that's a small price to pay for the data trade you sign up for with other brands
19:52:08 <gervarouge[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "got url to arguments why privacy"> Yeah one sec, the js injection is bad it's bypassable

19:56:41 <blacklight447[m]> cx2:  so what did you exactly mean with " stir the pot"
19:58:20 <cx2[m]> blacklight447: Oh well this has the possibility of getting some providers removed.... some providers that IF removed, would be akin to, "Wait, you mean Santa isn't real and there is no easter bunny??"
19:59:05 <cx2[m]> I guess "stir the pot" is the wrong way to phrase it... maybe "shake things up"
19:59:22 <blacklight447[m]> <cx2[m] "blacklight447: Oh well this has "> who knows, we can push some of them to do stuff properly
19:59:47 <cx2[m]> Also true.... and pretty f-ing rad
20:00:31 <blacklight447[m]> when we published  our 2020 requirements,, lots of provider actually did implement changes to stay listed
20:00:35 <blacklight447[m]> lots of them didnt do mta-sts and tls-rpt
20:01:26 <gervarouge[m]> Somehow Debian, Firefox, and Lineage are still on the list
20:01:32 <blacklight447[m]> its nice to know that these days, we have enough influence that use delisting you actually can significantly hurt your reputation as a provider
20:01:50 <blacklight447[m]> a responability that should be used carefully
20:02:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah man! O_O
20:12:21 <JTL> blacklight447[m]: Very nice
20:14:05 <blacklight447[m]> :) all for the good cause
20:15:36 <blacklight447[m]> doing everything publicly like this is also an effort to keep out bias
20:16:00 <blacklight447[m]> makes it easy for outsiders to call us out on decisions
20:16:02 <blacklight447[m]> keeps us sharp
20:16:33 <cx2[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Somehow Debian, Firefox, and Lin"> Agreed here... I am not AS keen on the implications of Debian, and Firefox...but have definitely learned recently.... Lineage on the other hand. Yikes.
20:16:46 <gervarouge[m]> Will you guys ever consider recommending what's recommended here? Running the stock rom with gapps disabled over installing Lineage?
20:18:01 <TheJollyRoger> Well,
20:18:13 <hitchhooker[m]> why lineage is so bad?
20:18:17 <blacklight447[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Will you guys ever consider reco"> well i would agree with that
20:18:33 <TheJollyRoger> if I ever suddenly hear a chorus of cries of shock, despair, and agony from the Toxic Power Users all across the world from up north here in Canada...
20:18:34 <blacklight447[m]> its just that privacytools is my opion, its the opinion of the entire team and community
20:18:36 <TheJollyRoger> I'll know what happened :D
20:19:01 <madaidan[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "why lineage is so bad?"> Disables verified boot, uses userdebug builds, doesn't ship firmware updates etc.
20:19:16 <blacklight447[m]> as a core member i have quite some influence, but i have no power to delist something or list something myself, with good reason
20:19:17 <gervarouge[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "why lineage is so bad?"> The lack of verified boot, lying about security patches, and debugging paths
20:19:27 <blacklight447[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "why lineage is so bad?"> unlocked bootloader is required to run it
20:19:41 <blacklight447[m]> it uses debug builds, which increases attack surface
20:20:06 <blacklight447[m]> hmm, maybe i can open a pull request to atleast slap a warning label on there
20:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> hitchhooker[m]: the reason why we've shied away from LineageOS here is partially because LineageOS deliberately opts not to use verified boot or any of the bootloader security features and significantly rolls back the Android SELinux mandatory access control security policies; this is often seen as desirable to people who want to play sysadmin with their phones and have extra toggles, buttons,
20:20:24 <TheJollyRoger> and tunables to futz with, but this is a horrifying pandora's box for security and privacy.
20:20:42 <blacklight447[m]> i think i can convince the other to atleast meet me midway here
20:21:52 <gervarouge[m]> Yeah that's a good idea, stock rom with everything disabled is virtually always better
20:23:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. At least with the factory operating system, if your phone gets exploited by Android Malware, and that exploit manages to break out of or somehow exploit something outside of the Android Sandbox, as long as you reboot, the Verified Boot should restore your trusted partition to a known good state.
20:23:09 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't have verified boot...?
20:23:12 <TheJollyRoger> That compromise is persistent.
20:23:22 <hitchhooker[m]> is there really secure custom roms?
20:23:23 <TheJollyRoger> And you'll never know.
20:23:42 <TheJollyRoger> hitchhooker[m]: there is no such thing as a "custom ROM" unless you plan to delid the SOC and close or burn e-fuses.
20:23:48 <madaidan[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "is there really secure custom ro"> GrapheneOS
20:23:57 <madaidan[m]> Although "custom rom" is a bad name
20:24:10 <TheJollyRoger> Phones haven't loaded their operating systems from electronically erasable programmable read only flash memory for generations.
20:24:40 <cx2[m]> I am just a driveby privacy advocate no sense in lying about it.... though i have been at it for quite some time.
20:24:40 <cx2[m]> But with opinions like those from Stcat, TheJollyRoger, madaidan., I looked into Lineage for my uneducated self.... and fucking yikes, man.
20:24:40 <cx2[m]> In short, I can't imagine it would be too hard to convince your fellow admins on PTIO. This one is really a doozy. I mean, are the se 10s of thousands of LOS users REALLY re-flashing their phones every single month?? And even then, what is that doing?
20:24:49 <TheJollyRoger> hitchhooker[m]: if you're looking for a secure mobile operating system besides the one that it came with, you should simply run GrapheneOS.
20:25:17 <gervarouge[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "is there really secure custom ro"> CalyxOS is very good
20:25:39 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, or CalyxOS! Which also uses verified boot and remote attestation, and cdesai is here!
20:26:31 <gervarouge[m]> GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, and iOS are definitely the top notch options
20:26:34 <gervarouge[m]> I wouldn't use anything else
20:26:55 <TheJollyRoger> I've been meaning to someday check out an iPhone but... I never find the time or money to >_<.
20:28:01 <cx2[m]> <gervarouge[m] "GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, and iOS are"> Couldn't agree more... have collected them on... a few times over.
20:28:10 <hitchhooker[m]> so lets say I have Xiaomis Redmi device which I want to run without leaking too much data. you recommend that best option is to run debloated MIUI with disabled gapps, instead of using some custom OS from xda?
20:28:34 <gervarouge[m]> Get an older one like an iPhone SE (2016) TheJollyRoger
20:28:38 <gervarouge[m]> $50
20:28:47 <hitchhooker[m]> or is the argument that privacy is not available for under 300 dollar devices?
20:28:47 <gervarouge[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "so lets say I have Xiaomis Redmi"> Exactly
20:29:21 <madaidan[m]> I will never get why people think installing random operating systems from random people on some forum is a good idea
20:29:34 <gervarouge[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "or is the argument that privacy "> You can get used iPhones that have a lot of time left for under $300 easily
20:30:08 <gervarouge[m]> iPhone 8 can be under $200 and has more time left than a Pixel 3a
20:30:12 <gervarouge[m]> Cheap privacy is definitely an old iPhone
20:30:37 <TheJollyRoger> hitchhooker[m]: Yes.
20:31:00 <hitchhooker[m]> madaidan, have you used 100e android phone with default settings? running anything else on that device feels suddenly good idea
20:31:53 <joeri_poeri[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "so lets say I have Xiaomis Redmi"> is there an operating system like calyxos for it? I don't know what other options there are but I'd recommend going with any mainstream open source distribution for your device.
20:32:11 <blacklight447[m]> <madaidan[m] "I will never get why people thin"> because a guy on the internet said it was
20:32:18 <blacklight447[m]> just like we are just random guys on the internet saying it isnt
20:32:35 <TheJollyRoger> I get the impression it's what I call the "Antigoogle at any cost" mentality.
20:32:54 <TheJollyRoger> Or "Throwing the Baby Out With The Bathwater."
20:33:24 <blacklight447[m]> lmao
20:34:08 <TheJollyRoger> It's kinda funny, but I see this all the time, where people would rather trust a shady VPN service provider out of Panama run by god knows who, because they think that Tor can't be trusted because the idea of onion routing came from a research lab in the United States Navy.
20:34:16 <gervarouge[m]> Honestly I trust Google more than most companies
20:34:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Lot of it feels like ego.
20:36:01 <gervarouge[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah. Lot of it feels like ego."> What do you mean I can't trust anyone who says they build from open source code I've never looked at and have a "good" privacy policy I've never read
20:36:13 <TheJollyRoger> Eheheehehehe
20:36:19 <cx2[m]> <TheJollyRoger "It's kinda funny, but I see this"> Annnnndddd is continuously funded by the US GOV.... I mean, I could see some concern there. But agreed
20:36:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.

20:39:50 <blacklight447[m]> we are redoing our jurisdiction section
20:40:20 <blacklight447[m]> we will stop focussing on the whole "eyes" thing, and more talk about inter country relations in general
20:40:27 <gervarouge[m]> The US came a long way they deserve some credit for that
20:40:41 <blacklight447[m]> what kind of allieaces can be made,  commonly used loopholes in law, gag orders, etc
20:40:46 <blacklight447[m]> and then use the eyes as just an example of such an allience
20:40:49 <cx2[m]> <blacklight447[m] "we are actually talking about dr"> Don't get me wrong.... I think it's still well thought out and in a lot of cases, Likely reasonable.
20:40:51 <gervarouge[m]> The fact that you can see a number of government requests and they even are allowing NSLs to be published
20:41:20 <TheJollyRoger> Horay for critical thinking and nuances :D
20:41:32 <cx2[m]> <gervarouge[m] "The US came a long way they dese"> What do you mean?
20:41:55 <cx2[m]> California specifically is making some strides that is giving silicon valley night terrors.
20:41:58 <blacklight447[m]> the issue with the eyes is, we don't know what or alliences are out there these days, and we don't want people to get a false sense of security because its not in an eyes country
20:42:42 <gervarouge[m]> The laws from Congress mostly 2015
20:42:51 <blacklight447[m]> this way we also wanna remind folks that there are people outside the us, or even the western world for that matter
20:43:02 <gervarouge[m]> The transparency laws
20:43:11 <blacklight447[m]> sure, i wouldnt trust an american email service if i was a whislteblower in the us
20:43:16 <cx2[m]> <blacklight447[m] "the issue with the eyes is, we d"> Makes total sense... and I think you're right.... It's almost like a blank check because the "eyes' have been ridden so ferociously, that if it's a service not belonging to an "eye" it automatically gets major bonus points.
20:43:43 <blacklight447[m]> but if i was a chinese or russian whsileblower, then using a US based service might not even be that unreasonable
20:43:57 <gervarouge[m]> Exactly
20:44:22 <cx2[m]> <blacklight447[m] "but if i was a chinese or russia"> Be willing to bet if that were the exact case..... there would be safe haven to say the least. hahahaha
20:44:33 <blacklight447[m]> as china and russia arent exactly buddies with the us
20:44:35 <blacklight447[m]> and are therefore unlikely to share intellgence with eachother if they dont have to
20:45:22 <TheJollyRoger> Fortunately, when it comes to businesses hosted in the United States...
20:46:47 <gervarouge[m]> How is Canada?
20:47:18 <TheJollyRoger> I got a great big felt cowboy hat and a stuffed bald eagle an electric guitar and I'm pretty good at cooking, so my plan is to post lots of videos of myself playing the National Anthem with my hat on and the bald eagle on my shoulder while eating a hamburger with seven meat patties in it, and hopefully that should fool the NSA's AI by overloading them with patriotic images so much it lowers my
20:47:20 <TheJollyRoger> "IS_TERRORIST_POSSIBLE" score
20:48:08 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm joking, in case anyone can't tell)
20:48:43 <TheJollyRoger> Although I kind of do have to admit, trying to play the guitar and eat a hamburger with seven meat patties in it at the same time would kind of be an impressive stunt.

20:51:04 <blacklight447[m]> anyway, i appriciate you guys thoughts
20:51:25 <blacklight447[m]> we just try to improve PrivacyTools day by day :)
20:51:38 <cx2[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I got a great big felt cowboy ha"> Definitely think the *stuffed* bald eagle part might get a few riled up...
20:51:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
20:51:48 <sel[m]3> <blacklight447[m] "the issue with the eyes is, we d"> Yes, I feel like people are too much trusting with "Swiss Laws" or some other laws for example while disregarding everything else
20:51:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe. Well, I'll have to go to the zoo then and ask them if they'll let me borrow the real one :D
20:52:06 <gervarouge[m]> Glad to see what you guys do
20:52:30 <sel[m]3> This is very bad
20:52:34 <gervarouge[m]> I'm Swiss you can trust me. Give me your SSN
20:52:38 <sel[m]3> <gervarouge[m] "I'm Swiss you can trust me. Give"> I'm even better
20:53:02 <sel[m]3> Cuz I'm from Iceland :^)
20:53:12 <blacklight447[m]> <sel[m]3 "This is very bad"> whats bad?
20:53:17 <blacklight447[m]> ah
20:53:27 <TheJollyRoger> Lucky duck, iceland!
20:53:29 <gervarouge[m]> <sel[m]3 "Cuz I'm from Iceland :^)"> I'm sorry you're superior
20:53:29 <cx2[m]> yeah +1 for what you're doing blacklight447 Certainly isn't a perfect answer that's for sure. But is many cases, an *answer* is better than the alternative.
20:53:39 <sel[m]3> <blacklight447[m] "whats bad?"> Trusting a provider based solely on where it's geographically located
20:53:59 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back shortly!
20:54:03 <gervarouge[m]> My cloud service provider is based in the US
20:54:12 <blacklight447[m]> <sel[m]3 "Trusting a provider based solely"> yep, thats moronic indeed
20:54:12 <gervarouge[m]> The guy is 100% trustworthy
20:54:29 <sel[m]3> <sel[m]3 "Cuz I'm from Iceland :^)"> Missed an /s there btw
20:54:29 <cx2[m]> *TheJollyRoger leaves to hide his stuffed bald eagle.
20:55:03 <blacklight447[m]> fun fact, i personally think cloud providers don't matter at all
20:55:23 <blacklight447[m]> i mean, if your having to trust your cloud provider, then you already made a mistake: not encrypting your data before it leaves your machine
20:55:27 <gervarouge[m]> I am a self hoster only I'm kidding
20:55:28 <gervarouge[m]> I am the guy
20:55:33 <blacklight447[m]> cloud data should never leave your device in plaintext form if you ask me
20:56:12 <sel[m]3> Agree
20:56:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. If you rely on your computer to do the encryption (rather than a web application), all they'll get is the ciphertext produced by the program.
20:56:32 <sel[m]3> It's not the cloud, it's someone else's drive ;)
20:56:35 <TheJollyRoger> Ehehehe
20:57:03 <TheJollyRoger> I've been experimenting using backurypt and I'm going to try to make it a tad bit better before I post it.
20:57:05 <blacklight447[m]> i mean we can do it for calenders and password managers, no reason why we cannot do it for normal data like documents
20:57:14 <TheJollyRoger> Thinking maybe in the future I could use python once I learn python.
20:57:40 <blacklight447[m]> and if its encrypted, your provider wont be able to see it anyway
20:57:56 <blacklight447[m]> so thats why i could care less about what provider you use, whether its spider oak or google drive
20:58:00 <cx2[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Thinking maybe in the future I c"> for backurypt?
20:58:31 <TheJollyRoger> cx2[m]: yeah, I've wanted to improve on Backurypt. I haven't had time to put in more work on it yet though.
20:58:42 <sel[m]3> <blacklight447[m] "and if its encrypted, your provi"> Though, I've seen one concern stating that cloud providers could thetorically break your current encryption in the far future
20:58:46 <sel[m]3> Weather they do it or not is something else
20:59:22 <gervarouge[m]> Well VeraCrypt and the like is bad for cloud storage
20:59:32 <gervarouge[m]> It's not meant to be observed with changes
20:59:42 <cx2[m]> <blacklight447[m] "and if its encrypted, your provi"> How do you feel about Cryptomator? I have a hard time geting into the weeds with the technicals of encryption..... have relied on TheJollyRoger for that education bit. But if you had a Cryptomator RAGE / AGE like implementation, that would be the business
20:59:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Use something like age, or Tarsnap.
21:00:18 <blacklight447[m]> <sel[m]3 "Though, I've seen one concern st"> your most likely thinking about quantum computers
21:00:20 <blacklight447[m]> thats indeed far in the future
21:00:28 <blacklight447[m]> <cx2[m] "How do you feel about Cryptomato"> we do like cryptomator, but do note that their mobile apps are closed source
21:00:31 <sel[m]3> Maybe that's the one
21:00:53 <blacklight447[m]> https://www.privacytools.io/software/encryption-tools/
21:00:54 <cx2[m]> <blacklight447[m] "we do like cryptomator, but do n"> yeah saw that...
21:01:01 <gervarouge[m]> Can you run Cryptomator with a Linux terminal on Android and iOS?
21:01:34 <blacklight447[m]> <gervarouge[m] "Can you run Cryptomator with a L"> good question
21:01:38 <cx2[m]> blacklight447: My question though: Is the scheme on par with AGE? I mean I know it's the new hottness, but is it at least in the same catagory?
21:01:41 <TheJollyRoger> Note that even if someone magically creates a Quantum Computer powerful enough to break public key operations, stuff encrypted with symmetric keys will remain safe.
21:01:50 <blacklight447[m]> never tried that tbh
21:01:56 <blacklight447[m]> btw
21:02:07 <TheJollyRoger> And I gotta run again >_<.
21:02:10 <blacklight447[m]> ill let you in on a little gem on the fdroid store called EDS lite
21:02:17 <TheJollyRoger> **to break EXISTING public key operations.
21:02:21 <gervarouge[m]> That's go the same issues as VeraCrypt
21:02:26 <blacklight447[m]> it can open veracrypt truecrypt and luks containers on your phone
21:02:34 <blacklight447[m]> it can also create them
21:02:38 <gervarouge[m]> I'd only use it on trustworthy cloud service providers
21:03:04 <blacklight447[m]> its like a veracrypt install on your phone for veracrypt vaults, pretty neat
21:03:22 <cx2[m]> <gervarouge[m] "I'd only use it on trustworthy c"> which service are you speaking to?
21:03:42 <blacklight447[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Note that even if someone magica"> only if your key is longer then 128 bits though, so 128 bits will not be safe, but 192 or 256 would be
21:04:10 <gervarouge[m]> I would only use EDS Lite or VeraCrypt on Tresorit or SpiderOak
21:05:33 <cis-166871[m]> Or using EDS Lite with a sever at a Co-op data center with nextcloud.
21:06:07 <TheJollyRoger> blacklight447[m]: right, 128 bit will be halved to 64 bit strength equivalency by Grover's algorithm. Heh, thanks.
21:06:28 <gervarouge[m]> The main problem is VeraCrypt is not built for the cloud
21:06:40 <gervarouge[m]> It's optimized for drives
21:07:05 <blacklight447[m]> <TheJollyRoger "blacklight447: right, 128 bit wi"> exactly
21:07:11 <gervarouge[m]> The security model is very different
21:07:52 <blacklight447[m]> <gervarouge[m] "It's optimized for drives"> well, that could be enough, depending on what your using it for
21:08:18 <Guest32> Hello I got a question. I try unlocking bootloader but i need help
21:08:21 <blacklight447[m]> if you just have a crapton of old photos you want a backup of in the cloud, a veracrypt volume will suit you perfectly
21:08:35 <gervarouge[m]> Just don't change the contents without changing the keys
21:09:14 <sel[m]3> <TheJollyRoger "Note that even if someone magica"> Yeah, symmetric encryption is very resistant to Quantum Computers as opposed to asymmetric encryption
21:10:18 <Guest32> i got a pixel 3a i did "Enabling OEM unlocking" and when i run the fastboot on windows PC and i put in the command "adb devices" it does find the device. So far so good
21:11:58 <Guest32> then i type in "adb reboot bootloader" and the pixel starts in "Fastboot Mode" but from then on the pixel doesn t seem to take the commands like "fastboot flashing unlock"
21:13:23 <gervarouge[m]> You are sure it's not a carrier version right?
21:13:33 <Guest32> what does that mean?
21:13:50 <Guest32> in the fastboot Mode it says "Device state: locked"
21:14:19 <gervarouge[m]> Where did you buy your pixel?
21:14:44 <Guest32> in a department store it is not branded to a carrier
21:15:38 <gervarouge[m]> It's unlocked carrier?
21:15:47 <gervarouge[m]> Okay
21:16:22 <Guest32> any ideas what to do?
21:16:45 <gervarouge[m]> Try a different cable?
21:16:53 <gervarouge[m]> Make sure you're on the latest adb
21:16:57 <Guest32> it is the original cable
21:17:02 <Guest32> just bought it
21:17:13 <gervarouge[m]> You do have it trusted ADB device?
21:17:19 <Guest32> as I said the "platform-tools" recognize the device
21:17:22 <gervarouge[m]> <Guest32 "it is the original cable"> Try another
21:17:24 <Guest32> when the device is on
21:17:55 <Guest32> jus twhen it boots to fastbood mode then it doesn t work
21:19:45 <Guest32> trusted ADB device?
21:21:19 <Guest32> what does it mean?
21:21:23 <nscnt> Guest32: Just follow https://grapheneos.org/install
21:21:53 <Guest32> i did
21:22:32 <nscnt> You were writing about commands which are not in the official install guide.
21:22:47 <Guest32> yeah i tried researching
21:23:46 <Guest32> so when the phone is booted normally i can connect with the Windows PC with the plattform-tools to the phone via the command "adb devices"
21:24:00 <Guest32> it shoes me a list with the pixel phone
21:24:25 <Guest32> then i type in "adb reboot bootloader" and the phone boots to the "Fastboot Mode"
21:24:49 <nscnt> That's not the official guide.
21:24:49 <Guest32> next step would be to put iin the command "fastboot flashing unlock" right?
21:25:17 <Guest32> yeah i tried it also by tswitching the phone of and starting presssing the two bottons
21:25:24 <Guest32> brtings me also in the fast mode
21:25:34 <Guest32> *fastboot mode
21:25:40 <Guest32> right?
21:26:02 <Guest32> i just ried to explain you better how things look for me
21:26:10 <mmcblk0[m]> how to use mail.grapheneos.org?
21:27:10 <Guest32> Did you understand my problem?
21:27:47 <nscnt> Guest32: Where did you get the platform tools from?
21:27:50 <Guest32> In other words: When i am in the Fastboot Mode it doesn t accept my "fastboot flashing unlock" command
21:28:09 <Guest32> https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.0-linux.zip
21:28:24 <nscnt> mmcblk0[m]: What do you want to use?
21:28:32 <Guest32> this one: https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.0-windows.zip
21:31:55 <nscnt> Guest32: If you insist that you're following the official guide, I don't know what could be the issue.
21:51:21 <dazinism> Guest32: try fastboot --version
21:51:58 <cis-166871[m]> Are you using sudo?
21:52:26 <cis-166871[m]> I know on Linux you can't run fastboot commands without sudo (unless you are root)
21:52:37 <Guest32> TheJollyRoger
21:53:03 <JTL> cis-166871[m]: Can be avoided with udev configuration
21:54:19 <Guest32> "fastboot --version" gives back "fastboot version 30.0.0-6374843"
21:56:39 <dazinism> Thats right then
21:56:57 <Guest32> when i put in the command "fastboot flashing lock"  then it just says <waiting for any device>
21:57:35 <dazinism> Could be your lead or  the USB port on the computer. Try other ones if you can
21:58:13 <Guest32> the cable i just bought today and of this type pf USB port i just got that one
21:58:43 <dazinism> Usb C on the computer end?
21:58:49 <Guest32> yes
22:00:31 <Guest32> any ideas?
22:01:11 <dazinism> Would definitely be worth trying a different lead and a different port. Often can be the issue
22:01:22 <Guest32> i might have a hint so when i put in the command: "adb devices"
22:01:23 <Guest32> (this should normally list the devices)
22:01:23 <Guest32> it gives back "adb server version (39) doesn't match this client (41); killing.."
22:01:42 <Guest32> does that help you?
22:03:01 <dazinism> Its common for USB C to be not implemented well on computer end
22:03:03 <dazinism> https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting
22:03:13 <dazinism> *not uncommon
22:03:50 <Guest32> whats does that mean, do i need to update drivers or what?
22:06:03 <dazinism> Best to get hold of a decent USB A to USB C and try that
22:06:33 <cis-166871[m]> Do you feel comfortable with a live boot USB? That way you could see if it's a driver problem/os problem.
22:06:45 <dazinism> usb A to usb C cable
22:11:11 <Guest32> What is a "a live boot USB"?
22:11:28 <Guest32> well i don t have a converter but i guess i could get one
22:12:58 <dazinism> Guest32: could try
22:13:47 <dazinism> fastboot devices
22:14:04 <dazinism> Only got usb C on the computer?
22:15:02 <Guest32> one usb c and many usb a
22:15:20 <Guest32> but the cable of the phone is USB C and i got no converter so far
22:15:29 <Guest32> fastboot devices? is this a command?
22:15:41 <dazinism> Yeah its a command
22:19:03 <headgas[m]> Ok so im back on my pixel 4 xl since you guys said it was safer than my Nexus 5 running Ubuntu touch. I have Google deleted and everything I can think of to de-google as much as I can. I know I can't delete play services. But I have fdroid and replaced everything I can think of with apps from there. Anything else I can do until grapheneos or something is available for my phone?
22:30:45 <cis-166871[m]> Guest32: live boot is installing a full Linux distro on a flash drive or cd (what ever media you like) and using that for installing Grapheneos. I only use Linux so I have no idea of the use with Windows. On Linux it was like at 10 15 min install process.
22:31:13 <cis-166871[m]> Kali Nethunter install was easier on Linux than Windows for me as wepl
22:31:18 <cis-166871[m]> Well
22:36:20 <Guest932> Hey, i am back
22:36:42 <Guest932> did you have any ideas what to do next?
22:42:17 <Guest932> What does "On Windows:
22:42:18 <Guest932> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"" mean?
22:42:33 <Guest932> is it bad if i didn't do it?
22:43:47 <Guest932> oh yes i did that
22:44:33 <dazinism> Did you try
22:44:44 <dazinism> fastboot devices
22:45:43 <Guest932> fastboot devices in the command line didn t do anything
22:46:55 <cis-166871[m]> Yeah the only time I have seen a computer detect recovery and adb but not fastboot was if the bootloader was locked.
22:48:54 <Guest932> yeah the bootloader is locked right? Because in the "Fastboot Mode" menu it says "Device state: Locked" that means bootloader is locked right?
22:50:03 <cis-166871[m]> Yeah. The bootloader needs to be unlocked in order to run fastboot. At least that's my understanding. I'm sure if I'm wrong the people here would be the ones to correct me lol.
22:51:04 <dazinism> If i'm not getting confused, fastboot flashing unlock should change that to say unlocked
22:51:53 <dazinism> fastboot isnt working for you..
22:52:31 <dazinism> Its been a long time since I last used windows...
22:53:04 <Guest932> "fastboot flashing unlock" command -> give me back "< waiting for any device >"
22:54:02 <dazinism> fastboot devices should show your phone
22:55:35 <Guest932> "fastboot devices" shows me just an emty command line
22:56:43 <Guest932> if i put in "adb devices" when the phone is turned on (not in Fastboot Mode" then it shows me my phone
23:00:38 <sea2clowns> guest932 - have you enabled OEM unlocking?
23:01:26 <cis-166871[m]> Guest932: I have sent you some direct messages to offer more assistance.
23:01:43 <Guest932> guest932 - have you enabled OEM unlocking? -> YES
23:08:17 <yzernik> How does the over-the-air update work? Does my phone connect to a central server somewhere to get software updates when there is a new grapheneos release?
23:12:20 <dazinism> yzernik: yes, it checks for updates
23:12:53 <dazinism> All happens automatically, tells you when its got an update and is ready to reboot
23:14:38 <dazinism> Guest932: possibly fastboot doesnt have the correct privilage.
23:14:48 <dazinism> You entered
23:14:57 <dazinism> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
23:16:48 <dazinism> yzernik: theres some settings under settings>system>advanced>updates
23:21:09 <Guest932> dazinism how do i give "fastboot  the correct privilage"?
23:23:37 <sea2clowns> it sounds like his PATH is fine as fastboot is running/reporting proper version
23:24:57 <sea2clowns> you can run command prompt as admin
23:25:24 <sea2clowns> not sure that it changes anything in windows, not used fastboot in win before for flashing
23:32:38 <yzernik> dazinism: thanks. how do i verify that software updates are not malicious? Does the OS have the PGP key of the developer built in?
23:33:26 <JTL> Not PGP but it has signed updates built in
23:34:40 <yzernik> JTL: thanks. do you know what kind of signature it uses? does the private key belong to the lead developer?
23:35:16 <JTL> Re: kind of signature. I don't recall off hand, but I do know the private key does belong to the lead developer
23:40:18 <dazinism> yzernik: the updates are checked two, or maybe three times before you could actually use them.  Its a solid system.
