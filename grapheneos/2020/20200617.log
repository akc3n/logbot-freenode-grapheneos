04:10:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> josh.man: what about audio?
04:11:41 <yolotro[m]> if i remember there is no audio as well, you need to use usbc headphones with builtic dac
04:11:52 <yolotro[m]> builtin*
04:12:10 <yolotro[m]> so you can't use an usb to jack adapter
04:12:21 <yolotro[m]> or you need one with a built in DAC
04:12:41 <strcat[m]> yolotro: it used to be supported on Nexus devices, it went away from lack of usage probably
04:13:17 <strcat[m]> yolotro: there is digital USB-C audio - adapters work fine as long as they have a DAC like the one that comes with the device
04:13:53 <yolotro[m]> yea i know but some devices can work with an adapter without dac
04:14:49 <strcat[m]> sure, modern headphones using USB-C digital audio
04:15:10 <strcat[m]> instead of having a low quality DAC in a phone send a poorly converted signal through a long poorly shielded cable
04:15:53 <strcat[m]> and there isn't the issue of not having enough power to drive fancy headphones
04:16:17 <yolotro[m]> no, i mean on some android you can use a usbC to jack adapter that don't have a  builtin dac
04:16:49 <strcat[m]> if they still use analog audio why did they remove the analog jack>
04:16:49 <yolotro[m]> that's all, i'm using usbC headset
04:16:52 <strcat[m]>  * if they still use analog audio why did they remove the analog jack?
04:17:22 <yolotro[m]> i don't know
04:18:37 <strcat[m]> analog USB-C audio is weird and really shouldn't be a thing
04:18:51 <strcat[m]> causes a lot of confusion for users
04:18:56 <strcat[m]> and they waste money on products that won't work
04:19:00 <strcat[m]> maybe that's the point
04:19:11 <yolotro[m]> i see that the DAC is a part of the SoC so they don't have to add a DAC
04:19:13 <JTL> I've had similar thoughts too and wouldn't be surprised
04:19:16 <JTL> :/
04:20:47 <strcat[m]> yolotro: it's an anti-feature confusing to end users giving them lower quality audio - that's why it's not supported
04:22:18 <strcat[m]> USB-C audio should be digital only
04:22:29 <strcat[m]> but they came up with a hack to still support analog audio by sending it over the data pins
04:22:42 <JTL> I was going to ask how USB-C analog audio works
04:22:53 <strcat[m]> and you'll get lower quality than an actual analog audio cable/jack
04:23:00 <JTL> I've always thought that was rather janky
04:23:01 <strcat[m]> because it's not meant for that and not shielded for that
04:23:33 <strcat[m]> JTL: it's just an awful hack to support switching to a mode where it sends analog audio signal via data pins
04:23:43 <JTL> right...
04:23:45 <strcat[m]> should not exist
04:23:58 <strcat[m]> really confusing for users that there is a lower tier class of USB-C audio hardware using analog audio instead of digital audi
04:24:03 <strcat[m]>  * really confusing for users that there is a lower tier class of USB-C audio hardware using analog audio instead of digital audio
04:24:42 <yolotro[m]> there is even usbC headsets that use analog lmao?
04:25:02 <yolotro[m]> i guess so
04:25:26 <strcat[m]> yolotro: yes and they are terrible
04:25:36 <strcat[m]> it's an even worse way of doing it than the legacy analog jack + cables
04:26:18 <yolotro[m]> i would probably not notice lol i'm one of those guys that can't differentiate "good" sound vs "bad" sound anyways
04:26:18 <strcat[m]> since the cable isn't properly shielded for that - the lines it uses aren't really shielded from the others
04:26:30 <strcat[m]> and headphone companies can use power from the phone since it's USB
04:26:31 <strcat[m]> so it fucks up the signal even more
04:26:46 <strcat[m]> they are shielded a bit but not to protect an analog signal
04:27:05 <strcat[m]> yolotro: well it's easy to notice the static, etc. with analog audio
04:27:33 <strcat[m]> yolotro: ideally gets converted to analog right next to the speakers in a properly shielded place
04:27:44 <strcat[m]> a cable basically acts as a big antenna
04:27:45 <strcat[m]> and now you have
04:28:01 <strcat[m]> analog headphones drawing power from the phone (which they couldn't do before) via the same cable they use to send this janky signal
04:29:39 <strcat[m]> for noise cancelling, amplifying the sound (since the phone doesn't dedicate much power to producing a strong signal), and whatever gimmicks they do
04:29:55 <strcat[m]> like making fake surround sound with some high latency stupid garbage in the headphones
04:30:08 <strcat[m]> yolotro: it's just dumb that analog USB-C audio exists
04:30:27 <strcat[m]> yolotro:  users shouldn't have to worry about analog vs. digital and compatibility
04:30:44 <strcat[m]> yolotro: and shouldn't have to deal with quality of cables, etc.

04:32:02 <yolotro[m]> i get it
04:33:23 <concat[m]> <yolotro[m] "i get it "> lmao that's actually kind of a funny response, dude rambles too much
04:33:46 <yolotro[m]> lol
04:35:01 <yolotro[m]> at least i have learned some things
04:37:31 <yolotro[m]> now i wonder if my noise canceling usbc headset is analog or no
04:38:02 <yolotro[m]> but i don't mind much the sound is great
04:38:03 <yolotro[m]> and the noise canceling is working well
04:39:27 <yolotro[m]> i will try it on a pixel when i will get one so i will know
04:39:51 <concat[m]> analogs are a good blast to the past
04:39:55 <concat[m]> analog computing is interesting historically
04:39:56 <concat[m]> If your headset has the placebo effect or actually work it doesn't matter as long as you don't notice
04:39:58 <concat[m]> at least I've always thought that way
04:42:14 <yolotro[m]> i'm no sure if i should get a pixel 4 with a big top bezel and a power hungry SoC or wait for the borderless pixel 4a with a less power hungry SoC
04:42:35 <yolotro[m]> i have been waiting forever already
04:49:07 <yolotro[m]> i may just buy some used pixel3
04:51:23 <fluoridatedsheep> you can get them pretty cheap. saw decent unlocked refurbs at wallymart for 174$
04:54:46 <yolotro[m]> yea i'm going to do that i guess, i feel like its a downgrade from my almost 2017 bordeless mix2 with a larger battery but i can't handle the terrible security part anymore
04:55:40 <fluoridatedsheep> thats fair.. my biggest problem is that I have my google voice as my main... and gapps not be an option :/
04:56:15 <yolotro[m]> i"m already google free so that's ok for me

04:58:01 <salvoromega[m]> Or at least a Sim provider that doesn't ask for large quantities of info...
04:58:22 <fluoridatedsheep> i mean they still have your daily routines
04:58:52 <fluoridatedsheep> even if you do a prepay like mintsim, privacy is there.. but its still routing through the same shit thats collected by ICs
04:59:27 <yolotro[m]> come inEU, they don't sell those datas
04:59:54 <fluoridatedsheep> even if they dont sell, guarantee they collect and analyze
05:00:14 <yolotro[m]> oh i don't mind about that if they dont sell it
05:00:35 <fluoridatedsheep> thats the main thing i do mind
05:00:46 <yolotro[m]> 😀
05:01:05 <yolotro[m]> why do u mind?
05:01:32 <fluoridatedsheep> because i don't believe they have the right to know whether i have something to hide

05:23:18 <furofuro_01[m]> Before buying it, that is.
05:25:36 <yolotro[m]> i guess by buying from the legit sites  and not ebay or amazon
05:25:46 <yolotro[m]> but the price isn't the same
05:26:16 <yolotro[m]> i have no clue of the cheap ones are working well, there is probably some reviews on internet
05:27:24 <furofuro_01[m]> fair enough, was talking about the specs of faraday itself, or a well-known faraday bag seller
05:28:02 <furofuro_01[m]> I kinda doubt it if it comes from China though
05:31:00 <furofuro_01[m]> No offense though, CCP is an adversary against privacy, and companies built there must be regulated by them.
05:31:18 <furofuro_01[m]> At least, most of them...
05:31:25 <yolotro[m]> isn't the same in the US?
05:31:40 <yolotro[m]> they have to comply as well if i remember
05:33:04 <yolotro[m]> lavamail had to close for exemple otherwise they had to comply
05:33:14 <furofuro_01[m]> CCP is slightly tighter than US, given their government
05:34:42 <furofuro_01[m]> US is the slightly better option here.
05:34:43 <furofuro_01[m]> <yolotro[m] "lavamail had to close for exempl"> Talking about products, but yeah.

05:46:43 <furofuro_01[m]> They have the vulnerabilities of Android and Linux 1 month ahead, according to an ad-tech
05:46:46 <yolotro[m]> didn't it have been debunked? trump itself said that it's was ok to authorize huawei again if the US can make a market deal with china, so if they are spying why authorize them?

05:47:44 <furofuro_01[m]> Authorization != no spying
05:48:09 <furofuro_01[m]> You're expecting China to tell the truth, just like any other government?
05:48:24 <furofuro_01[m]> Just look at covid 19 cases.
05:48:37 <yolotro[m]> oh yea  you see governments as hostiles, i get it
05:48:53 <yolotro[m]> ok i go take a shower now, see u later =)
05:50:53 <yolotro[m]> and i don't think there was ever any proof about that huwei spying, if i remember it was a part of the trade war
05:52:42 <furofuro_01[m]> <yolotro[m] "and i don't think there was ever"> There may be not, because China is good at hiding things, but remember the same government who lied about covid-19 has also control on Huawei company.
05:53:03 <furofuro_01[m]> I rest my case.
05:55:33 <yolotro[m]> if i remember they fired the local government of that region when they found out that they were trying to hide it
05:56:15 <furofuro_01[m]> It is a possible PR move.
05:57:10 <furofuro_01[m]> WHO, who is in coordination in China, once said covid-19 isnt communicable disease.
05:57:39 <yolotro[m]> little was know about it in the beginning
05:59:33 <yolotro[m]> anyways yea they spy, for example one of their army plane is the exact copy of an american plane lol
05:59:39 <furofuro_01[m]> Then why did they hoard PPE in December?
05:59:40 <yolotro[m]> i don't remember the name
06:00:11 <yolotro[m]> everyone is spying
06:01:10 <furofuro_01[m]> <yolotro[m] "everyone is spying "> If so little was known on that disease, there shouldnt even be a shortage in PPEs.

10:38:53 <hapssmak[m]> Like, is it a malicious OTA or?
10:42:45 <Arhu> yekip[m]: you'll probably have to install them again on the second account, although that shouldn't take up more space since the app files are shared, only the user data is not

11:10:15 <bauruine> Hi. I'm trying to install graphene on a new Pixel 3a and I'm stuck at flash-all.sh. It looks like it hangs at flasing the bootloader. I don't have any output on the shell and the device only shows the bootloader. Any idea what i'm doing wrong?
11:18:56 <yolotro[m]> i have no clue but no one is replying, so are you use the correct fastboot version?
11:19:53 <fll[m]> bauruine: does your PC show the phone when you enter 'fastboot devices'?
11:20:01 <bauruine> RTFM. Had to "Reboot to bootloader" on the device.
11:20:19 <bauruine> sorry for bothering you :-(
11:20:31 <yolotro[m]> ya RTFM! :D
11:34:35 <Arhu> yolotro: are you considering a non-XL Pixel 4?

11:36:14 <meltedcheddar[m]> <bauruine "Hi. I'm trying to install graphe"> I had the same problem, I don't know how I solved it. But it's easy. Now I have it installed.
11:37:03 <meltedcheddar[m]> Maybe something about location?
11:38:07 <Arhu> For the non-XL, battery life shouldn't be that much worse than the 3 if you turn off all the battery consuming features like 90Hz display, always listening Google assistant, and Soli gestures
11:38:21 <meltedcheddar[m]> I recommend you read carefully the isntall instructions and keep trying
11:38:47 <Arhu> If you don't want the XL, I'd wait for the 4a

11:40:53 <yolotro[m]> <Arhu "I did my research and opted for "> not anymore, no fingerprint reader is totaly dealbreaker for me i think i'm goint to wait even more, for the 4a or i may get a 3 if i can find a good deal used

12:09:56 <strcat[m]> yekip: the Auditor app uses hardware-based attestation, it doesn't rely on software checks to verify the OS but rather verified boot, attestation and hardware-backed keys in the HSM (Titan M on a Pixel 3)
12:11:07 <strcat[m]> yekip: the hardware provides extremely strong verification of device identity (the fingerprint of the key that was generated for the pairing), the OS verified boot key, verified boot state, patch level, etc.
12:11:15 <strcat[m]> and the way it works chains trust to the app within the OS
12:11:42 <strcat[m]> the OS tells the hardware the app id and signing key fingerprint
12:11:43 <strcat[m]> and the hardware includes that in the signed attestation
12:11:55 <strcat[m]> and it's done in a way that the OS chains trust to the app
12:12:21 <strcat[m]> so you can't just install an Auditor app signed with a different key and pass verification, doesn't work
12:12:27 <strcat[m]> which means Auditor can do meaningful checks in software too
12:12:50 <strcat[m]> which is why is gathers information on other ways an attacker could have persisted access after a compromise
12:12:51 <strcat[m]> like an accessibility service, device manager, etc.
12:13:36 <strcat[m]> the purpose of Auditor is to verity identity of the device (the cryptographic pairing) and through that (pinned public keys) strong verification of the attestation information
12:14:01 <strcat[m]> since it has pinned the keys used to sign the attestation by the hardware
12:14:42 <strcat[m]> so it's strong verification of OS integrity + authenticity, identity of the device (and when I say that I mean via the cryptographic pairing - if you clear it a redo the pairing that's a totally fresh identity)
12:15:13 <strcat[m]> and with trust chained to the app, the app can do all kinds of checks and gather interesting information in a reliable way
12:15:46 <strcat[m]> even if an attacker exploits the OS in the current boot to gain root access successfully, they CANNOT fake the core device information provided by Auditor (identity, OS, verified boot hash / state, OS patch level)
12:16:03 <strcat[m]> and if they do not CURRENTLY have root access, they can't fake the 2nd section in the output of software-based checks
12:16:19 <strcat[m]> they would have had to successfully exploit the OS in the CURRENT boot to fake the 2nd section
12:16:45 <strcat[m]> so, important to note that the patch level is provided via hardware in the first section (which is the hardware-based attestation info) which provides more assurance for the 2nd section of info from the app which has had trust chained to it through the OS
12:21:20 <yolotro[m]> A popular tipster suggests that Google Pixel 4a could launch in July but release in October.Another leaker reports that the phone could have a different name.A third tipster believes that the Pixel 4a is launching “very soon.” https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4a-release-date-delay-1128965/
12:21:36 <yolotro[m]> can't they just shut up?
12:36:55 <Arhu> there were also rumors that the Pixel 5 would not have a top tier CPU
12:37:25 <Arhu> maybe Google is like "fuck it, the Pixel 4a is the Pixel 5 now"
12:46:46 <Arhu> strcat[m]: how is Sony with security? They are relatively nice with releasing AOSP kernels, builds, and binaries. Even very old devices get Android 10 AOSP. No custom verified boot I think. Any idea what kind of HSM their recent phones have and if it's implemented in a sensible way?
12:50:29 <strcat[m]> Arhu: most phones don't have an HSM
12:50:33 <strcat[m]> they only have the TEE
12:50:59 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm introduced their SPU which is an HSM provided as part of the SoC
12:51:22 <strcat[m]> but I don't know how broadly used that is on current generation flagship devices where it's available
12:51:42 <strcat[m]> and I somewhat doubt it supports Insider Attack Protection
12:52:59 <Arhu> I see the the attestation app website only lists the Samsung Galaxy Note 10(+) as having an HSM with StrongBox support used by Auditor
12:54:13 <Arhu> They probably use ARM TrustZone

13:13:05 <jalb66> "This would mean developers have to upload their signing keys to google play even though there's no technical benefit in doing that. You can achieve the same efficient download sizes by using bundletool locally and uploading all generated apks. But it seems google will stop allowing that and just wants your signing keys."
13:32:40 <zozu[m]> Wanted to hear some thoughts here. At a practical level, how bad can it be, –from a scale of not ideal, to horrific just don't let it happen ever– to keep a phone for one year after it is no longer getting firmware updates and so on?
13:38:16 <yolotro[m]> for example recently there was an exploit on many samsung phones that allowed anyone to hack you and steal all your data and files by just sending an MMS to your phone, if you didn't update you would stay vulnerable
13:38:51 <zozu[m]> But was that a firmware based attack?
13:41:00 <zozu[m]> Or is that wrong?
13:41:00 <yolotro[m]> oh i thought you mean the whole thing, sometimes firmware refer to the whole rom sometimes to only a part of it
13:41:10 <yolotro[m]> it was a bug in the rom
13:42:32 <zozu[m]> I mean theoretically you'll still get support from graphene a little after you lose firmware support no?
13:43:17 <yolotro[m]> i don't think graphene is going to support phones that do not longer receive firmware updates
13:43:26 <alzxjm[m]> This is probably something of a novice question, but I'm wondering if the Pixelbook would be a potential target for GrapheneOS. I know Daniel has said in the past that laptops are not worthy targets, but the PB has Google's Titan M implementation and verified boot. Presumably the Pixelbook Go, as well. Would this qualify the device for further research?
13:43:59 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have a Titan M, it's a different thing
13:44:04 <strcat[m]> and a different kind of verified boot
13:44:24 <zozu[m]> <yolotro[m] "i don't think graphene is going "> Isn't it supporting the already legacy pixel 2?
13:44:44 <yolotro[m]> yea but the pixel still receive firmware updates
13:44:53 <strcat[m]> zozu: the Pixel 2 is not EOL
13:45:03 <strcat[m]> we consider it legacy because it doesn't meet our current standards
13:45:27 <zozu[m]> Ohhh, okay sorry my bad.
13:46:12 <yolotro[m]>  * yea but the pixel 2 still receive firmware updates
13:46:45 <zozu[m]> So in getting a pixel 3a, by may 2022, even if I really like the phone, it's urgent to get a new device?
13:47:50 <alzxjm[m]> > it doesn't have a Titan M, it's a different thing
13:47:50 <alzxjm[m]> > and a different kind of verified boot
13:47:50 <alzxjm[m]> I see. Are these implementations beneath the standards of the project?
13:48:18 <strcat[m]> it is not really the same thing - it's not meant for AOSP
13:51:03 <alzxjm[m]> Has anyone worked on developing a de-Googled version of Chromium OS with verified boot?
13:53:45 <Arhu> alzxjm: The Pixel Slate and Pixelbook Go (but not the Pixelbook) have a Titan C. Also Intel vs Snapdragon CPU so the verified boot works completely different. There is a good chance the Pixelbooks don't even support verified boot with custom keys, in which case that security is only for ChromeOS, and not ChromiumOS and derivatives. There aren't even properly deGoogled ChromiumOS builds, let alone attempts at verified boot. ChromiumOS can't really be
13:53:46 <Arhu>  compared to AOSP, it relies on the Google Cloud.

13:55:37 <Arhu> it's bad for security and you're better off with ungoogled chromium

13:56:12 <concat[m]> <yolotro[m] "ask concat he know well about th"> I've seen an attempt before but it's not very well maintained, and CloudReady does support rootfs and bootloader verification (w/ secure boot) but it's missing the other verified boot ChromeOS (on Chromebooks) have.
13:56:34 <zozu[m]> <Arhu "is there some specific extension"> But doesn't google have influence even over ungoogled chromium?
13:56:45 <zozu[m]> That's my main thing
13:56:58 <Arhu> what do you mean with influence?
13:57:07 <Arhu> it's based on Google code
13:57:28 <Arhu> in that way, Google has influence over GrapheneOS too
13:58:13 <Arhu> Just that the code it's based on comes from Google doesn't make it bad
13:58:43 <Arhu> it makes it better than being based on code than comes from Mozilla :)
13:58:46 <zozu[m]> (Perhaps this be complete crap what I'm saying) but say google decides to push some kind new protocol

14:00:06 <concat[m]> <zozu[m] "What about tor browser vs ungoog"> You don't have homogeneity.
14:00:07 <Arhu> at least Google is more competent when it comes to security
14:00:07 <zozu[m]> Enlighten my innocence
14:00:20 <concat[m]> <zozu[m] "How so?"> Firefox ranked worse than Google Chrome for phoning home out of the box by a study.
14:00:54 <concat[m]> https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Doug.Leith/pubs/browser_privacy.pdf
14:00:56 <zozu[m]> Is that it? Any more complaints?
14:01:48 <zozu[m]> <Arhu "at least Google is more competen"> Okay but with using ungoogled chromium over tor browser, won't that spoil your fingerprint?
14:02:18 <Arhu> Tor is something different
14:02:42 <zozu[m]> Let's focus on that now
14:02:43 <Arhu> Chromium is better than Firefox
14:02:53 <zozu[m]> Got it
14:02:58 <zozu[m]> But with tor?
14:03:05 <zozu[m]> Which would you use?
14:03:16 <zozu[m]> And why?
14:03:26 <Arhu> I would bet that if they would rewrite the Tor browser now, they'd start out with Chromium instead of Firefox
14:04:17 <zozu[m]> It doesn't help the question. For the closest to anonymous experience, what would you use today?
14:04:27 <zozu[m]> With what we have
14:05:47 <dazinism> Arhu: nice you got a 4xl and ready to help - paintedman is also working on pixel 4
14:06:19 <Arhu> Regular webbrowsing -> Chromium, Tor -> Tor browser (which is FF based)
14:07:44 <zozu[m]> So tor browser is your final vote here?
14:07:44 <dazinism> zozu: best to use tor browser over tor
14:07:45 <zozu[m]> For best security and privacy?
14:08:05 <dazinism> To lower the  chance of compromise set safety slider to safest (then no JavaScript can run)
14:08:20 <zozu[m]> Of course
14:08:31 <zozu[m]> Okay cool
14:08:36 <zozu[m]> What about on android?
14:08:58 <dazinism> I'm talking android
14:09:12 <zozu[m]> Ohhh cool cool
14:09:41 <zozu[m]> Same logic applies for pc then?
14:09:45 <zozu[m]> Right!
14:09:49 <zozu[m]> *?
14:10:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> <Arhu "Regular webbrowsing -> Chromium,"> There's a Chromium-based Tor? What?
14:11:13 <zozu[m]> No, but you can link them
14:11:27 <Arhu> dazinism: I'm afraid I can only be of limited help because I have almost zero Android development experience (although I am a programmer), but installing and testing builds is no problem
14:11:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> <zozu[m] "For best security and privacy?"> Tor Browser for everyday browsing, Vanadium if Tor breaks the site (or Bromite if you're not on Graphene OS)
14:11:51 <dazinism> If you want to be extra safe and are worried that tor browser may have been compromised can clear the app data.
14:12:27 <zozu[m]> Ohh, right! That's good to know
14:13:55 <jalb66> Use it better in a different user/profile
14:15:05 <dazinism> After each data clear, you have to reset safety slider (if you want it higher)
14:15:30 <dazinism> This also breaks the default way tor works
14:18:16 <dazinism> IIRC by default you use the same entry node for some time, as this is statistically safer than using a different one.
14:18:41 <dazinism> Clearing app data means you use a new entry node next connection
14:20:36 <dazinism> Have to weigh up that against possibility that browser has been exploited, and they have gained persistence within the app sandbox
14:39:19 <strcat[m]> particularly since the browser it's based on has no inner sandbox
14:39:23 <strcat[m]> and trusts persistent state completely
14:41:39 <Manouchehri> dazinism: where did you get the idea of being persistent in the app sandbox?
15:03:57 <strcat[m]> no output as in an error message?
15:07:44 <alzxjm[m]> Not sure if this is relevant to this room, but has anyone tried CalyxOS? It seems quite similar in scope to Graphene.
15:10:19 <madaidan[m]> CalyxOS is great but it's not really similar to GrapheneOS. It doesn't work on hardening the OS.
15:11:37 <alzxjm[m]> So it's considered trustworthy? I have a Pixel 4 XL and I'd like to flash GrapheneOS when it is available, but CalyxOS might be a good middleground for now. Side-question: what sort of hardware do I need to build and test GrapheneOS for the Pixel 4 XL? I'm happy to try and test it out.
15:14:55 <madaidan[m]> I'd consider it trustworthy. Build requirements are https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies
