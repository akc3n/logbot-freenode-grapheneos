01:29:59 <M7777777y[m]> I can't for the life of me find an x200
01:30:10 <M7777777y[m]> And on eBay they are all too expensive
01:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> M7777777y[m]: Something you may find funny: I remember that in this city, all the universities in town gave their students Thinkpads, and then when they were done, usually those students would then trade away or give away their thinkpads when they graduated. So as a result, most stores would have entire bins of them, they were a dime a dozen. Then come December 2017, all of them
01:41:37 <TheJollyRoger> vanished overnight, it was like there was a thinkpad panic. Walked into a laptop store and asked, the guy just laughed and told me that someone came in and just bought the whole box without even looking over them.
01:42:13 <M7777777y[m]> I don't blame them
01:42:39 <M7777777y[m]> Adjusted for inflation they will cost more soon than they did new!
01:42:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah o.O.
01:43:41 <M7777777y[m]> If only they would make a remastered classic x200 and sell it new again...
01:43:45 <TheJollyRoger> Like refurbished, as is, vendor refurbished, used, didn't matter. They just grabbed the box, paid and left, and that was the end of that. No more thinkpads.
01:43:53 <M7777777y[m]> Little does their marketing team know
01:45:41 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I'm expecting the Talos and POWER to be more viable and more sustainable bets in the long term, rather than holding out on old relics from the past. Sure, I did like that they built them like tanks back then, but I don't think we can keep holding out on old technology forever, especially given how exploits and hardware exploits are becoming increasingly more sophisticated.
01:46:01 <TheJollyRoger> But I do miss and feel nostalgic for those old laptops... those things were built like tanks.
01:46:52 <TheJollyRoger> Solid magnesium frame, thick overmolded plastic casing, even vent holes in case you spilled coffee on your laptop.
01:47:22 <TheJollyRoger> *vent holes to allow liquid to avoid settling in the keyboard in case
01:47:27 <M7777777y[m]> Never had one but they look very sturdy
01:47:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> +++
01:47:50 <entry1> <TheJollyRoger "Solid magnesium frame, thick ove"> Yep, build quality was top notch. Can't snag them cheap anymore. I got one for $50 last year and now its worth at least $120
01:48:00 <TheJollyRoger> Oh jeez, yeah :(
01:49:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I did like them back then, they definitely made them very strong. The only minor nitpick I have with the X200 Tablet was the little reversible clasp, that little revesible toggle clasp is very small, and very weak, so if a part on the laptop's going to break, it's going to be there.
01:49:56 <TheJollyRoger> That, and the fan is in an uncomfortable location and tends to get clogged up with dust easily, then when it ingests dust the fan will die very quickly... getting replacement fans also tends to be kind of difficult.
01:50:29 <TheJollyRoger> But aside from that, mine is still being used as a hardware monitoring console.
01:50:36 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> sounds like Nokia 3310 build quality
01:50:42 <entry1> All used laptops shot up in price since the pandemic. Hard to want to buy one that is pushing $150 when you can buy an HP stream for like $220. The upgradability and longevity of them were insane.
01:50:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, totally!
01:50:45 <entry1> <TheJollyRoger "But aside from that, mine is sti"> Very cool
01:51:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. But it's a hardware monitoring console, *very* specifically it's not a computer. So all it's used to do is talk to the baseboard management controller via IPMI and that's it, it's never used for anything else.
01:55:01 <entry1> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah. But it's a hardware monito"> Haha you know you had to specify that before someone just tries to rip you to shreds for not using the most up to date hardware/firmware for security optimization
01:55:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehehe, yes XD.
01:55:42 <Baobab> TheJollyRoger, does talos II support coreboot?
01:55:48 <buthomeisnowhere> Does anyone use orbot? Do you select all apps for VPN mode?
01:56:37 <TheJollyRoger> Baobab: If I recall right it has some elements of coreboot which are used for hostboot, but it's not the same.
01:57:54 <Baobab> I wish more hardware had coreboot support (;-;)
01:58:02 <TheJollyRoger> Same here :(
01:58:30 <M7777777y[m]> Libreboot please
01:58:57 <akc3n[m]> <entry1 "All used laptops shot up in pric"> Even where I usually buy my refurb laptops, all the prices went by 100-200$ cad in the last while. Same models/specs/year were a lot cheaper before.
01:59:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> m77, you've got stuff to learn
01:59:15 <Baobab> The pinebook pro looks like has a coreboot port but idk if it's finished yet
01:59:21 <TheJollyRoger> M7777777y[m]: Heh, if you prefer being vulnerable to chip-level vulnerabilities, due to the lack of microcode loading.
01:59:39 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Surface 4!
02:00:26 <M7777777y[m]> TheJollyRoger osboot (fork if libreboot) is a good comptomise - no ME but still micro code updates
02:00:38 <M7777777y[m]> * TheJollyRoger osboot (fork if libreboot) is a good compromise - no ME but still micro code updates
02:00:47 <Baobab> M7777777y[m], coreboot doesn't need ime either
02:00:47 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that's stil bad m7
02:01:13 <M7777777y[m]> Why's that
02:01:20 <TheJollyRoger> M7777777y[m]: I actually prefer the way the Talos does it: since the POWER9 chips don't support microcode loading, instead we are able to mitigate chip flaws in firmware.
02:01:34 <surveillexxxx[m]> so system76 devices come with coreboot right?
02:01:48 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: Some do, but it's not open.
02:02:01 <TheJollyRoger> I'll explain what I mean by that in a sec.
02:02:02 <Baobab> >Why's that
02:02:02 <Baobab> the devices don't need it?
02:02:17 <M7777777y[m]> Was replying to why is osboot bad
02:02:24 <Baobab> Oh.
02:02:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos-offtopic/20210507#c7920448
02:02:45 <TheJollyRoger> Because the firmware on the Talos is open source, this essentially means you can set those chicken bits yourself if need be, you don't need to rely on encrypted and signed vendor supplied binaries to do so.
02:03:12 <Baobab> TheJollyRoger, that sounds so cool
02:03:15 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: Essentially, the "Coreboot" in System76 and Purism devices is essentially a wrapper to talk to the IME and FSP.
02:03:49 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> anyway, i'm out people
02:03:50 <TheJollyRoger> So to analogize, it's like saying "I run Linux! I'm an Elite Linux Hacker!"... by running Linux in Hyper-V on Windows 10.
02:03:57 <TheJollyRoger> Goodnight @Hulk! See you tomorrow.
02:03:58 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> have a good day y'all shipmates)
02:04:02 <surveillexxxx[m]> im looking to buy a system76 system and was wondering if they disable ME on the intel chips and if they make it privacy friendly
02:04:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr~
02:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: If you want to disable the IME, use a hammer.
02:04:18 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], I recommend removing it yourself
02:04:34 <TheJollyRoger> Let me put it this way:
02:04:54 <surveillexxxx[m]> I read on an article that they disable it
02:05:08 <surveillexxxx[m]> im going to call them to confirm though
02:05:10 <TheJollyRoger> If you disable it completely, there's nothing to initialize DRAM timing, unpark the CPU cores, and get the CPU started.
02:05:27 <TheJollyRoger> On CPUs that were made past ~2010.
02:05:36 <TheJollyRoger> Because that has to be done before the host boots.
02:05:37 <Baobab> TheJollyRoger, I think he meant cleaning it
02:05:44 <Baobab> and flipping the hap switch
02:05:55 <surveillexxxx[m]> so if I buy an I9 the newest CPU im screwed?
02:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> Baobab: Ah, in terms of running me_cleaner. Yes, you can do that... and I still to this day advise against it because we don't know about what mitigations it does.
02:06:36 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, the IME is able to control system management mode and may be responsible for sandboxing SMM.
02:06:52 <TheJollyRoger> You don't want that running lose on your computer.
02:07:01 <Baobab> TheJollyRoger, true
02:07:06 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: allow me to present a simpler answer.
02:07:11 <Baobab> x86 is a mess :\
02:07:13 <surveillexxxx[m]> https://www.tomshardware.com/news/system76-disables-intel-me-firmware,36030.html
02:07:23 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: Misleading.
02:07:33 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't want the IME/PSP shit on your computer, the only responsible thing you can do is /move off the x86/.
02:07:35 <TheJollyRoger> That's what I did.
02:07:54 <M7777777y[m]> Hulk I read the post its mostly about Linux and C
02:08:10 <Baobab> I personally use arm whenever I can.
02:08:10 <M7777777y[m]> I'm not so naive to think Linux is very secure
02:08:28 <TheJollyRoger> Even if you did fully remove the chip on chip, and implement something like a BMC which could externally boot the chip, initialize DRAM timing, and all that lovely stuff,
02:08:36 <M7777777y[m]> But I am idealistic about free software for reasons beyond security
02:09:04 <M7777777y[m]> Although both is preferred
02:09:07 <TheJollyRoger> This doesn't address the elephant in the room that the CPU itself is a MASSIVE black box, with management interfaces themselves only being a TINY TINY FRACTION of the overall complexity they make up.
02:09:12 <surveillexxxx[m]> System76, which provides Linux-powered laptops, desktops and servers, has decided to address the risks introduced by Intel ME by disabling the feature altogether.
02:09:13 <Wonderfall[m]> I love free software, except when GNU touches it
02:09:23 <surveillexxxx[m]>  * "System76, which provides Linux-powered laptops, desktops and servers, has decided to address the risks introduced by Intel ME by disabling the feature altogether."
02:09:37 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: Again, misleading. They've just set HAP and run me_cleaner.
02:09:42 <M7777777y[m]> I would in most cases take something less secure that is free than something closed and "more secure"
02:09:43 <Baobab> >CPU itself is a MASSIVE black box
02:09:43 <Baobab> True, there are instructions that even intel doesn't know about.
02:10:03 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], flipping the hap switch doesn't fully remove it.
02:10:28 <TheJollyRoger> If the IME is disabled, then your computer won't boot, and even if you DO find a way to boot the CPU externally, there's a computer-operating-properly circuit that checks for firmware validation and if those files are tampered with, after 30 minutes, power off the host.
02:10:35 <M7777777y[m]> Wonderfall Why's that?
02:10:56 <Baobab> >True, there are instructions that even intel doesn't know about.
02:10:56 <Baobab> https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/sandsifter
02:11:39 <Wonderfall[m]> <M7777777y[m] "Wonderfall Why's that? "> They have a funny definition of malware and security itself. They don't care about modern security, Zero Trust and all that. As long as it's free it's good enough for them. Then we get shitty stuff full of vulnerabilities like GnuTLS, and other obsolete and dangerous softwares no one should ever use
02:11:42 <TheJollyRoger> Baobab: Well, with respect to the VIA4 chips that Christopher Domas found, actually the interesting thing is, the instruction is there in the documentation; its functions were detailed, it's just that nobody but him found out how to use them.
02:12:06 * entry1  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/gNqPJCYlKciRNjEfZufGZyIz/message.txt >
02:12:08 <TheJollyRoger> Wonderfall[m]: Oh man thank you so much, that is so refreshing to hear ^_^.
02:12:11 <surveillexxxx[m]> what are the chances that the gov can watch me if I buy a pc from system 76
02:12:14 <TheJollyRoger> Preach, brother!
02:12:22 <Baobab> TheJollyRoger, cool
02:12:24 <Wonderfall[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Wonderfall: Oh man thank you so "> Hehe as usual
02:12:53 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: Even if you don't buy a PC at all, total, because the other people around you aren't doing their part.
02:13:02 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: let me tell you an unfortunate truth, but it's one you need to hear:
02:13:12 <surveillexxxx[m]> ok
02:13:21 <M7777777y[m]> What about more security focused GNU projects like hyperbola? Wonderfall
02:13:38 <TheJollyRoger> Your privacy depends very little on how good, skilled, paranoid, or elite you are, or what gadgets you buy. It depends more on the collective apathy of the people around you.
02:13:40 <Baobab> >what are the chances that the gov can watch me if I buy a pc from system 76
02:13:40 <Baobab> I'm not sure what you mean.
02:14:00 <M7777777y[m]> There definitely are things that aren't great but the general idea is good
02:14:08 <Wonderfall[m]> <M7777777y[m] "What about more security focused"> It uses linux-libre, which by itself is a step down from Linux default security
02:14:26 <M7777777y[m]> Its switching to a openbsd krtneo
02:14:29 <surveillexxxx[m]> well the people around me love apple and google so im fucked
02:14:33 <surveillexxxx[m]> royally fucked
02:14:33 <M7777777y[m]> Kernel
02:14:33 <Baobab> Wonderfall[m], linux-libre is just linux with non-free drivers removed
02:14:42 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, you could do what I did and spend $11k buying a Talos II, and having a friend bootstrap your operating system from crosscompiled gcc, compile everything here, encrypting everything on keys you've generated yourself...
02:15:03 <Baobab> it's not a step down from anything
02:15:12 <TheJollyRoger> it all goes to *shit* when your grandmother logs onto grandma⊙gc and messages brother⊙gc and says HEY DID YOU HEAR WHAT GRANDSON GOT UP TO OH LET ME TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT!
02:15:50 <surveillexxxx[m]> so if I live alone
02:16:02 <surveillexxxx[m]> am I safe?
02:16:10 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: You need to go to work sometime, unless you want no bread.
02:16:11 <Wonderfall[m]> <Baobab "it's not a step down from anythi"> Well, that's wrong
02:16:33 <Wonderfall[m]> By using linux-libre you're less likely to get patches for vulnerabilities
02:16:41 <Baobab> ?
02:17:00 <Wonderfall[m]> That's already a nightmare for Linux, I recommend checking out Dmitry Vyukov presentations
02:17:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Linux-Libre "Hey let's use known vulnerable firmware, because firmware updates? What are those?"
02:17:23 <Wonderfall[m]> yes they don't care
02:17:28 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh >_<.
02:17:36 <Wonderfall[m]> they just care about removing the bad stuff which is proprietary code for them
02:17:41 <Wonderfall[m]> but that's a very narrowed conception
02:17:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
02:18:18 <M7777777y[m]> It wouldn't be Linux libre if they made exceptions
02:18:19 <Baobab> the kernel handles microcode?
02:18:25 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: If your goal is to control the outflow of information about you that's caught up in dragnet surveillance, you get far more mileage out of getting people around you to start caring as much as you do, because even if you live alone, your family still talks about you. You're still a part of something. You'll need a job if you want to pay the rent.
02:18:32 <surveillexxxx[m]> atleast I will be buying a CPU that actually did something to try to disable it and not one that doesnt try at all
02:18:32 <M7777777y[m]> You don't have to use it in every context
02:18:32 <Baobab> I thought the initramfs does that
02:18:45 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: We the geeks often get hung up on the technology because for us, tech is the /easy/ part.
02:18:50 <TheJollyRoger> Changing phones, is simple.
02:18:55 <TheJollyRoger> Changing people, is *hard*.
02:19:12 <TheJollyRoger> It's the law of triviality at work.
02:19:46 <TheJollyRoger> Well and it allows us to flex our geekdom out on IRC channels ;-).
02:19:48 <TheJollyRoger> But tech, in all honesty, is a very, very, VERY small part of it.
02:20:06 <M7777777y[m]> I don't think the hate towards GNU is justified for not taking non free security fixes
02:20:31 <M7777777y[m]> The solution is that there needs to be more contributions to it
02:21:00 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: How about you buy a CPU that allows full owner control of everything right down to the self-boot engine?
02:21:12 <TheJollyRoger> and has been /designed that way/, not discovered via reverse engineering?
02:21:18 <surveillexxxx[m]> like what?
02:21:24 <TheJollyRoger> https://raptorcs.com
02:21:27 <TheJollyRoger> Like that.
02:21:28 <Wonderfall[m]> <M7777777y[m] "The solution is that there needs"> Security is not about ideology, it should be pragmatic
02:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> Full disclosure: I was one of the early adopters of the Talos II.
02:21:50 <Baobab> M7777777y[m], you mean microcode updates right?
02:21:53 <M7777777y[m]> GNU is about freedom not security
02:22:06 <Wonderfall[m]> Exactly, but freedom at what cost
02:22:26 <Wonderfall[m]> Not to mention, GNU is NOT the only way to have free softwares
02:22:38 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: The Talos II comes with full hardware schematics, full source code right down to the self-boot engine, the toolchain is fully libre; even the Field Programmable Gate Array used for power sequencing has a libre toolchain.
02:22:43 <surveillexxxx[m]> holy fuck these are expensive
02:22:51 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: Not really.
02:22:56 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], it's worth it
02:22:56 <TheJollyRoger> To get a sense of scale:
02:22:57 <M7777777y[m]> Of course free software is not one group
02:23:02 <Wonderfall[m]> Think about BSD, AOSP, a lot of stuff actually are free and not tied to GNU in any way (Google avoids them)
02:23:15 <Wonderfall[m]> for good reason
02:23:19 <M7777777y[m]> Open source does not mean free
02:23:28 <TheJollyRoger> My old office would pay about $6000 to lease a bunch of crappy workstations from HP that didn't hold a candle to these, after the three year lease, they'd have to return them to HP.
02:23:38 <M7777777y[m]> Something along the lines of GPL is required
02:23:54 <M7777777y[m]> Openbsd is not free software
02:24:19 <Wonderfall[m]> Also I've seen some GNU maintainers trashtalking about the Rust rewrite of POSIX tools, that's not very "freedom" to me
02:24:33 <Wonderfall[m]> anyway
02:24:51 <Wonderfall[m]> you're free to use GNU softwares if you want, just beware of the cost
02:25:13 <M7777777y[m]> Not necessarily here to defend individuals
02:25:24 <M7777777y[m]> But free software itself
02:25:39 <surveillexxxx[m]> well I will defs buy one when I have the money
02:25:43 <surveillexxxx[m]> I just need to know on a scale of 1-10 how secure I will be if I dont talk about what I do and keep everything private and secure while using the system76 desktop?
02:25:44 <M7777777y[m]> I use GNU sometimes and non free software sometimes as well
02:26:06 <M7777777y[m]> Sometimes as you would imagine for security reasons
02:26:22 <M7777777y[m]> But I can do both
02:26:29 <Wonderfall[m]> Well unfortunately GNU/FSF is all about these strong opinions of some individuals about free software. For me GNU should not reflect what free software really is, but that's my opinion.
02:26:41 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: Well it's hard to boil down a very complex and nuanced question to a simple answer, that's like asking me to see the future.
02:27:02 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: But what I can tell you is this: you're not gaining anything in the long term, really.
02:27:08 <TheJollyRoger> Or in the short term.
02:27:22 <M7777777y[m]> To me the fsf should just be one among many organizations for this
02:27:27 <surveillexxxx[m]> wdym?
02:27:44 <TheJollyRoger> And in fact, by disabling the IME you may be leaving your system open to other attacks that the IME may mitigate, such as attacks that operate within system management mode.
02:27:56 <M7777777y[m]> But I read and considered the GPL license
02:28:27 <TheJollyRoger> Its role in exploit mitigations is currently unknown, yet it functions as the root of trust for the CPU, especially for things that are too privileged to even entrust to SMM.
02:28:29 <M7777777y[m]> And I think generally anything less than that is not free software
02:28:52 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: TLDR you gain nothing.
02:29:02 <M7777777y[m]> Why contribute to openbsd license when it will help companies use it and not contribute back
02:29:28 <Wonderfall[m]> Appreciation of GPL is very subjective. Even Linus Torvalds would never use GPLv3 (Linux is GPLv2).
02:29:38 <M7777777y[m]> Copyleft will give users and devs more tools and such in the long run to better compete against bigger corporations
02:30:13 <M7777777y[m]> But stuff like MIT is giving work to them for free
02:30:17 <Baobab> M7777777y[m], a project doesn't need to be copyleft in order for it to be free software
02:30:30 <TheJollyRoger> *TLDR you gain nothing, over buying any other consumer laptop, it's mostly a marketing stunt meant to fool the gullible and capitalize on scare tactics, which falls apart the moment you take a look at any nuance with any real knowledge.
02:30:53 <M7777777y[m]> I don't think MIT of BSD is free
02:31:06 <M7777777y[m]> Or×
02:31:26 <Baobab> M7777777y[m], so is musl nonfree software?
02:32:43 <M7777777y[m]> Musl is open source and more in the category of public domain
02:33:00 <Baobab> M7777777y[m], is musl nonfree software?
02:33:02 <surveillexxxx[m]> if I keep good privacy practices will I be safe?
02:33:04 <surveillexxxx[m]> <TheJollyRoger "*TLDR you gain nothing, over buy"> damn
02:33:30 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: like I said, if you can't tolerate the IME/PSP stuff, then *move off the x86/amd64*.
02:33:52 <M7777777y[m]> Hmm seems like its in the middle to me
02:33:56 <Baobab> TheJollyRoger, 100%
02:34:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr~
02:34:27 <M7777777y[m]> Will talos have anything affordable soon
02:34:53 <Baobab> M7777777y[m], https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html
02:34:57 <TheJollyRoger> You'll get FAR better privacy convincing your family and friends to install Signal than buying your own personal super computer.
02:35:09 <Baobab> your definition of free software is pretty narrow
02:35:42 <TheJollyRoger> M7777777y[m]: there's the Blackbird, which you could buy the board, CPU, and cooler to, and then put together on your own using your own ATX case and power supply. By the time you're done, you're likely going to have spent about the same cash as you would have, buying a gaming laptop.
02:35:53 <TheJollyRoger> That said:
02:35:57 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to let you know right now,
02:36:16 <TheJollyRoger> if you aren't prepared nor responsible enough to manage software updates and platform maintenance yourself?
02:36:22 <TheJollyRoger> Learn now.
02:36:24 <TheJollyRoger> Or don't.
02:36:53 <TheJollyRoger> Because while I will push the Talos II as a viable alternative to those of us who want to be away from the IME/PSP stuff, or want a high-performance computer,
02:36:57 <TheJollyRoger> I will NOT push it as a magical solution.
02:37:15 <TheJollyRoger> You take all the responsibility into your own hands, and that means you need the shoulders to bear that responsibility yourself.
02:37:42 <M7777777y[m]> One sec let me check the price because I wouldn't buy a gaming rig
02:37:56 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], you also might want to play with: https://github.com/ArthurHeymans/petitboot_for_coreboot
02:38:27 <Baobab> I *think* talos II uses that, even though it doesn't use coreboot.
02:38:48 <TheJollyRoger> Once again: I love the Talos II, I use it myself, and I evangelize it. But I will NOT call it a magical solution, that's not the expectations I want to cultivate.
02:39:18 <M7777777y[m]> Bao you gave a point I should word more carefully next time
02:39:51 <M7777777y[m]> I'm slow to type on a touch scrrrn so I'm being very short winded
02:40:01 <surveillexxxx[m]> they ship them with intel me disabled
02:40:03 <M7777777y[m]> Have×
02:40:20 <Baobab> M7777777y[m], I'm a free software advocate && a copyleft advocate, but it doesn't help when you conflate the two terms as one.
02:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: Were you even listening?
02:40:42 <surveillexxxx[m]> yes
02:40:42 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], they only enable the hap switch
02:40:45 <surveillexxxx[m]> I was
02:40:58 <surveillexxxx[m]> what is a hap switch?
02:41:02 <TheJollyRoger> What Baobab said -
02:41:03 <rathantara[m]> opinions on https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search?
02:41:28 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: So, more or less, Intel included a switch that once the host has booted, politely requests the IME to enter an error state.
02:41:44 <M7777777y[m]> Baobab true you are right
02:41:47 <Wonderfall[m]> <rathantara[m] "opinions on https://github.com/b"> Same as Searx: only useful is not self-hosted directly, which would defeat the purpose. But then again, would you trust random instances
02:41:55 <surveillexxxx[m]> is there anyway to remotely turn it on
02:41:55 <TheJollyRoger> So regardless of what you do, you're still trusting Intel anyways.
02:41:58 <Wonderfall[m]> > <@zippy99:matrix.org> opinions on https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search?
02:41:58 <Wonderfall[m]>  * Same as Searx: only useful if not self-hosted directly, which would defeat the purpose. But then again, would you trust random instances
02:42:10 <M7777777y[m]> TheJollyRoger yeah I would not be able to justify spending that money on w personal device
02:42:26 <M7777777y[m]> Only if it was used for a server
02:43:06 <rathantara[m]> self-hosted + searches through tor
02:43:26 <rathantara[m]> I have searx and yacy
02:43:47 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: There have been pre-bringup exploits on the IME that may or may not be remotely exploitable. HAP has no effect on exploits on IME prior to bringup.
02:44:09 <TheJollyRoger> As for if there are any out there that are as of yet unknown, unpatched, and discovered, we don't know.
02:44:34 <surveillexxxx[m]> so unless that exploit exists intel cant do it?
02:44:43 <Wonderfall[m]> <rathantara[m] "self-hosted + searches through t"> Then you should just use Tor itself. Requests through a meta-search engine could stand out
02:45:14 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: not sure what you're asking.
02:45:40 <M7777777y[m]> TheJollyRoger for affordability you can get olimex boards
02:45:47 <surveillexxxx[m]> unless that exploit for hap exists they cant remotely turn on hap
02:45:51 <M7777777y[m]> But idk how secure they are
02:46:07 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], the hap switch is in the ime image
02:46:21 <Baobab> you'd need to reflash it to turn it on
02:46:24 <surveillexxxx[m]> hmmm
02:46:33 <surveillexxxx[m]> ah so its good then
02:46:53 <TheJollyRoger> Note that like I said, disabling the IME may cause you to become vulnerable to some attacks that you normally aren't.
02:47:10 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], I highly recommend switching off of x86.
02:47:17 <Baobab> *if you're able to
02:47:24 <surveillexxxx[m]> isnt that slower though?
02:47:33 <surveillexxxx[m]> now look i dont mind slow things
02:47:34 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], the isa?
02:47:41 <surveillexxxx[m]> but I kinda need it for my work
02:48:40 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: no, POWER actually beats x86 of the time for certain multithreaded operations, compression and decompression, and cryptographic operations, and still remains competitive today.
02:48:44 <TheJollyRoger> *POWER9 actually
02:48:50 <Baobab> >I highly recommend switching off of x86.
02:48:50 <Baobab> even excluding ime, x86 is a mess
02:49:09 <Baobab> it's why i ditched my T400 for a c201
02:49:11 <TheJollyRoger> Even though POWER10 is now being rolled out.
02:49:27 <surveillexxxx[m]> so where can I learn about this glorious piece of tech
02:49:40 <surveillexxxx[m]> any articles i can read?
02:49:55 <M7777777y[m]> Are there any good options for low power devices other than arm
02:49:58 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], to learn about the talos II or the power isa?
02:50:27 <surveillexxxx[m]> I want to learn about hardware that I control not the gov
02:50:30 <Baobab> M7777777y[m], probably riscv?
02:50:33 <surveillexxxx[m]> not big tech
02:50:34 <surveillexxxx[m]> just me
02:50:52 <M7777777y[m]> Maybe
02:50:53 <Baobab> there's this isa emulator called spike that's pretty cool
02:51:14 <M7777777y[m]> There was one that it was a hybrid CPU and GPU
02:51:23 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: IBM actually publishes a great deal of stuff about the POWER9 CPUs, and most of the technical literature such as the reference manuals and engineering documentation is actually open source. You can probably get a cursory view by searching IBM.com for "power9."
02:51:26 <M7777777y[m]> Forgot the name though
02:51:45 <TheJollyRoger> Note that that's just the chip though.
02:51:46 <surveillexxxx[m]> isnt IBM big tech though
02:51:59 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: what computer stuff isn't? So, newsflash;
02:52:18 <surveillexxxx[m]> oh
02:52:19 <TheJollyRoger> building a CPU is complex, costly, requires HUGE amounts of resources and huge amounts of risk.
02:52:20 <surveillexxxx[m]> didnt know this
02:52:32 <TheJollyRoger> It's reliant on economy of scale.
02:52:44 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], purism/system76 uses intel processors
02:52:54 <surveillexxxx[m]> yes
02:52:57 <surveillexxxx[m]> I know
02:53:15 <TheJollyRoger> If it wasn't for a lot of people working together, with a lot of common heritage, and with a lot of resources to shoulder that burden and get an insanely complex product containing countless transistors squeezed into the palm of your hand,
02:53:29 <TheJollyRoger> we wouldn't have computers /period./
02:53:29 <M7777777y[m]> Now now
02:53:36 <M7777777y[m]> Don't lick the boot too hard
02:53:55 <TheJollyRoger> So pick your battles.
02:54:33 <M7777777y[m]> There is more bad than good coming out if this scale
02:54:34 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to head to the beach, scoop up a bucket of sand, and cast your own CPUs, you totally can, but the most assistance I can give you with that is to lend you a bucket, and wish you good luck.
02:54:37 <Baobab> a lot of software has companies behind it
02:54:42 <Baobab> e.g. linux
02:55:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Linux especially, the biggest contributors to it are Google, Samsung, and... le gasp. Intel.
02:55:13 <Baobab> and microsoft too right?
02:55:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, Microsoft surprisingly enough have been contributing to Linux.
02:55:27 <M7777777y[m]> Yes
02:55:37 <Baobab> This year will be the year of the Plan9 desktop.
02:55:45 <TheJollyRoger> For those of us that want to be smug and shout "BSD" guess where Clang came from?
02:56:13 <M7777777y[m]> I think its better to go to take the bucket of sand than to give up
02:56:16 <surveillexxxx[m]> im thinking for now system76 would be a good bet bc if they disable it then im safe from remote access unless an exploit is found.
02:56:21 <TheJollyRoger> M7777777y[m]: Then good luck.
02:56:23 <surveillexxxx[m]> like Jolly said, pick your battles, and for now im going to pick to not fight this one
02:56:32 <Baobab> BSD came from AT & T's unix
02:57:35 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], if you really want to get a laptop and flip the hap switch, I recommend getting a thinkpad or something.
02:57:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. But unfortunately they had to hold out on an old version of gcc for a very long due to some odd reasons, a few of which might've been license incompatibilities... around ~2009 or so they switched to Clang which came from Apple.
02:57:55 <Baobab> there isn't anything special about system76 that I'm aware of
02:58:07 <surveillexxxx[m]> thinkpads BIO's where backdoored?
02:58:13 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], use coreboot
02:58:14 <surveillexxxx[m]> unless you are talking about the old ones
02:58:23 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, there really isn't anything special about system76. They're rebadged clevos.
02:58:26 <TheJollyRoger> *Clevos.
02:58:50 <Baobab> >there isn't anything special about system76 that I'm aware of
02:58:50 <Baobab> This applies to purism also
02:58:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
02:59:07 <TheJollyRoger> All laptops these days come out of the same like six factories anyways.
02:59:34 <surveillexxxx[m]> S76 uses coreboot
02:59:56 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: you seem set on this, so I'm not going to waste any more time. Have fun.
03:00:09 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], good luck!
03:00:52 <surveillexxxx[m]> I will take the advice and buy switch off of this later down the road
03:01:14 <surveillexxxx[m]> but for now I will make this a fun little project and secure it
03:01:22 <M7777777y[m]> They are pricy
03:01:30 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], I recommend depthcharge as a payload
03:01:37 <M7777777y[m]> Don't buy unless you have the money
03:01:41 <surveillexxxx[m]> depthcharge?
03:01:44 <Baobab> that way you can use chromeos's secureboot
03:02:03 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], yeah, it's a payload that's pretty cool
03:02:11 <Baobab> I use it when I'm not using grub2
03:02:27 <surveillexxxx[m]> usually when i hear the word payload its a malicious one
03:02:36 <M7777777y[m]> Royally-Fucked-Privacy-Advocate if you want something basic that runs u boot go to  olimex website pay 60$, put parabola on it and call it a day
03:02:40 <surveillexxxx[m]> so forgive me for stating wrong
03:03:35 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], coreboot basically does a little hardware initialization, then launches a payload like seabios, or tianocore
03:03:57 <surveillexxxx[m]> I will make sure to do some research on it
03:04:03 <Baobab> :)
03:04:11 <TheJollyRoger> On x86 platforms after ~2010, coreboot hands off to the FSP.
03:04:22 <surveillexxxx[m]> if I find a way to make this more private and secure I will write it up on a forum
03:06:55 <surveillexxxx[m]> btw if I may ask did I do anything wrong or did I just not listen to what you where saying TheJollyRoger ? I would like to know the full extent so i can improve so no one wastes their time explaining things to me 🙂
03:08:25 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m], you kind of had your heart set on system76
03:08:37 <Baobab> and TheJollyRoger was trying to tell you the cons
03:08:59 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: I think we just may not be speaking the same language. To be honest, there's no security nor privacy advantage in System76 even with IME disabled, but it seems they are your preference.
03:09:13 <TheJollyRoger> So... it's your dime.
03:10:31 <TheJollyRoger> Like, there really isn't any security or privacy advantage in it. At all. And there are potentially a lot of cons, but if that's what you want, then go ahead, I can't stop you from spending the money.
03:10:58 <Baobab> >https://review.coreboot.org/plugins/gitiles/coreboot/+/refs/heads/master/src/mainboard/pine64/rockpro64/
03:10:58 <Baobab> soon...
03:12:03 <surveillexxxx[m]> I will take this info and improve
03:12:05 <surveillexxxx[m]> I will look over what you were sayiny Jolly and take sense to what you where saying, thnx for telling me Baobab
03:12:14 <Baobab> surveillexxxx[m] yeah np
03:12:18 <surveillexxxx[m]> Tor took so long to send that
03:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, well, as it is, privacy and security is a very nuanced issue.
03:17:30 <TheJollyRoger> Nuanced problems require a /lot/ more care than simple answers otherwise provide. Simple answers tend to be convenient because we as people don't like doing the work to understand 'em.
03:18:15 <TheJollyRoger> I made many similar mistakes starting out... took me a while to get over 'em. Still am in a lot of cases.
03:18:20 <Baobab> Most security/privacy answers will be "depends"
03:18:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:19:46 <TheJollyRoger> The thing about software is that it's still an emerging technology: we are doing things with it, before we understand how those things work, how they work, or even what they are. So as a result, things change /fast/.
03:20:11 <TheJollyRoger> The best we can do as geeks, whether we are building systems, or using them, is try to keep pace.
03:20:34 <TheJollyRoger> *about software, and computers in general, including hardware
03:21:01 <TheJollyRoger> Rather than simply sort things into arbitrary "good" and "bad" boxes.
05:58:25 <M1f4a9[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Royally-Fucked-Privacy-Advocate:"> Aren't they quite power hungry? That's why everyone is switching to ARM nowadays.
06:05:51 <Patrick[m]4> Holy shit, Google Maps works nowadays without Play Services
06:16:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <s​urfhard> But it will still compromise ones privacy right?
06:22:36 <Patrick[m]4> Osmand+ is better in that regard but there are some instances where GM is such a ridiculously useful tool (i.e. traffic)

09:25:46 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> There's still a part of that documentation of still keeping some of these data, and "anonymizing" these
09:25:59 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Which according to some studies, is not so effective against deanonymization
10:01:48 <Gladox114[m]> So I have a problem with Wifi security login. On my phone with Lineage OS I could connect to WPA/WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise. But on Graphene OS I want to do the same thing but there is one more text field needed that says "Domain"... How should I know it and why does Lineage not need this but Graphene?
10:07:23 <Gladox114[m]> seems like this isn't graphene Os but rather more the new android or only for pixel android

10:13:17 <Gladox114[m]> they also say it's not the same problem
10:13:23 <Gladox114[m]> and don't get help
10:13:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Take a look on my link
10:19:11 <Gladox114[m]> yeah the post is talking about the certificate but I can select the option and I don't get the red text like in the picture. But looking at the second Picture I did everything there but Domain is needed and the first Picture doesn't show it
10:29:32 <Gladox114[m]> actually having the exact same problem and this dude is showing you the settings

10:37:16 <Gladox114[m]>  * it seems that the school needs to fix it. I think this will never happen because schools are lazy but gonna try and ask my teacher. Thought I could fix it OS side but google wants to really push security by not letting you login without a domain
10:41:12 <GhostSplinterSix> I would never connect to a school's network unless it was a last resort.
10:41:32 <Gladox114[m]> what about a VPN?
10:42:46 <GhostSplinterSix> Well, yeah...I would if I have something like a VPN. Not everyone is smart enough to protect themself.
10:43:20 <Gladox114[m]> true
10:45:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Won't they still see your traffic as you are logged into their network? Not sure
10:47:07 <Gladox114[m]> well the only thing they can know is when you were online. Not sure if the the sim-card provider also stores the informations
10:47:26 <TheLoneWanderer[> Don't they need to install a custom cert if they want to decrypt traffic?
10:47:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Yep
10:47:48 <Gladox114[m]> but on sim-card provider your name and school isnt bound to you so it should be still better than school
10:48:27 <GhostSplinterSix> Using a VPN on a school's WiFi would be the same thing as using a VPN on your home's WiFi. They'd see someone is connected to it but your device's IP address is masked by an IP address set by the VPN.
10:49:27 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Alright, assuming that is indeed the case, there's a low lying problem solved, next would be resistance against traffic analysis, but usually Tor on not self-owned WiFi is not a great idea or sight
10:53:29 <GhostSplinterSix> More often that not, educational websites and networks don't allow Tor and so it would be blocked.
10:54:08 <Gladox114[m]> bridges could still manage to connect you to tor and hide the fact that you are using tor
10:54:24 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Gladox114[m] "bridges could still manage to co"> Still cannot fully hide you are using Tor
10:55:08 <GhostSplinterSix> Correct. That and you'd be exposing personal information.
10:56:32 <TheLoneWanderer[> What personal information?
10:56:53 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> When you use Tor while logging in to school or work-related domains
10:57:01 <GhostSplinterSix> ^
10:57:06 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> That site domain alone can be identifying enough
10:57:37 <TheLoneWanderer[> Understandable but then again, why would you do that?
10:58:57 <TheLoneWanderer[> The only goal of Tor/VPN here is to hide which sites you visit
10:58:57 <GhostSplinterSix> Your student account has your address, phone number, etc etc.
10:59:35 <TheLoneWanderer[> hmm, matrix lagging again
10:59:57 <GhostSplinterSix> Yes. But it is strongly suggested to still not access websites that reveal your personal information...
11:00:20 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Use clearnet for that iirc
11:00:26 <TheLoneWanderer[> Exactly
11:04:10 <GhostSplinterSix> I'll never forget the time that Verizon threatened to ban my buddy and his family if their IP address didn't stop torrenting media from ThePirateBay. His idiot brother was downloading anything and everything.
11:04:57 <TheLoneWanderer[> lmao
11:05:47 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> There once was a student who didnt learn for exam. At the da of exam he send a bomb threat through tor. But he got busted because he had to login in his schools network. The identified that the only tor traffic at the specified time only came from his network account lol
11:07:10 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Lmao
11:07:15 <TheLoneWanderer[> lmfao
11:07:19 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> That's also a problem
11:07:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Be the only one that uses Tor, you get caught
11:07:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Fucking legend... was totally worth it haha
11:08:38 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Yea especially if you have to login to the network with credentials tied to you
11:09:18 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Seems like the rule of not using enterprise/education WiFi for personal usage is not for bandwidth reasons
11:09:45 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's also to protect self from having privacy/security/anonymity reduced or exposed
11:09:51 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> More likely than not, you'd stand out
11:13:48 <GhostSplinterSix> When I was in college, the FBI, other federal agencies and local law enforcement personnel raided a dorm room above mine. Someone was accessing websites containing underage children on the school's network.
11:14:04 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm telling you...people are smart AF.
11:14:20 <TheLoneWanderer[> You'd stand out but then again, you'd also hide what you're browsing from your school
11:16:08 <TheLoneWanderer[> Not that it matters much if they don't have a custom cert installed
11:17:20 <TheLoneWanderer[> They can't see what you're searching for on google etc.
11:17:26 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> He could have just hide the tor connection through a vpn and the school propably would not have recognized it
11:18:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> And they prove it everyday 😂

11:20:59 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> At least, according to some info I got before
11:21:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> "Worse" depends on your threat model. It is good for hiding tor traffic.

11:25:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Identifying Tor users in VPN traffic, especially retrospectively, is arguably harder than searching based on known Tor bridges. Many people use VPN services, far more than use Tor. 
11:27:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Although Tor bridges may well be "harder to monitor", it's arguable that this is so only transiently. That is, sooner or later, virtually all Tor bridges are identified, and replaced with new bridges.If that assessment is accurate, consider the implications for observers of my ISP-assigned IP address. If I were using Tor bridges, all of my prior traffic to a particular Tor bridge would be readily found once that b

11:36:40 <TheLoneWanderer[> The easiest example
11:50:37 <GhostSplinterSix> *wipes forehead*
12:10:53 <TheJollyRoger> M1f4a9[m]: POWER's not particularly power-hungry. Google and Rackspace put a lot of money into POWER9 to get their own platforms made for it. It's quite versatile, powerful, and efficient. I have the 8-core versions, when idle the chips draw about ~30W each, give or take a bit, although again, POWER9 was released in 2017 and is on 14nm tech.
12:35:03 <TheJollyRoger> Hello tasanox[m]; for desktop operating systems, you've got a number of options. If you're into Linux, a lot of people here when it comes to Linux like Arch or Void since they're rolling release, and keep up with upstream releases. A few others like Fedora since Fedora keeps pace with upstream.
12:36:09 <tasanox[m]> I've been considering trying out Void or Fedora in fact. Also looked a bit at Qubes, but until it supports GPU passsthrough I'm probably gonna hold off on that
12:37:31 <TheJollyRoger> Well... I think if you're holding out for Qubes to support GPU passthrough, I think you'll be disappointed. GPUs have a lot of security implications due to the nature of being essentially a von neumann computer to themselves, and occupying a highly privileged position which is attached to the host via direct memory access.
12:37:44 <TheJollyRoger> So the reason they at this point in time don't support GPU passthrough out of the box is actually considered a feature.
12:38:35 <TheJollyRoger> It's *possible* to get GPU passthrough working with a bit of clever workarounds and some hackery. Someone I met on a chat room claimed to have done it, but recommended against it due to this.
12:39:21 <tasanox[m]> I'm just hoping that one day it will be easy to enable, yet disabled by default
12:39:35 <TheJollyRoger> Ah. In that case, possibly! Time will tell.
12:41:23 <tasanox[m]> I certainly hope so, currently using Windows 10 and I want nothing more than run Qubes and have a Windows 10 gaming VM that works flawlessly
12:41:25 <TheJollyRoger> If you're not currently on Linux, Windows also is a topic that occasionally comes up from time to time here. Although Windows 10 gets a bad rep in some privacy circles due to overblown reports of telemetry and invasiveness, and a lot of FUD, the interesting thing to note is that Windows actually has a number of exploit mitigations that are either mutually exclusive with the design of
12:41:28 <TheJollyRoger> Linux, or aren't around yet.
12:42:28 <tasanox[m]> Indeed, I've used Application Guard quite a bit and I think it's a neat feature. It's what got me interested in Qubes in the first place
12:42:45 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir! :)
12:46:00 <TheJollyRoger> If you haven't tried out any Linux distributions yet, Fedora usually is a great first step. It's got the full support of RedHat, so they've got a pretty diligent developer team. It doesn't play as well with older hardware as some distributions, but it's a pretty small and relatively easy step to go from Windows to Fedora. I used to use Fedora myself a bit back, and found it was pretty
12:46:03 <TheJollyRoger> nice that you could more or less have an entirely usable setup and experience without needing to touch the commandline.
12:46:27 <TheJollyRoger> Qubes is the same way. I like their approach and philosophy of "usability is an aspect of security"
12:47:07 <tasanox[m]> I've used Ubuntu, Mint, Manjaro and Whonix. The first 2 on a real machine, the latter two in a VM. I might try Fedora next
12:47:13 <TheJollyRoger> Fantastic.
12:47:35 <covid-1984[m]> I'm most impressed with Void Linux
12:47:53 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta run for a bit, I'll see you guys around!
12:48:12 <tasanox[m]> Really? Why are you unimpressed with Void?
12:48:12 <tasanox[m]> Bye!
12:53:04 <covid-1984[m]> tasanox: well it is super simple
12:53:16 <covid-1984[m]> And I've had zero problems running it over a year
12:53:32 <tasanox[m]> Oh sorry, I'm at work and I read it as "I'm not impressed"
12:54:07 <vdh7[m]> is there an app that would enable me log and dump in a file the online connections and data sent by apps?
12:54:36 <vdh7[m]> without having to install a development environment and plug a cable on pc
12:55:06 <tasanox[m]> Void looks pretty darn enticing I got to say
13:53:53 <GhostSplinterSix> With regards to desktop OSes, I always recommend Qubes + Whonix, Tails and Linux Kodachi.
13:54:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Why kodachi especially?
13:55:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Anyone heard about garudalinux?
13:57:46 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Did check, sounds good. But im fine with tails as a notrace live distro. Or are there reasons to switch?
13:58:15 <GhostSplinterSix> For starters, the OS is frequently among search results and articles discussing the best Linux distros for privacy and security.
13:59:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Yeah but thats no true reason for me to switch^^
13:59:38 * GhostSplinterSix  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/DmzxRAKPpSqtovLUUgPDzQqc/message.txt >
14:05:47 <TheJollyRoger> Kodachi's been busted doing sketchy things with their users like using their users' CPUs for cryptomining, and it's also a downstream fork of Mint, which has the attitude of "Security updates? Why would you need that?" Highly not recommended.
14:08:28 <GhostSplinterSix> The OS is frequently among search results and articles discussing the best Linux distros for privacy and security and so I thought I'd mention it in case someone wanted to look into it and decide for themselves whether they want to use it or not.
14:09:42 <vdh7[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Kodachi's been busted doing sket"> lol i'm on mint
14:10:11 <vdh7[m]> but hey had to start somewhere, looked like the easiest linux distro to start on
14:11:25 <vdh7[m]> what would you recommend as next step? I saw you guys like arch linux but I checked and I think I can't use that yet
14:11:31 <TheJollyRoger> You should consider checking out Fedora, they're much closer to upstream. Versioning tends to increment more quickly on Fedora, but many people would consider that a bonus.
14:11:38 <GhostSplinterSix> Fair enough! We all start somewhere.
14:11:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, indeed!
14:12:27 <TheJollyRoger> GhostSplinterSix: Most people writing these articles don't tend to look deeper into nuance beyond the UI, sadly. Unfortunately, it's really past the UI where privacy and security really begin.
14:13:17 <vdh7[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You should consider checking out"> ok thx ! will try
14:13:41 <TheJollyRoger> There is more to privacy and security than providing preinstalled apps and throwing in a whole bunch of VPNs. Unfortunately, since nuance and code review is complex, these things often are used as proxy signals for it.
14:15:00 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Yeah and also it connects to a default vpn? What? You trust a defaultly set vpn you dont know? Not a good idea
14:15:04 <TheJollyRoger> vdh7[m]: Good luck! Fedora is a very small step away from Windows, most things are done via the graphical layer. Fedora doesn't play as well with older hardware as some lighter distributions, but it's fairly intuitive and you won't have to touch the commandline much, if at all, for stuff you're going about day to day.
14:15:09 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah. I can understand that.
14:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> @M0ctezuma - hit the nail on the head there!
14:16:12 <GhostSplinterSix> I'd love to try out BlackArch once I get into pentest.
14:16:14 <TheJollyRoger> The installer for Fedora is all-graphical as well, it's very point-and-click. It does offer you some more options than the Ubuntu installer does, but the defaults tend to be fairly sane.
14:16:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Opensuse tumbleweed with kde is also beautiful, but not for absolute bloody beginners.
14:16:43 <trttl> if you're entirely new to linux i would say stick with mint or an another just werks out of the box distro for a few months until you figure out the basics of how a linux system works, get familiar with the filesystem hierarchy, permissions, the command line, the major components of the os, etc. after that you can just switch to whatever
14:18:29 <vdh7[m]> <TheJollyRoger "vdh7: Good luck! Fedora is a ver"> trttl: ok looks cool. I can do a bit of command line but not debug broken dependencies and such yet
14:18:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Its the perfect os for productivity in my opinion. And highly customisable. I used it for long time, now switched to qubes and still customising the whole thing and dod not rech the productivity mode i had with tumbleweed. But some day...
14:19:26 <TheJollyRoger> That's perfectly fine! Fedora actually includes an all-graphical package manager, and they've depreciated the old yum package manager which was prone to the infamous "RedHat Dependency Hell."
14:20:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> I often heard manjaro is often recommended for beginners but i never tried it
14:20:29 <TheJollyRoger> There is one catch though you need to know before you run Fedora, and that's the Fedora ecosystem moves /fast./ They release a new one every ~six months, and then immediately move to put the older versions on EOL. So you do have to be fairly on top of things.
14:20:44 <TheJollyRoger> But it's fairly simple to upgrade between versions.
14:21:46 <trttl> yeah. my main problem with fedora in the past was that version upgrades weren't always painless
14:22:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. From time to time that can happen, I've had the same happen to me as well, although it was a long time ago.
14:22:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Ohh i had this alwys with parrotOS
14:22:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Once an update simply fcked up my whole luks
14:23:17 <TheJollyRoger> I partially like Rolling Release distributions for this reason, because that way I can have little breakages from time to time, then deal with them easily, rather than have things working fine for about six months, and then have something major break or a whole lot of things break at once and the operating system collapse.
14:23:37 <trttl> the same was true for something like ubuntu or debian and their broken dist-upgrade but you only had to that every 2 years not every 10 months
14:23:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
14:24:12 <TheJollyRoger> Fedora is much, much faster about this, new release every six months, and as soon as they do you have to move quickly because they won't support the old release for much longer afterwards.
14:24:17 <vdh7[m]> <TheJollyRoger "There is one catch though you ne"> ok thx i'll try on virtualbox to see if I like before I switch
14:24:53 <TheJollyRoger> vdh7[m]: Sure, that's a great idea. You will need to give the Fedora installer something like at least 2GB of RAM, or it may think you're on a small embedded device and give you a text-based installer instead of the graphical one.
14:25:03 <nscnt[m]> That's why I always make a clean installation. Create a good backup plan that always runs. It should be easy to set up the machine again. Don't rely on an operating system. All you want is your data
14:25:05 <TheJollyRoger> So if you boot it up and it immediately dumps you onto the commandline, you need a bit more RAM.
14:25:22 <trttl> yeah fedora is overall a good choice if you want to spare your time from dealing with ancient packages
14:25:22 <TheJollyRoger> nscnt[m]: yessir!
14:25:40 <nscnt[m]> You can't get to use the new file system if you only upgrade
14:28:01 <jpds> trttl: Fedora is pretty up-to-date these days, and release upgrades are even more seamless with silverblue
14:29:17 <trttl> it is
14:29:35 <trttl> still prefer rolling

19:20:46 <tasanox[m]> <abze "my Q is about if its very steppy"> Looks pretty easy to me, check the website
19:21:04 <abze> tasanox[m]:  thanks
19:24:13 <came2complain[m]> Seems like there won't be a Pixel 5a :(
19:25:05 <GhostSplinterSix> All good.
19:25:39 <aks3n> came2complain[m], why not?
19:25:59 <came2complain[m]> no mention at the Google I/O 2021 keynote
19:26:38 <tasanox[m]> <came2complain[m] "Seems like there won't be a Pixe"> As long as they launch a Pixel 6a with the new chip, I'm happy
19:27:01 <came2complain[m]> what's your problem with the current chip? :D
19:27:16 <tasanox[m]> Only 3 years of updates, mainly
19:27:34 <tasanox[m]> Currently I'm using an Iphone 8. It's from 2017 and still updated
19:28:08 <came2complain[m]> but not secure :D
19:28:24 <came2complain[m]> all iPhones except for the 12 series have been hacked already.
19:28:37 <came2complain[m]> 12 series is about to be done too.
19:28:37 <aks3n> came2complain[m], just because it wasn't announced today, doesn't mean it wont be in the next two days or later. It's scheduled to go from May 18-20.
19:32:28 <abze> by card means
19:33:56 <abze> so i got here a mean card , ancient card, the RMN
19:36:09 <sign4l[m]> I have just seen the Google I/O keynote. Unbelievable how often they told us how they take privacy serious... and you will be able to delete your search history... Liars!
19:36:27 <tasanox[m]> They take privacy very seriously... their own privacy ;)
19:36:32 <sign4l[m]> And the new material design UI for android 12...
19:36:39 <sign4l[m]> 🤮
19:36:46 <tasanox[m]> Another thing they will half-ass, for sure
19:38:52 <abze> google is in the hands of politicians, boxkiki sails in turbulence w/ the democrat bite
19:39:18 <sign4l[m]> Ah and there are 3 billion active android devices in use... but they did not tell if they are patched to current security level.. which they are not
19:40:25 <mrx777[m]> <came2complain[m] "12 series is about to be done to"> And it has a realtime tracking chip outside the gps.
19:40:26 <mrx777[m]> 7,8,x doesnt have that tracking chip.
19:40:26 <mrx777[m]> Is it true dat Graphene on Pixel 3a is less securen then on Pixel 4a and Graphene devs also suggesting to not use Pixel 3a anymore?
19:41:00 <sign4l[m]> Ah the new privacy dashboard... Which tells you which app is currently open and is using gps or microphone... this is what I understand of transparency
19:48:33 <tasanox[m]> Can Aurora Store be set to automagically update apps on GrapheneOS btw?
19:50:51 <GhostSplinterSix> <mrx777[m] "Is it true dat Graphene on Pixel"> The support for the 3a will end before the support for 4a will and so that's why people will recommend the 4a.

19:59:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Lol
19:59:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Confirmed it
19:59:22 <tasanox[m]> I think we're the ones questioning your sanity here bro
19:59:55 <abze> poh
20:00:04 <GhostSplinterSix> If Railgun is Soros, I'm severing my friendship.

20:22:54 <TheExplorer[m]> I was talking about launchers in the main GrapheneOS room, switching here
20:23:06 <TheExplorer[m]> I was wondering how safe open launcher was
20:23:45 <TheExplorer[m]> Because it seriously brings many features that are important to me compared to grapheneOS' launcher
20:26:44 <GhostSplinterSix> When in doubt, I go with whatever the OS comes with and follow any guidance (since I'm relatively new to the OS) that more experienced users in the main room and this room recommend.
20:26:47 <abze> you can shop security specs each year, such things is a race ,

20:53:50 <buthomeisnowhere> What's the search app on graphene?
20:53:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> abze: wtf
20:54:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I thought I told you to stop derailing the chat
20:54:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> buthomeisnowhere: Do you mean search engine or...?
20:55:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Not sure what you mean by "search app"
20:56:09 <buthomeisnowhere> There's an app called search
20:57:52 <noobie62> I'm guessing you mean an internet search engine? Where does "Search" look in?
20:58:00 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> how would you know?

21:01:19 <noobie62> I've heard that push notifications don't work for all apps. Does this apply to text and email?
21:03:31 <strcat[m]> no, that's not accurate
21:03:36 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#notifications
21:10:12 <noobie62> That's great, thanks! It seems most youtubers don't give good insights into the experience.
21:11:22 <strcat[m]> YouTube is a bad source of information especially since one of the main influencers there is malicious towards the project and tries to undermine it while pretending to be a supporter
21:13:48 <GhostSplinterSix> YpuTube is as accurate as Wikipedia.
21:14:04 <Baobab> I made a peertube instance
21:14:17 <Baobab> but all of my videos are private rn
21:14:20 <Baobab> lol
21:15:14 <theychuckthisfro> Did you guys see what the new Android update is trying to shove down our throats.
21:15:18 <theychuckthisfro>  * Did you guys see what the new Android update is trying to shove down our throats?
21:15:23 <M7777777y[m]> YouTube will be TV 2.0 soon
21:15:26 <Wonderfall[m]> "Youtubers" are often not qualified enough to speak about a technical subject, yet people are inclined to trust them because of the format. This is very dangerous since it easily allows misinformation to be spread.
21:15:32 <theychuckthisfro> It has been for a while.
21:15:42 <M7777777y[m]> Yup
21:15:43 <GhostSplinterSix> <theychuckthisfro "Did you guys see what the new An"> Nothing is getting shoved down my throat without my consent...
21:15:51 <M7777777y[m]> But even more
21:16:40 <M7777777y[m]> Most of the good channels are available on Odyssey or peertube now
21:17:05 * theychuckthisfro uploaded an image: (188KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/200acres.org/sxfuXAeNBwOqxelaBLFFiTmW/image.png >
21:17:06 <M7777777y[m]> But if you must use YouTube for something, invidious is the way to go
21:17:52 <GhostSplinterSix> Oh, YouTube? That Big Tech POS I already don't use...
21:17:55 <M7777777y[m]> No js bloat needed
21:18:26 <M7777777y[m]> I never directly go to YouTube but I still get YouTube content from invidious sometimes
21:19:01 <M7777777y[m]> Its very easy to switch considering invidious loads waaaay faster too
21:21:37 <GhostSplinterSix> Just don't touch my GrapheneOS and Tor- and Onion-related software alone.
21:50:28 <TheExplorer[m]> Are peertube and freetube comparable to invidious ?
21:55:30 <_johnson> Is Barinsta a secure app on Grapheneos?
22:02:13 <lackshan[m]> TheExplorer Peertube is a selfhosted alternative to YouTube whereas invidious is a front end for YouTube
22:02:22 <lackshan[m]> Not sure about freetube
22:05:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> Freetube is an open-source desktop client for YouTube than can also proxy through Invidious, if I remember right.
22:06:31 <TheExplorer[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Freetube is an open-source deskt"> Yea exactly
22:07:10 <TheExplorer[m]> <lackshan[m] "TheExplorer Peertube is a selfho"> Yea I know but the content is still limited there
22:09:02 <TheExplorer[m]> And what about newpipe, is it a good option for mobile phones ?
22:10:42 <Baobab> peertube is a video hosting platform
22:10:55 <Baobab> it's not just a youtube proxy
22:11:06 <Baobab> *it isn't a youtube proxy
22:11:38 <TheExplorer[m]> Yess I know but that's not what I'm asking...
22:11:55 <Baobab> oh
22:12:01 <akc3n[m]> <_johnson "Is Barinsta a secure app on Grap"> Is that that instagram wrapper client?
22:25:59 <_johnson> I'm not sure... I just know it's an open source, Instagram access app.
22:28:36 <ypm[m]> <TheExplorer[m] "And what about newpipe, is it a "> newpipe is worth the convenience if you use yt a lot
22:29:02 <ypm[m]> just make sure to use the upstream repo and not the fdroid builds
22:29:18 <ypm[m]> since fdroid lags behind and google changes thigns every now and then that break newpipe
22:29:41 <ypm[m]> so more downtime whenever theres a hotfix or w/e
22:53:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> _johnson you are free to use whatever you want to use
22:53:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Is your security compramized by installing barinsta vs Instagram? The answer is no
22:54:08 <GhostSplinterSix> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> _johnson you are free to"> They left already.
22:54:12 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> All apps are sandboxed
22:54:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Oh, ok, tnx ghost bro
