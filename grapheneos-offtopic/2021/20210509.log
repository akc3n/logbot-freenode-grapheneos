00:56:42 <GhostSplinterSix> Scroll up and you'll see my message.
00:57:31 <Cliff[m]> I see it, i asked did you know him?
00:59:44 <GhostSplinterSix> I do not but since your trolling comment was in response to him saying that he is using Element on PC, I commented that he's not and that a friend of mine uses Element on PC as well.
01:00:36 <Cliff[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I do not but since your trolling"> No it was not. Scroll up and read my messages. I couldn't believe some of his claims.
01:01:56 <GhostSplinterSix> I already have. Your message follows his and so that's how it appears.
01:04:15 <Cliff[m]> I was trying to help him. Read it all, it was a bit strange. Thats why i thought of trolling. I think you are reading the wrong chat.
01:05:06 <GhostSplinterSix> Like I said, I did read it. I can't read the wrong chat when I'm in the correct room. üòÜ
01:06:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Well, the full convo is like 2 days long, and appears both in the main channel and the off-topic

01:19:18 <GhostSplinterSix> Okay. üòÜ

01:20:38 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's really just that bad that it's hard to just recommend open source softwares
01:22:37 <a5trix[m]> Nothing about open source requires specific morals.
01:22:53 <a5trix[m]> Tho agreed.
01:22:53 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <a5trix[m] "Nothing about open source requir"> It's not really just that
01:22:59 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's just the cherry on top

05:17:03 <joltman[m]> after several hours of full format of 128gb flash drive on Win10, i ended up getting the same "volume too big for FAT32" error. It seems newer versions of windows intentionally don't let you format drives bigger than 32gb as FAT32. will probably have to use 3rd party software or linux instead. annoying, but whatever. anyone know if ext4 usb drives are recognized by Pixel 3XL? probably would be superior to
05:17:03 <joltman[m]> FAT32 if it's supported.
05:32:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> joltman: well
05:32:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Create a small 100 mb partition
05:32:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Format it as fat32
05:32:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Extend it to the rest of the disk
05:43:24 <joltman[m]> I'll look into that if I have trouble doing it the right way. Thanks.
05:43:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also idk why you're spending hours
05:43:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Full format is useless
05:43:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Full format is just zeroout the drive
05:44:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then create a filesysten
05:44:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> * And then create a filesystem
05:44:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's a waste of time
05:44:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do a quick format
05:46:45 <joltman[m]> I tried quick format first and got the error. After trying several other settings, I tried full format and didn't get the error, so I let the process continue. When the format was complete, it finally just gave me the same error as quick format.
05:48:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes because full format is just a zero out
05:48:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then quick format
05:48:59 <joltman[m]> yes, i discovered that the hard way. i thought it was one big process and would give an error right at the beginning.
05:50:25 <joltman[m]> So, do you happen to know if any other file systems other than FAT32 are supported for removable media?
05:51:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fat32 is basically something that a lot of people make the implementation mandatory for
05:51:04 <joltman[m]> I was hoping exFAT would be supported, but apparently not yet
08:12:19 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <a5trix[m] "I mean that is not controversial"> It's also generous to think that FOSS projects are always well-intentioned, but I was trying to understand earlier what you mean

08:50:45 <cx7dd[m]> <Cliff[m] "Do you get auto updates with nat"> I dont think so. Aurora store isnt running in the background. Most apps I use from google play dont have internet permission. So if I do not notice any bugs I usually dont update my apps.
09:27:16 <djentosaurus[m]> I just installed some apps from the aurora store, but nothing is showing on my phone. I can only open them in the store itself. Can this be fixed?
09:30:17 <djentosaurus[m]> I also remember seeing warnings sometimes that say the app was built for an older version or something in those lines. I have a Pixel 3a, so it should work no?
09:31:16 <sphinx[m]> <Cliff[m] "Or go to the home screen and swi"> do this properly
09:31:27 <sphinx[m]> there is nothing to fix
09:31:50 <djentosaurus[m]> When I go to the home screen and swipe up there is nothing there

09:33:50 <Assyria> Hello im trying to install graphene on a pixel 4xl via web usb. Im up to unlock the bootloader but it says no compatible device found. What do i do. Thanks
09:38:24 <dazinism> djentosaurus: maybe you swipe up from too low. Have to swipe from just above the bottom icons
09:39:17 <djentosaurus[m]> Okay, I see them now
09:39:18 <dazinism> ....actually think that way depend if you have gesture navigation or button navigation. Worth a trh
09:39:20 <dazinism> Try
09:39:36 <djentosaurus[m]> Is that normal
09:39:51 <djentosaurus[m]> Shouldn't they appear on the home screen?
09:40:18 <dazinism> You can pick them up from the tray and dump them on the home screen
09:40:46 <djentosaurus[m]> okay! it works
09:41:31 <dazinism> If you long press on the homescreen you get an option where icons for new apps are on homescreen automatically
09:42:33 <djentosaurus[m]> okay!
09:42:54 <dazinism> The warning about older apps is because they are not as secure
09:44:08 <dazinism> Its about the targetSDK
09:44:43 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps#Target_SDK
09:44:45 <djentosaurus[m]> when I long press the home screen I only get the messages: home settings, widgets styles and wallpapers
09:44:56 <djentosaurus[m]> If they are not as secure, are there risks when I install them?
09:48:37 <djentosaurus[m]> the option add app icons to homescreen is allready turned on I see
09:48:52 <djentosaurus[m]> but it doesn't fo it automaticly
09:49:01 <dazinism> There is some risks. But there is lots of stuff to consider when selecting apps. Ideally you would avoid installing apps with older targetSDK. Sometimes an app with an older targetSDK may be a better choice than alternatives
09:49:49 <dazinism> Have a good look at the wiki page I linked for info about some things to consider
09:51:04 <djentosaurus[m]> okay
10:17:17 <djentosaurus[m]> Got everything to work now, but can someone explain why I see a tiny white line on the bottom of my home screen when I swipe between 2 homescreens?
10:17:36 <djentosaurus[m]> very annoying
10:18:00 <djentosaurus[m]> Could a faulty app installation be the cause of this?
10:29:52 <Assyria> Trying to install graphene on pixel 4xl via web usb. Up to part where i need to unlock bootloader but it says no compatible device found. what to do?
10:36:50 <sphinx[m]> Assyria: you can ask in the main channel (#grapheneos) and please provide more details like if you are using a supported OS, browser, etc
10:37:20 <Assyria> thanks
11:07:12 <djentosaurus[m]> can someone explain why I see a tiny white line on the bottom of my home screen when I swipe between 2 homescreens?
11:11:05 <enjoy_the_silenc> How frequently do you wipe the cache partition? Does it make sense to do this once in a while?

21:30:02 <trail_undergroun> Ah
21:30:17 <trail_undergroun> So it‚Äôd be pointless
21:30:42 <strcat[m]> the packager manager can't install an apk that's not signed and pins the key after installing (it supports rotations authorized by the prior key)
21:30:47 <strcat[m]> and does downgrade protection
21:30:59 <strcat[m]> so the only thing you could verify is the signing key fingerprint if you obtained it out of band
21:31:08 <strcat[m]> they're just getting it from the Signal site which doesn't accomplish anything
21:31:23 <cryptokid777> But whats better to use, signal apk from their website so the signall app uodate itself and the only permission i give is to signal app, or aurora store but than i have to give the store the permission?
21:31:47 <strcat[m]> you don't have to give aurora store any permissions
21:31:54 <cryptokid777> I now many phones were hacked thru the updater feature, malware were uploaded with updater
21:32:05 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure what you're talking about
21:32:12 <strcat[m]> doesn't seem relevant to the discussion
21:32:19 <strcat[m]> you can read about how the OS update system works on the site
21:32:24 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
21:32:31 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
21:33:26 <strcat[m]> you cannot grant an app the ability to automatically install / update apps, only a component built into the OS could do that (and as you can see, we do not yet provide our own first party app install/update system as we plan to eventually)
21:33:43 <strcat[m]> cryptokid777: download Signal from their website via https on the phone and install it
21:33:45 <cryptokid777> Well if aurora store has permission to install apps, if someone can hack into aurora store they can plant malware thrue them on my phone, so thats why i am carefull with permissions
21:34:00 <strcat[m]> there is no permission to install apps automatically
21:34:08 <strcat[m]> doesn't exist as something available to third party apps
21:34:26 <cryptokid777> Okeyy than i misunderstood hownit works
21:34:29 <strcat[m]> please read all of my responses above
21:35:12 <strcat[m]> obtaining a public key hash from the same site you download an apk has no value
21:35:19 <strcat[m]> should be straightforward, I think
21:36:03 <cryptokid777> Okey well i dont know why the signal website post that key and says verify before install, if ita useless, i was figurong out whole day how to do it and it was for nothing
21:36:14 <strcat[m]> it's useless to verify based on that
21:36:17 <cryptokid777> Should come here first to ask i guess
21:36:18 <strcat[m]> you got the apk from the same place you got the hash
21:36:21 <strcat[m]> it can't help you
21:36:26 <strcat[m]> same HTTPS connection securing both
21:36:28 <strcat[m]> same server
21:36:40 <strcat[m]> we plan on displaying the public key hash on the initial install of an app but that's not implemented yet and again has NO VALUE if you're simply getting it from the same place
21:37:04 <strcat[m]> you only REDUCE your security by using your laptop to download it and then transferring it over
21:37:06 <strcat[m]> explained above
21:37:20 <strcat[m]> doing more work != making yourself more secure
21:37:40 <strcat[m]> using more software, doing more work with it, etc. is generally going to make you less secure
21:37:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cryptokid777 "Okey well i dont know why the si"> Don't be disheartened. At least you can help someone else out in future.
21:39:23 <cryptokid777> Oke got it,
21:40:30 <cryptokid777> I have one more question
21:40:34 <cryptokid777> I was reading this post
21:40:38 <cryptokid777> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/
21:40:54 <cryptokid777> Does this still apply because your response was a long time ago
21:41:11 <cryptokid777> Or is pixel with graphene now much better dan ios ?
21:41:23 <cryptokid777> In terms of security and privacy
21:42:04 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They're similar
21:42:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Some things GrapheneOS does better
21:42:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Some things iOS does better
21:42:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> the post is outdated, and your question does not really makes sense, let me try to explain
21:42:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> For example, GrapheneOS allows full sensor disablinf
21:42:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * For example, GrapheneOS allows full sensor disabling
21:42:49 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> how do you measure security?
21:43:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But iOS doesn't have an insecure kernel
21:43:29 <cryptokid777> Now being hacked into OS so the attacker can read my messages before they are encrypted, has acces to my files ohotos etc
21:43:47 <cryptokid777> Now=not
21:44:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, how do you measure that?
21:44:04 <cryptokid777> Thats what i mean with security
21:44:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They are different, it depends on your threat model which is better
21:44:41 <cryptokid777> I dont measure that , how high tech guys measure that i have no idea, thats why i am asking
21:44:55 <cryptokid777> If there is no way measuring that than jusy say yiu cant measure that
21:45:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> "a statement like this thing is 10 times more secure than that thing" makes completely no sense
21:45:22 <cryptokid777> Every question i ask you reply with question , whats the point of asking than?
21:45:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <c‚Äãhipharold> Any thoughts on cell phone carriers?
21:45:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <cryptokid777 "If there is no way measuring tha"> Again, it depends on your threat model
21:46:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<chipharold> Any thoughts on cel"> Cell towers in general are bad for privacy, it's intrinsic to radio physics
21:46:31 <cryptokid777> Well the reason i ask is because i saw a video of snowden explaining how easy governments hack into iphones,
21:46:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Please link that
21:47:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <c‚Äãhipharold> Yes but I must have some service its a necessary evil
21:47:13 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, my point is you can't measure security, without properly defining it first
21:47:14 <cryptokid777> Okey i will link that 1 1 moment
21:48:02 <cryptokid777> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XsIFppgyvWQ
21:49:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<chipharold> Yes but I must have"> Then idk
21:49:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You'll depend on your carrier's morality
21:49:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <c‚Äãhipharold> They don't have that feature available
21:51:13 <cryptokid777> So if iphones can be hacked this easy , like snowden says, does this apply also on grapheneos ?
21:51:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> cryptokid777: that iOS bug was patched in iOS 14
21:52:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> it's not an issue if you're up to date
21:52:30 <Railgun_Lover[m]> This is a good lesson on why you should be regularly updating
21:54:33 <cryptokid777> The video is from a few years ago, so if they just fixed it in ios14 they are a little bit late, maybe now tge government has a new exploid they are using and they will fix that in ios16 ,
21:54:48 <cryptokid777> It shows that ios isnt as secure as apple says
21:55:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Please don't spread rumors about other OSes
21:55:32 <cryptokid777> So i am just curious if graphene provides more security and privacy , and they are not vurnerble against these kind of attacks
21:55:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And you're lying about the date, it was from 7 months ago
21:55:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> The bug was from August 2019
21:56:33 <cryptokid777> Yes that video was , just look all snowden video s on youtibe he s talking aboit iphone hacking for years
21:56:55 <strcat[m]> I am impersonating Railgun_Lover: iOS kernel is not more secure
21:57:11 <Railgun_Lover[m]> strcat: oh it's not?
21:57:12 <Railgun_Lover[m]> My bad
21:57:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> cryptokid777: be careful with your claims, you are on the verge of spreading FUD
21:57:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Thought it would be better than the Linux kernel since that's a really low baf
21:57:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * Thought it would be better than the Linux kernel since that's a really low bar
21:58:00 <strcat[m]> it's better than a typical Linux kernel configuration / build
21:58:11 <strcat[m]> cryptokid777: I don't think this is a productive discussion for the channel
21:58:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> strcat: thanks for informing me
21:58:48 <cryptokid777> Well i want to know if graphene provides more security and privacy than ios
21:58:56 <cryptokid777> Its not a bad question
21:59:50 <cryptokid777> It s normal that people qant to know whats the most secure and use that, dont know why everyone gets so upset
22:00:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> If we consider only the privacy of your data, by default with no apps installed, GrapheneOS is better for privacy
22:01:25 <strcat[m]> cryptokid777: because you're posting claims based on youtube videos, media coverage, etc. which is not informed / accurate
22:01:29 <strcat[m]> and you're trying to argue
22:01:34 <strcat[m]> and it's just derailing the channel
22:01:44 <strcat[m]> a conversation between people who don't really know about something isn't helping anyone
22:01:51 <cryptokid777> I am posting video s of edward snowden, who has worked for the cia
22:02:07 <strcat[m]> just drop it
22:02:12 <cryptokid777> Wowwww
22:02:17 <strcat[m]> read past discussions in the channels and on Reddit

22:04:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Thanks
22:04:08 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Sorry
22:04:46 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Was testing whether the messages went to the other side
22:05:47 <cryptokid777> So if i understand, grapheneos is secure and good but when anyone want to switch from ios to grapheneos and asks questions about it than it s forbidden
22:06:39 <Railgun_Lover[m]> you need to read discussions between experts like stringcat
22:06:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Not YouTube videos
22:06:49 <cryptokid777> Thanks , this channel is the best, maybe change name from grapheneos to chinaOS, secure but questions not welcome
22:07:05 <cryptokid777> Edward snowden is an expert, i just posted that
22:07:09 <Railgun_Lover[m]> strcat:
22:07:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> TheJollyRoger:
22:07:31 <cryptokid777> Yes cry and ask for a ban
22:07:39 <Railgun_Lover[m]> cryptokid777: it was patched in iOS 14 anyway
22:07:41 <cryptokid777> Wtf , this is just sick
22:07:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Please stop spreading rumors
22:07:56 <cryptokid777> Stop crying i will leave myself
22:08:00 <cryptokid777> Communists
22:08:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Well
22:08:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> also, for anyone interested, https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/kde.org/ade39ed718dd4becc92ef2f994eadf63962911ac/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf
22:08:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> That was unexpected
22:09:33 <strcat> probably just a troll
22:09:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I don't understand why people think patched vulnerabilities are bad
22:10:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Kind of like saying OpenSSL is insecure because you can use Heartbleed
22:10:16 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> damn, i really hate when someone yells "communist" just to say "you're a bad person"
22:10:16 <Railgun_Lover[m]> (and I know there are more issues)
22:10:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> with openssl, but I'm saying it's insecure SIMPLY because of heartbleed
22:14:53 <WonderWoman> Hello everyone, i was wondering anyone knows whats best to use , VPN or Orbit and tor ?
22:15:16 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> WonderWoman: hello
22:15:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> WonderWoman: Tor, generally speaking
22:15:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> best for whom?
22:15:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> one can argue that better not to use any of them
22:15:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But it's not always the best thing, for example if your traffic intrinsically deanonymizes you
22:16:49 <WonderWoman> Wel i know tor is good but the problem i have with tor is that ISP can detect it, so maybe i will be suspicious using it
22:17:10 <strcat> just a warning for everyone in the channel: there are ongoing raids via sockpuppet accounts
22:17:33 <WonderWoman> And vpn on the other hand, dont know what the benefits are besides that my ip will be anonymous
22:17:54 <strcat> WonderWoman is very likely the same person as cryptokid777
22:18:16 <WonderWoman> ?
22:18:25 <WonderWoman> Are you serious?
22:19:25 <strcat> appears to be IPs from the same VPN provider / service
22:19:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <WonderWoman "Wel i know tor is good but the p"> It's sometimes "suspicious" because it's one of the only ways to truly anonymize yourself
22:19:28 <strcat> same writing style
22:19:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <strcat "appears to be IPs from the same "> Ah
22:19:56 <strcat> WonderWoman: yes I'm serious the channel is being raided and I don't appreciate it
22:20:29 <strcat> looks like trolling to me
22:20:32 <WonderWoman> There is no raid going on, just asking questions
22:20:47 <strcat> will you admit it's the same person?
22:20:54 <WonderWoman> I am not
22:21:05 <WonderWoman> I just want to know whats better to use
22:21:08 <WonderWoman> Vpn or tor
22:21:34 <Thatcher[m]> <cryptokid777 "Thanks , this channel is the bes"> ChinaOS could work as a name if the operating system broke easily, but that's not the case.
22:21:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Thatcher: He left
22:22:00 <louipc> i dont think theres a general better or worse really. depends on your needs and usage
22:22:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Unless he came back
22:22:30 <Thatcher[m]> I know
22:22:34 <WonderWoman> Alright thats louipc
22:22:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> louipc: Well I'd say generally Tor is better
22:23:37 <strcat> it's the same person
22:23:38 <strcat> same weird VPN
22:23:40 <strcat> same writing style
22:23:52 <strcat> just switched from netherlands IP to germany IP
22:24:04 <ypm[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "louipc: Well I'd say generally T"> better/worse don't exist in a vacuum. it's relative to some purpose, aka security, anonimity, performance, etc and these params dont necessarily overlap
22:24:12 <WonderWoman> I dont like you making those assumptions
22:24:22 <Railgun_Lover[m]> ypm: That's why I said "generally"
22:24:28 <WonderWoman> I am here to get some help
22:24:29 <strcat> not making assumptions
22:24:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But let's not fall into the trap
22:24:31 <strcat> those are facts
22:24:48 <ypm[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "ypm: That's why I said "generall"> fair enough
22:24:51 <strcat> someone left the channel and seconds later someone joins with same obscure VPN + same writing style
22:25:15 <WonderWoman> Vpn has millions of users, u cant just say this person has the same vpn so its hin
22:25:20 <WonderWoman> Very strange
22:26:00 <WonderWoman> So if i understand you right i am not welcome here?
22:26:09 <Thatcher[m]> Same style of names too. CryptoKid is superhero-like as WonderWoman
22:26:32 <WonderWoman> Cryptokid is a superhero?
22:26:39 <strcat> I mean it's pretty clear what's going on
22:26:52 <strcat> you can deny it and try to keep portraying the channel as oppressive which seems to be the goal of the raiding
22:26:58 <strcat> but I know what's going on
22:27:01 <WonderWoman> Yes it s clear people are paranoid dear god
22:27:06 <ypm[m]> chances someone with the same exact vpn and writing style joining right after leaving w another account is near zero. You're just fishing for screenshots
22:27:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> WonderWoman: your writing style is the exact same, please stop trolling
22:27:29 <WonderWoman> Nobody is trolling
22:27:54 <WonderWoman> I asked a question and you guys bringing some paranoid stuff up and calling me a troll
22:27:57 <strcat> raiding the channel trolling, trying to portray it as having something wrong with it to attack the community
22:27:59 <WonderWoman> Read the discussion
22:28:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If you're genuine, your writing style, joining right after someone left, same VPN, etc. is very suspicious
22:28:27 <strcat> https://iphub.info/?ip=159.48.55.39 cryptokid777
22:28:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's why we think you're cryptokid777
22:28:43 <strcat> https://iphub.info/?ip=141.98.102.148 WonderWoman
22:28:45 <WonderWoman> I am not cryptokid the superhero, dont even know what kind of superhere that is, but whatever
22:29:17 <WonderWoman> Different ip adress
22:29:21 <WonderWoman> Look a that
22:29:23 <strcat> reverse IP:

22:29:57 <WonderWoman> Are these links a way to hack into my phone?
22:30:02 <WonderWoman> Clickbait?
22:30:10 <WonderWoman> I would not appreciate this
22:30:38 <ypm[m]> about time
22:30:42 <strcat> sucks dealing with these raids all day
22:30:46 <strcat> just showing people how obvious it is
22:31:01 <louipc> how do you tell its the same vpn?
22:31:16 <strcat> reverse ip
22:31:22 <strcat> also nmap
22:31:26 <strcat> same weird firewall setup
22:31:52 <louipc> oh reverse ip didnt give me anything on first ip
22:31:53 <strcat> louipc: use that site I linked
22:32:02 <louipc> yea i won't nmap tho :p
22:33:03 <seashield[m]> I've had it with Reddit! I now know exactly why Strcat gave up on it.
22:33:57 <louipc> one is worldstream something and other is m247
22:34:20 <jebemtimamu> What uppp everyone?
22:34:41 <jebemtimamu> I am from.chine love grapheneos community
22:34:48 <jebemtimamu> China love grapheneos
22:34:55 <louipc> cool
22:34:55 <jebemtimamu> Also russia loves graphene
22:34:56 <strcat> you would think people have something better to do than raiding the channel
22:34:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> now this is just hilarious
22:35:03 <strcat> it's not funny
22:35:06 <strcat> it wastes my time and energy
22:35:10 <strcat> it harms the OS and community
22:35:20 <jebemtimamu> Telegram bridge is a asslicking puppet
22:35:44 <strcat> other one is probably them too
22:36:16 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> how about a slow-mode? With about a minute delay per user?
22:36:19 <louipc> yea that was weird
22:36:33 <louipc> that can be done on irc
22:37:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> can be done on telegram too
22:40:41 <strcat> I don't want to make the experience worse for everyone just because Calyx and techlore get trolls to raid the channel nonstop
22:41:08 <strcat> I know what's going on and we'll retaliate, simple as that
22:45:30 <seashield[m]> I had the audacity to state Firefox on Android has a number of security issues and that Bromite would be a better choice. Got a ban without warning. Why? They used the "don't be a dick" rule to justify it.  Huh? Reddit sucks.
22:45:49 <strcat> from which subreddit?
22:46:02 <seashield[m]> Privacytoolsio
22:46:02 <strcat> Reddit as a whole is trash but subreddits are moderated by the people who made them / mods they added
22:46:23 <seashield[m]> I give up on Reddit
22:46:26 <Thatcher[m]> Privacytoolsio is a cult
22:46:34 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Off-topic
22:46:39 <Baobab> >Reddit as a whole is trash
22:46:39 <Baobab> True.
22:47:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Oh sorry, it is off-topic room :P
22:47:05 <strcat> Reddit is just 4chan for people over 30
22:47:27 <seashield[m]> üòÜ
22:48:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Don't read forums people, read booksüëç
22:49:27 <seashield[m]> Agreed. I wasn't in Reddit to be educated, that's for sure.
22:49:42 <Allyouneedislove> Using Iphone 12 now, rhinking about switching ti pixel 5 with graphene, what are the benefits?
22:51:02 <seashield[m]> <Allyouneedislove "Using Iphone 12 now, rhinking ab"> Have you read the Grapheneos.org website?
22:51:04 <southron[m]> Not being tracked by Apple for one.
22:52:14 <strcat> Allyouneedislove is likely the same person as before
22:52:30 <strcat> joined at the same time as jebemtimamu
22:52:50 <Allyouneedislove> Strcat you are tracking grapheneos users
22:53:02 <strcat> similar topic, similar writing style, same kind of VPN
22:53:10 <strcat> Allyouneedislove: stop raiding the channel
22:53:18 <Allyouneedislove> This is a totally differect vpn provider you can never know, unless you are tracking graphene device
22:53:27 <strcat> I know because I'm not an idiot
22:53:32 <Allyouneedislove> Vpn is different domt lie
22:53:32 <strcat> so you admit that you are the same troll?
22:54:48 <strcat> so annoying
22:55:01 <strcat> I was tempted to just ban those 2 as soon as they joined but didn't seem one was being used
22:55:11 <strcat> I guess they must be using 2 different devices for their trolling at the same time
22:55:22 <strcat> wonder if they'll do the good old talking to each other from 2 accounts to derail the channel approach
22:55:57 <Thatcher[m]> These trolls will never back down and it will only get worse. Their puppetmasters want the same notoriety for their OS as yours so they can easily monetize what should be free.
22:56:05 <lambo-mambo> Why are you tracking my device strcat?
22:56:11 <Baobab> <______<
22:56:28 <lambo-mambo> You could never know every time i use different vpn provider i can do this all night
22:56:29 <strcat> lambo-mambo: I'm not, you suck at opsec
22:56:34 <lambo-mambo> Stop tracking my grapheneos
22:57:13 <strcat> will just make the channel invite-only for a while if it continues
22:57:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> what happened here
22:57:27 <strcat> Railgun_Lover[m]: same person still raiding the channel
22:57:41 <strcat> pretending to be using iOS and wanting to know if they should switch to GrapheneOS and other trolling
22:58:04 <seashield[m]> <strcat "will just make the channel invit"> Not such a bad idea...
22:58:08 <strcat> these people literally just come here to waste people's time and lower the quality of the discussions
22:58:24 <strcat> and then they claim in their channels (Calyx, techlore) that this is a toxic place based on the impact on their raids
22:59:22 <tracker> Stop hacking me
22:59:38 <tracker> This is not cool
22:59:53 <ypm[m]> idk how you deal with this strcat
23:00:02 <strcat> you should see the emails they send me daily
23:00:05 <seashield[m]> <strcat "will just make the channel invit"> It would certainly make for better discourse, at the expense of accessibility for new users.
23:00:28 <Baobab> idk if you can do this on irc
23:00:37 <Baobab> but on xmpp
23:00:51 <Baobab> you can make it to where people can't speak for the first 30 minutes
23:01:09 <Baobab> that would probably cut down on low effort trolling
23:01:30 <hypokeimenon[m]> Does degrade the experience for newcomers though.
23:02:03 <hypokeimenon[m]> I feel like I've seen enough Discord servers where it is a thing that people might not mind.
23:02:28 <seashield[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Does degrade the experience for "> Yeah, who may need the most help. Flip side is that it would increase developer productivity no end.
23:03:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <strcat "I am impersonating Railgun_Lover"> yeah
23:03:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> what do people even get out of this?
23:03:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> On the other hand, what do we gain out of talking about it
23:04:07 <strcat> as I said
23:04:25 <strcat> techlore and Calyx have encouraged / supported this and directed people to harass me
23:04:37 <strcat> their goal with this kind of raiding is harming the quality of our channels
23:04:52 <strcat> they raid them on a daily basis in order to be able to claim that people are commonly banned here and that it's a toxic place
23:05:06 <strcat> to promote themselves through harming us
23:05:15 <strcat> that's what is happening over the past couple months
23:05:35 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Let's take the conversation about something else, not give the trolls what they want
23:05:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> SOOO...
23:05:53 <seashield[m]> I wonder where Graphene OS would be today if these raids didn't happen.
23:06:06 <strcat> it's a lot more than the raids
23:06:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> What are some of the things iOS does better than GrapheneOS, and vice versa? Just the main things
23:06:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Cuz I'm not well informed on it
23:06:38 <Thatcher[m]> <seashield[m] "I wonder where Graphene OS would"> Probably would have a GrapheneOS-based rover on Mars
23:08:34 <hypokeimenon[m]> I am impersonating Railgun_Lover: Probably best to start with the channel logs. Leeya/cn3m/strcpy in particular should have covered/reiterated most of it.
23:08:44 <hypokeimenon[m]>  * I am impersonating Railgun_Lover: Probably best to start with the channel logs. Leeya/madaidan/cn3m/strcpy in particular should have covered/reiterated most of it.
23:08:44 <seashield[m]> iOS is where I'd be at if it wasn't for Graphene OS.
23:08:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "I am impersonating Railgun_Lover"> wilco
23:09:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> What does this error in the web installer mean? "Error: Must be handling user gesture to show a permission request"
23:09:09 <seashield[m]> cn3m. I do miss him...
23:09:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> <seashield[m] "cn3m. I do miss him..."> Is around, probably just busy with life.
23:10:02 <cyborgninjaneer[> Dumbass trolls. Wish I owned a big corporation. All the company phones would be GOS and we'd donate to the project for each install and each update.
23:10:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> This is the good shit here.
23:10:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> I don't get why people hate the project.
23:11:06 <Thatcher[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "I don't get why people hate the "> They hate it because they are jealous of it
23:11:07 <seashield[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "I don't get why people hate the "> Only a very select, determined few.
23:11:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> Even if you don't run GOS you benefit from the upstream stuff
23:12:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> <seashield[m] "Only a very select, determined f"> Too bad I don't know an aggressive attorney who wants to screw some trolls for fun.
23:12:34 <strcat> 19:06:03              --> | freewilzy (~freewilzy‚äô7211) has joined #grapheneos
23:12:52 <seashield[m]> I've not once had a single issue with Graphene OS. It's flawless in my experience.
23:13:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> <seashield[m] "I've not once had a single issue"> It just about is. Super clean Android distro, PLUS all the security and privacy improvements. The only issue I had was with Bluetooth.
23:16:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> strcat: bro you are legitimately doing more for Android and Linux than any of the other forks could even dream of. Just want you to know I respect that a lot.
23:19:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <strcat "19:06:03              --> | free"> lol
23:19:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> he left right after you called him out
23:22:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> I wish the Telegram bridge would send a message when someone joins/leaves
