05:28:18 <mazyani[m]> Baba: what
05:31:08 <Baba[m]> <mazyani[m] "Baba: what"> Migrate to matrix room
10:01:01 <strcat[m]> @room We're migrating to upgraded Matrix rooms without a bridge to freenode: #grapheneos-new:matrix.org #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org . Please join the new rooms and you can leave these legacy ones to stop being bothered by pings.
10:18:07 <strcat[m]> @room if you've already joined the new Matrix rooms, please leave this one so it's easier to tell how much of the migration is left to go

11:09:42 <sbstnsr[m]> does anyone else doesent get element notifications even with customized settings cause i dont get even with these settings
11:14:52 <akc3n[m]> <sbstnsr[m] "does anyone else doesent get ele"> What are you settings set to in elements app notification settings, how do you have notifications set per room? And what's your GrapheneOS system notifications set to for Element app.

11:19:21 <strcat[m]> sbstnsr: your client might not support @ room or you have it disabled?
11:19:37 <strcat[m]> sbstnsr: I was pinging people individually about it too  earlier
11:20:02 <strcat[m]> but yeah join #grapheneos-new:matrix.org  / #graphene-offtopic-new:matrix.org
11:37:12 <Eagle89> can i get some advive
11:37:41 <Eagle89> i have a company samsung phone
11:38:01 <Eagle89> i was thinking of doing this to it https://dt.gl/privacy-cookbook-chapter-5-9-2-samsung-debating-and-tweaking-2021/
11:38:18 <Eagle89> but not sure if this will help battery or performance wise
11:38:46 <strcat[m]> this is a legacy room
11:38:51 <strcat[m]> you should join the new Matrix rooms instead
11:39:00 <strcat> This room will continue to the exist for the time being but we're fully migrating to Matrix without a bridge to Freenode: #grapheneos:matrix.org #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org. We reserved #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat but we'll be focusing on Matrix.
11:39:01 <strcat> After you move to #grapheneos-new:matrix.org / #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org (or the libera.chat IRC channels, but keep in mind they aren't bridged to the main rooms) you can leave here.
11:39:03 <strcat> https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover
11:39:05 <strcat> If your Matrix client has the previous aliases cached with the old rooms, use #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org as a workaround.
11:39:07 <strcat> if enough people are interested in the libera.chat #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic rooms we'll figure out a leaner way to bridge it without having a bridge bot requiring mod powers in the Matrix room to invite/kick virtual irc users and kick Matrix users for lurking (really bad experience).
11:39:09 <strcat> There will be nothing beyond spam telling people to move to the new rooms here. We'll be focusing on the Matrix rooms.
11:39:11 <Eagle89> ok i will great an account
11:39:23 <strcat> there are libera.chat rooms but it's barely used / inactive, moving fully to Matrix rooms
