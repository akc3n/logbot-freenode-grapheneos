19:26:52 <strcat> This room will continue to the exist for the time being but we're fully migrating to Matrix without a bridge to Freenode: #grapheneos:matrix.org #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org. We reserved #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat but we'll be focusing on Matrix.
19:26:54 <strcat> After you move to #grapheneos-new:matrix.org / #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org (or the libera.chat IRC channels, but keep in mind they aren't bridged to the main rooms) you can leave here.
19:26:56 <strcat> https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover
19:26:58 <strcat> If your Matrix client has the previous aliases cached with the old rooms, use #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org as a workaround.
19:27:00 <strcat> if enough people are interested in the libera.chat #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic rooms we'll figure out a leaner way to bridge it without having a bridge bot requiring mod powers in the Matrix room to invite/kick virtual irc users and kick Matrix users for lurking (really bad experience).
19:27:02 <bitd> stop spamming
19:27:02 <strcat> There will be nothing beyond spam telling people to move to the new rooms here. We'll be focusing on the Matrix rooms.
19:28:13 <strcat> go to the new channel this one exists to tell people to go to the new one
19:30:01 <bitd> I've joined #grapheneos-new:matrix.org but there's nobody there
19:30:23 <strcat> that's a Matrix channel not an IRC channel
19:30:37 <strcat> there are IRC channels (#grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic) on libera.chat
19:32:00 <bitd> oh matrix
19:32:04 <bitd> sus
19:32:24 <bitd> why would you need irc with pictures unless you're doing something very naughty
19:33:17 <strcat> so we can own our rooms instead of some fucking guy who bought his way into royalty taking over the server with legal threats
19:33:26 <strcat> and getting everyone's accounts / messages
19:33:43 <strcat> as happened here
19:35:27 <bitd> why is the room on the matrix homeserver then
19:35:54 <bitd> shouldn't it be #grapheneos-new:grapheneos.org?
19:36:09 <strcat> that's an alias
19:36:12 <strcat> not where the room is hosted
19:36:23 <bitd> ah
19:36:25 <strcat> I could post a privacytools.io alias for the same room
19:36:34 <strcat> you can just reserve a bunch of aliases on each server
19:36:50 <strcat> accounts are tied to server not rooms
19:37:03 <strcat> so if this had been a proper standalone Matrix room
19:37:09 <strcat> we'd just have had to move our own accounts elsewhere
19:37:13 <strcat> pass admin/mod powers to them
19:37:18 <strcat> and users could do what they wanted
19:37:30 <strcat> plus E2E encryption for private rooms / direct messages by default in Element anyway
19:37:47 <strcat> so it's less impactful than here where now if mr. prince wants to read your PMs to see if you're trash talking him and ban you, he can
