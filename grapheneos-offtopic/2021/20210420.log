01:00:44 <floralshoppe[m]1> if i connected to public wifi with a vpn and used that device to wifi tether to another device with a vpn is there any information the public wifi would get about the second device?  just something i was thinking about today.

01:35:20 <retracey[m]> Does anyone have any recommendations for how I could see email notifications for a gmail account? unfortunately my school gmail account does not let me set up IMAP and I don't know what my options are.
01:36:50 <akc3n[m]> <retracey[m] "Does anyone have any recommendat"> https://grapheneos.org/faq#notifications
01:37:30 <retracey[m]> > <@akc3n:tchncs.de> https://grapheneos.org/faq#notifications
01:37:30 <retracey[m]> > It mentions FairEmail, maybe that might be a good solution for your gmail issue?
01:37:30 <retracey[m]> This only works if I use IMAP, which I can't enable due to school restrictions on my email account. :(
01:38:10 <akc3n[m]> Oh.. Okay. Good to know. Thanks for that. I'll jot that one down in my notebook.
01:38:51 <akc3n[m]> How about k-9 mail retracey ? Have you looked into that by chance?
01:40:44 <retracey[m]> <akc3n[m] "How about k-9 mail retracey ? Ha"> That also takes IMAP
01:40:47 <entry1> K-9 Mail works very well, easy setup. Notifications are lacking (app's fault, not GrapheneOS). Tutanota is my favorite if you are willing to make a switch. Has the best push notifications
01:40:50 <retracey[m]> Tried it just now
01:41:31 <entry1> <retracey[m] "Tried it just now"> Did you enable 3rd party service for gmail?
01:41:48 <retracey[m]> <entry1 "Did you enable 3rd party service"> I cant do that
01:41:55 <retracey[m]> thats the problem
01:43:04 <entry1> Yeah then you can't use a third party service. You can only use IMAP according to Gmail. You're stuck to using a browser to my knowledge
01:43:47 <entry1> You could set it on your home screen and possibly setup notifications that way. You won't be able to use another client from the looks of it
01:44:12 <troypatrick[m]> What password manager works the best with GrapheneOS
01:44:40 <akc3n[m]> troypatrick: keepassdx or bitwarden.
01:45:03 <akc3n[m]> Keepassdx is local and bitwarden is hosted.
01:45:14 <troypatrick[m]> Is the local one free to use
01:45:23 <akc3n[m]> Yes.
01:45:32 <entry1> Yessir, right on F droid or github
01:46:13 <akc3n[m]> KeePassDX (Secure and open source password manager compatible with KeePass files.) - https://f-droid.org/packages/com.kunzisoft.keepass.libre
01:48:23 <entry1> KeePassDX will probably be my long term fix. Just have to remember that if you use a local database/password manager is that if you save a new login/entry, that you will have to update all other versions of your database. Most people choose to have a hosted database like Bitwarden
01:48:54 <maxxxed69> Can I change the clock color? XD Since I've got a really light wallpaper.
01:49:01 <entry1> Bitwarden gets updated very frequently
01:50:07 <maxxxed69> bitwarden?
01:50:28 <entry1> <maxxxed69 "Can I change the clock color? XD"> Unless you use a third party clock app, you are stuck with the color scheme (blue and red).
01:51:11 <entry1> I'd personally stick with the system app, but as long as you make sure the permissions are strict with a 3rd party one, you're fine
01:51:40 <maxxxed69> I'm using the discreet launcher, Idk Why, But I seriously love GOS.

02:23:31 <akc3n[m]> > Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps, and it provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run a variety of commands on a device

04:25:14 <M3manu31[m]> <maxxxed69 "Is there a way to turn off the g"> I guess, this is a very old request but I would also like to know if this is somehow possible in future.
04:26:38 <somenerd[m]> The Google logo is related to the hardware, so GrapheneOS would require custom hardware to have a different logo on boot.

06:38:01 <helloworldkk87[m> Bye bye
06:39:30 <akc3n[m]> christhepanda:  what is your use case for microg supposed to be?
06:44:06 <somenerd[m]> > Hey, so can somone help me with adding microg to graphene?
06:44:06 <somenerd[m]> you can fork GrapheneOS and add microg
06:44:15 <christhepanda[m]> A public transport app that I need to get around the city.
06:44:44 <somenerd[m]> the roadmap is for another project where the app pretends that Google Play servers are offline, rather than reimplementing them
06:44:51 <christhepanda[m]> I mean I would love to stay on graphene, but I need to go to work.
06:45:06 <christhepanda[m]> Maybe i'll come back.
06:46:16 <christhepanda[m]> When that is over.
06:46:43 <akc3n[m]> <christhepanda[m] "A public transport app that I ne"> Ahh, I see..
06:47:53 <christhepanda[m]> Yes. When there is an faq page about how they will not give the option to support somthing, I get concerned.
06:48:58 <christhepanda[m]> Like, maybe consider that people rely on google services and have no choice. If I was an uber driver could I switch to graphene? No.
06:53:38 <christhepanda[m]> I would love an answer better than: you have to switch to calyx because it destroys the precious security model
06:54:31 <somenerd[m]> well, there is a solution: the compatibility layer that is going to be offered
06:54:51 <somenerd[m]> however, there needs to be work done on it
06:55:00 <akc3n[m]> <christhepanda[m] "Like, maybe consider that people"> AOSP doesn't have proprietary Google apps and services.
06:56:15 <helloworldkk87[m> I hate how these days to live normal lifes we need to accept either Googles or Apples policys.. To be something like an Uber driver or get some job or to get around town etc
06:56:23 <christhepanda[m]> The fact is that microg is the best that we have at the moment. Why not let it work for the people that need it?
06:56:51 <christhepanda[m]> It does not matter what you think about it, it matters that it is real life.
06:57:04 <akc3n[m]> <christhepanda[m] "I would love an answer better th"> It is "precious". It *is* the point of GrapheneOS.
06:57:26 <somenerd[m]> > The fact is that microg is the best that we have at the moment. Why not let it work for the people that need it?
06:57:26 <somenerd[m]> it's actually not that robust
06:57:34 <somenerd[m]> and afaik there are also legal problems
06:57:38 <christhepanda[m]> So what?
06:57:54 <christhepanda[m]> If I need it for my job, why not?
06:58:23 <somenerd[m]> it sorta counters the point of GrapheneOS
06:58:32 <somenerd[m]> which is a secure and private OS
06:58:45 <somenerd[m]> the compatibility layer is GrapheneOS's solution to this problem
06:58:53 <somenerd[m]>  * and afaik there are also legal problems (not sure about this tbh)
06:59:08 <christhepanda[m]> You care about it, and thats ok. Why not let me have microg, and remove network access? There is no compatibility layer.
06:59:29 <somenerd[m]> >remove network access
06:59:29 <somenerd[m]> ?
06:59:51 <joltman[m]> If you care so little about security that you'd want to severely compromise the security model of GrapheneOS, then you need to ask yourself why you want GrapheneOS in the first place.
07:00:01 <akc3n[m]> christhepanda: just a side note fyi, something to consider when it does come to calyxos and info...

07:00:43 <somenerd[m]> > You care about it, and thats ok. Why not let me have microg, and remove network access? There is no compatibility layer.
07:00:43 <somenerd[m]> so you/someone else can work on it?

07:19:16 <somenerd[m]> You can also look at existing implementations (LineageOS with Microg, for example)
07:19:47 <christhepanda[m]> Yup. If this does not work, Ill be with calyx until this compatibility layer is up.
07:20:39 <christhepanda[m]> And I do nat want to hear any dissing of calyx by micay.
07:26:59 <christhepanda[m]> This seems to confirm my fears. https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bnfx6r/signature_spoofing_support/ I cannot do signature spoofing. Goodbye graphene.
07:27:28 <somenerd[m]> You can add it, it's not built into the OS automatically
07:29:08 <christhepanda[m]> No. According to the dev, It would.require a fork.

08:06:57 <dazinism> christhepanda: There are a number of issues with microG. From a security perspective the way its been implemented is poor.
08:07:15 <dazinism> Things break in it and it can take some time for fixes to land
08:07:27 <christhepanda[m]> Dude. I have a job.
08:07:43 <christhepanda[m]> I need a public transport app.
08:07:58 <christhepanda[m]> It uses google services.
08:08:49 <dazinism> GrapheneOS was never supposed to be a replacement for stock with Play Services its not the focus of the project
08:09:18 <christhepanda[m]> Yeah. That's why I'm switching to calyx.
08:09:27 <dazinism> I was starting to explain why microG can't be included
08:09:39 <christhepanda[m]> I know.
08:10:13 <christhepanda[m]> You can't have your cake and eat it too.
08:11:10 <dazinism> Getting microG working with a new android version takes time. Which means if you have microG you can't switch to a new version and get security updates dependant on that till that porting work is done
08:12:23 <christhepanda[m]> I really don't care, I need it to go to work mate.
08:13:46 <dazinism> What app?
08:14:04 <christhepanda[m]> Bridj.
08:20:17 <dazinism> Yeah unfortunately you probably out of luck. Its unfortunate that in many countries Android devices without Play are uncommon - so apps are written expecting Play to be present.
08:20:36 <dazinism> In some countries Android without Play is the norm
08:22:47 <christhepanda[m]> Which ones?
08:23:06 <dazinism> Guess one solution is to get an extra super cheap phone to use for that app
08:23:39 <christhepanda[m]> Also, yeah I am out of luck. I cannot afford 2 sim plans, as well as another phone.
08:24:12 <christhepanda[m]> Switching to calyx is my only option.
08:24:27 <dazinism> 'You could use WiFi hotspot from the first. Here can get a brand new cheap rubbish Android phone for like Â£20
08:25:06 <dazinism> Can get used rubbish android phones similar price
08:25:33 <christhepanda[m]> I do not want google tracking me which is the while point of using calyx os because I can revike network access. Also, having 2 phones is kinda dumb.
08:26:19 <helloworldkk87[m> Calyx doesnt have the ability to deny internet access from apps..?
08:26:23 <dazinism> China, India (If I remember correctly )I think other Asian  countries also
08:27:23 <somenerd[m]> > Calyx doesnt have the ability to deny internet access from apps..?
08:27:23 <somenerd[m]> I believe it does
08:27:34 <helloworldkk87[m> Oh
08:27:47 <christhepanda[m]> Yeah.... I think you mean aosp?
08:28:04 <helloworldkk87[m> No
08:28:22 <helloworldkk87[m> Havent looked into calyx so didnt know
08:29:34 <akc3n[m]> <christhepanda[m] "I do not want google tracking me"> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210318#c7303870
08:29:39 <dazinism> Yeah Calyx has microG but lacks pretty much all the security hardening Graphene has https://grapheneos.org/features#grapheneos
08:32:46 <strcat[m]> sphinx: FLoC is already disabled in Chromium itself unless you sign into Google + enable history sync + have Web & App Activity enabled + have toggle enabled to include Chrome history in it + have Ad Personalization enabled + have toggle enabled to include app activity in Ad Personalization
08:33:21 <strcat[m]> Vanadium just made the change that will be needed to disable it in the future when they replace third party cookies with it (it will probably inherit the current setting for that as the new toggle for it)
08:33:30 <strcat[m]> rather than waiting, since it might as well be done now
08:34:11 <strcat[m]> somenerd: it doesn't have a working way to deny internet access, it doesn't block IPC network access
08:34:45 <somenerd[m]> afaik it's similar to netguard
08:34:55 <somenerd[m]> (The Lineage firewall)
08:35:16 <somenerd[m]> which also doesn't stop IPC network access
08:36:14 <strcat[m]> @christhepanda:matrix.org is clearly a troll who was here to spread attacks on the project from a YouTube influencer who publishes misrepresentations and misinformation about the project
08:41:22 <strcat[m]> joltman: the OS that was being promoted is not a fork of GrapheneOS, doesn't have the privacy / security hardening it does and doesn't share the same goals around privacy and security
08:41:27 <strcat[m]> akc3n: we'll eventually replace the keyboard with one supporting changing theme automatically and many other missing things in the current one
08:41:32 <strcat[m]> most open source keyboards don't bother with Direct Boot support among other problems
08:41:43 <strcat[m]> so we can't currently replace it
08:41:55 <randomcat54[m]> Oh shut up mate. He is not a troll, he points out valid criticism such as your os not working with many apps people  use on a daily basis.
08:42:17 <stealthdroid[m]> Which youtube influencer is spreading misinformation about graphene?
08:42:29 <randomcat54[m]> Techlore apparently
08:42:36 <somenerd[m]> > Oh shut up mate. He is not a troll, he points out valid criticism such as your os not working with many apps people  use on a daily basis.
08:42:36 <somenerd[m]> you came right after they left
08:42:39 <stealthdroid[m]> <randomcat54[m] "Oh shut up mate. He is not a tro"> I believe that's because graphene doesn't support google services
08:42:43 <somenerd[m]> (were banned)
08:42:58 <stealthdroid[m]> Oh yeah, I saw techlore's vid about this
08:43:16 <akc3n[m]> <randomcat54[m] "Techlore apparently"> Nobody said that
08:43:38 <randomcat54[m]> Yes. Banning people for valid criticism is not a good look micay. Especially a donor.
08:44:41 <dazinism> While you may have had valid concerns It did kind of appear you were here for trolling/acting in bad faith.
08:44:58 <dazinism> What you are doing now kind if adds to that impression
08:45:34 <randomcat54[m]> Yeah. I guess wanting to use public transport was too much to ask.
08:45:41 <somenerd[m]> you probably should've DMed the mods instead of joining with an alt
08:45:45 <dazinism> Wasn't just that
08:46:23 <randomcat54[m]> I'm leaving the community whaen micay bans this account. Christhepanda was already an alt.
08:46:31 <somenerd[m]> instead of referring to yourself in third person to make yourself seem innocent
08:46:35 <dazinism> You were being insulting
08:46:39 <akc3n[m]> Valid criticism? A few have engaged in explanations with citations to you. After a while, a admin and dev was active and tried to talk to you about microg, you said you didn't care.
08:46:39 <akc3n[m]> Please just stop.
08:47:00 <akc3n[m]> * Valid criticism? A few have engaged in explanations with citations to you. After a while, a admin / dev was active and tried to talk to you about microg, you said you didn't care.
08:47:00 <akc3n[m]> Please just stop.
08:47:40 <randomcat54[m]> He is just too toxic. I do care. I donate so that this compatibility layer will work. In the mean time I will be using a less secure os  that works for me.
08:47:58 <dazinism> Theres been loads of trolling, concern trolling and other attacks.  If you are/were genuine you went about your engagement here in a real bad way
08:48:06 <randomcat54[m]> Ok.
08:48:16 <dazinism> Insulting the lead developer
08:48:22 <somenerd[m]> and joining with another account
08:48:31 <dazinism> Without understanding the situation
08:50:08 <randomcat54[m]> I guess I joined with another account because I fundamentally disagree with censorship in a public forum. This is semi-public, and I would hope that banning is not taken lightly, but it is done without consultation, and with retaliation because of disagreement.
08:50:16 <dazinism> It pretty much looked like you were just here to throw insults and criticisms from the start
08:50:18 <akc3n[m]> <strcat[m] "akc3n: we'll eventually replace "> Awesome! Thanks for taking the time to let me know. I appreciate it.
08:50:22 <dazinism> I engaged in good faith
08:50:29 <randomcat54[m]> This is off topic for goodness sake.
08:50:44 <somenerd[m]> offtopic doesn't mean unmoderated
08:50:54 <randomcat54[m]> If you look at my past messages I was initially very excited to get the os.
08:51:30 <dazinism> Maybe, still what I said stands
08:51:40 <randomcat54[m]> Jolly rodger can attest to talking to me about my excitement ro getting my phone.
08:51:52 <dazinism> ....still
08:52:24 <dazinism> Its unfortunate that some apps are made with a hard dependency on Play
08:52:34 <Pratyush[m]> randomcat54:  you are talking about someone who started there carrier by sharing how to pirate software and now someone he is a big brain privacy advocate.
08:52:35 <Pratyush[m]> Nice lol
08:52:35 <randomcat54[m]> And, I too engaged in good faith. I called the lead developer on dissing other projects which have different goals.
08:52:49 <dazinism> But sadly thats due to the way Google has developed the Android ecosystem
08:52:57 <Pratyush[m]>  * randomcat54:  you are talking about someone who started there carrier by sharing how to pirate software and now somehow* he is a big brain privacy advocate.
08:52:57 <Pratyush[m]> Nice lol
08:53:15 <dazinism> You were pretty harsh with your calling out
08:53:30 <dazinism> When you clearly know little about it
08:55:05 <somenerd[m]> joining with an alt isn't really a way to get unbanned
08:55:18 <stealthdroid[m]> At least there's still quite a few things that don't rely on it. Browsers, some utilities like taking pictures, making phone calls, messengers like signal, etc.
08:55:19 <strcat[m]> @randomcat54:matrix.org is @christhepanda:matrix.org on another account, but they were dishonestly pretending to be someone else
08:55:34 <stealthdroid[m]> But yeah, social media apps and mobile games probably won't work
08:56:31 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier, pretty clear their intention is to cause harm to the project by spreading misinformation
08:56:33 <helloworldkk87[m> <stealthdroid[m] "But yeah, social media apps and "> Most of them dont work with microg either, such as Snapchat. Yeah you can open the app but ypu cant log in or make an account xd
08:56:35 <strcat[m]> it's likely they're one of the people doing it elsewhere too
08:56:51 <helloworldkk87[m> * Most of them dont work with microg either, such as Snapchat. Yeah you can open the app but you cant log in or make an account xd
08:56:52 <strcat[m]> in my experience people who do this stuff are quite prolific with it and if they use 1 sockpuppet they probably have many more
08:58:07 <strcat[m]> a small group of people have serious obsessions with causing harm to the project and unfortunately they work together and coordinate creating false narratives and misinformation to cause damage
08:58:12 <stealthdroid[m]> Maybe if graphene OS becomes more popular, a solution will appear. But for now, I guess it's a slight compromise we'll have to make (for privacy/security)
08:58:56 <Dylanger[m]> > mikeythemonkey46
08:58:58 <Dylanger[m]> Oooooo boy
09:00:08 <mikeythemonkey46> <stealthdroid[m] "Maybe if graphene OS becomes mor"> I mean going to work is not slight.
09:00:28 <stealthdroid[m]> <mikeythemonkey46 "I mean going to work is not slig"> What?
09:01:00 <stealthdroid[m]> Yes, some apps won't work, but many still will
09:01:29 <somenerd[m]> also stop joining with alts
09:01:43 <somenerd[m]> this isn't the way to convince someone to unban you
09:01:47 <akc3n[m]> > I'm leaving the community whaen micay bans this account. Christhepanda was already an alt.
09:01:47 <akc3n[m]> mikeythemonkey46:  what happened to this statement
09:02:23 <mikeythemonkey46> Anyways, this is my last alt guys, I am christhepanda, retracey, and randomcat46. Goodbye.
09:02:34 <mikeythemonkey46> Not retracey tho.
09:02:38 <Dylanger[m]> No

09:05:36 <Dylanger[m]> No
09:05:46 <mikeythemonkey46> Anyways goodbye for realsies. I won't miss you micay.
09:05:52 <Dylanger[m]> No
09:06:08 <mikeythemonkey46> How else would I know the app he was talking about was bridj?
09:06:38 <strcat[m]> ban evasion from another sockpuppet, they say they'll stop but that would be a shock
09:07:10 <strcat[m]> probably going to continue making sockpuppets and spreading misinformation about GrapheneOS in this channel and elsewhere
09:07:19 <strcat[m]> that's my experience with these kinds of people
09:07:59 <strcat[m]> they watch a video on YouTube from a malignant narcissist aiming to harm an open source project for not including him in it as a moderator and content creator partner
09:08:06 <strcat[m]> and then peddle his lies / attacks everywhere on his behalf
09:08:15 <strcat[m]> because they just believe what he says without any skepticism or their own research
09:08:25 <strcat[m]> it's unfortunately going to continue causing immense harm to the project
09:08:47 <strcat[m]> the false narratives that Copperhead created have been picked up by others and Copperhead being put to rest will not stop the harm they have caused from continuing to keep going
09:09:31 <dazinism> It isn't just Graphene. If more AOSP forks get used more, more app developers will support AOSP
09:09:49 <stealthdroid[m]> I think his problem had to do with the fact that graphene doesn't support google services (which is fair I guess for privacy reasons)
09:10:11 <sphinx[m]> please add https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos-offtopic to the room description
09:10:17 <helloworldkk87[m> <stealthdroid[m] "I think his problem had to do wi"> MicroG breaks the security model
09:10:24 <stealthdroid[m]> Yes, I know

09:10:53 <akc3n[m]> * Almost reminds in a way of Stockholm syndrome
09:11:41 <somenerd[m]> If they were in good faith (which I don't think they are), they wouldn't come here with an alt
09:12:05 <dazinism> Amazon colour Tablets use an AOSP fork, as I mentioned previously China and some other Asian countries mainly have Android phones without Play
09:12:41 <dazinism> The US vs. Huawei thing means Huawei don't include Play and they have their own app store
09:13:19 <dazinism> All these things increase the chances that an app developer may make their app work properly without Play
09:13:32 <stealthdroid[m]> Well, a lot of western apps (including google) are banned in china, so... I guess they really don't need play
09:14:22 <dazinism> Also all the people using aftermarket OSs / Custom ROMs
09:14:35 <dazinism> without Play
09:14:39 <stealthdroid[m]> People using custom roms are still quite a minority though
09:15:31 <stealthdroid[m]> I'm pretty sure we won't get to the point where a majority support the custom roms. I mean, look at windows vs linux for example. There are still lots of windows apps that don't work natively on linux
09:15:37 <dazinism> Its the reason apps like WhatsApp & Signal have full support for devices without Play
09:16:00 <stealthdroid[m]> And the two systems have existed for decades
09:19:17 <dazinism> Also I guess why Snapchat removed the hard dependency on SafetyNet (which is implemented by Play)
09:24:22 <dazinism> helloworldkk87: apparently  SnapChat is available from the Huawei Store and works without Play.
09:25:14 <dazinism> And their dependency on safetynet was dropped from the Play Store version last year
09:26:18 <helloworldkk87[m> <dazinism "helloworldkk87: apparently  Snap"> Yeah I know
09:26:29 <helloworldkk87[m> But the Aurora version doesnt
09:26:37 <strcat[m]> stealthdroid: that's no excuse for them to be spreading attacks on the project and myself based on misinformation
09:26:43 <strcat[m]> and manipulative misrepresentations
09:26:57 <strcat[m]> they weren't banned for not supporting GrapheneOS or not wanting to use it anymore
09:27:09 <dazinism> I kind of imagined that would have meant that they moved to using the same apk in both places.  Although maybe the version offered from Play still won't work.
09:27:10 <strcat[m]> they were banned for their malicious behavior and would have been even if they still claimed to support and use GrapheneOS
09:27:22 <dazinism> (As you suggest)
09:27:24 <strcat[m]> do not care what OS people use but rather their actions
09:27:34 <sphinx[m]> they went to lie about why they were banned to their channel
09:29:09 <stealthdroid[m]> I think one thing these people are missing is the concept of use-case. Every app/system has it's use case, and they tend to be very different
09:29:34 <stealthdroid[m]> App support tends to be different
09:30:04 <stealthdroid[m]> A lot of people just expect their favourite apps to work everywhere without issues. It unfortunately doesn't work that way
09:34:18 <strcat[m]> sphinx: which channel? the CalyxOS one no doubt?
09:34:35 <strcat[m]> that channel / community is largely based around the identity of malicious behavior towards GrapheneOS
09:34:53 <strcat[m]> most of them don't care about privacy, security or building something great but rather harming us
09:34:57 <strcat[m]> that's the community they have built
09:35:21 <strcat[m]> ot'
09:35:25 <sphinx[m]> <strcat[m] "sphinx: which channel? the Calyx"> yes https://freenode.logbot.info/calyxos/20210420#c7703817
09:35:37 <strcat[m]>  * it's yet another person involved in causing harm to us there
09:36:10 <strcat[m]> doesn't surprise me at all, that's what their community is all about with the support of the project's developers/leadership
09:38:25 <strcat[m]> and btw I greatly appreciate efforts to counter the misinformation they spread there
09:39:32 <strcat[m]> the arguments about this belong in the channel of the project engaging in organized attacks on us rather than here, it is completely unfair for them to use all these sockpuppets and keep raiding our channel while claiming that their community is nicer / better due to not being the target of raids
09:39:46 <strcat[m]> since we do not engage in that behavior and never have
09:40:12 <strcat[m]> they have tried to use sockpuppets pretending to be GrapheneOS users to fake that but it's flimsy and clearly faked (Seth Simmons, Techlore, @maxtannahill among others)
09:47:11 <came2complain[m]> can someone tell me if it's possible to test grapheneOS builds on any emulator?
12:31:56 <withinfire[m]> Hi all, I hope this is OK to ask in the off topic room (tried searching in the log). I understand that some apps include some Google Play Services stuff like SafetyNet that would probably make it impossible for it to run on GrapheneOS if acquired through the Aurora store, is this correct? Would there be other aspects that can in advance predict that an app will not work?
12:31:56 <withinfire[m]> I am trying to get some understanding whether some critical apps may run. In my situation that would be a banking app from a neo / challenger bank that is app-first, i.e. you cannot log in via the website without the app (I guess you can criticise me for that haha)
12:31:56 <withinfire[m]> The project sounds really cool so would like to join if possible!
12:32:39 <dnull> SafetyNet won't run on Graphene.
12:35:06 <withinfire[m]> Thank you - would you possibly know if there are any other hard "contra-indications" like SafetyNet?
12:36:47 <dnull> That's the big one. Mostly for any app that deals with money. In my experience, other apps that require gps still work
12:42:26 <withinfire[m]> Thanks for that. Fingers crossed I guess, one way to really find out..
13:44:29 <jf2021[m]> <dazinism "jf2021: can use Activity Launche"> Thanks - will give it a go

15:08:53 <catacombs[m]> hi
15:10:25 <catacombs[m]> I uh am a new user of graphene.  I have issues with data, which appears to be related to the APN.
15:10:59 <catacombs[m]> carrier, Straight Talk, CDMA suggested I delete the all the APNs, then enter another APN which he suggestsed.
15:11:36 <catacombs[m]> I can delete APN,    where can I get Graphene to let me enter APN information.
15:12:13 <catacombs[m]> Carrier rep suggested Name of Straight Talk,   with the second line of VZWINTERNET
15:12:33 <catacombs[m]> If I try to edit an existing APN, it still has Verizon as the first line.
15:13:34 <catacombs[m]> This phone previously worked on Android, with data working
15:14:11 <catacombs[m]> This morning I reinstalled Graphene to get rid of any issues I might have created
15:14:42 <Cliff[m]> <came2complain[m] "Does anyone have experience with"> I use briar too how can you see it is not using tor?
15:15:00 <came2complain[m]> did you install it manually?
15:15:26 <catacombs[m]> I used the web installer
15:15:46 <Xcutioner[m]> Hi catacombs: I have a similiar issue, where I have tried Verizon and AT&T sims.  While I can get it activated and text and Call/ I get no no data
15:16:34 <catacombs[m]> what I have today is the first line is Verizon Tracfone wentp
15:17:11 <catacombs[m]> I used this same phone/SIM with Android for several days before doing the Graphene Install
15:18:26 <catacombs[m]> I have an Iphone on the same network  which shows a TFW LTE at top,  and strangely I can not find APN for it.   However, the Apple phone was carrier locked to straight talk with first purchase.
15:19:10 <catacombs[m]> I drove over to sit under tower, and tried to create APN there.
15:21:28 <catacombs[m]> So anyone know where I can get Graphene to let me create my own APN?   Carrier Rep suggested different systems had it in different places, might not be where I deleted the original APN (which he told me to do)
15:22:10 <Xcutioner[m]> The carrier's lock the APN settings, so I have never been able to change them
15:22:49 <Xcutioner[m]> or create a new one.
15:23:45 <catacombs[m]> Took a minute or two in settings system data ,  with the APN listed to find the way to delete it.
15:24:53 <catacombs[m]> if no one knows the fix, I am tempted to spend some time to re-install Android, and get it working that way to see what the APN it shows.  I suspect ST reps may not be aware of some hitch in the carrier mode here.
15:25:18 <side_land> Does anyone have an invitation code for the email service Riseup?
15:25:26 <catacombs[m]> It is also a pain that there is no place in Graphene to see the SIM card number
15:25:45 <Xcutioner[m]> They aren't I spent a couple hours trying settings that wouldn't change
15:26:46 <Xcutioner[m]> I think there is a way to find that
15:26:55 <Xcutioner[m]> the Sim card number
15:27:19 <catacombs[m]> options to riseup, Protonmail.   no offense to the guys who help us, but riseup will agree to government court orders.
15:27:28 <catacombs[m]> Protonmail as well
15:28:41 <catacombs[m]> I saw a program to display SIM card number.  I did not have SIM tool.   I finally used a toothpick
15:29:41 <catacombs[m]> Might be better to start with fresh SIM with a new ST card payment.  as they lock the SIM card somehow to the number
15:29:49 <catacombs[m]> from what they told me
15:31:04 <catacombs[m]> by the way,  what is a good repo of apps for Graphene.  I saw some that were listed from several years ago.  Too me, a lot of security advice was once true, no more
15:32:11 <catacombs[m]> well, any advice on reinstalling Android?  I see what the webpage says.
15:32:39 <catacombs[m]> just sometimes, there are some wiggles not on webpage, written some time ago.
15:33:42 <catacombs[m]> I could not get the program to run that should display SIM Card, tried to work thru Vanadium,  which I read is written never to do things like that for security reasons
15:34:30 <catacombs[m]> tell the guys who have created Graphen thanks for such a smooth product.   I had problems with getting data going on Android, and do not know what i did to get it to work there.  but it did.
15:38:11 <catacombs[m]> Several years ago I was told that sometimes the Carrier System has to go through some time before the login to their system allows data to work.  That is, the instructions to towers are not instantious

15:49:41 <catacombs[m]> <catacombs[m] "https://protonmail.com/law-enfor"> I would guess no company can refuse a court order issued in their own country.   Guessing the last to refuse was Lava Bits, who Edward Snowden used.  when the owner heard noise, he simply closed his service, and refused to explain why, which would have violated court order for which he could go to jail
15:53:25 <catacombs[m]> <akc3n[m] "catacombs: maybe have a look at "> I am glad there are people like you that can research this and keep us up to date.  I have been told that using some phones with some software can be more secure than laptops.    Keeping in mind that processors and such for phones may not be FOSS. anyway, how many folks are out there doing FOSS reviewing and vetting.
15:59:29 <TheLynx> Seems I found the issue with my Banking and 2FA CC Apps, it lies here: "add back support for fully disabling native debugging support in Settings â†’ Security" only happens when this feature is disabled. Maybe someone elese has this issue too. @ anonym1984[m] and other mods if someone has the same issue.
15:59:49 <akc3n[m]> <catacombs[m] "I am glad there are people like "> My research is very minimal in comparison to the experts here and the devs. I learn most from here and then follow up on my own time and try not to ask questions unless I don't understand or can't find something.
16:01:03 <covid-1984[m]> https://github.com/uber/baseweb/issues/4190 feel free to up vote if you wanna have a ride sharing app that actually works without Google Services :)
16:04:02 <akc3n[m]> catacombs:  maybe you have time, have a look at https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io

16:14:27 <catacombs[m]> when I started phone, I did not allow location, which might be necessary to get data working properly
16:52:28 <Xcutioner[m]> catacombs: did you reload your phone to get your data to work?
16:58:34 <Xcutioner[m]> Catacombs, thanks for sharing what you did, I was able to get my data going.
16:59:03 <strcat[m]> location toggle being enabled is definitely not needed for data...
17:00:35 <Xcutioner[m]> I turned it on for a moment and then the LTE Mobile data option became available and then I turned location data back off
17:03:02 <strcat[m]> don't think it's related
17:03:36 <strcat[m]> it takes time to provision a new device
17:03:40 <strcat[m]> you probably just had to wait
17:17:38 <Forbo[m]> <covid-1984[m] "https://github.com/uber/baseweb/"> Alternatively, you could use https://ride.lyft.com in your browser.
17:20:01 <covid-1984[m]> Will check it, thx

19:09:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> "in AOSP, one can put a user profile at rest (similar to "end session" in GOS) by rebooting the phone" is that true?
19:14:08 <entry1> @hulk yes when you log out/reboot, the profile data is at rest
19:14:56 <Cliff[m]> What would be the best browser to use on my stock samsung tablet? Vanadium is not possible
19:14:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> thank you!
19:15:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Bromite
19:15:41 <Cliff[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> Bromite"> Do you have a official link for me?
19:15:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> "best" is subjective, but bromite is chromium security + ad-blocking

19:16:16 <entry1> Bromite and Tor Browser. You'll have to add it to the F Droid repo or download it directly from the site
19:16:26 <Cliff[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> "best" is subjective, bu"> That is exactly what i am looking for using firefox now after reading up on it found it to be not a good one
19:17:11 <Cliff[m]> Thanks!
19:17:29 <vdge[m]> <entry1 "Bromite and Tor Browser. You'll "> Tor can be done from aurora store.
19:18:39 <entry1> <vdge[m] "Tor can be done from aurora stor"> Was referring to bromite, should have specified. Tor Browser is in F-Droid as well, just have to enable the Guardian Project repo in settings
19:20:52 <vdge[m]> Ahh yep. As he's refering to samsung tablet. It would be convenient with auto updates and secure if he gets from play store.
19:20:52 <vdge[m]> Bromite fdroid repo if you wanna add Cliff

20:37:16 <catacombs[m]> sorry,  so fdroid is now considered reliable repo for apps
20:39:00 <catacombs[m]> I just spent time yakking with Google Pixel Support,  He insists that one can go:
20:39:05 <catacombs[m]>  please try adding new APN from Settings>>Network&Internet>>Mobile network>>Advanced>>Access Point Names>>Three dots at the top right corner>>New APN. Make sure to select the three dots from the next screen as soon as you select "Access Point Names" option in "Advanced".
20:40:09 <catacombs[m]> My graphene does not have a new APN.   Google forum support has a note that Google Pixel will not auto download APN Settings from some Carriers.
20:41:02 <catacombs[m]> Also they would not assist in my rolling back phone to Android.  Saying they did not support Flashing.
20:43:34 <catacombs[m]> I am guessing a specific two lines for an APN actually represents a bunch of values usd to talk to tower.
20:44:09 <catacombs[m]>  * I am guessing a specific two lines for an APN actually represents a bunch of values used to talk to tower.
20:44:49 <catacombs[m]> I just thought I would report back.  I am tired of fooling with this.
21:01:25 <dazinism> x-seraph-x: can use a usb-c hub and a DisplayLink capable monitor. Then either usb or bluetooth mouse and keyboard. I've got this setup
21:03:25 <dazinism> Got a cheap used ASUS MB168B display
