01:43:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Just use regular Chromium
01:44:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Ungoogled Chromium only removes stuff that you can manually disable in Chromium
01:45:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> They're frequently very far behind, 1 month so they apply security patches late
01:46:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> For anti fingerprinting and security on desktop use Brave, but the developers are pretty shady
01:46:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> So I recommend Tor Browser
01:47:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> The best anti fingerprinting in pretty much any browser, you take a security hit but it's worth it
01:47:46 <just-a-bugger[m]> Yeah I wanna avoid Brave
01:47:46 <just-a-bugger[m]> Anyways, that's interesting. If I do disable google integration in regular Chromium, it wouldn't undo itself after an update right?
01:48:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Yeah it wouldn't
01:48:16 <just-a-bugger[m]> Cool
01:48:16 <just-a-bugger[m]> I'mma go see how I'd do that, thanks
01:48:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> These are just settings that you can disable
01:49:15 <just-a-bugger[m]> No chrome://flags or anything?
01:49:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Mostly in you and google
01:49:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> No
01:49:38 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Do not change those unless you absolutely need to and know what you're doing
01:49:45 <just-a-bugger[m]> Interesting

02:10:49 <just-a-bugger[m]> Sorry haha but i just feel a little unconvinced
02:10:49 <just-a-bugger[m]> Like it can't be *that* easy
02:10:49 <just-a-bugger[m]> I've kinda assumed turning off sync and usage statistics, safe browsing for downloads etc. doesn't stop google from collecting user data. have i actually been assuming wrong all long

02:28:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Google doesn't have anything privacy invasive in its open source projects anyway, so you can probably infer from that
02:28:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They're actually REMOVING Google services integration from Chromium...

08:49:55 <strcat> not an OS or hardware issue, carrier issue
08:50:28 <djentosaurus[m]> How to solve this?
08:50:52 <djentosaurus[m]> What does carrier issue mean? My English isn't perfect
08:55:13 <helloworldkk87[m> The problem has to do with your phone carrier and not the OS or hardware
08:56:13 <djentosaurus[m]> So it's normal then?
08:56:29 <djentosaurus[m]> What is phone carrier
08:58:28 <freewilzy> You sim card provider
08:58:33 <djentosaurus[m]> oh okay
08:58:50 <djentosaurus[m]> if I have another carrier it will be better then?
09:00:01 <freewilzy> It s worth trying
09:00:37 <djentosaurus[m]> okay
10:06:20 <helloworldkk87[m> <djentosaurus[m] "if I have another carrier it wil"> You could also contact them to ask for help
10:09:24 <GhostSplinterSix> <djentosaurus[m] "if I have another carrier it wil"> It depends on the carrier's coverage in your area.

12:41:12 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> bluetooth - yes
12:41:28 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> wifi - afaik, no
12:41:46 <sign4l[m]> with build in KI which is able to determine if maybe the bluetooth does not tu be turned off after x minutes?
12:42:04 <sign4l[m]>  * with build in KI which is able to determine if maybe the bluetooth does not have to be turned off after x minutes?
12:42:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> no, AOSP now provides an option to turn Bluetooth off after N minutes of inactivity
12:42:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> therefore GrapheneOS has it too
12:43:36 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Moof> Shit. I used to use an app that does that but I think it's not supported anymore since android 9 due to permissions
12:44:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Moof> I literally always forget to turn my wifi off
12:44:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> don't take my words on that one, i don't have an active GrapheneOS installation nearby
12:45:17 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> but as sign4l[m] said, you can use the built-in automator
12:45:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Moof> I will check it out, thanks!
12:47:29 <just-a-bugger[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Fiery> Just use regular Chromi"> Do you mean "Google Chrome," like the stable release that auto-updates? Cause from the looks of it, this: https://download-chromium.appspot.com/?platform=Linux_x64&type=snapshots is not what I want.
12:48:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> just-a-bugger[m]: yes, desktop Chromium browser does not auto-update
12:49:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if you want to have the auto-update feature, you can use Google Chrome
12:50:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> afaik, some people here use the Chromium browser, and update it manually
12:55:13 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i used to do that, but Chromium updates roll-out every few hours, and i kept on forgetting to update sometimes
12:55:58 <just-a-bugger[m]> Could that be done with a script like this https://github.com/scheib/chromium-latest-linux
12:56:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, but you would need to trust the script
12:56:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> or validate it at the very least
12:57:03 <just-a-bugger[m]> It's from here https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium so i mean
12:58:35 <just-a-bugger[m]> So from a privacy perspective, "Google Chrome," the stable release, isn't all that different from the beta/canary/trunk versions right?
12:59:39 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> no, i don't think so
13:03:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!nvfvdhguis> Is there a reason why i can not add accounts? (pixel4a) If i taped on add accounts, nothing happend.
13:04:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> go to settings system->multiple accounts
13:04:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> try adding from there
13:04:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> there is a toggle that disables adding new accounts from lockscreen

13:08:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> what i mean is, Google Chrome and Chromium are pretty different in privacy perspectives
13:08:22 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> no, i don't think so"> Wait, I thought chrome had Google integration that ruined privacy
13:08:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <!nvfvdhguis> Is there any sevurity and or privacy different between add account and add users?
13:08:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Can all the invasive stuff be disabled?
13:08:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i would compare them to Stock vs AOSP

14:19:52 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Just asking, not meant to offend anybody
14:20:05 <fsamevljan[m]> Is there a Panic Button feature in the GrapheneOS?
14:20:28 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> None (iirc)
14:21:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> f.samevljan: This sort of thing has been talked about before. In particular, Graphene OS is an open-source project. If law enforcement ask you to open your phone, are tipped off about proliferated usage of Graphene OS- they will also know that such a data wiping feature exists. I am not a lawyer, but I cannot imagine this will land you in calm waters legally or otherwise in the eyes of your oppressors.
14:21:51 <stencil[m]> There is in guardian apps and F-droid
14:22:40 <stencil[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "f.samevljan: This sort of thing "> No, it was more likely because you're opening yourself to remote data deletion
14:23:19 <stencil[m]> It will also need to have a web dash which graphene won't provide
14:24:46 <fsamevljan[m]> We are creating a web dash ourselves for wipe features, we just need someone who would help us with Graphene side

14:41:15 <strcat[m]> if you want to contribute to that, there's an open feature request about it, it is not something users should be trying to do by hand, doesn't make any sense
14:41:26 <strcat[m]> we have lots of docs available
14:41:45 <strcat[m]> it's explained that since Sensors is an added permission with no basis in AOSP it has to be assumed that every app and OS component uses it

14:43:03 <strcat[m]> f.samevljan: there's no real use in software-enforced limits, it's just security theater, an OS exploit would bypass them and the adversary just won't trigger the limit
14:43:05 <strcat[m]> f.samevljan: please read that section before wasting time/resources on stuff
14:43:14 <strcat[m]> f.samevljan: and read the features that are planned in the issue tracker
14:43:23 <strcat[m]> do that first
14:43:30 <strcat[m]> cancel whatever plans you have to implement features
14:43:37 <strcat[m]> read what is planned for GrapheneOS first
14:44:50 <strcat[m]> there's already hardware-enforced throttling which unlike a software enforced limit isn't bypassed by either exploiting the OS or messing with storage
14:45:14 <strcat[m]> image storage -> make attempts -> re-image storage - what good is a software limit that's stored in regular storage?
14:45:34 <strcat[m]> there's hardware-enforced throttling which is far better than anything the OS can do
14:46:09 <strcat[m]> we plan to implement a timeout feature for auto rebooting the device after N hours without unlocking any profile
14:46:31 <fsamevljan[m]> Yes! That's the feature we wanted to develop ourselves also
14:47:01 <fsamevljan[m]> strcat: Thank you for the advice. My point here is that we can pay people to actually develop those features faster and make GrapheneOS more robust in shorter time-frames
14:47:11 <strcat[m]> you're welcome to do that
14:47:15 <strcat[m]> look through the issue tracker though
14:47:34 <strcat[m]> we do not want security theater i.e. harmful features which do not really work / give a false sense of security
14:47:45 <strcat[m]> a software enforced limit on attempts is harmful security theater
14:47:57 <strcat[m]> it only has value if the secure element implements it or it can just be trivially bypassed
14:48:03 <strcat[m]> like restoring storage, etc.
14:48:33 <strcat[m]> it already throttles to 1 attempt/day
14:48:47 <strcat[m]> via secure element internal timer
14:49:04 <strcat[m]> it could have a hard limit but it doesn't make much practical difference, and it doesn't, and the OS can't change that
14:51:49 <fsamevljan[m]> Roger that, thanks!
14:51:49 <fsamevljan[m]> But my offer still stands, if anyone wants (and knows how to) to work with my team on feature implementation - please let me know!
14:54:27 <fsamevljan[m]> We could contribute to GrapheneOS while we pay the dev to do that - win win :)
15:04:44 <came2complain[m]> <fsamevljan[m] "Yep, those features are the ones"> please provide  an exact list of the features you are looking for

15:29:43 <strcat[m]> needs to be done right or not at all
15:30:55 <fsamevljan[m]> Yeah, agreed, that's what I was saying, develop both for GrapheneOS and our own gain at the same time, as those features overlap with both need üëçÔ∏è

18:28:20 <jackflash89[m]> Explain profiles on graphene
18:28:32 <jackflash89[m]> I see many talk aboutnthem
18:30:59 <freewilzy> Grapheneos.org you can read everything there
18:31:08 <jackflash89[m]> Ok

20:44:59 <hasnoname[m]> Anyone using outlook app? Mine keeps crashing after 2 seconds
20:51:00 <sign4l[m]> you downloaded Outlook app on graphene os?
20:52:40 <sign4l[m]> Some people also try to mount a trailer hitch onto a Ferrari... there are things that don't fit together
21:00:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> why not?
21:00:15 <hasnoname[m]> <sign4l[m] "you downloaded Outlook app on gr"> This is a friendly help group. You don't GATEKEEP here. Not everyone here can live absolutely open source.
21:00:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> exactly!
21:00:47 <sign4l[m]> you re right
21:00:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> also, now that Microsoft announced that they are switching to DANE
21:01:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and DNSSEC
21:02:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that would make Outlook to be very nice choice for security-minded people
21:03:44 <hasnoname[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> that would make Outlook "> It wouldn't work on primary or secondary profile
21:05:30 <hasnoname[m]> Any app that can display mails and calendar together like outlook?
21:09:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> sorry hasnoname, i currently have no suggestions for you
21:10:56 <tharg[m]1> Hi team
21:10:56 <tharg[m]1> There is a nice little android application called netguard which restricts network access to either WiFi or mobile or none by application. Is this known to the grapheneOS team and are there plans to put this kind of function into the OS?
21:10:56 <tharg[m]1> Alternatively is there a problem using it with graphene? (It diverts network access using a local VPN channel).
21:12:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> tharg[m]1: hello, please read this https://grapheneos.org/faq#firewall
21:19:00 <tharg[m]1> Thanks TGB
21:19:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you're welcome!
21:19:20 <tharg[m]1> :-)
21:21:45 <tharg[m]1> Ah yes, I have already clocked this, thanks. I can't see (yet!) how to distinguish between the mobile and WiFi network. Happy to take suggestions from the OS gurus! Thanks again.
21:24:05 <hasnoname[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> sorry hasnoname, i curre"> Np. Thanks for help
22:09:23 <tharg[m]1> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> you're welcome!"> Apologies - I found the netguard reference further down in https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking-apps but cannot tell if it is regarded as a good or bad thing.
22:14:20 <Cliff[m]> hasnoname I don't use outlook myself, but have you tried fairemail or k9mail from f droid?
22:15:06 <Cliff[m]> If you are open to switch, tutanota app works amazingly well on graphene os.
22:32:49 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> tharg[m]1: why would you need netguard, when you already have a Network permission toggle?
