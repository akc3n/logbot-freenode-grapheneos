03:52:10 <faxing[m]> I know that -- I just mean more in terms of sale of your sign-up data.

12:55:04 <somenerd[m]> I mean, Google play services do add attack surface
12:55:15 <somenerd[m]> and have many privacy problems
12:57:29 <souvlaki[m]> yes, they sure do add attack surface, but i doubt its criticality
12:57:39 <souvlaki[m]> about privacy 100% true

13:09:29 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Good morning ghost)
13:09:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Just a bit gapps talk here and there, again :P
13:10:55 <somenerd[m]> > yes, they sure do add attack surface, but i doubt its criticality
13:10:56 <somenerd[m]> attack surface is still added though, which is a problem for security focused OSs
13:12:35 <somenerd[m]> stock security is inferior to GrapheneOS
13:13:39 <souvlaki[m]> yes, and i agree it should be removed in security-focused OSs. but the point was "if you can't live without GApps, go install stock android, please do not reinvent the wheel"
13:13:57 <souvlaki[m]> like microG does
13:14:16 <somenerd[m]> Yeah, it's probably the most robust option, but not really private (don't think that microG is private either)
13:14:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <L‚Äã73689> I've always been curious about the encryption on huawei p20 pro
13:15:57 <souvlaki[m]> <somenerd[m] "Yeah, it's probably the most rob"> yes, that's the point - identificators are still obviously being sent by microG in order for GSF to work properly, but imho microG adds even more attack surface than google services themself
13:16:22 <somenerd[m]> I'm not sure about how well it works either
13:16:33 <somenerd[m]> or how much it improves upon compatibility
13:20:03 <souvlaki[m]> so it basically makes choice between microG and google services a choice between two evils (it is pretty unclear what is more evil since microG is opensource implementation of how devs think google services work)
13:21:42 <GhostSplinterSix> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> Just a bit gapps talk he"> Oh, fun!
13:22:26 <souvlaki[m]> that would be a talking point forever, i think
13:47:44 <withinfire[m]> hi, I've been trying to read up on Daniel's comments about insecurity of Linux (as a layperson) which makes me wonder: what desktop OS are people using here?
13:47:44 <withinfire[m]> I feel there are limited options out there, personally speaking (!) I don't like Windows because it's from Microsoft, and I don't like anything from Apple because it's Apple (I know this may be controversial).  Is there anything left? :P

19:58:14 <GhostSplinterSix> Him?
19:58:28 <GhostSplinterSix> * Hm?
19:59:18 <r0tt0r[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<L73689> When using an app such "> you can ask for a report on whatsapp in eu what data they stored about you. but that doesnt tell whats send
20:00:00 <r0tt0r[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "Him?"> either i sleep on my phone qhich i doubt as i put is aside, or someone is noisy and was that
20:00:36 <r0tt0r[m]> * either i sleep on my phone which i doubt as i put is aside, or someone is noisy and was that
20:01:47 <GhostSplinterSix> I have no idea what you are saying.
20:03:11 <GhostSplinterSix> * I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are saying.
20:04:25 <Thatcher[m]> He's saying that someone making noise can destroy the screen protector

20:06:48 <r0tt0r[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I have no idea what you are sayi"> im saying maybe someone in my house breaks the protectors

20:08:49 <r0tt0r[m]> nosey?

20:09:09 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm not even going to ask....
20:09:41 <r0tt0r[m]> np, haven is good app for such cases, thx to snowdon
20:11:02 <r0tt0r[m]> thx for good input
20:12:05 <GhostSplinterSix> Don't sleep with your phone on you and keep your phone away from others. That's what I recommend according to what you've said.
20:12:21 <Thatcher[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<L73689> When using an app such "> No one truly knows
20:12:56 <r0tt0r[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "Don't sleep with your phone on y"> yep agree but not as easy as said
20:13:46 <GhostSplinterSix> <Thatcher[m] "No one truly knows "> Using WhatsApp breaks the 11th Commandment: Thou shalt not use WhatsApp.
20:14:25 <r0tt0r[m]> <Thatcher[m] "No one truly knows "> i bet zucker knows
20:14:27 <Thatcher[m]> I sleep in my underwear and my screen protector remains undamaged
20:14:55 <helloworldkk87[m> All apps are sandboxed. Apps cant get much info on you or "track" you.
20:17:31 <Thatcher[m]> Sandboxing does not prevent an app from tracking the user. If I typed about sleeping in my underwear over WhatsApp then there's a good chance I will start seeing Hanes ads all over the place.
20:17:31 <GhostSplinterSix> I sleep with my phone on my nightstand that's next to my bed.
20:17:38 <souvlaki[m]> that doesn't excuse whatsapp usage
20:17:39 <souvlaki[m]> lol
20:18:18 <helloworldkk87[m> <Thatcher[m] "Sandboxing does not prevent an a"> Yeah but that means you have full controll over that
20:19:02 <GhostSplinterSix> My Mom was once talking to my Dad about bunyons and my Dad started receiving ads about it on his phone.
20:19:19 <souvlaki[m]> used to use some app on my old nexus 6p for spoofing identificators, but it required root and xposed framework
20:19:25 <souvlaki[m]> still was very amusing
20:21:24 <helloworldkk87[m> * Yeah but that means you have full controll over that. Whatsapp uses end-to-end encryption anyways
20:24:14 <souvlaki[m]> <helloworldkk87[m "Yeah but that means you have ful"> whatsapp theoretically uses openwhisper (signal nowadays) protocol, but nothing was said about metadata, which whatsapp uses to track you everywhere
20:25:02 <souvlaki[m]> also they are making that freaking "ecosystem" type of shit, when you don't even have to make a fb account for you to be on fb
20:25:14 <helloworldkk87[m> Oh yeah they harvest all of the metadata for sure, was talking about message content
20:27:00 <souvlaki[m]> in terms of message contents it must still be good unless they commited changes to protocol implementation to make sure funny alphabet letters always have backdoor access
20:28:02 <helloworldkk87[m> Well there is no proof of that
20:28:36 <helloworldkk87[m> Im not defending Whatsapp but it gets maybe little bit too much hate imo
20:29:47 <souvlaki[m]> true, never really needed a proof of protocol "customisation" since it's widely known about metadata collection
20:30:05 <souvlaki[m]> that's already a stopper imo
20:30:42 <souvlaki[m]> also using signal protocol abd closing source kinda breaks gplv3 licensing
20:30:44 <souvlaki[m]> slightly
20:32:04 <jpds> souvlaki[m]: You do know that it was the Signal team that implemented the Signal protocol in WhatsApp?
20:33:31 <souvlaki[m]> i'm not really a historical type of guy, but i've heard Whatsapp was developed by two guys and then bought by FB, never heard Signal team had any affilitation to it
20:34:17 <jpds> https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/
20:35:11 <flawedworld[m]> <souvlaki[m] "also using signal protocol abd c"> Not necessarily, they (Signal) most likely just said "here you go you have rights to X bit of GPLv3 code that we own"
20:35:38 <flawedworld[m]> thats assuming they reused code
20:35:58 <helloworldkk87[m> https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp/
20:36:08 <souvlaki[m]> <jpds "https://signal.org/blog/whatsapp"> oh, i see, guess it was "at least they would use really secure protocol" type of thinking from Moxie
20:36:41 <Thatcher[m]> WhatsApp uses Signal protocol? I can now ditch Signal for WhatsApp!
20:36:57 <souvlaki[m]> true
20:37:03 <souvlaki[m]> time to uninstall Signal
20:37:11 <helloworldkk87[m> Lol
20:37:48 <flawedworld[m]> Signal also did the E2E implementation in a few other apps
20:38:01 <flawedworld[m]> Skype secret chats come to mind
20:39:19 <souvlaki[m]> <flawedworld[m] "Signal also did the E2E implemen"> that's the answer why so small group of people used Signal until this year: they're too nice
20:39:39 <souvlaki[m]> * that's the reason why so small group of people used Signal until this year: they're too nice
20:41:06 <flawedworld[m]> I personally think that its just a matter of being unknown
20:41:25 <flawedworld[m]> Average person either doesn't care or lacks the attention span
21:31:38 <hypokeimenon[m]> That's probably the best pitch you can make to a regular person for Signal.
21:35:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> "Oh, you know the software that makes Skype, FB Messenger, WhatsApp and Allo secure? That's  largely thanks to Signal."
21:37:19 <Telegram-Bridge> !Tom has joined the Telegram Group!
21:40:50 <akc3n> Technically, it's the signal protocol.
22:06:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!user> @r0tt0r[m]: So using something like SElinux and setting up policies should improve systemd's security concerns?  I guess I don't fully understand why there's such a dark cloud over systemd if they've tried mitigating some of the vulnerabilities.
22:10:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> user I never pointed to a specific bug. I pointed to an architectural weakness that cannot be "patched".
22:11:34 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> > So using something like SElinux and setting up policies should improve systemd's security concerns?No. SELinux isn't a magic security switch that fixes everything.
22:12:47 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Systemd is very bloated
22:13:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> @madaidan wdym
22:13:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Secure everything linux
22:17:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <!user> @madadaina: so runit on void or openrc on gentoo seem be the most common alternatives.  Are they any better architecturally?
22:17:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Nice @
22:18:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> They're significantly more minimal but I don't have a particular recommendation.
22:20:12 <Telegram-Bridge> <!user> Thanks for responding.
22:24:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!user> How does AOSP/Graphene compare in regards to init/services to the way linux distros are setup?
22:40:04 <jpds> user: The reality is that systemd is far better suited for desktops, while openrc is great for servers
22:57:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> I would like to add my 5 cents to the WhatsApp e2ee talk. One should remember that they only claim that your chats are encrypted, while we can't really check that since the client (the app) is closed source. Here is what I know from the actual in-court investigations: "there have been cases when government officials were able to get all WhatsApp conversations (up to a few month of messages) in decrypted plain text of som
22:59:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> AFAIK, the messages were actually "requested by gov officials from Facebook, with a specific order"
23:04:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> enough FUD for today, just don't assume that your conversations are actually properly encrypted when somebody advertises that to you
23:05:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> (without providing sufficient evidence)
23:32:39 <telum[m]> Does anyone know of any virtual SMS verification methods that work in separate user profiles? I am thinking mainly apps from Aurora store that would work with no play services
23:33:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> I don't understand what you're trying to accomplish
23:35:41 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> What are you trying to verify, and why it needs to run in multiple profiles?
23:36:49 <Wonderfall[m]> <jpds "user: The reality is that system"> Alpine Linux is great for servers (and containers), musl, openrc, minimal system
23:37:59 <jpds> Wonderfall[m]: It's mostly aimed at containers
23:38:40 <Wonderfall[m]> I know, been using it for years
23:38:41 <Wonderfall[m]> But it has its value for the host system too
23:39:06 <jpds> I tried it a while ago as a host system and it just felt lacking
23:40:26 <Wonderfall[m]> In which way? But yeah, it lacks some packages and documentation sometimes
23:41:02 <Wonderfall[m]> Also some softwares break with musl, but I tend to avoid them
23:41:06 <jpds> I can't remember, but the overall impression I got was that it was mostly built with running inside docker in mind
23:41:19 <Wonderfall[m]> It certainly is
23:41:47 <Wonderfall[m]> But the idea of a minimal host system with musl is very pleasing
23:43:34 <jpds> I use gentoo myself, as a musl profile, but there's also void
23:44:09 <Wonderfall[m]> Yeah I was gonna say there's still Gentoo. Never used Void though, I'll have to take a look
23:51:01 <Ghosts-In-My-Wir> Tbh not a fan of alpine
23:51:07 <Ghosts-In-My-Wir> More highly recommend void
23:53:16 <covid-1984[m]> Same, but I run alpine on servers
23:53:24 <covid-1984[m]> void on workstation
23:53:51 <covid-1984[m]> Do you guys think that traveling while keeping syncthing on (to sync GOS filesystem & laptop) is secure enough?
23:54:07 <covid-1984[m]> (If you only allow it to run when on your home WiFi network)
23:54:27 <telum[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> What are you trying to v"> Just any other app that requires SMS verification. I try to keep Aurora segregated in another profile, along with the riskier apps
23:55:01 <Wonderfall[m]> My host system doesn't matter much anyway, I now use gVisor everywhere I can
23:56:37 <covid-1984[m]> Gentoo is great, just that who has the time these days :P
23:59:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> telum[m]: idk, none of what you said makes sense to me. Maybe someone else can help
