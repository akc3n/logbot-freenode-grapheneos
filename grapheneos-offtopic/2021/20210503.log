00:00:16 <Baobab> oh
00:02:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Windows would actually have better resistance to targeted attacks
00:03:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> It can just block everything in userspace
00:04:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Common targeted attack would just be a break out from a browser and then achieving execution
00:04:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or phishing
00:05:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> If we talk about more complex attacks though
00:05:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well they are hard but not impossible
00:05:40 <ypm[m]> Ok fair enough. I guess if you're being targeted by a state actor with near limitless resources youre screwed anyways and have other problems to deal with
00:06:41 <ypm[m]> and the attacks youre mentioning are way more common
00:06:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> A complex attack would be hijacking something like a vulnerable application and stealing all data
00:07:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well in that case you are kinda screwed
00:07:47 <ypm[m]> yup lmao at that point your choice in os is irrelevant
00:08:48 <ypm[m]> i honestly just kind of want a graphene equivalent on desktop. thatd be great

00:09:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> S mode and deny permissions
00:09:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> It isn't that great
00:09:41 <Baobab> I don't think recommending windows is a good idea.
00:09:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm trying to find a way for the user to freely get in and out of S mode
00:10:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> On paper at least this should be possible
00:10:22 <ypm[m]> I can't really justify using windows. terminal is too comfy on linux and im way too used to my workflow
00:10:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> So get out of S mode
00:10:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Update drivers and stuff
00:10:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Get back into S mode
00:10:42 <ypm[m]> whats stopping a user from switching at will?
00:10:52 <ypm[m]> actually i should just look that up myself
00:11:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <ypm[m] "whats stopping a user from switc"> No documentation unless you're an OEM
00:11:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> But apparently OEMs can disable S mode, install bloatware to test stuff and then enable it again
00:11:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Windows would block all the bloatware at boot
00:12:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have the files needed to create an S mode iso
00:13:21 <ypm[m]> seems like a pain to deal with the microsoft store for all your programs though
00:14:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> ypm: doesn't work that way
00:14:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> S is a code integrity mode
00:14:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> A lot of applications would actually continue working
00:14:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> S mode just states that anything loaded by the operating system must be signed by 1 of the 4 keys it pins
00:15:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> So potentially a lot of stuff is going to work

02:45:05 <ishikawa[m]> Does graphene sandbox apps like this? do i even need to install it in another user profile? would that add any security/privacy?
02:57:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> ishikawa: apps can communicate with each other, if you think that's happening then yes, installing in another profile will prevent that
02:58:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> However apps communicating with each other is not necessarily a privacy risk, unless some apps have certain privileges that the target app is abusing
03:13:08 <strcat[m]> ishikawa: all apps are sandboxed
03:13:50 <strcat[m]> if you use a profile then it can't communicate/share data with other apps but can still talk to them via network access
03:14:14 <strcat[m]> the main thing profiles do is having separate instances of apps with their own data and entirely separate profile data for granting apps access to separate workspaces of data
03:14:35 <strcat[m]> no sharing data / communication across profiles, but if you give it network access, which I assume you would, it can communicate via network
03:31:40 <akc3n[m]> <ishikawa[m] "Does graphene sandbox apps like "> I would definitely install it in a different profile, if it were my guilty pleasure.
03:42:24 <ishikawa[m]> <strcat[m] "no sharing data / communication "> Oh i see, i guess i will install it in another user profile just as an added measure.
03:42:55 <ishikawa[m]> It cant hurt to add another step in that process

03:53:12 <ishikawa[m]> I also figured out if you want to track an uber eats order you can find the web tracking link and open it in vanadium
03:53:29 <CaptainPicard[m]> I have the app, but the browser version would probably work (haven't tested it)

03:57:39 <ishikawa[m]> I honestly thought maps needed play services. Thats cool
03:57:53 <ishikawa[m]> Might install in a new profile
03:58:06 <ishikawa[m]> I really hate google though, i might cringe a bit using it
03:58:10 <CaptainPicard[m]> Yeah I learned it from someone on here last summer and tried it out when Magic Earth started crapping out on me. Works great
03:58:18 <CaptainPicard[m]> I definitely do haha
03:58:32 <CaptainPicard[m]> I'm tethered to some degree though. My school email is a gmail
03:58:37 <Cliff[m]> I tried osmand+ but not really like modern navigation apps
03:59:06 <Cliff[m]> Did anyone try using maps through vanadium?
03:59:17 <ishikawa[m]> Osmand is powerfull but can get cluttered, the good thing is you can remove alot of the things you dont want from the map as well
03:59:33 <ishikawa[m]> I keep my setup as minimal as possible
03:59:36 <CaptainPicard[m]> <Cliff[m] "I tried osmand+ but not really l"> Yeah. I really like hiking with it because you can download contour lines and it takes less battery than Guthook. Wasn't crazy about it for driving

04:15:34 <ishikawa[m]> Yeah using the browser is a great idea, less apps you need to have installed etc
04:15:34 <ishikawa[m]> You could even create a launcher shortcut for vanadium

06:36:03 <EV-9600[m]> I have 3 devices, A, B and C. A and C have official builds, B is tempered. C tries to verify B, so B decides to impersonate A, so every time B receives a packet from C, he transfers it back to A and every packet he receives from A he sends back to C

16:53:36 <sign4l[m]> But there is a PDF reader in GOS!?
16:54:45 <CaptainPicard[m]> Yee
16:58:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. There is a secure PDF viewer in GrapheneOS included standard. It uses the improvements in sandboxing, exploit mitigations and memory safety that Vanadium on GrapheneOS adds. Given the large amount of executable code that PDFs contain, and the way they can be used to attack the program that reads them, GrapheneOS' inclusion of a small, lightweight, safe and hardened PDF viewer is a
16:58:51 <TheJollyRoger> very pragmatic one.
17:07:50 <helloworldkk87[m> Thanks nscnt for those links:)
18:39:51 <Xcutioner[m]> Has anyone tried the Omerta Titan Ultra phones?  Do they offer any added benefit over Graphene on a supported Pixel?
18:42:04 <entry1> <Xcutioner[m] "Has anyone tried the Omerta Tita"> All rebranded GrapheneOS phones have zero benefit over normal GrapheneOS. All marketing and overpriced in comparison to flashing the OS yourself.
18:46:11 <entry1> Better to flash the OS and contribute to the project directly. As long as the reseller is hopefully giving some of the proceeds to the project and crediting GrapheneOS, it would be morally acceptable and okay for them to do.
18:47:10 <skwisgaar[m]> Omerta is also a really sketchy company. They charge a ton of money for a free OS and make all sorts of BS marketing claims. If anything their phone is less secure than a regular graphene install.
18:47:30 <skwisgaar[m]> “100% anonymous browsing” is one of their claims
18:50:19 <entry1> It pisses me off when people misrepresent the OS and make a profit off of unsuspecting non-tech saavy users. Can't stop it though, can only inform people and try to bring them here.
18:52:30 <EV-9600[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "“100% anonymous browsing” is one"> That's because it comes pre built with Orbot
18:54:05 <nscnt[m]> :]

19:01:34 <EV-9600[m]> Nothing
19:02:13 <Baobab> My guess is you need something prebuilt before you compile.
19:02:28 <Baobab> probably a git submodule update would do

19:21:03 <strcat[m]> they relied on our support and our investment into production AOSP builds, but just tried to undermine and harm us even while still pretending to collaborate
19:21:10 <strcat[m]> and now are outright malicious
19:21:30 <strcat[m]> and the only reason most people know about it is that I promoted it when I thought they were going to be working with us
19:21:38 <strcat[m]> greatly regret doing that
19:22:19 <strcat[m]> we're going to be taking legal action and putting substantial resources into dealing with their ongoing attacks
19:23:03 <strcat[m]> I'm really tired of this nonsense and no longer plan to take the approach of trying to conserve resources as we did with Copperhead
19:23:07 <strcat[m]> need it to end
19:27:11 <Jasper[m]1> How were they undermining the project if I may ask? I’m a little confused here since they’re a non-profit with the goal of creating privacy enhancing tech. How would they stand to benefit from undermining this project if there can be a mutual benefit
19:28:18 <Jasper[m]1> What is it with people being so hostile towards this community
19:29:04 <strcat[m]> by spreading misinformation and false claims about it
19:29:12 <strcat[m]> putting substantial resources into negative advertising targeting it
19:29:22 <strcat[m]> including targeting developers individually
19:29:35 <strcat[m]> with harassment/bullying, false claims about them, etc.
19:29:45 <strcat[m]> Jasper: there aren't many people hostile towards us
19:30:05 <strcat[m]> pretty much just CalyxOS and their community
19:30:05 <Xcutioner[m]> Hi strcat: Does Omerta contribute any code to Graphene
19:30:12 <strcat[m]> Xcutioner: no they don't contribute anything
19:30:19 <strcat[m]> they don't cause harm though
19:31:21 <strcat[m]> Jasper: Copperhead stopped actively attacking us and that will likely be officially ended in the near future
19:31:27 <strcat[m]> it's just Calyx doing it
19:31:54 <Baobab> CalyxOS seemed fine to me as a community. Is there something specific I missed?
19:31:57 <strcat[m]> if you look into the people who are spreading misinformation about GrapheneOS / attacking it you'll see that they're involved with CalyxOS
19:32:11 <strcat[m]> Baobab: definitely not, they're highly malicious and actively trying to harm GrapheneOS
19:32:17 <strcat[m]> and engage in substantial abusive behavior
19:32:28 <strcat[m]> which is not just condoned by the project itself but rather they engage in it too
19:32:51 <strcat[m]> will be starting to deal with them as we did Copperhead including posting on Reddit with logs, screenshots, and other things
19:32:57 <Jasper[m]1> Well there’s /r/privacy folks who get up in arms once you mention Firefox’s lack of proper sandboxing, the overal security landscape of Linux desktop distro’s, open-source not necessarily being more secure
19:34:04 <strcat[m]> okay but they don't have a project and community that's almost entirely based around causing harm to us
19:34:15 <strcat[m]> they aren't actively malicious towards us in most cases
19:34:18 <strcat[m]> only a couple people are
19:34:25 <strcat[m]> that's not what's happening with this
19:34:41 <strcat[m]> it's not a few bad apples, it's the project itself leading / encouraging it
19:38:03 <Jasper[m]1> I’d like to know why they feel the need to do that. I mean we could just ask
19:38:15 <Baobab> I'll just join #calyxos and when I see people being hostile I'll try to pushback.
19:39:30 <CaptainPicard[m]> I used to be in although I haven't followed it in some time because I've been so busy. I'm really saddened to hear all that happened. I'll definitely be pushing back when people try to push that stuff now that I know about it.
19:39:50 <Jasper[m]1> <Baobab "I'll just join #calyxos and when"> I’m not sure if that would be helpful. Infiltrating their community just to defend ours seems hostile from our part. Better to just ask what’s up
19:39:53 <alex-resist> I'm strongly in favor of deescalation at this point
19:40:20 <Baobab> Well I'm not sure if I'm infiltrating.
19:40:54 <Baobab> I don't think there's much of an anti-grapheneos culture in calyxos.
19:41:16 <Baobab> *at least in my experiences
19:41:20 <strcat[m]> Jasper: it's not hostile and they regularly raid our community and harass our developers
19:42:00 <alex-resist> There definitely is some shit talking going on, I've seen it
19:42:03 <strcat[m]> they come to our channels to concern troll and cause problems
19:42:04 <Baobab> and I don't think pushing back is hostile
19:42:21 <strcat[m]> they raid our channels to try to make them look hostile
19:42:36 <strcat[m]> people should absolutely be countering what they're doing
19:42:41 <Baobab> >and I don't think pushing back is hostile
19:42:41 <Baobab> well, it depends on how you pushback
19:42:54 <strcat[m]> don't engage in the same underhanded behavior but definitely do counter them with facts
19:43:16 <strcat[m]> what they've been doing in the past couple months has been a serious drain on the project's resources
19:43:53 <strcat[m]> they've caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to GrapheneOS and I will be putting substantial resources into starting to counter it in the near future
19:44:19 <strcat[m]> and we'll be focusing on the root of the problem
19:46:19 <alex-resist> I suggest not taking any action that threatens the existence of either project. It might be a good idea to have a round table with Nick and others and to try to come to a peaceful solution. Pretty sure Nick is not a bad person even if there's some shit talking going on
19:46:55 <Baobab> >try to come to a peaceful solution
19:47:00 <dithher[m]> I agree with alex-resist
19:47:00 <dithher[m]> Nick seems hospitable and uninterested in this apparent beef
19:47:02 <Baobab> 100% yeah
19:47:28 <dithher[m]> I am a newcomer interested in both systems and the only reason I know there's a "dispute" is because it's being mentioned here
19:47:33 <strcat[m]> dithher: that's not the case
19:47:39 <strcat[m]> I was trying to talk to them for months
19:47:50 <strcat[m]> and we've made offers to talk to them and resolve it over the past weeks, repeatedly
19:48:08 <strcat[m]> they have no interest in doing that and have ramped up their attacks on us substantially
19:48:09 <strcat[m]> he's absolutely not hospitable or friendly, he's just manipulative and wears that mask
19:48:41 <dithher[m]> I guess I do not understand what needs resolving?
19:48:41 <dithher[m]> I haven't seen attacks
19:48:41 <dithher[m]> Again, I'm new here, but they don't seem to be doing attacks enough that average users will detect it
19:48:51 <strcat[m]> he repeatedly insulted me for struggling with depression and then engaged in trying to target me publicly by explicitly helping to push the narrative created by others that I'm deranged/crazy
19:49:00 <alex-resist> Then a third party should initiate a mediation process. Sometimes that step is necessary.
19:49:06 <strcat[m]> dithher: they're spreading misinformation and false claims about GrapheneOS on a daily basis
19:49:09 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: this was already tried
19:49:10 <strcat[m]> so no
19:49:18 <Baobab> >they have no interest in doing that
19:49:18 <Baobab> I can talk to the calyxos devs if you want.
19:49:27 <strcat[m]> we're taking legal action and substantial resources into counterattacks
19:49:35 <strcat[m]> they are worse than Copperhead
19:49:37 <strcat[m]> what they've done is worse
19:49:40 <alex-resist> Then that third party was not very competent at mediation
19:49:53 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: not really the case at all
19:50:11 <strcat[m]> they did a good job with it but they are dealing with malicious people with no interest in stopping
19:51:12 <strcat[m]> we're going to be paying to have apps developed which demonstrate privacy and security vulnerabilities, making a site about it and directing traffic to it via paying for advertising
19:51:17 <strcat[m]> there are aspects where legal action makes sense
19:51:35 <strcat[m]> and we'll also be hiring people to work on making content that debunks their attacks and goes through them in detail
19:52:00 <strcat[m]> along with putting together content that shows examples of what they've been doing with logs, screenshots, etc.
19:52:11 <strcat[m]> debunking it, proving they have clearly acted maliciously and dishonestly
19:52:42 <alex-resist> That will look terrible, I'm afraid, even if you're 100% in the right
19:52:42 <strcat[m]> I'll happily put substantial resources towards this
19:53:03 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: what they're doing already causes substantial harm
19:53:17 <strcat[m]> it has substantially harmed the reputation of the project through their dishonest claims and fabrications
19:53:31 <strcat[m]> it has caused substantial harm to me through bullying/harassment they've directed towards me
19:54:11 <strcat[m]> there's an ongoing attempt to disrupt GrapheneOS development through multiple ways of them attacking it
19:54:21 <strcat[m]> it's a serious issue that impacts all GrapheneOS users significantly
19:54:34 <alex-resist> I honestly don't think so. I absolutely agree with you that they should not attack you personally. But people from the outside will mostly notice that there is endless beef between projects that should join forces to provide a better experience for the community
19:54:37 <strcat[m]> if you use GrapheneOS, you have been impacted by it, because of all the time and energy they've wasted
19:54:58 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: they've already framed it that way based on what Copperhead was doing
19:55:02 <strcat[m]> but it is them behind nearly all of it now
19:56:25 <nscnt[m]> What I've personally observed is that they claim not to take sides, but in doing just that, they take sides
19:56:25 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: we've already been damaged by that, don't have much to lose based on how they've already framed it
19:56:26 <CaptainPicard[m]> <alex-resist "That will look terrible, I'm afr"> Disagree. What Daniel is describing is a pretty serious defamation case, in addition to the negative attention directed at the project. I actually think this is a reasonable response based on what I heard.
19:56:26 <strcat[m]> nscnt: they have been directly involved in it themselves, repeatedly
19:56:32 <strcat[m]> I have screenshots and logs showing Nick's abusive behavior including leaking private information about me
19:56:35 <strcat[m]> can show their sockpuppet accounts doing things including doxxing and lots of harassment
19:56:36 <skwisgaar[m]> It’s such a shame that more people can’t see beyond the surface-level demeanor of calyx, techlore, etc. Just because you smile and come across as harmless and cute doesn’t mean that is really who you are.
19:56:37 <strcat[m]> and that they support people openly doing these things in their community
19:56:52 <akc3n[m]> <strcat[m] "it's a serious issue that impact"> Absolutely agree. Its emotionally draining. Especially when all people seek the truth and having to deal with malicious people purposely imposing false information for their own agenda effects my mental health, personally, IMHO.
19:56:54 <strcat[m]> they don't just tolerate it but promote it and help it along
19:57:34 <strcat[m]> I'll happily put $200k+ into fighting them because they've caused far more damage than that already
19:57:41 <strcat[m]> they successfully sabotaged one of the projects that was supposed to be funded
19:57:51 <strcat[m]> they've made it significantly harder for us to find developers we can fund
19:58:05 <strcat[m]> everyone using GrapheneOS is impacted by what they've done
19:58:38 <strcat[m]> all resources dedicated to defending against Copperhead will be moved over to this
19:58:41 <alex-resist> I guess I must have missed parts of the story then and will keep my mouth shut. If it's in fact worse than what I've seen, I'm not in the position to judge. But still, I'd really suggest not putting either project at stake
19:58:55 <strcat[m]> I was ignoring a lot of what they were doing for months due to focusing on what Copperhead was doing
19:59:02 <strcat[m]> and was actively trying to get them to stop, for months
19:59:05 <strcat[m]> I mean 8+ months
19:59:09 <skwisgaar[m]> akc3n: agreed, I am not involved with the project directly at all and I get stressed out over this stuff
19:59:38 <skwisgaar[m]> And that pales in comparison to the real damage done
20:02:17 <skwisgaar[m]> I definitely think presenting logs and other data will definitely help to show more people of what calyx is doing.
20:02:31 <skwisgaar[m]> * I definitely think presenting logs and other data will help to show more people of what calyx is doing.
20:03:03 <Baobab> strcat[m], if you like, I can talk to the calyxos devs.
20:03:10 <strcat[m]> the problem is that I don't have the time and energy to do it and therefore they get away with it, like Copperhead
20:03:13 <strcat[m]> Baobab: people have already tried that
20:03:15 <strcat[m]> I do not think they care
20:03:23 <strcat[m]> they've escalated their attacks substantially
20:03:59 <strcat[m]> they're doing the opposite of making peace and I'm going to be hiring people to start dealing with it
20:04:03 <strcat[m]> this has been ongoing for many months and has recently substantially escalated
20:04:13 <akc3n[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "akc3n: agreed, I am not involved"> I was going to get more involved on youtube and reply to a lot of in accurate information with facts. But it was effecting my mental health in a bad to the point where I didn't even want to get out of bed at times because of how sad it made feel as to why people would be saying such lies just out of their own ego and agendas.... so I couldn't continue with it. It
20:04:13 <akc3n[m]> took a while for me to personally snap out of it.
20:04:17 <strcat[m]> Baobab: so, sure, you can do that, but I don't think it would help
20:04:51 <strcat[m]> it's way past that point
20:05:05 <strcat[m]> Baobab: the amount of damage they've done at this point is enormous
20:05:42 <strcat[m]> it's worse than anything Copperhead did over the past few years
20:05:57 <strcat[m]> other than their initial takeover attempt, I mean everything after that
20:06:23 <strcat[m]> Copperhead finally stopped their attacks and guess what happens? Calyx massively ramps up their attacks on us a couple weeks afterwards
20:06:43 <strcat[m]> there were 1-2 weeks of peace
20:08:17 <skwisgaar[m]> akc3n: I feel the same way, there’s no way I could have done that without extreme stress. Like strcat is saying, this nonsense affects everyone in the community. I hope you can continue to keep perspective.
20:11:23 <alex-resist> I think part of this conflict stems from the fact that GrapheneOS (and Daniel too, by all appearances) is a very sincere, no bullshit project. Which is in contrast to how most of the modern society is run, including Youtubers and unfortunately also other tech projects
20:14:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Lead calyx dev be spreading Fud about graphene
20:14:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/calyxos/20210503#c7858995
20:14:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They are not good
20:17:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They also welcome harassers of graphene in the channel
20:17:16 <Railgun_Lover[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210314#c7246011
20:17:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> (linked image)
20:17:53 <akc3n[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "akc3n: I feel the same way, ther"> Thank you very much.
20:18:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If they're reading this
20:19:06 <alex-resist> Tbf I don't think Nick understands the hardening measures very well. Doesn't excuse those statements though. It's just unnecessary provocation
20:19:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You can stop your actions
20:19:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> alex-resist: no, what he is doing is just subversion
20:19:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And they still welcome bad people in their channel
20:20:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "You can stop your actions"> Calyx devs, feel free to not attack Graphene
20:20:34 <CaptainPicard[m]> <alex-resist "Tbf I don't think Nick understan"> No. People, myself included have tried to explain things to him and others. Always falls back on "well how much more secure is it (10%, 50% hurr de durr de durr I'm not listening)"
20:20:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It will significantly improve the situation for everyone
20:20:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <CaptainPicard[m] "No. People, myself included have"> Yeah
20:20:45 <CaptainPicard[m]> He hears what he wants to hear from these discussions unfortunately
20:20:55 <alex-resist> Hmhm ok, I'm listening and learning
20:21:09 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's pretty manipulative ngl
20:21:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> What Nick does
20:21:15 <skwisgaar[m]> alex-resist: nick isn’t that dumb… he is underhandedly creating FUD and pretending to be reasonable to mask his behavior.
20:21:31 <Baobab> The first log link seemed fine to me, I'm not sure if I would call it malicious. The second log link I think should be reported to calyxos.
20:21:37 <billinmtl[m]> I am relatively new to GrapheneOS, and stepped away / flashed back to stock b/c at times I would log on to the board(s) to find hundreds of messages and responses due to harassment, etc.  It was overwhelming and I am not directly involved.  I lasted about a week, but like Graphene's OS and this community - so I flashed back.  I have no input to offer on the harassment issues other than personal opinion which
20:21:37 <billinmtl[m]> would not really help.  I chose to sign up for the Beta releases and support by testing and offering feedback.  Thanks for a great OS !
20:21:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Baobab "The first log link seemed fine t"> Nah
20:21:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's malicious
20:21:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You can see that they're saying misinformation
20:22:15 <akc3n[m]> skwisgaar:  I feel like I lost the month of April due to their actions, but the reality is, its my own fault for not being strong enough mentally. Now I've reset my self and going to attempt again, one step at a time and small daily tasks of how I can personally help using the resource that I put in place at the beginning of April when that devious video was published on YouTube.
20:22:16 <akc3n[m]> Thank you for your kind words skwisgaar and thank you to TheJollyRoger and j8bit  too for the encouragement, and of course a big thank you to strcat
20:22:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But anyway, I gotta mess around makeshift welding now
20:22:49 <TheJollyRoger> billinmtl[m]: We'll be glad to have you onboard the beta test program. Every release, there's usually a post on the beta reports submitted, we'll be glad to have more people chipping in and looking out for bugs.
20:22:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> See y'all
20:23:03 <skwisgaar[m]> akc3n: glad to hear it :)
20:23:09 <TheJollyRoger> akc3n[m]: S'what I'm here for, indeed, big thanks to strcat for all his work.
20:26:09 <billinmtl[m]> <TheJollyRoger "bill.in.mtl: We'll be glad to ha"> Thanks - I've been on the beta for the last couple of releases, and have given basic feedback.  Much of the discussions are above my current knowledge base - but I can test OS's as needed 👍
20:26:58 <alex-resist> I'm also on beta, but since nothing ever breaks and I don't have IRC on my phone, I'm usually too late to comment on it
20:29:24 <akc3n> skwisgaar[m], thanks :-)
20:30:33 <alex-resist> GrapheneOS is really of exceptional quality, especially as an "alternative" project. Speaks a lot for Daniel's work
20:36:39 <TheJollyRoger> billinmtl[m]: Sure. Well, I can show you a few examples...
20:36:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a second...
20:37:39 <entry1> <alex-resist "GrapheneOS is really of exceptio"> His work ethic and expertise are unmatched, very inspiring how much of his knowledge he lends in these rooms everyday, in addition to all of his work he provides the world to use for free. Very sad to see anyone have anything negative to say about him, the project, and the community. Just need to drill it in that that is not the popular opinion and to acknowledge
20:37:39 <entry1> his efforts and help where we can.
20:38:17 <TheJollyRoger> billinmtl[m]: alex-resist, here, this is a beta report from the last release, it's an older one, but it could be a pretty good example. The idea behind the beta reports is that we the beta testers need to be on our toes to quickly upgrade as fast as possible, use our phones to test for something that wasn't broken before, before the upgrade gets pushed to stable.
20:38:19 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/beta-feedback/issues/11
20:39:01 <TheJollyRoger> The items that I list, are simply guidelines for quick reference, just to give an idea of what I did and didn't look for, you're by no means limited to the items or format that I follow, I just use it as an example.
20:39:37 <alex-resist> TheJollyRoger thanks, I think you actually showed this to me before. I'm just not really in the workflow to do that kind of reporting. I'm always late
20:39:43 <TheJollyRoger> If something is previously broken from before or by upstream, then I like to indicate that it works, but has a preexisting bug, so that way it doesn't get marked as something that is newly broken; the point of the beta releases is to catch something that is broken and wasn't broken before.
20:39:53 <TheJollyRoger> alex-resist: Got it, no problem then.
20:40:41 <alex-resist> I more or less refuse to have Matrix on my phone (because of all the bloat) and I'm on IRC only every couple of days, it's a bit frustrating. I want to contribute more, actually
20:41:00 <TheJollyRoger> Since GrapheneOS lacks telemetry or error reporting, this is why the beta testers have to actually dial in and post reports; we otherwise have no way to make the beta testing transparent and automatic.
20:41:20 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense, yeah, I have struggled with Matrix as well.
20:42:04 <TheJollyRoger> Hey billinmtl[m], awesome, I see now you've actually sent in a beta report before, haha! Small world, sorry about that, didn't mean to be condescending at all.
20:42:35 <billinmtl[m]> I'm not being clear - sorry.  I signed in to Matrix with my Github info and my user name there is bill-in-mtl.  I am the second response on the link you uploaded.
20:44:14 <TheJollyRoger> Haha, got it, sorry about that, I missed the cue, d'oh.
20:52:47 <alex-resist> Do you folks have an overall favorite GrapheneOS phone, including obsolete ones?
20:57:28 <TheJollyRoger> alex-resist: Woah, that's a tough and difficult question...
20:57:30 <TheJollyRoger> Well...
20:58:05 <TheJollyRoger> My favourite so far, and one that will be remembered fondly, is the Pixel 3. I think that was my first, and I really fell in love with my Pixel 3 and kind of wish I could have it back since the Pixel 4, while it *is* a nice phone, lacks the fingerprint reader.
20:59:24 <TheJollyRoger> So either I have to remove my respirator (not recommended!) or go through the hassle of entering the passphrase to unlock my phone when I'm outside of my apartment. I also miss it because the thing "felt" right.
20:59:47 <alex-resist> I think mine is the 3a XL, for its size, battery life, 3.5 mm jack and affordable price. And it's still supported for at least 12 months. It's just a tiny tiny bit slow when switching apps or doing lots of things at the same time, but that's not a reason to switch yet
21:02:37 <skwisgaar[m]> alex-resist: overall I would have to say pixel 3. Ignoring security/privacy it would probably be the M7 HTC one just for looking cool and metal construction.
21:03:53 <alex-resist> The HTC M7 was supported by GrapheneOS?
21:04:48 <skwisgaar[m]> Oh I misread your message lol
21:04:56 <akc3n[m]> <alex-resist "Do you folks have an overall fav"> I'm quite happy with my 3a. Although I can't wait to upgrade to have to a newer phone with SSD instead of the eMMC on the 3a.
21:04:58 <skwisgaar[m]> Thought you asked about any phone. Nope I don’t think it was.
21:05:34 <alex-resist> Any phone would also be interesting, but I don't want to be *that* off-topic :)
21:05:35 <skwisgaar[m]> Pixel 3 is only graphene device I’ve ever had. Bought it specifically for graphene.
21:05:45 <akc3n[m]> * I'm quite happy with my 3a. Although I can't wait to upgrade to have to a newer phone with SSD instead of the eMMC on the 3a.
21:05:45 <akc3n[m]> From what I understand, 3a's eMMC adds 150ms to bootup time which isn't noticeable lol. But the SSD on newer phones increases app spawning time.
21:06:05 <TheJollyRoger> alex-resist: hehehe, it's offtopic! We're allowed to talk about other things that aren't GrapheneOS here, as long as it doesn't turn into conspiracy theories, or is misleading or misinformation :).
21:06:24 <TheJollyRoger> After all, akc3n[m] and I love to talk about cooking here, that's perfectly fair for this channel :D
21:06:39 <jj1013[m]> Does anybody here have Windows 10 as a main driver? I want to know how can I keep my privacy while not destroying the operating system's security.
21:07:16 <alex-resist> jj1013 I think you can turn off lots of telemetry and other tracking, also Cortana etc.
21:08:10 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: Simply switch off the most invasive options in the privacy settings. You can turn Cortana off, after which it will turn to "Windows Search"
21:08:30 <southron[m]> I've got an enterprise copy and went through group policy editor and was able to make a lot of changes.
21:08:58 <skwisgaar[m]> You might want to look at windows security settings too.
21:09:37 <skwisgaar[m]> I’ve never had the patience for group policy but it seems like you can get a lot of benefit from customizing stuff
21:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> You can. Windows has a lot of pretty odd, strange, and niche options, and what I like is that they generally explain what most of them do either in the manual or right there in the group policy settings window.
21:11:19 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "jj1013.: Simply switch off the m"> I think somebody here recommended a specific Windows 10 debloated ISO. What was it again?
21:11:23 <TheJollyRoger> Of course, it's important still to check the documentation and make sure that they're right for you when you change them. Some of them, like zero out pagefile on shutdown *definitely* will have tradeoffs.
21:11:44 <TheJollyRoger> (And you shouldn't use it unless you're using a hard disk drive as your root drive or it way kill your SSD)
21:12:10 <akc3n[m]> <TheJollyRoger "After all, akc3n and I love to t"> Haha yes! Its great. And just to quote ya TheJollyRoger  February:
21:12:21 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "(And you shouldn't use it unless"> I thought SSDs were reliable.
21:12:25 <alex-resist> In principle I would like to try out WSL2 on a cleaned/more privacy respecting Win10, but I think in the long run I will just end up using Qubes on one machine and Debian on another.
21:12:25 * akc3n[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/jMnKJLdYthqqqOZhlDRteqTb/message.txt >
21:12:27 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: I don't recommend that unless it's the official version from Microsoft.
21:12:54 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: it has nothing to do with reliability and everything to do with that that setting will severely reduce the lifespan of your SSD, for no security benefit because SSDs do not work the way that hard drives will.
21:13:33 <southron[m]> 10 N comes without some bloatware, or LTSB comes with almost none I believe.
21:14:12 <jj1013[m]> <southron[m] "10 N comes without some bloatwar"> Oh, I've heard about LTSC.
21:14:26 <TheJollyRoger> Microsoft discourages the use of the Long Term Support Contract version, because that one's intended for special purpose installations where you "upgrade" the unit by throwing it away and buying a new one. It's out of my depth though.
21:14:33 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not a Windows wizard :P.
21:14:42 <TheJollyRoger> akc3n[m]: Haahahahahaha yes, culinary exploits XP.
21:14:56 <strcat[m]> note that Enterprise has both LTSC and non-LTSC
21:15:06 <strcat[m]> the best variant for security is non-LTSC Enterprise
21:15:12 <TheJollyRoger> But if I recall right LTSC is for things like medical equipment, factory equipment, embedded devices, that sort of thing. It's not supposed to be for general usage.
21:15:13 <akc3n> TheJollyRoger, heheh
21:15:35 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Microsoft discourages the use of"> https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-deployment/windows-10-ltsb/m-p/2070121 Microsoft says LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) was formerly LTSB.
21:15:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, whoops.
21:15:57 <TheJollyRoger> I get my acronyms mixed up.
21:16:05 <jj1013[m]> LTSB = Long-Term Servicing Branch
21:16:13 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
21:16:52 <skwisgaar[m]> I used LTSC for a while before I realized the security downsides. But my god it was sooo amazing having no extra windows garbage built in.
21:16:56 <flawedworld[m]> obligatory thing to say here btw - Windows Server also has LTSC and SAC variants, but the SAC variants are CLI only
21:17:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah! X(
21:17:18 <jj1013[m]> Does archive.org host unaltered versions?
21:17:37 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: dunno. Dunno if you want to trust that either.
21:17:56 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, yeah, I remember running Windows Server in Server core back when I was going through my "Toxic Self Defeating Power User" days... man, I was so stupid back then.
21:18:05 <skwisgaar[m]> * I used LTSC for a while before I realized the security downsides. But my god it was sooo amazing having no extra microsoft garbage built in.
21:20:38 <southron[m]> The Windows official iSO contains most versions from home up to enterprise. You can edit it to install the one you want.
21:20:49 <southron[m]> * The Windows 10 official iSO contains most versions from home up to enterprise. You can edit it to install the one you want.
21:20:57 <flawedworld[m]> .\MediaCreationTool.exe /Eula Accept /Retail /MediaArch x64 /MediaLangCode en-US /MediaEdition Enterprise
21:21:10 <TheJollyRoger> Woah.
21:21:10 <flawedworld[m]> That's what I would suggest to make trustable installation media
21:21:17 <TheJollyRoger> flawedworld[m]: I'm gonna remember that, thank you!
21:21:28 <jj1013[m]> <southron[m] "The Windows official iSO contain"> I found Microsoft's evaluation OS download.
21:24:21 <jj1013[m]> Annnnd it asked me for a bunch of personal stuff. Whatever, I guess. Not that I don't have the ability to use my mom's phone number.
21:25:52 <jj1013[m]> Would it run on a budget computer?
21:26:57 <flawedworld[m]> <jj1013[m] "Would it run on a budget compute"> if you can run windows 10 now then yeah. Some of the security functionality requires IOMMU and virtualization support
21:28:07 <jj1013[m]> <flawedworld[m] "if you can run windows 10 now th"> My computer can do virtualization ─ not only it has run virtual machines in the past, QubesOS did not complain about this.

I'm passing through a PCIE USB card. Shame it doesn't work on Windows 10 Enterprise, I really would love for MS to enable DDA on Enterprise.
21:29:19 <jj1013[m]> Virtual machines do not run flawlessly on this computer, though. It has a 1,80 GHz processor and 4 GB of RAM.

21:50:16 <Xcutioner[m]> where is the wipe option when you enter the pin wrong to many times?
21:51:22 <strcat[m]> Xcutioner: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
21:51:42 <strcat[m]> Xcutioner: there's an option like that but it's not exposed in the standard UI and isn't particularly useful since it's only a software feature in the OS
21:51:55 <strcat[m]>  please read encryption FAQ
21:52:11 <strcat[m]> there's a secure element implementing hardware-based throttling which quickly ramps up to 1 attempt per day
21:52:29 <strcat[m]> a sophisticated attacker would be able to fairly easily bypass the an OS implemented attempt limit
21:52:36 <strcat[m]> they could not easily bypass the throttling
21:52:45 <strcat[m]>  * they could not easily bypass the throttling due to the hardware implementation
21:53:03 <strcat[m]> without hardware support for an attempt limit, it isn't really useful in the real world
21:53:23 <strcat[m]> the hardware-based throttling already makes it so that you'd need to exploit the secure element to bypass it even for a random 6 digit PIN
21:53:27 <strcat[m]> 1 attempt per day is not much
21:54:09 <strcat[m]> they would just stop making attempts to unlock before they hit the limit that wipes and switch to working on bypassing it which for an OS limit is not hard
21:58:29 <Gladox114[m]> So I finally bought the pixel 5 and my question is what features would be gone. Because the phone GUI is smooth as fuck and this would be something I would miss. I mostly use open source software as replacement to everything except the camera (And maybe the keyboard) so are there tricks to still use them maybe?
21:59:36 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> gui would remain smooth
21:59:48 <Gladox114[m]> nice this sounds good
22:00:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> the default AOSP camera is fine
22:00:14 <flawedworld[m]> devices with 90hz support retain that functionality
22:00:33 <Gladox114[m]> oh wait I forgot it has 90hz
22:00:38 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> it does what a camera is supposed to do, you can also use Open Camera
22:01:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> there is a way to make Google Camera work on GrapheneOS, without microG
22:02:27 <strcat> there's a permissively licensed open source keyboard project we might use to replace the current keyboard in the future
22:02:41 <strcat> since the AOSP keyboard isn't actively improved anymore beyond bug fixes
22:02:58 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> oh oh oh, can you send the link please?
22:03:00 <jj1013[m]> I have heard somebody say Windows 10 switches some privacy settings back to their defaults after you change them. Is this FUD?
22:03:01 <strcat> but it's not ready yet, doesn't support stuff that's mandatory for it being a viable replacement
22:03:22 <Baobab> >there is a way to make Google Camera work on GrapheneOS
22:03:22 <Baobab> I think there's a foss driver for that.
22:03:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> ahh ok
22:03:35 <Gladox114[m]> All the open source keyboards I saw (on S4 Lineage) were just simple without swibe so will it have this swibing feature?
22:03:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> not really a driver, if we are talking about the same thing
22:04:11 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "I think there's a foss driver fo"> You can search on the history of the chatroom.
22:04:15 <Gladox114[m]> <Baobab "I think there's a foss driver fo"> just for the Gcamera?
22:04:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> no swiping keyboard
22:04:35 <jj1013[m]> <Gladox114[m] "just for the Gcamera?"> Just for the GCam.
22:09:57 <ypm[m]> <Gladox114[m] "All the open source keyboards I "> simple keyboard on fdroid has spacebar swiping to move the cursos and backspace swiping for quick deletes. idk if thats what youre referring to
22:10:57 <Gladox114[m]> No I meant really swibing across all the letters to just write words with that
22:11:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i guess, he's refering to "gesture typing"
22:11:18 <Gladox114[m]> idk the name so I think yeah
22:12:03 <ypm[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> i guess, he's refering t"> idk then
22:12:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, that's what it istho, i think, the name of this feature has been changing
22:12:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <g​ochoingles> I've tried that once.It's slow. Not useful.
22:13:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> in any case, GrapheneOS keyboard (as AOSP keyboard) does not have this feature, as it relies on a proprietary library
22:13:58 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i guess for you it wasn't good. personally, i really love it
22:14:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <g​ochoingles> Oh. OK.
22:31:41 <Gladox114[m]> Can somebody send me a link to get Gcam working on graphene OS? Or the driver, modified version?
22:31:57 <sfhsjr[m]> AnySoftKeyboard has gesture typing and it works decently. I found it on f-droid but does anyone have any thoughts on it?
22:32:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
22:33:39 <Gladox114[m]> oh damn that's even better than I saw months ago (It was a modified version of Gcam) but this is even open source
22:57:04 <hasnoname[m]> <sfhsjr[m] "AnySoftKeyboard has gesture typi"> It's fine for general use and had lot of back and forth. I use g board. Can use it with network disabled
