00:13:37 <Baba[m]> Any feedback on this?
00:22:25 <akc3n[m]> Baba: https://tailscale.com/kb/1013/sso-providers
00:22:25 <akc3n[m]> You can't sign up with email. You have to use gsuit/gmail, office 365, and/or other providers.
00:22:25 <akc3n[m]> Hard pass and hard no for me
00:22:43 <akc3n[m]> But depends on your own usecase and threat model Baba
00:23:13 <Cliff[m]> What is the best navigation app for graphene?
00:24:02 <akc3n[m]> Cliff: I hear a lot of people use osm
00:24:40 <joltman[m]> "best" isn't easy to define. OSMand+ is popular. Magic Earth is another option if you need something more functional, but it's not open source code.
00:25:22 <Cliff[m]> akc3n OSMfocus reborn that one?
00:25:34 <akc3n[m]> Cliff: https://freenode.logbot.info/?ch=grapheneos-offtopic&q=
00:25:34 <akc3n[m]> Search for osmand and/or navigation. You'll find a lot of previous discussions on this
00:25:56 <akc3n[m]> Cliff: osmand+
00:26:43 <Cliff[m]> Thanks
00:27:01 <joltman[m]> If you get OSMand, I think it is limited to like 7 downloaded maps (like 7 US states if you live in USA) whereas OSMand+ is limited only by the storage on your device. Keep that in mind if you see both options.
00:27:13 <akc3n[m]> You're welcome Cliff
00:28:28 <Cliff[m]> I live in switzerland
00:28:37 <joltman[m]> Magic Earth is nicer and more functional and has unlimited downloadable maps, but you're placing your trust in a company since the source code is closed.
00:29:25 <joltman[m]> If you're in Switzerland, then the download limit on OSMand may not be important unless you're using it to travel across Europe.
00:29:28 <akc3n[m]> Cliff: nice! Beautiful country. I lived in Bern for 10 months.
00:32:21 <Cliff[m]> <joltman[m] "Magic Earth is nicer and more fu"> I want to limit to f-droid is osmand+ not available for Europe?
00:32:51 <joltman[m]> I think OSMand+ might only be on Aurora
00:32:56 <joltman[m]> Not sure about that
00:32:57 <Cliff[m]> akc3n yes very nice here i am from zurich
00:33:33 <joltman[m]> OSMand+ may not be on F-droid as I seem to recall.
00:34:37 <Cliff[m]> Maps & GPS navigation OsmAnd+  is on fdroid this is not the correct one?
00:35:57 <joltman[m]> If you're used to Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, etc., you'll find OSMand and OSMand+ to be relatively primitive. Also, some people have trouble getting voice navigation working on certain devices.
00:36:22 <joltman[m]> That sounds like the one you want, the OsmAnd+ with unlimited map downloads
00:36:43 <joltman[m]> I think that's what I have
00:37:00 <Cliff[m]> I wilk try it out thanks
00:37:10 <joltman[m]> You're welcome
00:37:38 <joltman[m]> Keep expectations low 🙂
01:10:57 <theychuckthisfro> Are there any good forks of Firefox for Android?
01:33:34 <Telegram-Bridge> <g​ochoingles> No. Firefox is no good.
01:35:21 <theychuckthisfro> Wish there was something like LibreWolf for Android.
01:37:06 <TheJollyRoger> theychuckthisfro: I suggest avoiding Gecko-based browsers on Android. They don't internally sandbox and simply have an "all your eggs in one basket" approach.
01:37:28 <theychuckthisfro> Ah, got it.
01:37:34 <theychuckthisfro> Looks like I'm stuck with Chromium.
01:37:39 <TheJollyRoger> Just use Vanadium and use the default settings, or if you must, use Bromite.
01:37:56 <theychuckthisfro> Why not Ungoogled Chromium?
01:38:22 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium has been very carefully designed to be indistinguishable from the stock pixel's Browser on your specific handset, with Play Services disabled.
01:38:33 <TheJollyRoger> So as to maximize your anonymity set.
01:38:51 <theychuckthisfro> I have both on my phone, since I'm trying to figure out what Browser I'm comfortable with.
01:39:02 <theychuckthisfro> Or rather, which Chromium fork is the best for Graphene.
01:39:02 <TheJollyRoger> Just use Vanadium.
01:39:05 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium.
01:39:13 <theychuckthisfro> Got it.
01:39:28 <theychuckthisfro> What makes Bromite good?
01:39:31 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium has the best security, strongest site isolation, uses the improved sandboxing and memory safety features of GrapheneOS and maximizes your anonymity set.
01:40:12 <TheJollyRoger> Bromite has some amount of ad blocking, and there has been co-operation between Vanadium and Bromite in the past. Nevertheless, I have not used Bromite myself, so I just say if you have Vanadium, use it because it's the best you're going to get.
01:40:22 <TheJollyRoger> No ifs, ands, technicallies, or buts.
01:40:30 <TheJollyRoger> *the best you're going to get on GrapheneOS.
01:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, hiding your IP address from sites you visit is only a small fraction of remaining secure or claiming privacy. That does very little if you cannot maximize your anonymity set.
01:41:49 <theychuckthisfro> Right.
01:42:11 <theychuckthisfro> I'm still new to experimenting with Graphene, I just want some advice as to what I should be using to maximize my anonymity.
01:43:09 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium, and if you must use Tor, use the Tor Browser and bear in mind that it makes no effort to sandbox sites from each other.
01:44:20 <TheJollyRoger> I advise not to use Vanadium with Tor unless you want to join the only two people in the whole wide world doing so, and likely both of them are in this room now.
01:45:15 <theychuckthisfro> What would the advantage be with connecting a Tor bridge to Vanadium?
01:45:32 <TheJollyRoger> None, but you will get a shitload of disadvantages.
01:45:59 <theychuckthisfro> I figured.
01:46:11 <TheJollyRoger> When using GrapheneOS for privacy, the biggest favour you can do yourself is to forget everything you've learned in the privacy sphere that encourages "custom tuning" or "configuring" or "config hardening" - GrapheneOS is designed to be secure and to be private out of the box with opinionated defaults that are meant to work in concert with each other and have been very very carefully
01:46:13 <TheJollyRoger> thought through by a professional developer who thought the whole thing through top to bottom taking into account a proper threat model.
01:46:16 <TheJollyRoger> Countermand his expertise at your own peril.
01:46:19 <theychuckthisfro> Does Vanadium have access to uBlock and stuff, or is it like Brave where it has a built in AdBlocker?
01:46:39 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium does nothing to block ads, this is by design: adblocking is the best way to make yourself trivially trackable online.
01:46:52 <theychuckthisfro> That's true.
01:47:50 <TheJollyRoger> The easiest way to do this would be a site embedding an image (such as a single pixel) to popular advertising domains on each site, then enumerating which devices block which combinations of those domains.
01:48:09 <TheJollyRoger> Because each person will likely personalize their own adblocking lists, this essentially gives you an anonymity set of precisely one.
01:48:13 <TheJollyRoger> Which is no anonymity set at all.
01:48:42 <TheJollyRoger> This requires no JavaScript, no fancy side channels, no exploits, just a pixel and a little bit of HTML, and a site counter.
01:49:28 <TheJollyRoger> This is why Vanadium does not do it and purposely disables add-ons.
01:53:01 <theychuckthisfro> TheJollyRoger: Thanks for the tip.
01:53:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, ye be welcome.
01:53:18 <theychuckthisfro> Any other cool .apks I should look at that will improve the experience?
01:54:37 <TheJollyRoger> Probably Signal or Molly IM, Vinyl Music Player or Music Player Go, Aegis for One Time Passwords, FairEmail, OpenCamera, Jitsi, KeePassDX, maybe Simple Calendar.
01:55:40 <theychuckthisfro> I use Signal and Music Player Go currently.
01:56:13 <theychuckthisfro> I'll check out OpenCamera.
01:56:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, good luck!
06:48:11 <Ed[m]2> <TheJollyRoger "Probably Signal or Molly IM, Vin"> vinyl is really comfy but id like it to output music loouder
06:48:12 <Ed[m]2> is that a thing
06:54:41 <Thatcher[m]> VLC can do that
06:56:42 <sign4l[m]> I also stuck to vinyl
06:58:13 <Ed[m]2> <Thatcher[m] "VLC can do that"> im aware that vlc can do that aswell, but i perfer vinyl since the UI is better
07:11:59 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <TheJollyRoger "Because each person will likely "> On the other hand it's OK for Brave or Bromite. Just don't bother using browser extensions.
07:28:55 <helloworldkk87[m> No it is not
07:29:44 <helloworldkk87[m> adblocking is the best way to make yourself trivially trackable online.
08:35:57 <Thatcher[m]> Unless you use the same adblocking rules a lot of other users are using, which are provided in brave and bromite
08:37:12 <Thatcher[m]> Bromite uses the steven black list
08:37:52 <Thatcher[m]> It's a popular list used by a lot of vpn's and dns services
08:38:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> GrapheneOS website recommends AdGuard dns as a way to block ads
08:39:07 <nscnt[m]> Not a recommendation
08:39:17 <nscnt[m]> Just an explanation how to do it
08:39:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, "suggestion", not a "recommendation"
08:45:18 <somenerd[m]> Mostly used as an example of a static list afaict
08:46:28 <somenerd[m]> Don’t think that there’s any suggestion or recommendation from the project
08:46:36 <somenerd[m]> Except for Bromite as a browser
09:30:09 <GhostSplinterSix> <theychuckthisfro "Any other cool .apks I should lo"> Through recommendations on here (Element) and personal preference, I installed Signal, ProtonMail, ProtonVPN, Brave, Bitwarden, KeePassDX, Simple Calendar (Until ProtonCalendar becomes available), Simple Gallery, Open Camera, AntennaPod, Nextcloud, Syncthing, Markor, Voice Recorder, MuPDF Viewer, Feeder, Termux and a few others. I'll probably dwindle
09:30:10 <GhostSplinterSix> down on the apps as I get more familiar with the ones that I've never heard of before.
09:37:19 <missfire[m]> antenna pod is awesome
09:38:24 <missfire[m]> I wish there was some app with similar interface as spotify which takes songs from youtube api
09:39:06 <missfire[m]> like newpipe for songs / podcasts
09:39:19 <Thatcher[m]> That's a lot of apps. You can simplify by using a few apps to do multiple things, such as using Signal's Note to Self feature for voice memos and encrypted gallery instead of a voice recorder and camera app. Syncthing eats up a lot of battery, so I use one of my encrypted chat apps for sending files like my Keepass database to and from devices. I have an encrypted group chat on Element/matrix with my
09:39:19 <Thatcher[m]> Raspberry Pi that I have as a backup storage device for the files I post to the group chat. Just some ways to repurpose few apps for many tasks.
09:41:46 <akc3n[m]> GhostSplinterSix: why did you go with Brave? Vanadium is the browser to use. And as a secondary browser, Bromite is the recommended.
09:41:47 <akc3n[m]> Just curious about your choice for Brave.
09:42:10 <lain[m]1> cause he’s brave
09:42:14 <mynacol[m]> Thatcher: I would be cautious repurposing apps in this way. Element allows you to delete past messages, so not suitable as a backup.
09:42:28 <Telegram-Bridge> l​p4678 shared a photo on Telegram with caption: 'Jolly do you know what the architecture is for the pixel 5'
09:43:06 <missfire[m]> photos not sending via bridge?
09:44:56 <Thatcher[m]> mynacol That is a good point, but the only way I'd delete old messages is if I were drunk and I've been sober for 7 years.
09:45:12 <Thatcher[m]> 🍺
09:45:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <l​p4678> Oh ok yeah , so you know varients of apps can be for different arm architecture , what is the pixel 5 using ?
09:49:28 <mynacol[m]> <Thatcher[m] "mynacol That is a good point, bu"> My point is: The device that has the original data can delete the backup as well. If your phone were to be compromised your backups could be gone as well.
09:52:35 <mynacol[m]> All Pixels since 3 (not sure for older ones) are running 64 bit ARM, sometimes phrased aarch64
09:53:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <l​p4678> Cheers

09:54:56 <GhostSplinterSix> > Just curious about your choice for Brave.
09:54:56 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm new to GrapheneOS and am the most familiar (as of right now) with Brave and its features. Also, my anti- spyware, virus, malware, adware, etc software only has Brave as an option for web browsing protection.
09:55:43 <somenerd[m]> wdym "only has Brave as an option"
09:55:49 <somenerd[m]> suggestion?
09:56:16 <GhostSplinterSix> <Thatcher[m] "That's a lot of apps. You can si"> Yep. Like I said, I'll probably dwindle down on the apps as I get more familiar with the ones that I've never heard of before.
09:58:49 <GhostSplinterSix> <somenerd[m] "wdym "only has Brave as an optio"> It has a list of web browsers that it can "protect" and Brave is the only one available (i.e. no Bromite, Vanadium, etc etc). Chrome is available, but we already know why using that isn't smart...
09:59:28 <somenerd[m]> I'm not sure about how it'd protect brave, does it include an adblocker (content blocker/firewall)
09:59:30 <akc3n[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "> <@akc3n:tchncs.de> GhostSplint"> Gotcha. If you like, (maybe you've already read it), check out  https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
09:59:52 <Thatcher[m]> mynacol  I have an extra stay-at-home 4a5g with Graphene (always plugged in as Captain Easton suggests) with a Threema chat for backups with my primary device. No delete function in Threema like Element has. I try and utilize all my chat apps as redundant backup solutions. 😋

10:03:11 <somenerd[m]> does the antivirus itself have a firewall/content blocker?
10:04:07 <helloworldkk87[m> There really is no need to use antivirus tho.. Auditor app can monitor if your bootloader is unlocked or OS version is downgraded etc
10:04:35 <covid-1984[m]> Used to be a Google Checkout button on this website of a restaurant I go to... It doesn't load in vanadium - this is expected behavior right? Pretty sure it used to load in Vanadium though.
10:06:26 <GhostSplinterSix> <somenerd[m] "does the antivirus itself have a"> The system scans webpages and warns you when you come across fraudulent pages. It filters all traffic, not only your intentional browsing, and offers real-time protection against all online dangers.

10:19:54 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm open to suggestions on what web browser (Vanadium it seems) to use and what settings to tweak. Drop this n00b some knowledge!
10:20:36 <somenerd[m]> The GrapheneOS site suggests Vanadium and Bromite
10:20:37 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
10:20:57 <somenerd[m]> Bromite has a bit of ad-blocking implemented
10:23:31 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah. I've browsed the website some. I was more or less asking y'all since I'm brand new and y'all have a lot more knowledge and experience. That and preferences vary, so I enjoy getting the chance to pick brains and learn from others.
10:24:13 <helloworldkk87[m> Bromite also has some anti-fingerprint features like sub-channel color data for canvas and WebGL canvas is randomised etc
10:25:11 <somenerd[m]> Vanadium is more focused on security than Bromite
10:25:16 <somenerd[m]> However, Vanadium does include some privacy hardening
10:26:42 <somenerd[m]> such as disabling FLoC: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/11/patches/0078-disable-unused-FLOC-feature.patch
10:27:00 <GhostSplinterSix> Is there a particular reason those two web browsers are recommended for the OS and not one like Tor?
10:27:15 <somenerd[m]> I suggest rereading the section
10:27:33 <somenerd[m]> it has reasons on why it doesn't recommend FF-based browsers
10:27:43 <helloworldkk87[m> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html
10:27:58 <somenerd[m]> (Like Firefox and Librewolf)

10:30:05 <GhostSplinterSix> All good. I'm not tech savvy and familiar with a lot of the lingo, so I thought I'd ask.

10:41:29 <GhostSplinterSix> Fair enough. I want to support the developers and contributors and so I don't want to take anything away from them by installing other stuff and using those instead of what they have worked hard on implementing.
10:41:39 <stealthdroid[m]> <helloworldkk87[m "Edge comes pre-installed and is "> Doesn't really matter though, chrome has 70% market share and is much better for "blending in"

Can you, or someone else explain me a better way of hiding IP ? VPN providers maybe more of a single point of failure in my understanding but I am not that professional on this topic .
10:42:27 <stealthdroid[m]> The real question is, how much telemetry is there in chrome after you've disabled it in settings

10:50:05 <covid-1984[m]> I see most of the things we need now have independent self-hostable services now... So I didn't want to get reliant on nextcloud. The one thing they have, though, that is hard to find elsewhere is photos (Google Photos replacement; backups, etc).
10:50:06 <GhostSplinterSix> I've never used Nextcloud before and it was recommended to me and so I thought I'd ask.
10:51:14 <covid-1984[m]> Ya it covers most of your bases. So next step is to figure out if you wanna self host it or not
10:51:48 <somenerd[m]> e2ee is preferred, no matter which provider you choose
10:52:11 <GhostSplinterSix> Proton Technologies has their own Drive but it's in beta, so I was looking for something to hold me over in the meantime.
10:58:00 <crazycryptofreak> <helloworldkk87[m "Tor Browser is fine but using Or"> Okay yeah I understand that but how about other apps like proton mail , elementary, conversation s etc. ?
10:58:17 <covid-1984[m]> Proton's mail is mad expensive. Just self host and use FOSS mailing clients
10:59:02 <covid-1984[m]> Or trust Snowden's recommendations of signal & proton :P
10:59:36 <crazycryptofreak> So what do you guys do to hide IP with vanadium ?
11:00:36 <covid-1984[m]> crazycryptofreak: why the need? is the first question.
11:00:44 <covid-1984[m]> Look at some guides on how VPNs aren't a saving grace
11:01:08 <covid-1984[m]> https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29 one enlightening discussion
11:01:12 <crazycryptofreak> Well to stay private and not giving my name registered with my IP I guess
11:01:28 <covid-1984[m]> I use VPN mainly to change my IP... For example banks freak out sometimes when you're not in their country.
11:01:42 <covid-1984[m]> crazycryptofreak: aka trust VPN provider more than ISP
11:01:53 <covid-1984[m]> depending upon what you're doing that could be wise or unwise
11:02:06 <crazycryptofreak> Well that's why j wanted to use tor not VPN providers
11:02:07 <covid-1984[m]> also checkout the DNS guide on grapheneos.org

15:13:29 <bikeman1234[m]> Is it possible to add a layer of full disc encryption with 3rd party software to my pixel 5 with graphene? for example like i use veracrypt on my computer.  The point with this would be 1. to protect against possible flaws in the file based encryption like ive seen alot in police reports, for example in many iphones some data can be unencrypted even in BFU-mode. And 2 it would provide the possibility to
15:13:29 <bikeman1234[m]> use a long code when I start the phone to open the full disc encryption but then have a shorter one for screen lock. ( yes im aware of touch id but i would never use such a function )

15:31:17 <covid-1984[m]> Unless you're just talking about some files... Or the app data too?
15:31:56 <somenerd[m]> suggest reading the FAQ section on encryption
15:46:04 <joltman[m]> ...and then decide if what you want to do is even necessary. Just because iOS encryption may not be secure doesn't mean it's also true for GOS.
15:46:04 <bikeman1234[m]> <covid-1984[m] "Unless you're just talking about"> No i want everything encrypted like the old android versions using full disc encryption

15:50:19 <somenerd[m]> (on the system)
15:50:29 <somenerd[m]> I don't think that any app can have access to all files
15:50:44 <somenerd[m]> if the app was implemented, it would be a privileged system app
15:51:05 <bikeman1234[m]> <somenerd[m] "example? "> Iphones , at least a couple of years ago some data was unencrypted, some IOS versions even pictures was unencrypted

15:54:01 <joltman[m]> I'm pretty sure you'd have to rewrite the GOS code to make it do what you want and you would likely lose some security advantages in the process, depending on how you implemented it.  Basically, a lot of work that might make the device less secure.

20:21:49 <Core6255> normally I'd just leave browser open and wait for it to finish but it's a very large file
20:22:16 <Core6255> staring at white background for 4 hours will probably kill my battery
20:23:15 <Core6255> didn't try other browsers tbh, since all the decent ones are chromium based and behave the same anyway
20:24:32 <entry1> May be bad advice, but maybe try Firefox (apologies before I get shot in the head). It allows me to play audio when the screen is locked, while chromium closes.
20:24:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <A​randolf> I'm talking about push notification
20:25:39 <entry1> <Telegram-Bridge "<Arandolf> I'm talking about pus"> No, unless that have proper push implementation built into the app, you will not get notifications for certain apps.
20:25:56 <entry1> What app are you referring to specifically
20:42:21 <covid-1984[m]> For audio? VLC can stream it maybe
20:45:38 <GhostSplinterSix> <entry1 "May be bad advice, but maybe try"> You take that back!
20:47:40 <Cliff[m]> > <@wonderfall:targaryen.house> True, and Tor Browser (at least on desktop) is a good example of that to learn about its importance. That's how it's meant to be used: with standard/robust defaults (even a standard window) so there would be no deviation possible that could compromise your "anonymity". But when you start to mess with it, it can go wrong.
20:47:40 <Cliff[m]> > Blending in is much better than standing out from the crowd, each setting can increase your entropy, so caution is needed when you start to weak your browser
20:47:40 <Cliff[m]> What about disabling JavaScript in the TBB or tails tor browser does that make you stand out?
20:49:58 <Cliff[m]> I read somewhere it is the most secure way of using tor to put the security slider to max and disable javascript in about:config but it does break functionality for most sites
20:57:17 <vdge[m]> <Cliff[m] "I read somewhere it is the most "> Don't touch the about:config in tor. Feel free to use the slider as you like.
20:58:58 <Cliff[m]> vdge why is that?
21:00:44 <vdge[m]> Because pushing slider to 'max' already disables the java script already. You're just duplicating it by doing the same in about:config which could also make you stand out based on how that specific toggle is set to function.
21:01:18 <vdge[m]>  * Because pushing slider to 'max' already disables the java script. You're just duplicating it by doing the same in about:config which could also make you stand out based on how that specific toggle is set to function.
21:02:58 <Cliff[m]> I remember a bug not so long ago in the slider so is it really safer then setting javascript.enabled to false
21:03:33 <Cliff[m]> To me it is just making sure again it does break functionality so i dont use it it is more for the people needing to be sure
21:05:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <A​randolf> signal
21:05:54 <helloworldkk87[m> Dont change anything in Tor browser. Period. Something like TAILS os sugest that you dont even touch the security slider
21:06:13 <Telegram-Bridge> <A​randolf> and whatsapp/telegram
21:07:08 <vdge[m]> <Cliff[m] "I remember a bug not so long ago"> If you don't trust the browser to do the things correctly, you shouldn't use it. What's the proof that a small hidden toggle in about:config works correctly ?
21:09:48 <Cliff[m]> <helloworldkk87[m "Dont change anything in Tor brow"> Where does it say that?
21:11:37 <Cliff[m]> vdge chances of bugs higher? Everything i ever read about hardening firefox had to do with about: config
21:14:27 <vdge[m]> <Cliff[m] "vdge chances of bugs higher? Eve"> Yes, they use it because it's the only way to customize FF at the root level. I did contribute to arekenfox user.js as well btw.
21:15:25 <GhostSplinterSix> <Cliff[m] "Where does it say that?"> The reason they prefer you to not change anything in the addons is that the purpose of the Tor Browser is to make all users look exactly the same, so if people have customized some settings it will make them stand out.

21:18:17 <GhostSplinterSix> Yep!

21:51:31 <GhostSplinterSix> It would be wrong of me to complain about how many great privacy and security OSes and programs there are out there for folks like us.
