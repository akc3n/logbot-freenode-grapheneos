03:23:03 <abff[m]> the uh offtopic new room doesn't seem to exist
03:23:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> It does, you just need to use the correct link
03:23:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> The one with "-new" in it
03:23:56 <akc3n[m]> <abff[m] "the uh offtopic new room doesn't"> #grapheneos-offtopic
03:24:15 <abff[m]> yeah I get some report that says it doesn't exist
03:25:25 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> try this one? https://app.element.io/#/room/%23grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
03:27:39 <akc3n[m]> > please migrate to the new channels GrapheneOS and GrapheneOS Off Topic (the old aliases without -new were also moved to the new channels, but some home servers seem to cache those)
03:28:37 <akc3n[m]> Eeek, sorry, matrix markdown :sigh

08:38:28 <Erraverunt> So there wont be irc channels anymore?
08:39:24 <strcat> Erraverunt: for the time being it's just on Matrix, we have #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic reserved on libera.chat (freenode replacement by the former freenode staff) and oftc but we don't have plans to use them atm
08:39:39 <strcat> you can join those but we can't bridge them the same way, the bridge had unacceptable consequences for the Matrix rooms
08:39:46 <strcat> we would need to use a different bridge approach
08:39:59 <strcat> would be best if people moved to Matrix (Element has gotten a *lot* better)
08:40:14 <strcat> the room upgrade also helps (for #grapheneos, #grapheneos-offtopic wasn't that out-of-date)
08:40:26 <Erraverunt> Ok thanks, guess its good time for me to start using matrix =)
08:40:54 <strcat> since nearly everyone is on Matrix it's a better experience
08:41:16 <strcat> we'll be making a Telegram -> Matrix bridge (rather than Telegram -> IRC) which should be a better experience (but still not ideal, best experience is on Matrix)
08:42:31 <strcat> IRC users get links to long messages, see edits to messages as new messages with * (rather than them being updated and being able to see edit history), can't click through the quotes to past messages, can't see reactions, can't see all formatting (the bridge tends to strip out formatting even when people are used to Markdown syntax in regular chat / email)
08:42:43 <strcat> and so on
08:42:51 <strcat> it's just a better experience being on Matrix where most people are
08:43:30 <strcat> atm Telegram bridge is worst experience but largely because it went through IRC, it'll be less bad hooked up to Matrix
08:43:36 <strcat> since then it won't truncate messages, etc.

15:39:33 <strcat> focusing on the new Matrix rooms though
15:55:06 <strcat[m]> ideally we can get most people here on both Matrix and IRC to move to the new Matrix rooms
15:55:25 <strcat[m]> then if necessary we can make a new leaner / less fancy IRC bridge to libera.chat #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic
15:55:35 <strcat[m]> but ideally we get most people in the new Matrix rooms, it will be a better experience for everyone

20:57:01 <blaqkbsd[m]> Someone recommend me some reliable VoiP services with SRTP/ZRTP or SIP/TLS DID numbers to use with GrapheneOS. Its quite shit the stock Android 11 program does NOT support encrypted SIP in the Dialer
20:57:18 <blaqkbsd[m]> Looking for reliable SIP (TLS) services with DID, preferably crypto accepting ISP. And if anyone can recommend me a top 5 of VoiP apps to use with GrapheneOS please let me know!
20:58:13 <blaqkbsd[m]> I finally received my second Pixel. This is a Pixel 5. Great for experimenting
21:10:38 <madaidan[m]1> ḃl̔a͂q̔k͡b̊s̅d̏: ask in the new Matrix rooms.
