00:05:04 <akc3n> We live in an instant gratification materialistic world that all based on money and greed. All about the flash. ie. Playing on words (privacy, security, etc) in current events in order to monitize of peoples fears and concerns. Just my personal outlook.
00:06:49 <akc3n> Marketing to their target audience by giving them hope and 'solution' through seductive manipulation and word play.
00:07:18 <GhostSplinterSix> Correct.

00:13:52 <mistazaki[m]> I don't understand what they scam.
00:14:27 <mistazaki[m]> I am interested in coreboot bios.
00:28:00 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mistazaki GhostSplinterSix Purism makes many misleading and false claims
00:28:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> For example, portraying their ARM smartphone as open hardware
00:28:20 <akc3n> mistazaki[m], I just bought a lenovo t430 (3rd gen - 2012). i5-3320M, 180gb ssd, 14" 1600x900, 8gb ram $100cad. Upgraded the ram to 16gb for $70cad. It's in mint condition. Built like a tank. And can flash coreboot on it myself if I wanted to. Archlinux runs perfectly on it. I can do my own physical tamper proof if I wanted to, and most certainly dont need to spend $1499 usd (~1850cad) to have all these stupid gimmicks designed to make
00:28:20 <akc3n> money of people who are easily swayed by reviews and hype.
00:30:32 <mistazaki[m]> <akc3n "mistazaki, I just bought a lenov"> Understand
00:31:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Making blatantly false claims

00:32:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I could understand stretching the truth, you gotta make money
00:32:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But blatantly lying? I have a problem with that
00:32:54 <Railgun_Lover[m]> (referring to Purism, not you)
00:33:44 <akc3n> mistazaki[m], and that's not even getting into the technical aspect of things.

00:41:09 <enjoy_the_silenc> I would need to try using my bank's app on my device with GrapheneOS. I had thought about creating a separate profile and installing it via Aurora store. If so, what data would I be exposing to the app? (I've read the faq on the site but would need confirmation). Theoretically the app should not have access to: non-resettable hardware identifiers such as the serial number, MAC addresses, IMEIs/MEIDs, SIM
00:41:09 <enjoy_the_silenc> card serial numbers and subscriber IDs right? But it could identify the profile on which it is installed. So if I delete the profile on which it is installed it's as if nothing happened right?

00:43:41 <entry1> <enjoy_the_silenc "I would need to try using my ban"> Just network information to my knowledge and that you're using Android. A lot of bank apps may not be compatible depending on their integration of Google services. I also found that the Aurora Store doesn't have a lot of apps like they used to, and it can be kind of sketchy getting a bank apk lol
00:45:02 <entry1> They could probably see other apps installed within that profile as well.

14:21:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> What device
14:22:00 <manj-gnome> i'm using manjaro and the linux-hardened-git from the repo doesn't build correctly and avorts
14:22:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Linux hardened git is an experimental staging version
14:22:39 <manj-gnome> oh ok, i did'T know that
14:22:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should install linux-hardened directly from the official repositories
14:23:16 <manj-gnome> thats the only one recent i found in AUR
14:23:22 <louipc> yea if you using git u should be ready to do development and patching
14:23:56 <louipc> manj-gnome: does your distro have the kernel in its repos?
14:23:58 <manj-gnome> i went to https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened/releases and downloaded the source, but don'T know how to proceed further
14:24:44 <louipc> do you know how to build a kernel?
14:25:18 <manj-gnome> i have build samsung android kernels before, but never for desktop
14:25:58 <louipc> cool. then just read the error message and figure it out i guess
14:26:37 <manj-gnome> so my knowledge is limited and manjaro doesn't offer an official hardened kernel...
14:27:16 <manj-gnome> i guess i have to find it out, just wanted to take a shortcut any help will be much appreciated
14:29:05 <louipc>  no one can assist if you have no specific question
14:29:39 <manj-gnome> ok, can you tell me the command to build the kernel from source?

14:30:40 <manj-gnome> no, i'm just trying to build the kernel

14:31:28 <akc3n[m]> then to what command to use to build the kernel from source.
14:31:58 <jj1013[m]> <manj-gnome "no, i'm just trying to build the"> You should read the documentation, wherever you are pulling that kernel out of.

14:43:15 <louipc> good luck
14:43:52 <louipc> manj-gnome: also change locale to 'C' for when you post error messages
14:45:16 <manj-gnome> samsung kernels yes, but they source comes pretty much preconfigured... and i know all the commands and hicups, which is not the case for desktop kernels... anyway thanks

17:07:27 <TheJollyRoger> EV-9600[m]: I'm going to put it this way: if you decide to do rooting, you can use userdebug, but otherwise, you are on your own. If you have something that legitimately needs privilege escalation, you can write a privileged extension for it, or an exception.
17:08:57 <EV-9600[m]> <EV-9600[m] "Why? I will disable root once I'"> I am also interested as to what security concerns rise if I do this, just out of curiosity
17:09:06 <TheJollyRoger> The reason people do root is because they don't understand how the android permission and security model works, so rather than work within those permission models, they choose to give it access to everything.
17:09:14 <akc3n[m]> Oh, Hi Jolly, and here I was just about to quote you..
17:09:19 <akc3n[m]> From logbot lol
17:09:28 <TheJollyRoger> Hello akc3n[m]!
17:09:38 <akc3n[m]> :-)
17:10:17 <TheJollyRoger> EV-9600[m]: the equivalent would be like a hotel manager saying "I can't figure out how to get the keys to the guest's specific room off the hook, so I'm going to give him my entire key ring to the entire hotel."
17:11:01 <TheJollyRoger> "Including our financial records, our sensitive customer billing data, etc."
17:11:31 <TheJollyRoger> Only vold, init, and a few other legitimate low-level system daemons on Android have root equivalent access, and even they have to answer to the mandatory access controls enforced by the kernel.
17:11:32 <EV-9600[m]> <TheJollyRoger "EV-9600: the equivalent would be"> Only you should add that it is done under controlled environment and you latter take those keys back
17:11:47 <TheJollyRoger> EV-9600[m]: Doesn't work that way.
17:12:10 <TheJollyRoger> EV-9600[m]: So, you reenable verified boot. Now, all your changes are reverted so the system partition is as it was in signed and verified condition.
17:12:17 <TheJollyRoger> Or your phone is bricked.
17:12:21 <EV-9600[m]> Why though?, That's what I'm trying to understan
17:12:31 <akc3n[m]> > Android is not built like a desktop operating system, where root access is only one password entry away.
17:12:31 <akc3n[m]> > Instead, Android is built as many disparate components, all of which are internally sandboxed, individually. Even system applications are sandboxed; even vold, which talks to the storage interfaces at a low level, and init, which brings the kernel online, aren't allowed unconstrained access to the system; they still are bound by the mandatory access control policies enforced by the kernel.
17:13:30 <TheJollyRoger> EV-9600[m]: the reason why is because any privileged system components in Android, or by extension GrapheneOS, are signed, verified, and bitwise identical across every instance of the installation per that device.
17:13:30 <TheJollyRoger> Down to the very last bit.
17:13:40 <EV-9600[m]> <TheJollyRoger "EV-9600: So, you reenable verifi"> If add iptables rules it will brick my device?
17:14:06 <TheJollyRoger> EV-9600[m]: They'll be undone the moment you reboot your phone, as per verified boot.
17:14:17 <TheJollyRoger> If your phone's verified boot can't revert the damage to the system partition, your phone won't boot.
17:14:56 <EV-9600[m]> Verified boot will not only verify, but also modify, my system?
17:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> If it detects that it is no longer in the condition it was signed in, it will use error correction codes to revert it to the way it was until it passes.
17:15:32 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, let's say your phone is compromised by a Very Determined Adversary.
17:15:55 <TheJollyRoger> The Very Determined Adversary adds something like a kernel hook, or something nasty to your system partition.
17:16:04 <TheJollyRoger> A day later, you reboot your phone.
17:16:20 <TheJollyRoger> The late stage qualcomm bootloader finds that the system partition no longer passes signature validation.
17:16:59 <TheJollyRoger> It then uses error correction codes to determine what happened, and then undoes the damage until the signature validation passes, at which point it's undone the damage, and the phone boots.
17:17:04 <TheJollyRoger> If it can't, the phone won't boot.
17:17:25 <EV-9600[m]> OK so you are saying that not only this will harm my security that won't even work, because once the system is rebooted my changes will be undone, right?
17:17:38 <EV-9600[m]> Thanks
17:18:37 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to run without verified boot, I won't stop you, but you should be aware that if you're choosing to have no verified boot, any security measures that depend on it will also be disabled, which sets your device security back roughly ten years.
17:18:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, that's correct.
17:19:23 <TheJollyRoger> *I can't stop you, since I'm not you,
17:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> Now... it's possible for you to do things such as write privilege extensions, or exceptions.
17:20:30 <TheJollyRoger> Before I go on, I want you to understand where Android comes from in this matter:
17:21:06 <TheJollyRoger> A popular wisecrack I've often heard to describe the state of computer security is: "if someone has gotten your computer to run their programs, it's no longer your computer anymore."
17:22:11 <TheJollyRoger> Android was an attempt to allow your handset to run other people's programs, without giving away the keys to the kingdom; the Android developers realized that apps are going to come from sources that aren't curated; they'll come from shady people on the internet, they'll come from random publishers, who aren't going to be trustworthy, they're going to likely use old versions of
17:22:13 <TheJollyRoger> electron that are badly out of date...
17:23:19 <TheJollyRoger> So the Android developers decided that given the reality of the situation today where nobody is their own software developer and everyone is *expected* to install and run other people's programs, those programs NEED to be contained, isolated, sandboxed, and exploits need to be mitigated.
17:24:13 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS aims to take this a notch further by preemptively mitigating exploits such as those targeting Zygote spawning by replacing it with Exec spawning at the cost of some performance and being much more conservative with memory at the cost of each process requiring a slightly larger memory footprint.
17:25:21 <TheJollyRoger> But this is precisely why Android is built with everything -- everything including legitimate system functions -- internally sandboxed and locked down, and everything denied by default.
17:26:47 <TheJollyRoger> Apps are sandboxed. If something is able to get code execution outside its sandbox, the idea is, at least prevent it from invading another app's sandbox. If an app finds a way to start something outside the confines of that sandbox, then at the very least, prevent further damage by preventing that app from escalating privilege.
17:28:49 <TheJollyRoger> This "defense in depth" strategy is a core foundation of the Android security model. Turning off verified boot and then enabling app-accessible root essentially says, "I'm going to do away with all those layers and give the apps an easy way to escalate privilege, so now a single clickjacking attack through accessibility can now give someone access over my phone, and now since there's
17:28:51 <TheJollyRoger> no verified boot, I'm going to let the compromise be persistent."
17:30:24 <TheJollyRoger> So, this is where a privileged extension could help you. As for that, you're on your own. I don't understand the android security model well enough to help you there at this point in time; it's a tad bit complex and that's why people tend to take the sledgehammer approach of giving away the keys to the whole kingdom, rather than only the key to what they want done.
17:30:45 <TheJollyRoger> EV-9600[m]: Hope this helps a little bit.
17:32:02 <TheJollyRoger> But what flawedworld[m] said is quite correct: done correctly, there is no legitimate need for app-accessible root. You need to write the security policy to allow an app access.
17:37:05 <ypm[m]> that was quite informative
17:37:06 <ypm[m]> thanks!
17:37:10 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome.
17:37:20 <Baobab> :)
17:49:39 <Core6255> do you've any thoughts about arm v9, TJR? I guess we won't need titan m in future arm soc's with the amount of security focus they're putting in that thing as it seems pretty much all about security.
17:49:47 <EV-9600[m]> <TheJollyRoger "EV-9600: Hope this helps a littl"> Thanks! I'll be sure to read at later
17:50:30 <EV-9600[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Now... it's possible for you to "> Could you provide a link as to what you mean by this? This might be just what I need
17:50:41 <Baobab> armv9 looks _very_ promising
17:54:13 <Baobab> Gary expalains made a video on it in the past: https://invidio.us/watch?v=1kH1kJa9XJA
17:56:30 <TheJollyRoger> EV-9600[m]: I'm sorry, I don't think I have a video on privileged extensions at this point in time. I haven't even gotten as far as app development yet.
18:50:31 <TheJollyRoger> Core6255: sorry, I missed the message earlier. I don't have any thoughts on ARMv9 at this moment.
19:06:20 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "Gary expalains made a video on i"> Invidious is dead.
19:06:48 <Baobab> jj1013[m], it's a pretty active project
19:07:03 <Baobab> and the devs are very friendly as well
19:07:53 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "and the devs are very friendly a"> Didn't the owner say they'd stop developing it?
19:09:00 <Baobab> jj1013[m], he gave the project to the other devs
19:09:21 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "jj1013., he gave the project to "> Oh.
19:09:29 <Baobab> yeah :)
19:09:47 <Baobab> SamantazFox in general has been a great help fixing stuff
19:09:55 <jj1013[m]> By the way, how do I lower the quality in an instance? If I put it on "medium", the video just freezes.
19:09:55 <jj1013[m]> Keeps buffering.
19:10:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Everyone is free to run their own instance of it, and distribute load against other Invidious instances, just that the original Invidious has moved toward development instead.
19:10:19 <Baobab> jj1013[m], I mean you can do it in the settings.
19:10:22 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "SamantazFox in general has been "> New devs! I think I have an excuse to get rid of FreeTube.
19:10:23 <Baobab> what instance?
19:10:43 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "what instance?"> YTPrivate and Snopyta's IIRC.
19:10:51 <Baobab> lemme take a look
19:10:51 <jj1013[m]> Not sure if it was on kavin.rocks too
19:11:09 <Baobab> actually this might be too offtopic for grapheneos-offtopic
19:11:25 <Baobab> not sure if this is allowed but you might want to join #invidious
19:11:37 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "actually this might be too offto"> Nah. I heard Peter say there was somebody talking about food in here.
19:11:43 <Baobab> nice
19:11:48 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "not sure if this is allowed but "> Otherwise we could just DM.
19:12:34 <TheJollyRoger> It's fine!
19:12:40 <Baobab> >snopyta 502 Bad Gateway
19:12:40 <Baobab> muh
19:13:04 <Baobab> >It's fine!
19:13:04 <Baobab> sweet
19:13:22 <TheJollyRoger> The thing we take exception to in Offtopic is if people spread misinformation or misleading stuff. This isn't going near that, haha.
19:13:36 <TheJollyRoger> So you guys are fine! P.-)
19:14:12 <jj1013[m]> I only see "medium" and 720p res in invidious.tube.
19:14:19 <jj1013[m]> I am fetching instances from invidio.us
19:14:47 <Baobab> I think some instances only allow a certain res as well
19:15:27 <Baobab> I know that in the past some instances enforced proxying serverside but forgot to turn on proxying in the preferences.
19:15:48 <Baobab> So that unless you enabled proxying manually in the settings, you couldn't play the video.
19:37:32 <helloworldkk87[m> Happy May Day everyone! :) if youre country has mayday
19:37:51 <helloworldkk87[m> * Happy May Day everyone! :) if your country has mayday
19:45:26 <TheJollyRoger> Hey same to you helloworldkk87[m! :)
19:56:29 <Baobab> helloworldkk87[m, :)
20:28:26 <Core6255> lol
20:29:57 <Core6255> does anyone know what android symbol '10307' is or does, some service or app listed under battery usage
20:30:21 <Core6255> never seen it before tbh
20:30:59 <Core6255> but taking 8% of battery usage
20:58:27 <strcat> it's an app id
20:58:34 <strcat> it means the app was uninstalled, etc.
21:02:21 <Core6255> ohh. I thought I had a virus, lmao. Ty strcat.
21:02:45 <strcat[m]> maybe don't jump to strange unwarranted assumptions in the future
21:34:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <L‚Äã73689> I've just for qubes but I'm brand new to linux
21:37:19 <failbetter[m]> Wow straight into the deep end :0
21:50:15 <GhostSplinterSix> Only one way to learn how to swim
21:51:30 <louipc> swim
22:38:57 <akc3n[m]> <louipc "swim"> That second 'swim' made me chuckle! Thanks.
22:42:49 <louipc> ;)
22:43:39 <Baobab> :)
22:48:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> :(
23:30:13 <Pratyush[m]> i quick stupid question, is it possible to create work profile or other profile as secondary user?
