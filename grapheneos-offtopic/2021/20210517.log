00:48:53 <surveillexxxx[m]> anyone here a long time QubesOS user?
00:49:28 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: I am, although I unfortunately must leave my desk for the moment. There are a number of people here who do indeed use Qubes, myself included, feel free to ask away!
00:50:18 <surveillexxxx[m]> so the terminal for one of my qubes is the terminal for that entire template?
00:51:07 <TheJollyRoger> It depends. If you are using a TemplateVM, and you're doing stuff that affects the TemplateVM's persistent image, changes indeed, will be carried across to the AppVMs that are generated from your TemplateVMs.
00:51:57 <TheJollyRoger> So for instance, if you do `sudo apt install thunderbird` to install thunderbird in your templateVM, the next time that TemplateVM is closed and the AppVMs that are spawned from it are rebooted, they'll magically have Thunderbird with them.
00:52:56 <TheJollyRoger> However, you can't (as non-root) log in to Thunderbird on your TemplateVM and expect that your login will apply to all the AppVMs, because that part isn't carried forward to your AppVMs.
00:53:41 <surveillexxxx[m]> does anyone have a video explaining the full extent of this
00:53:44 <surveillexxxx[m]> or a atricle
00:54:07 <TheJollyRoger> The most reliable source of documentation on this is actually on the Qubes documentation, under TemplateVMs.
00:55:04 <dnull> https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/
00:56:00 <TheJollyRoger> @M0ctezuma - Actually, you can wipe a phone 100%. If you do a factory reset on GrapheneOS or on any phone with a security chip and full implementation of Weaver, the phone will turn over its access tokens and generate new ones. All the data on the filesystem will become permanently lost, even if you know the password.
00:56:19 <TheJollyRoger> Even if you extracted the SSD and imaged it.
00:59:12 <TheJollyRoger> This process, or "Crypto-shredding" operates under the assumption that the ciphertexts cannot be destroyed, so it makes it very easy to ensure the keys to decrypt them can be.
01:00:06 <surveillexxxx[m]> do the colors on of graphene OS actually matter?
01:00:09 <surveillexxxx[m]> or is it just the level of trust I deem the colors?
01:00:23 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: Nah, the colors under the customization options are purely cosmetic. Tune them to as you see fit.
01:00:54 <surveillexxxx[m]> so then what makes the red ones burn and die when i close them
01:01:14 <surveillexxxx[m]> I wonder if zoom would survive going through whonix.....
01:01:46 <TheJollyRoger> It won't. Zoom relies primarily on UDP. Tor doesn't really support that and there'd be a lot of latency.
01:02:01 <surveillexxxx[m]> yeah
01:02:27 <surveillexxxx[m]> can you help me troubleshoot something in debian?
01:02:29 <TheJollyRoger> So it will probably still connect but you might get such severe packet loss and lag that call and audio quality could make things difficult.
01:02:30 <surveillexxxx[m]> on wubes
01:02:35 <surveillexxxx[m]>  * on qubes
01:02:45 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, not at the moment, this is about all the time I have for today.
01:02:53 <surveillexxxx[m]> ok
01:02:57 <surveillexxxx[m]> I will turn to the forums
01:02:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hope this does help, good luck!
01:03:06 <surveillexxxx[m]> thank you
01:03:46 <dnull> There's also #qubes
01:04:11 <surveillexxxx[m]> im in it but no one is on
09:32:27 <boldeagle> hello asking about outlook and Microsoft teams
09:32:35 <boldeagle> as they are required by my company
09:32:43 <boldeagle> will they work on graphene
09:33:29 <jpds> boldeagle: Try it, see what happens, you might not get push notifications if they rely on google push services
09:34:04 <boldeagle> i need to know before i get the pixel phone other wise i will get iphone or somethine else
09:34:44 <trail_undergroun> <boldeagle "will they work on graphene"> According to Plexus, they seem to work fine.
09:34:48 <trail_undergroun> https://plexus.techlore.tech
09:35:05 <boldeagle> perfect
09:35:13 <boldeagle> will go buy a pixel
09:35:32 <trail_undergroun> I‚Äôd recommend asking some others first because it appears Teams hasn‚Äôt been tested since last year
09:35:52 <trail_undergroun> You‚Äôll probably be fine but it can‚Äôt hurt to be 100% sure :)
09:36:18 <boldeagle> thank you very much
09:37:50 <trail_undergroun> Oh small correction. They have an entry called ‚ÄúMicrosoft Teams‚Äù that claims to work fine in August 2020, but they also have an entry called ‚ÄúTeams‚Äù which claims to work mostly fine from 2021. I assume ‚ÄúTeams‚Äù refers to Microsoft Teams but I‚Äôm not sure.
09:38:53 <boldeagle> yeah
09:45:30 <boldeagle> currently using iphone and i hate it
09:45:43 <boldeagle> i can't even send or receive a file
10:06:55 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <boldeagle "hello asking about outlook and M"> Microsoft apps work fine with GrapheneOS
10:07:33 <boldeagle> thank you so much DHFuchsiaOSwhen
10:07:42 <boldeagle> from aruroa store right
10:07:50 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Yeah
10:08:46 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Generally, they don't have any hard dependency on Play services. On the other hand, most of their apps can't handle having Network permission revoked (they crash and do not allow their app to be opened, especially the Office suite apps)
10:11:53 <boldeagle> ahh i will need o give them network permission any way i think since they are communication apps
10:20:17 <covid-1984[m]> Might be of interest: https://github.com/i5ik/ViewFinderJS

11:06:42 <donkykong[m]> Hey all for crypto cold wallets would tails or whonix be better or any other recommendationsüôè
11:09:22 <lackshan[m]> Does anyone have any CPU benchmarks for building graphene? I'm deciding between a 3700X and a 3900X
11:10:12 <lackshan[m]> And do you know if building graphene/aosp is more dependent on cores or frequency?
11:24:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <C‚ÄãrowmacMcCarthy> Even if they don't work on Graphene, Pixel stock Android will be fine, and probably a better option that iOS, since you can isolate work apps in work profile (which can't be done on iOS)
11:33:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <M‚Äã0ctezuma> Tails is ment to not store any data. With storing data you break the concept
11:33:15 <Telegram-Bridge> <M‚Äã0ctezuma> With whonix idk

12:32:58 <just-a-bugger[m]> I'm not trying to shill for Chromium (if anything, I'd rather not use it because browser diversity in the web is nice), but if we consider that Firefox has security flaws, then I may want to use Chromium just to balance security and privacy.
12:33:07 <just-a-bugger[m]> One more thing: Tor and Firefox have implimented first-party cookie isolation (dubbed in Firefox as Total Cookie Protection), does Chromium have a similar funtionality?
12:41:39 <covid-1984[m]> <just-a-bugger[m] "I'm not trying to shill for Chro"> So he's saying not to use chromium, but rather Chrome, yes?

13:34:11 <trttl> that's cool. never understood what's the point of checking blocklist updates on every startup/every 4 hours. like if some new abp rule was a crucial security thing that you need to get as quick as possible
13:34:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> it's a privacy thing
13:34:55 <trttl> yeah an anti privacy thing
13:35:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if you have an outdated blocklist you stand out
13:35:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> the best way to blend-in with everyone is having exactly the same list with everyone
13:36:08 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> it's not an "anti privacy thing"
13:36:55 <trttl> no website is gonna deeply probe your 100k ruleset
13:37:26 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> ~depends
13:37:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> also, you don't need to check all 100k
13:38:08 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> even if your website has only 10, it is already easy to distinguish different users
13:38:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> with 10 factorial different groups of users, just based from 10 different ad domains
13:39:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> btw 10! == 3 628 800
13:39:46 <strcat[m]> they will probe distinguishing ones
13:40:08 <strcat[m]> ones that are differences between lists not all...
13:40:29 <strcat[m]> and you might be surprised how much time they spend doing this stuff
13:43:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> sorry, my previous messages were a bit wrong
13:45:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if your website uses 10 different ad domains, you will be group users solely based on that into one of 2^10 groups
13:45:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that is 2^10 == 1024
13:45:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> not 10 factorial
13:50:15 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> note that 2^33 == 8 589 934 592, almost 9 billion
13:52:00 <trttl> >ones that are differences between lists not all... - true but to what end? my list may be outdated now but not on my next visit. i just don't see how is this something a tracker can rely upon. if someone uses region specific lists, non-default lists or a certain combination of those that is obviously a different story
14:04:43 <failbetter[m]> Do you guys ever use one of those services that provides phone numbers?
14:07:58 <M7777777y[m]> So tor has been experiencing a heavy amount of malicious exit nodes, as we know, malicious exit nodes can try to downgrade HTTPS to HTTP and alter the content. This makes me worry about using orbot with certain apps
14:08:06 <M7777777y[m]> If some of these apps don't force HTTPS, they could be manipulated perhaps?
14:08:10 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> thank you m777777
14:09:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <M‚Äã0ctezuma> Didnt dive into this, but afaik they use sslstrip
14:09:06 <M7777777y[m]> Is there any any way to deal with this other than, I suppose finding out if each individual app forces https
14:11:21 <M7777777y[m]> For example: Element, would this app be vulnerable if it's using orbot?
14:11:27 <M7777777y[m]> Perhaps credentials stolen at login?
14:11:32 <Telegram-Bridge> M‚Äã0ctezuma shared a file (application/pdf) on Telegram with title: 'Phishing_detection_on_tor_hidde_2021_Forensic_Science_International.pdf'.

14:39:59 <M7777777y[m]>  * Is there a way I can check this per app to see if it forces https?
14:45:06 <strcat[m]> 7y: it's in res/xml/network_security_config.xml in the apk
14:45:10 <strcat[m]> an apk is just a zip file
14:45:18 <strcat[m]> in the built apk xml files are in a binary xml format
14:45:26 <strcat[m]> you can unzip it and convert it to plain text xml and just look at it
14:45:32 <strcat[m]> there are tools to do that kind of stuff

15:34:54 <FreeEagle> phones
15:51:03 <FreeEagle> hello guys how to you back up your contacts and how to synch it between two phones*+
15:51:19 <fomijafi[m]> export contacts as a .vcf file
15:53:34 <sb13x[m]> Year same I transferred using a USB stick
15:53:54 <FreeEagle> i always use two phones and back when i used to use google i liked the idea when i save the number on one phone i find it on the other phone
15:55:20 <fomijafi[m]> Syncing contacts on Google's cloud
15:56:25 <sb13x[m]> Don't know if ProtonMail Encrypted Contacts would be a viable solution?
15:57:33 <FreeEagle> fomijafi[m]yeah i used to do that
15:58:16 <fomijafi[m]> Could also use nextcloud if that's your thing. I sync my calendar using nextcloud
16:01:33 <withinfire[m]> i use davx5 to sync contacts and calendar with my non-google email provider, using CardDav and CalDav respectively. Think most alternative email providers use those protocols? (yes it's not e2e encrypted)
16:04:15 <FreeEagle> ok i will check it
16:43:12 <tharg[m]1> Hi everyone. My haptic feedback is stuck on, although settings tells me it is switched off. Any ideas where to fix this?

16:59:46 <just-a-bugger[m]> <tharg[m]1 "Hi everyone. My haptic feedback "> Do you have any accessibility services from apps turned on?
17:03:45 <FreeEagle> hello
17:03:49 <FreeEagle> again
17:04:01 <FreeEagle> any one facing troubles with Aurora store
17:04:14 <FreeEagle> i can't log in to a session no matter what i do
17:07:01 <sign4l[m]> maybe Aurora Store support can help
17:07:08 <broda721[m]> Yes me too
17:07:25 <broda721[m]> With the new UI its also not possible to edit the tokenizer anymore
17:07:33 <FreeEagle> what would be our safest alternative
17:07:44 <broda721[m]> For play store apps?
17:08:10 <FreeEagle> yeah i need microsoft outlook and Teams
17:09:26 <broda721[m]> No clue. There's sites like apkmirror and apkpure, but I would really not recommend them security wise
17:10:11 <FreeEagle> yeah i can't trust them Either
17:11:12 <broda721[m]> Yea for now I guess you'd have to wait till they fix it, or perhaps use those apps on desktop/google/apple device. I dont see other reasonable options
17:11:48 <FreeEagle> i'm thinking a separate work phone just for this stuff
17:11:57 <FreeEagle> this actually work use
17:12:39 <FreeEagle> i think i will request that
17:24:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> go to the aurora support group
17:24:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> they know if something is happening
17:26:03 <FreeEagle> will try to find them
17:29:47 <vdh7[m]> I saw a post of daniel micay saying desktop linux was insecure? what does the grapheneos community generally recommend as a daily driver os?
17:30:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <C‚ÄãrowmacMcCarthy> for desktop you mean?
17:31:31 <vdh7[m]> yeah desktop
17:31:49 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> chromeOS or windows or macOS
17:33:58 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> therefore you either get a chromebook or the latest surface or the latest macbook
17:34:18 <vdh7[m]> so basically on desktop, if I want security I can't have privacy/anonimity?
17:35:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you can be fairly private with them
17:35:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> but yeah, it's up to your threat model
17:36:37 <vdh7[m]> I mean I switched from windows to linux distribs because I wanted to avoid the telemetry and logging stuff
17:36:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah, i understand
17:36:55 <vdh7[m]> but then I learn linux is not as secure at all >.<
17:37:35 <TheLoneWanderer[> Try QubesOS?
17:37:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah QubesOS is an option
17:38:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> but telemetry on win/mac is not that bad as pictured by many pop youtubers
17:39:37 <vdh7[m]> my laptop is a bit light on specs I think to run such a heavy virtualized environement
17:39:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and it is well-documented in terms of what do they collect
17:40:35 <TheLoneWanderer[> Check how many times it pings in 1 hour
17:40:48 <TheLoneWanderer[> It's quite a lot
17:41:29 <TheLoneWanderer[> Not to mention there are some questionable design choices e.g edge using a webpage as new tab page
17:45:01 <vdh7[m]> I find windows to become really more and more invasive these days
17:45:46 <vdh7[m]> like recently with the last update, they offer that new feature where you can connect your phone and access pictures, send messages etc easily via a desktop interface
17:45:55 <vdh7[m]> of course you don't have to opt in
17:46:42 <vdh7[m]> but I feel like microsoft is starting to really close down on all the tracking stuff where they were previously lacking behind google
17:51:36 <Telegram-Bridge> <C‚ÄãrowmacMcCarthy> macOS is the best option
17:52:46 <Telegram-Bridge> <C‚ÄãrowmacMcCarthy> ChromeOS is still not quite there yet, and Wintel is not as secure as macOS on an M1 macbook
17:57:28 <vdh7[m]> hum I see
17:57:38 <vdh7[m]> but in that case I really need two laptops
18:02:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <C‚ÄãrowmacMcCarthy> why?
18:06:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> > "Check how many times it pings in 1 hour"this is not a good metric for measuring telemetry
18:06:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> the actual amount of user data would be a better metric
18:07:26 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and they do document how much and what type of user data gets shared
18:08:09 <TheLoneWanderer[> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> > "Check how many times "> Never said it was a good metric. Just the easiest one
18:08:26 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> while one can develop an app that simply pings a server a billion times per hour, without actually sending any user data
18:10:56 <TheLoneWanderer[> Even if no data gets sent, it doesn't make much sense to ping the servers every 5 minutes or so
18:11:08 <TheLoneWanderer[> And that doesn't include NCSI
18:11:36 <TheLoneWanderer[> Compare it with LTSC. It's much better
18:12:13 <mynacol[m]> Today I learned Edge contacts Microsoft with every web page you visit, including full path and parameters. That's part of their SmartScreen feature, which is  enabled by default.
18:12:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> it does makes sense to ping a server frequently, for example, a fast messaging app
18:12:51 <mynacol[m]> German source: https://www.kuketz-blog.de/microsoft-edge-datensendeverhalten-desktop-version-browser-check-teil4/
18:13:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> <check to see new messages>
18:13:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> mynacol of course SmartScreen does that
18:13:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> similar to Google's Enhanced Protection feature
18:13:49 <TheLoneWanderer[> They could strip the paths
18:14:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> tbh, if i was a dev of smartscreen, i would do the same :P
18:14:41 <mynacol[m]> Firefox, Brave and I believe Chrome as well do the same checks, but with an offline database that gets updated every hour or so. Same benefits - much better privacy
18:14:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> it makes more sense that way
18:15:13 <TheLoneWanderer[> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> it does makes sense to p"> IIRC those weren't windows updates
18:15:29 <TheLoneWanderer[> <mynacol[m] "Firefox, Brave and I believe Chr"> Wait till you find out about the new tab page
18:15:47 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> mynacol Google's Enhanced Protection does the same active measures
18:16:13 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> anyway, it's up to your threat model at the end of the day
18:16:18 <mynacol[m]> Just throwing the most upsetting fact in the telemetry discussion. I don't use Edge.
18:16:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if you don't trust Microsoft, you shouldn't be using Windows at all
18:17:06 <mynacol[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> if you don't trust Micro"> I don't
18:17:18 <tharg[m]1> <just-a-bugger[m] "Do you have any accessibility se"> Good question! I have to admit, after looking at the application permissions and in some apps, that I cannot see any relevant permissions to check. All prompts welcome!
18:17:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> or, at the very least, you shouldn't give it any information that you don't want to give to your potential attacker
18:17:58 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if you don't trust Google, you shouldn't use Pixel phones
18:18:07 <mynacol[m]> And btw. Edge is also available for Mac, Android, iOS...
18:19:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> by using a pixel phone, you must trust Google, and TSMC
18:20:00 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you must trust the manufacturer
18:20:22 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> there is literally no way of avoiding that, unless you become a manufacturer
18:20:46 <mynacol[m]> @Hulk What's your point? I know that already
18:22:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> (i'm mostly talking to thelonewanderer tbh)
18:23:04 <mynacol[m]> And backdooring hardware or firmware is another thing than implementing a security feature in a privacy-destroying way in a internet-connected software
18:23:12 <mynacol[m]> (Sorry)

18:51:12 <ryan[m]1> what type of things are recommended to do in the secondary user profiles? I noticed they dont behave exactly as the owner, like for example notifications for element work in the owner but not in a secondary
18:51:31 <ryan[m]1> and is it recommended to end each secondary user session when not in use?
18:51:52 <akc3n[m]> Ya they do. I'm using element in secondary and it works perfectly fine for notifications.

18:55:10 <ryan[m]1> i'm asking about real world use cases, what do people do
18:55:40 <ryan[m]1> i know how to look up the specs
18:55:50 <ryan[m]1> this is OT
18:55:58 <akc3n[m]> And I told you
18:56:11 <akc3n[m]> Notifications work for element in secondary.
18:56:23 <ryan[m]1> i'm telling you mine dont
18:56:39 <akc3n[m]> I know that. That's what you said.
18:56:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <M‚Äã0ctezuma> You can use the other profile for every task you like to. For example one Profile dor watching porn
18:57:07 <akc3n[m]> So you must have messed around with some settings and messed stuff up.
18:57:21 <ryan[m]1> haven't
18:57:31 <ryan[m]1> or there's, wait for it

18:58:08 <ryan[m]1> ill try on a new new secondary though
18:59:06 <akc3n[m]> Or you can play around with the app notification settings and the system notification settings for that app.
18:59:06 <akc3n[m]> Why would you be the only one with a "BUG".

21:15:45 <djentosaurus[m]> Is it a good idea to install whatsapp on my user profile?
21:16:13 <jpds> djentosaurus[m]: Yes, if you want to talk to people on whatsapp
21:16:44 <djentosaurus[m]> Oke, so I don't need a seperate profile for social media then?
21:22:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> alex-resist: are there any good in-depth guides for privacy?
21:22:29 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> It's up to you
21:24:16 <alex-resist> The problem is that everyone has different requirements
21:25:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> Sure, but a good guide might talk about threat models.
21:25:40 <alex-resist> There are 3 approaches that are clearly wrong: 1) use tool A + B, then you're fine! 2) do whatever you want, it doesn't matter anyway 3) do nothing, the agencies are everywhere, stay away and hide
21:27:17 <alex-resist> There are some very good books on security engineering, but privacy is much more subjective, I'm afraid
21:29:44 <alex-resist> Threat modeling is essentially just a number of questions you have to ask yourself. What do I want to protect? What adversaries do I have? What adversaries do I not have? How much am I willing to spend? How much are my adversaries willing to spend?
21:30:17 <alex-resist> Once you understand that threat modeling is a process where you think about costs, it becomes much easier
21:32:47 <alex-resist> GrapheneOS for example is not about creating an invincible phone. It is about raising the costs for an attacker so that the attack doesn't make sense anymore
21:33:47 <ypm[m]> sorry to derail but did google change something regarding their store? aurora can't find certain apps anymore like signal. can anyone else confirm or is it just me
21:34:33 <hypokeimenon[m]> makes sense
21:34:37 <missfire[m]> I can find signal
21:35:01 <rathantara[m]> why use signal?
21:35:06 <ypm[m]> <missfire[m] "I can find signal"> using aurora store? interesting
21:35:12 <ypm[m]> ty
21:35:20 <missfire[m]> <ypm[m] "using aurora store? interesting"> yes
21:35:25 <rathantara[m]> there is a signal variant better
21:35:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> don't say session
21:35:57 <rathantara[m]> no man
21:35:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <C‚ÄãrowmacMcCarthy> Molly is not "better", it only has some advantages
21:36:05 <rathantara[m]> session is another thing
21:36:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> <alex-resist "There are some very good books o"> are there at least some prominent privacy researchers?
21:36:22 <rathantara[m]> I mean a better variant of signal
21:36:35 <missfire[m]> <rathantara[m] "why use signal?"> secure and comfortable,
21:36:48 <alex-resist> hypokeimenon check out " Security Engineering" by Ross Anderson, it will get you quite far
21:37:01 <hypokeimenon[m]> <rathantara[m] "I mean a better variant of signa"> There is no better variant?
21:37:03 <alex-resist> I don't really know if "privacy research" as such exists
21:37:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <C‚ÄãrowmacMcCarthy> Probably thinking of Molly
21:37:23 <surveillexxxx[m]> I wish signal had hackerman hacking NSA 2021 blackhoodie feel so that I could feel like big hackerman
21:37:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "There is no better variant?"> Voice/Video Calls, Group Messaging and an easy UX in an app well scrutinised by security researchers and cryptographers?
21:37:58 <akc3n> surveillexxxx[m], huh?
21:38:21 <surveillexxxx[m]> <akc3n "surveillexxxx, huh?"> its nothing im just fucking around
21:38:38 <hypokeimenon[m]> alex-resist: many thanks, I'll check it out
21:39:21 <surveillexxxx[m]> a simple image that is 1MB can DOS a TOR user on matrix
21:39:38 <surveillexxxx[m]> hope they patch it bc it just happened to me :/
21:40:03 <alex-resist> hypokeimenon it's called the $10.000 book because when you read and understood it, you can rightfully demand a pay raise
21:46:23 <jpds> hypokeimenon[m]: conversations.im does all those things + tor
21:46:33 <akc3n> alex-resist, thinkpad eh! nice! love those x230's. Whats your hardware specs on it?
21:47:45 <alex-resist> akc3n just the normal i5-3320 CPU, 16 GB RAM, 500GB SSD, Skulls (Coreboot + me_cleaner + SeaBIOS), Atheros AR9462 WiFi
21:48:57 <alex-resist> It's not the fastest laptop in existence but it's a quality workhorse. Never fails me
21:50:19 <alex-resist> That configuration is also compatible with Debian main, doesn't need any non-free stuff if that matters to you
21:52:17 <alex-resist> Oh also you can still get new batteries, the best ones last up to 12 hours if you don't do much
21:53:06 <vdh7[m]> I just did the EFF fingerprinting test with vanadium + adguard DNS + my VPN and it shows my fingerprint to be unique
21:53:40 <alex-resist> The EFF fingerprinting tool is quite lacking
21:53:45 <vdh7[m]> I'm confused, I thought using vanadium would enable me to blend in with all those chrome users?
21:53:52 <rathantara[m]> If you must use #Signal then Molly looks like a better way to do it without needing Google Play.
21:53:53 <vdh7[m]> is there a better tool to test?
21:54:03 <rathantara[m]> https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android
21:54:11 <alex-resist> vdh7 not that I know of, the concept is flawed
21:54:18 <jpds> rathantara[m]: Siganl doesn't need google play
21:54:52 <alex-resist> EFF's tool is essentially made to make Tor Browser users feel better about its anonymity properties and to push EFF's agenda
21:55:25 <rathantara[m]> > Back in 2018, Signal allowed the user to set a passphrase to secure the local message database. But this option was removed with the introduction of file-based encryption on Android. Molly brings it back again with additional security features.

21:57:10 <akc3n> alex-resist, wow sweet setup. Did you rebuild the coreboot yourself?
21:57:21 <GhostSplinterSix> Tor + Orbot is my baby.
21:57:42 <alex-resist> akc3n no, Skulls comes precompiled. I have built Coreboot for other targets though, it's not so difficult
21:58:04 <akc3n> Have you ever done one for a t430?
21:58:47 <alex-resist> akc3n the T430 is now also supported by Skulls, that should make that part very easy. The annoying part is disassembling the entire machine
21:59:06 <rathantara[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "Tor + Orbot is my baby."> with bridges
21:59:15 <alex-resist> https://github.com/merge/skulls/blob/master/t430/README.md
22:00:08 <alex-resist> T4xx Thinkpads are among the most annoying devices to flash
22:00:50 <sphinx[m]> vdh7: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/ciizae/comment/ev6m2ot
22:01:37 <sphinx[m]> vdh7: the FAQ mentioning Adguard DNS is an example, not a suggestion / recommendation, btw
22:01:58 <GhostSplinterSix> What laptop or desktop would y'all recommend if someone wanted to run Qubes + Whonix? I know there's a compatibility list on Qubes' website, but I thought I'd ask others.
22:03:41 <alex-resist> GhostSplinterSix the classic answer is Thinkpad X230, because of it's compatibility with Skulls/Heads and other features. For a smoother experience, a more recent Thinkpad might be in order, for example a T450s with 20 GB of memory and a fullHD display
22:04:25 <alex-resist> But there absolutely is no ideal machine for Qubes
22:05:04 <jpds> GhostSplinterSix: I have Qubes working on an Intel NUC
22:05:24 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah. I was under that assumption but thought I'd ask what others would recommend.
22:07:18 <alex-resist> I wonder if Qubes actually becomes fast at some point (like with 16 cores and lots of memory) or if it's always lagging
22:12:15 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm a crazy enough person to slap ridiculous hardware together if it means Qubes will run smoothly.
22:13:41 <vdh7[m]> <sphinx[m] "vdh7: https://www.reddit.com/r/G"> thanks I read the post, answers some of my questions regarding the eff test
22:16:28 <alex-resist> GhostSplinterSix exactly - if that doesn't work, i.e. Qubes is never fast on any machine, you might as well get an older Thinkpad and save some money
22:16:58 <alex-resist> Also Qubes + KDE is underrated (albeit no longer the official desktop)
