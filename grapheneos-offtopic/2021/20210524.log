20:02:50 <strcat> This room will continue to the exist for the time being but we're fully migrating to Matrix without a bridge to freenode: #grapheneos:grapheneos.org #grapheneos-offtopic:grapheneos.org.
20:02:52 <strcat> We reserved #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat but it won't be bridged the same way. We'll make a bridge via a leaner bot with a single user on both sides.
20:02:54 <strcat> After you move to the new Matrix rooms you can leave these ones. There will be nothing other than spam here.
