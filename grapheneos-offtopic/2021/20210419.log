00:52:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <TheLynx "Railgun_Lover: No, they dont wor"> Yeah not sure
02:30:34 <chile09[m]> Is pinephone more secure than a grapheneOS device?
02:33:58 <Wonderfall[m]> <chile09[m] "Is pinephone more secure than a "> No, read this: https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html
02:35:28 <GhostSplinterSix> <chile09[m] "Is pinephone more secure than a "> Not really. The Pinephone has physical killswitches but you have to take the back of the phone off to access them. Their location seems like an after thought when they designed the phone.
02:36:26 <chile09[m]> What about the librem 5
02:36:39 <chile09[m]> That has switches on the side
02:36:44 <mefistofeles> madaidans articles are always so off and full of hate
02:36:44 <mefistofeles> xD
02:39:22 <GhostSplinterSix> <chile09[m] "What about the librem 5 "> Good luck getting your hands on one. The developers are very much behind in shipping them due to getting their hands on the hardware to assemble them. They are still trying to fulfill pre-orders.
02:41:24 <GhostSplinterSix> https://puri.sm/posts/librem-5-news-summary-march-2021/
02:42:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> chile09: Purism's Librem and Pine's Pinephone are not security-focused projects. They are Free Software Foundation targeting smartphone projects.
02:44:08 <mefistofeles> hypokeimenon[m]: not really that related to FSF, but yeah, they are not security oriented
02:45:33 <mefistofeles> I guess there could eventually be security-oriented linux distros for them, but it has not reached that point
02:47:58 <GhostSplinterSix> <hypokeimenon[m] "chile09: Purism's Librem and Pin"> False. The Librem 5 aimed not only to run purely on the¬†free software provided in PureOS, but to "[focus] on security by design and privacy protection by default".
02:50:48 <GhostSplinterSix> The only association between the Librem 5 and FSF is that the phone is the only smartphone recommended by them.
02:51:30 <skwisgaar[m]> GhostSplinterSix: marketing is not evidence of security
02:51:43 <mefistofeles> lack of evidence is also not evidence of absence
02:52:32 <hypokeimenon[m]> Last couple of comments on this:
02:52:32 <hypokeimenon[m]> So I made a mistake earlier anyway, because Pine64 do **not** target FSF certification.
02:52:37 <skwisgaar[m]> mefistofeles: so numerous experts going into technical detail about the security properties of a device doesn‚Äôt count as evidence?
02:52:53 <skwisgaar[m]> Not sure how much better you can do than that
02:53:37 <GhostSplinterSix> I mean...have you not seen their website and/or seen video reviews of the phone? Privacy and security are always among the good things about it..
02:53:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> To GhostSplinterSix  https://puri.sm/learn/freedom-roadmap/
02:54:29 <GhostSplinterSix> <hypokeimenon[m] "To GhostSplinterSix  https://pur"> Yes...I'm aware. That's why I said that the Librem 5 is the only smartphone recommended by the FSF.
02:55:47 <mefistofeles> I hope we'll get better linux phone so we can ditch android
02:56:51 <GhostSplinterSix> <mefistofeles "I hope we'll get better linux ph"> They are a work in progress can be done.
02:57:13 <GhostSplinterSix> but can be done.*
02:57:22 <mefistofeles> ture
02:57:26 <mefistofeles> true
02:58:51 <skwisgaar[m]> GhostSplinterSix: people assume the phone is secure because of disingenuous marketing, UI frills, and because it‚Äôs open source. There is no technical analysis behind that or opinions of actual security experts. Just random reviewers/journalists/users.
02:59:04 <GhostSplinterSix> The developers are small companies compared to Apple, Samsung, etc and so getting their hands on hardware isn't as easy. That's one of the dilemmas Purism is currently facing.
02:59:21 <hypokeimenon[m]> Anyway, last thing that needs to be said is that strcpy has already discussed Purism's misleading claims on security many times. You can find those in all the usual places. I did have a look at their marketing for the Librem 5 GhostSplinterSix  and you are right that they say vague things like "layered security protection" and "separates CPU from cellular baseband".
02:59:22 <skwisgaar[m]> Either way this has been discussed to death in here so I‚Äôd rather not continue
02:59:32 <GhostSplinterSix> <skwisgaar[m] "GhostSplinterSix: people assume "> I'd do more research, my friend.
03:00:07 <skwisgaar[m]> GhostSplinterSix: funny I would say the same to you :P
03:00:23 <skwisgaar[m]> Like I said agree to disagree I‚Äôm not gonna keep talking about this
03:00:43 <GhostSplinterSix> I have. üëçüèª
03:01:14 <mefistofeles> https://puri.sm/security/ there are some neat things indeed
03:03:02 <chile09[m]> Is it even technically possible to have a baseband kill switch either physical or in software?
03:03:51 <chile09[m]> Is it even possible to interface with the cell modem driver?
03:04:10 <GhostSplinterSix> If getting my hands on one was much easier, I'd buy one to get my own opinion of the device but I'm not about to drop that much money on it only to wait 5+ months to receive it.
03:04:40 <chile09[m]> Its the all winner chip?
03:05:30 <mefistofeles> I do have a PinePhone, it's nice, but of course... still lacks a lot, as expected
03:06:43 <Wonderfall[m]> Having ¬´¬†better Linux phones¬†¬ª doesn‚Äôt change the fact GNU/Linux distributions don‚Äôt have a proper security model like Android does. They have much work to do.
03:09:01 <GhostSplinterSix> <mefistofeles "I do have a PinePhone, it's nice"> I'm interested in the PineTime.
03:09:41 <TheJollyRoger> skwisgaar[m]: heh, you've said it!
03:13:23 <entry1> This may have been mentioned before. Has anyone noticed the lack of apps on the Aurora Store? Seems like they've removed a lot
03:13:45 <TheJollyRoger> entry1: Aurora had some problems yesterday, don't know if they're back up at full capacity yet.
03:15:02 <entry1> TheJollyRoger gotcha. Yeah it is missing a ton at the moment, thanks for the info.
03:15:43 <TheJollyRoger> Hope they're back online soon!
03:16:40 <mefistofeles> hace grapheneOS been audited in terms of security by independent parties?
03:16:44 <mefistofeles> *have
03:17:16 <entry1> There aren't any alternatives to getting apps off the Google Playstore then in the meantime aside from trying to search for individual apks
03:17:16 <louipc> no formal audits as far as i know, but all the code is available
03:17:19 <chile09[m]> How is GrapheneOS better than replicant?
03:17:29 <TheJollyRoger> mefistofeles: GrapheneOS is always available to be audited by independent parties.
03:18:11 <mefistofeles> TheJollyRoger: sure, I can see that, but I'm guessing no one has?
03:18:16 <mefistofeles> like formally
03:18:16 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: Replicant uses LineageOS as an upstream provider on handsets that do not enforce signature validation. Replicant aims to be permissive to allow the user and software run by the user, while GrapheneOS aims to be secure.
03:18:52 <TheJollyRoger> mefistofeles: Not that I know of.
03:19:02 <mefistofeles> ok
03:19:21 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: you can aim to be permissive, or you can be secure, but they exist at opposite ends of a spectrum; it's not possible to have both.
03:19:41 <TheJollyRoger> Replicant and GrapheneOS are extremely different projects, with extremely different goals.
03:19:46 <GhostSplinterSix> <chile09[m] "How is GrapheneOS better than re"> https://redmine.replicant.us/boards/39/topics/15440
03:22:07 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to device security: if don't want to trust your device, the best I can give you is, pick up a bucket, go to the beach, scoop up sand and cast your own CPUs.
03:22:16 <TheJollyRoger> There is no such thing as an open ARM chip.
03:23:39 <mefistofeles> true, but it also isn't an all-or-nothing kind of thing... as they accurately say in that replicant link
03:23:58 <mefistofeles> depends on the actual threat model... this is also a nice post comparing many of the alternatives there exist https://www.kulesz.me/post/110-smartphones/
03:25:12 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to firmware on GrapheneOS, firmware sources are available from Qualcomm and Google if you ask nicely. They are signed and validated, but they are initialized and loaded by the host.
03:26:05 <TheJollyRoger> Pixels fully isolate the modem and peripherals via SMMU; most devices on Replicant use a USB-like interface to communicate with the radios. If anyone wants to trust USB for device isolation, I have a BadUSB I can lend you.
03:26:38 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm speaking figuratively, but you get the point)
03:27:59 <TheJollyRoger> Whether or not software is released under a specific license is orthogonal or not as to whether it's secure. GrapheneOS' source code is open and available for review. I'm waiting for Linus' law of there being "lots of eyes" to kick in, the same as I waited for the same for OpenSSL.
03:29:56 <TheJollyRoger> Where were the "lots of eyes" for OpenSSL on Debian back in '06 when someone commented out one innocuous line and broke random number generation for minting cryptographic keys? Where were the "lots of eyes" that should have caught an entirely useless antifeature that was neglected for years and allowed someone to send malformed queries to the server that would leak privileged host
03:29:58 <TheJollyRoger> memory?
03:31:38 <mefistofeles> well, they were exactly there
03:31:49 <mefistofeles> should've been before? Sure, but yeah, that's not how the world works
03:32:05 <mefistofeles> it's not linear, at all
03:32:35 <TheJollyRoger> In Debian's case it took more than two years for people to realize "why are our keys not random?"
03:33:31 <mefistofeles> sure, not like this has not happened to others (open or not)
03:33:58 <TheJollyRoger> Of course; what I'm saying is, open source doesn't magically mean it's going to be more secure.
03:34:06 <mefistofeles> true
03:34:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Of course; what I'm saying is, o"> I don't see why you should be inclined to trust software that follows good security practices and standards but limits to blackbox auditing over software that follows good security practices and standards but allows white box auditing.
03:35:34 <somenerd[m]> That‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs trying to say, the problem is when open source software doesn‚Äôt follow good security practices
03:35:54 <TheJollyRoger> hypokeimenon[m]: Realistically, a line has to be drawn somewhere. We can get sources for the firmware for the Pixels. But I'm not about to go about delidding my CPUs. There is no limit to how deep the rabbit hole can go.
03:36:19 <TheJollyRoger> And sooner or later, unless you want to go to the beach, pick up a bucket of sand, and cast your own CPUs, you NEED to trust someone.
03:36:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> That's fair. My issue is that there is a growing sentiment that "open-source does not equal secure" as Schneier put it.
03:37:08 <somenerd[m]> >And sooner or later, unless you want to go to the beach, pick up a bucket of sand, and cast your own CPUs, you NEED to trust someone.
03:37:08 <somenerd[m]> And then lose compatibility with everything
03:37:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> I think it is besides the point really. Software development as a rule should endeavour to produce code that is easier to trust.
03:38:03 <somenerd[m]> >That's fair. My issue is that there is a growing sentiment that "open-source does not equal secure" as Schneier put it.
03:38:04 <somenerd[m]> It‚Äôs more like open source is good, but needs to be paired with a focus on security.
03:38:10 <TheJollyRoger> This, exactly!
03:38:33 <TheJollyRoger> Software development should indeed endeavour to produce good code... but we have *so damn much of it* and developer time is a limited resource.
03:39:00 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS, which doesn‚Äôt see open source as a solution to everything, open sources almost every part that they can
03:39:39 <somenerd[m]> Even distrusted parts, like the update server code
03:39:41 <hypokeimenon[m]> I would hesitate to agree with that claim.
03:40:07 <somenerd[m]> How so?
03:41:17 <somenerd[m]> I‚Äôd like to hear your point of view
03:41:28 <louipc> lol i want to get beach sand cpus
03:42:53 <hypokeimenon[m]> I recall strcpy saying open-source code was inherently easier to harden, which is pretty central to Graphene OS as a project, but I can't remember where I saw it.
03:44:07 <somenerd[m]> I don‚Äôt think that all parts really need to be hardened
03:44:29 <somenerd[m]> Mostly talking about the server code, the OS itself probably benefits from extra hardening from others
03:48:34 <somenerd[m]> >I recall strcpy saying open-source code was inherently easier to harden, which is pretty central to Graphene OS as a project, but I can't remember where I saw it.
03:48:34 <somenerd[m]> Was it on the main channel?
03:56:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> Maybe. I will try and remember.
04:01:41 <hypokeimenon[m]> somenerd: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200513#c3868220
04:05:13 <somenerd[m]> Yeah, I believe that‚Äôs just the advantage of building from source though, most GrapheneOS users don‚Äôt build from source though afaik
04:05:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I'd rather leave that to someone who knows more about security than I do!
04:06:37 <somenerd[m]> My point was mostly about the server code (attestation and update servers, for example)
04:06:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> That's fair
04:07:16 <hypokeimenon[m]> Anyway I agree with the main point that open-source is not magic
05:30:46 <Cliff[m]> Could the reason for signal apk wich i downloaded from their website, not auto updating be because i have aurora store installed?
06:28:28 <whiskey0111[m]> Nope
06:32:08 <strcat[m]> Cliff: only if you installed an update from Aurora so you replaced with website apk with the Play Store version
06:32:21 <strcat[m]> the only difference between them is whether it has the self-updating code enabled
06:41:57 <Heuristik[m]> <strcat[m] "the only difference between them"> So the play Store version doesn't necessarily need Google Services either?
06:42:37 <strcat[m]> neither needs it
06:42:45 <strcat[m]> only difference is the self-updater
06:43:33 <Heuristik[m]> thanks

A developer preview was released immediately, with two additional ones planned the following two months. After that, four monthly beta releases are planned, beginning in May, the last one of them reaching platform stability in August, and general availability coming shortly after

17:37:54 <skwisgaar[m]> Apple maps is better than anything that isn‚Äôt google maps or waze. And it takes two seconds to change search engine.
17:38:24 <skwisgaar[m]> Either way idk why people are so obsessed with running away from google but iphone is a good option
17:43:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <l‚Äãp4678> If an app has 1 tracker , Google firebase analytics, is it risky or will be ok to use in a user profile that has no revealing info
17:44:53 <covid-1984[m]> any idea why the phone app doesn't respect system-wide dark mode?
17:45:26 <lain[m]1> because you haven't educated it enough
17:45:46 <squidward_snowde> Cause it‚Äôs a conspiracy
17:45:47 <lynn_stephenson[> <skwisgaar[m] "Either way idk why people are so"> Because Google is an advertising company, and they don't want to be a part of it.
17:46:44 <lynn_stephenson[> Their literal job is to make money off of you.
17:50:23 <nscnt[m]> covid-1984: Because there is currently no support that it acts on the system (dark) theme
17:50:40 <covid-1984[m]> nscnt: tnx good to know... not just my config
17:51:18 <skwisgaar[m]> lynn_stephenson: What I should have said is that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rational to avoid google like they are some kind of plague. I‚Äôm all for reducing usage of google services (I do that as much as I can), but I still recognize that there is a time/place for what they provide.
17:52:31 <skwisgaar[m]> On top of that, they are going to secure your data better than other companies, give you more clear cut options to opt out of data collection, etc.
17:53:05 <skwisgaar[m]> I don‚Äôt like them, but I am just as concerned if not more concerned of small companies with less oversight
17:55:07 * jf2021[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nPamycDolPxhXfhlGzaysuPV/message.txt >
17:56:35 <lynn_stephenson[> <skwisgaar[m] "On top of that, they are going t"> I've seen evidence that suggests that Google still sells your data after opting out.
17:57:54 <skwisgaar[m]> lynn_stephenson: if that‚Äôs the case I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked. I have some faith in them, but not a whole lot.
17:58:57 <skwisgaar[m]> However, I was under the impression that google is only interested in collecting data, rather than selling it.
18:01:06 <lynn_stephenson[> Also, people should be scared of Google, and other large corporations that have massive control (Amazon, too), especially of the flow of information (e.g: Twitter, Facebook).
18:03:02 <lynn_stephenson[> They deem what is politically correct, for rather their own agenda. People aren't allowed to ask questions anymore.
18:04:08 <skwisgaar[m]> lynn_stephenson: yep that is a huge problem.
18:04:31 <lynn_stephenson[> <skwisgaar[m] "However, I was under the impress"> Google is also part of PRISM, which is a _huge_ privacy implication.
18:05:03 <strcat[m]> every US company is 'part of' PRISM and really any company with a business presence there
18:05:16 <strcat[m]> imagining it to be a short list is a misinterpretation of the program
18:06:19 <lynn_stephenson[> <strcat[m] "imagining it to be a short list "> Oh, I'm aware.
18:06:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> If you want to get mad at someone for PRISM, get mad the NSA, not the companies which have no choice in the matter.
18:07:15 <lynn_stephenson[> I'm not mad at the companies, lol
18:07:54 <lynn_stephenson[> I know about subpoenas, and what my government does to the companies here.
18:08:27 <lynn_stephenson[> It all started with 9/11, and terrorism prevention.

18:19:31 <troypatrick[m]> I'm on pixel 4A
18:19:34 <troypatrick[m]> Which is best?
18:25:56 <covid-1984[m]> I chose the first, but ya it isn't totally clear
18:25:59 <covid-1984[m]> Had no problems so far
18:26:05 <jpds> troypatrick[m]: The top one as it says so
18:49:51 <missfire[m]> <dazinism "Or you can maybe enable 'just th"> yeah, good idea, I'm just coming from stock and always used it, maybe there is no need now.
18:50:54 <missfire[m]> it used something like 30% of the battery
18:52:05 <Telegram-Bridge> <g‚Äãochoingles> Gotta love that hole in the screen for the G Pixel camera.
18:52:20 <missfire[m]> yeah it's annoying
18:52:44 <Telegram-Bridge> <g‚Äãochoingles> missfire[m]: It's actually pretty cool.
18:52:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <g‚Äãochoingles> At least for me.
18:53:07 <missfire[m]> oh, I thought you were cynical
18:54:41 <missfire[m]> the ideal for me would be pop-up camera
18:58:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <l‚Äãp4678> If an app has 1 tracker , Google firebase analytics, is it risky or will be ok to use in a user profile that has no revealing info
19:01:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "Either way idk why people are so"> Is this facetious?
19:01:59 <strcat[m]> every app is sandboxed
19:02:02 <strcat[m]> whether or not you use user profiles
19:02:20 <strcat[m]> and apps have the same capabilities whether or not some third party scanner considers one of their libraries to be a 'tracker'
19:02:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <l‚Äãp4678> Oh ok, I need to let this new way of the phone sink in
19:03:02 <strcat[m]> you're just misleading yourself using apps with those vague and poorly justified classifications of libraries
19:22:19 <billinmtl[m]> I'm still getting my head around trackers vs libraries.  How would an individual mislead themselves using apps with them ?
19:50:11 <covid-1984[m]> Any tips on keeping WhatsApp Web active when the phone is locked? It loses connection soon after phone screen is off.
19:53:09 <skwisgaar[m]> bill.in.mtl: I think he‚Äôs saying to avoid using apps/services which classify the privacy of an app by looking at included libraries. Not that you shouldn‚Äôt use apps containing libraries.
19:53:15 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <covid-1984[m] "Any tips on keeping WhatsApp Web"> Is that a WhatsApp issue or a graphene issue?
19:53:26 <covid-1984[m]> Figured it would be ok to ask on off topic
19:53:31 <covid-1984[m]> Not a graphene issue
19:53:41 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
19:53:46 <covid-1984[m]> But I only saw a thread on it for OnePlus
19:53:54 <covid-1984[m]> Which makes me think it might be a non-standard ROMs issue
19:53:55 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> Just use WhatsApp app in a Different user profile
19:54:15 <covid-1984[m]> WhatsApp web is on your desktop browser
19:54:25 <covid-1984[m]> It is how you can use WhatsApp on the computer
19:54:34 <covid-1984[m]> But it sucks because it needs the smartphone app running somewhere
19:54:36 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <covid-1984[m] "WhatsApp web is on your desktop "> I know, I am suggesting using the app in a separate user profile
19:54:45 <covid-1984[m]> ok
19:55:07 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> I assume you use WhatsApp web because you don't want the app on your phone
19:55:27 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> * I assume you use WhatsApp web because you don't want the app on your phone covid-1984
19:56:02 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> So instead just install it on a separate user profile, and that effectively separates it from the rest of your data
19:56:11 <covid-1984[m]> Crowmac McCarthy: right... and no choice. you have to have the app on a phone. it isn't an alternative, just an extender
19:56:28 <billinmtl[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "bill.in.mtl: I think he‚Äôs saying"> Okay, granted my idea/understanding of trackers was incorrect once I came here.  Would it be correct to say the libraries might be part of the app, but not necessarily used ?
19:56:32 <covid-1984[m]> Just means whatsapp needs to stay awake
19:58:38 <skwisgaar[m]> bill.in.mtl: yeah they may be included with the app but you don‚Äôt know if/how they are used. To add to that, an app with no libraries could still track you.
20:00:13 <billinmtl[m]> Right, understand that as well.  So even if an app does somehow track you - the sanboxing talked about limits what can be tracked, right ?
20:01:52 <skwisgaar[m]> bill.in.mtl: I can‚Äôt speak as much about the security particulars (don‚Äôt want to mislead you), but certainly the security provided by grapheneos reduces what an app is able to learn about you/your device.
20:02:00 <m1tr4[m]> Does whatapp work flawless on Graphene or does it need Gapps?
20:02:15 <missfire[m]> it doesn't
20:02:21 <missfire[m]>  * it doesn't need gapps
20:03:55 <billinmtl[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "bill.in.mtl: I can‚Äôt speak as mu"> No, no - that's fine, not looking for a golden answer.  Just interesting that after a few months here and hours of reading and following - some of these foreign concepts to me are starting to sink in - thanks
20:04:28 <m1tr4[m]> I wish Graphene was available on the FairPhones series
20:06:02 <skwisgaar[m]> bill.in.mtl: sure glad to help :) grapheneos definitely requires (at least for me) some time to wrap your head around.
20:07:38 <skwisgaar[m]> m1tr4: unfortunately that device doesn‚Äôt meet the security requirements of graphene (in reality it‚Äôs not even close). If you want to search the matrix room or the IRC logbot, those devices have already been discussed in detail.
20:10:12 <m1tr4[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "m1tr4: unfortunately that device"> Yes I know. I read the documentation. Just stating a wish in case Google stops producing (or starts backdooring) Pixels in the future.
20:12:03 <strcat[m]> we wouldn't support an insecure device
20:12:15 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
20:12:30 <strcat[m]> support for those devices is definitely not happening, there are much less bad choices than those
20:14:30 <m1tr4[m]> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/faq#devic"> You guys have a great mentality, cheers to you and the devs! I will hopefully own a Pixel soon and install GrapheneOS.
20:39:39 <covid-1984[m]> <m1tr4[m] "Yes I know. I read the documenta"> I wonder if a phone exists today that an independent manufacturer could buy en masse and just open them up, add a Titan M (or similar), and meet the Pixel's security standard... Or if there's more to it.
20:40:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that's not how it works
20:40:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> idk how it works, but I know that it's not "that simple"
20:52:21 <covid-1984[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> idk how it works, but I "> Ya not saying it would be a simple thing... But that is way way easier than building your own from scratch like frame.work
20:57:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <g‚Äãochoingles> Apps may be sandboxed, but if you want untrusted apps to only see the files you want them to see (if they have hard-permissions for example), multiple profiles are the way to go.
21:02:55 <blakkhakis[m]> Hey I tried to take photos with the standard camera that come with the OS and realized they don't save to my gallery.  Do I have to download a FOSS camera or can I fix this?
21:03:39 <sign4l[m]> Go to f-droid store and download Open Camera App
21:04:04 <sign4l[m]> Look for a setup how to ...
21:04:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> sounds like you broke some permissions
21:05:44 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> blakkhakis[m]: did you revoke any permissions to the default camera app and/or gallery?
21:06:00 <chris42[m]> Is there a preference on donations? Like better in one go or monthly support?
21:08:04 <blakkhakis[m]> No I haven't mess with any permissions although I just tried to take a picture I tapped on it and there was an icon for the galley on the top right and it saved the photo. I think it I might have just fixed it lmao
21:09:41 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah, don't ever press the "edit" button. The gallery app is really really bad at editing photos and screenshots
21:11:12 <jpds> chris42[m]: Whatever works best for you, I guess
21:19:22 <covid-1984[m]> <sign4l[m] "Go to f-droid store and download"> Is that the top FOSS camera that takes advantage of pixel HW?
