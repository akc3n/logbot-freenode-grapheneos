00:01:27 <Cliff[m]> Thatcher does using that blocklist make your browsing more identifiable?
00:06:21 <Thatcher[m]> Yes
00:06:24 <Wonderfall[m]> It does, it's still part of "enumerating badness" practice. The thing is, if you do it at a DNS (handled by VPN) lvl, you blend in other people who have that option enabled
00:06:24 <Wonderfall[m]> Thus you can blend in with the relative confort gain of having that blocklist, if it gives you peace of mind
00:06:46 <Wonderfall[m]> To my knowledge VPNs like IVPN have that
00:07:08 <Wonderfall[m]> However I'm not sure if enough people are using that feature
00:07:18 <Wonderfall[m]>  * However I'm not sure if enough people are using that feature to make any difference
00:07:22 <Thatcher[m]> Using StevenBlack's list is less identifiable than using a bunch of different blocklists
00:07:38 <Wonderfall[m]> It's still a blocklist, though
00:08:09 <Wonderfall[m]> I'm using it myself, just beware it's not as good as it seems
00:08:56 <Thatcher[m]> I know it's not as good as it seems. But I need something, and this list is a popular list
00:09:44 <Wonderfall[m]> The list has not that of a great importance, but rather the fact other people are using the same VPN/DNS combo with that blocklist
00:10:25 <Thatcher[m]> I'm not going to allow ads to ruin my browsing experience just so i can blend in better.
00:10:47 <Thatcher[m]> Completely ruin*
00:10:47 <Wonderfall[m]> Never said that. Like I said, I do that myself with IVPN.
00:11:36 <Wonderfall[m]> But DNS-level blocking is not fine-grained at all, it's very lacking at what it does
00:11:36 <Wonderfall[m]> You're vulnerably to other forms of tracking (first-party tracking, scripts, etc.)
00:11:57 <Wonderfall[m]> I don't have a perfect solution for both blending in and blocking them, that said
00:12:00 <Thatcher[m]> Got a better solution?
00:12:06 <Wonderfall[m]> Like I said
00:12:21 <Thatcher[m]> I typed that as you posted
00:12:30 <Wonderfall[m]> Well it happens, no worries
00:13:16 <Wonderfall[m]> It's much better than using a VPN + a 3rd-party DNS, so that's a nice progress already
00:13:46 <Wonderfall[m]> And the lack of fine-grained blocking applies to NextDNS as well
00:14:37 <Wonderfall[m]> They still provide a very neat service, but it belongs to an old privacy paradigm where blocking all the bad is enough, if possible at all
00:14:40 <Thatcher[m]> Was only using Nextdns before without vpn. I'm on ivpn like you said, using that list
00:15:54 <Wonderfall[m]> Yeah I do like IVPN too. Not going to recommend them since everyone has their own needs, but they have a very reactive support. Like we discussed about WDAG+VPN and they were very open about potential improvements
00:16:49 <Wonderfall[m]> Mullvad will also provided DNS-blocking, in fact they already did set up them, just not integrated in their clients
00:17:19 <Thatcher[m]> It was already very difficult for me to ditch custom blocklists with Nextdns. There's gotta be at least a few people out there with default Chrome settings and ivpn with trackerblock on
00:17:32 <Wonderfall[m]> Count on me for that
00:17:57 <Thatcher[m]> I can assure that with the nextdns settings i had, it made me very unique
00:18:39 <Wonderfall[m]> Oh for sure.
00:18:48 <Wonderfall[m]> The simpler the better
00:36:54 <akc3n[m]> <Thatcher[m] "It was already very difficult fo"> Ivpn's anti-tracker hardcore mode is neat.
00:37:16 <akc3n[m]> * is a neat feature.
00:38:06 <Wonderfall[m]> AFAIK it blocks Google, so it's a bit too much for my taste, I still rely on Google a lot
00:45:04 <GhostSplinterSix> Yuck lol
00:45:51 <Core6255> is there a way to set / config it that when you change between airplane on/off. it does not disconnect WiFi (only cellular when enabling / disabling)
00:56:19 <Wonderfall[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "AFAIK it blocks Google, so it's "> Not to mention few people are going to straight up block Google/FB, so it could make you more unique in a sense
00:56:29 <Wonderfall[m]> <Core6255 "is there a way to set / config i"> Only disable cellular then?
00:57:39 <Wonderfall[m]> Android 11 Airplane mode leaves Bluetooth untouched, not sure you can change that yourself for WiFi
00:59:20 <Wonderfall[m]> (I see there are people doing that with adb, but I strongly advise against that)
01:03:51 <Core6255> <Wonderfall[m]> "only disable cellular then?"> how does one do that tho? I only know airplane mode, and that disables both cellular and WiFi at the same time, everytime. (I've to keep manually retoggling WiFi on again)
01:05:34 <Wonderfall[m]> There's also a cellular data toggle you can use. I imagine you could also set up a dummy APN access point and switch to that one if needed (though please make your own research before doing so!)
01:07:13 <abff> lets be real airplane mode just turns off the software not the hardware
01:10:00 <Wonderfall[m]> <Core6255 "<Wonderfall[m]> "only disable ce"> In fact please read https://grapheneos.org/faq
01:10:07 <Wonderfall[m]> > Connecting to your carrier's network inherently depends on you identifying yourself to it and anyone able to obtain administrative access. Activating airplane mode will fully disable the cellular radio transmit and receive capabilities, which will prevent your phone from being reached from the cellular network and stop your carrier (and anyone impersonating them to you) from tracking the device via the
01:10:07 <Wonderfall[m]> cellular radio. The baseband implements other functionality such as Wi-Fi and GPS functionality, but each of these components is separately sandboxed on the baseband and independent of each other. Enabling airplane mode disables the cellular radio, but Wi-Fi can be re-enabled and used without activating the cellular radio again. This allows using the device as a Wi-Fi only device
01:10:34 <Wonderfall[m]> That would be the way to do that.
01:12:04 <Wonderfall[m]> So just re-enable Wifi once you enabled airplane mode, it will leave the radio off
02:28:42 <akc3n[m]> Thatcher I just started to copy and paste links from vanadium, into new tabs on bromite, and there is an option in bromite to bookmark all tabs. Afterwards in settings -> bookmarks, I am now able to export to an html file.
02:30:21 <Thatcher[m]> Hell yeah!
02:32:26 <abff> what does -offtopic think of molly.im?
02:36:22 <abff> Fuchs[m]: sorry I missed your message, what permission issue are you talking about? Is it something to do with termux? Like you can't access shared storage? There is a script to mount shared storage in the termux env
02:36:46 <abff> Fuchs[m]: termux-setup-storage
02:38:31 <Fuchs[m]> <abff "Fuchs: termux-setup-storage"> No worries, fixed it already with redo the termux-setup-storage. All good now
02:39:41 <abff> awesome :)
02:40:42 <Thatcher[m]> abff I like Molly because it takes sms out of the equation and adds in some good stuff like ability to block contacts. Much better than default Signal app for me.
03:04:38 <j8bit[m]> <Thatcher[m] "abff I like Molly because it tak"> i believe you can block a signal user as well using native signal app.

12:20:57 <sign4l[m]> https://git.fuwafuwa.moe/you/stop_cloudflare/src/branch/master/readme/en.md
12:22:26 <sign4l[m]> like all matrix.org users... think with their matrix messenger they are way up ahead regarding privacy... but they just get screwed by cloudflare... which is worse than Google Amazon and Facebook combined...
12:46:58 <abff> matrix is snakeoil
12:47:07 <abff> the whole project is scuffed
12:48:44 <abff> is there even an implemented server that isn't the reference implementation? or are they still bullying out other projects
12:53:49 <abff> at least construct is still kind of alive
12:54:13 <jpds> abff: I just think that noone has completed another implementation
12:55:35 <Baobab> I wish Matrix was good.
12:55:47 <abff> jpds: I have heard the matrix org has been very adverse to other federated instances, maybe not publicly but through their actions and intentions, almost defensive like they see other servers as competition for their userbase. . . pretty scummy for a federated technology
12:56:05 <Baobab> Because the xmpp2matrix bridge is painful.
12:56:11 <abff> s/federated/"""&"""/
12:57:06 <abff> Baobab: yeah I had so much hope for it
13:05:06 <Thatcher[m]> Is it possible to self host a matrix server that is completely disconnected from the rest of the matrix ecosystem? Wouldn't want matrix.org giving me the stinkeye
13:05:45 <sign4l[m]> Yes of course
13:06:11 <Thatcher[m]> Excellent

13:08:54 <abff> Thatcher[m]: put address and password into client.
13:08:58 <Baobab> Thatcher[m], it's pretty easy to use, at least easier to use than email.
13:09:01 <abff> you're done
13:09:52 <Thatcher[m]> Also, I hate the conversations app
13:10:10 <Baobab> Thatcher[m], I hate all xmpp clients.

13:10:20 <GhostSplinterSix> <Thatcher[m] "Also, I hate the conversations a"> Oh. I just installed it after having just heard of it.
13:10:25 <abff> I hate element more

13:11:16 <abff> Baobab: it's the defacto matrix client on android
13:11:27 <Baobab> When I was on matrix I used fractal because it was the closest to dino-im.
13:11:55 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> There's not really much better clients for Matrix in terms of handling encryption correctly when logging in
13:12:13 <abff> I set up weechat to run in termux and the connect to that via weechat-android
13:12:41 <abff> "it just works"
13:14:25 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Nice (still iffy on using Termux atm, hoping it'll be usable for secondary users)
13:15:28 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Is there an advantage of using weechat over using IRC on web?
13:15:28 <abff> it's really nice to be able to bang out a script to run from clicking an icon on home screen
13:15:47 <abff> wdym irc on web
13:15:56 <abff> like a web client?
13:16:09 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <abff "like a web client?"> Pretty much

13:16:43 <abff> and identify with nickserv too
13:17:44 <abff> I use a bouncer, so I'd rather not log in through someone elses machine
13:18:27 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Oh, as in IRC web in Vanadium, not sure if you cannot do those in freenode, for example?
13:18:46 <abff> no idea
13:18:59 <abff> I haven't used a website as a client since I was 12
13:19:28 <abff> I also have revoltionirc on here, but I also hate it
13:20:11 <abff> needs the buffers get fucked up from time to time, and I can't get it to fucking compile
13:20:15 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <abff "I also have revoltionirc on here"> Oh, I had a bad impression on it as well, is it that hard to use?
13:20:30 <abff> its actually quite nice
13:20:38 <abff> there's just a couple bugs
13:20:57 <abff> which I'd love to troubleshoot but
13:21:02 <abff> oh well
13:21:16 <abff> I also used quassel for a couple years
13:21:25 <abff> the android client for quassel was saweeeet
13:22:22 <abff> but iirc it, like weechat-android, needs a core running to connect to
13:22:34 <abff> it won't do basic irc connections
13:28:08 <pkgbuild[m]> How I can install apps on the work profile or on another graphene profile?

17:19:10 <TheJollyRoger> That should bring up the menu.
17:26:41 <r8qwvgijb8p3hw[m> Hey everyone. I installed GrapheneOS and switched from a carrier with eSIM to one with a physical SIM. The eSIM still shows up in GrapheneOS, and my understanding is that it survives the installation because it's in the secure element. Is there a way to get rid of it? And in general is there a way to purge/reset data stored in places other than what is wiped out during install?
17:32:04 <TheJollyRoger> r8qwvgijb8p3hw[m: If you want to get rid of it and start out with a clean slate, open up Settings and go to Factory Reset.
17:32:57 <TheJollyRoger> It should return you to a fresh install of GrapheneOS and should get rid of the eSIM. Let me know if it doesn't.
17:37:45 <pkgbuild[m]> <TheJollyRoger "pkgbuild: Pull down the menu fro"> 🤦‍♂️ thanks
17:41:28 <r8qwvgijb8p3hw[m> <TheJollyRoger "r8qwvgijb8p3hw: If you want to g"> Thanks for the reply. I tried that and it's still showing up. It's a Pixel bought directly from Google and it came with Fi, if that helps
17:41:40 <TheJollyRoger> pkgbuild[m]: hope this helps!
17:42:52 <TheJollyRoger> r8qwvgijb8p3hw[m: Hum, very strange! If it's direct from Google it should be carrier agnostic. I'll make a mental note of that, you might have to reflash the factory operating system on it and use the app there to configure the eSIM. What's gone on is that GrapheneOS has the backend support for eSIM, but we don't have the app there to act as a frontend to configure it.
17:43:22 <TheJollyRoger> Then reinstall Graphene once you've made the change. I know this really sucks, but it's just in interim,
17:43:43 <TheJollyRoger> until we're able to put out a feature bounty on an eSIM configuration app for GrapheneOS.
17:48:35 <r8qwvgijb8p3hw[m> OK, I'll give that a try! While I'm in stock, is there anything I could/should do to make a clean slate (in addition to removing the eSIM through the Fi app)? By that I mean remove all proprietary/leftover stuff that isn't taken care of by the GrapheneOS installer
17:52:12 <strcat[m]> that's not how it works
17:52:22 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS replaces everything
17:52:50 <strcat[m]> eSIM acts as a SIM card and is a special case that doesn't get reset, although it probably will in the future
17:52:58 <strcat[m]> all data gets wiped, all the OS images are replaced
17:53:02 <strcat[m]> there is nothing left of the stock OS
17:53:08 <strcat[m]> that's just not how it works
17:53:17 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is not a derivative of the stock OS, and does not modify the stock OS
17:53:25 <strcat[m]> it is not something that modifies the OS on your device
17:53:30 <strcat[m]> I suggest reading the docs on our site
17:53:36 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq
17:54:15 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/
17:54:17 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features
17:54:22 <strcat[m]> lots of information available on the site
17:54:29 <strcat[m]> you seem to think GrapheneOS is something other than it actually is
18:01:27 <r8qwvgijb8p3hw[m> <strcat[m] "eSIM acts as a SIM card and is a"> Thanks for the resources. I understand GrapheneOS completely replaces the stock OS, but what I was trying to ask was if there were other special cases that, like the eSIM, don't get reset after installing GrapheneOS. I don't have any technical knowledge on how phones work so I figured I'd ask.
18:06:45 <strcat[m]> no, there aren't, and eSIM is just acting like another SIM
18:07:12 <strcat[m]> you weren't just asking but rather making an incorrect assumption and stating it as fact
18:13:01 <r8qwvgijb8p3hw[m>  * OK, I'll give that a try! While I'm in stock, is there anything I <del>could/should do</del> have to do to make a clean slate (in addition to removing the eSIM through the Fi app)? By that I mean remove <del>all</del> proprietary/leftover stuff that isn't taken care of by the GrapheneOS installer, if any.
18:15:46 <r8qwvgijb8p3hw[m> OK, thanks for clarifying. Sorry if it came off as a statement of fact rather than a question, I edited it in a way I hope fixes that and doesn't mislead people looking for answers in the room
18:34:56 <pkgbuild[m]> to use security token i should enable something for enable usb keys?
18:40:20 <pkgbuild[m]> 🤔 twitter app say "use USB for computer or via bluetooth or NFC on phone" it's just write bad or i really just can't?
18:43:33 <pkgbuild[m]>  * 🤔 twitter app say "use USB for computer or via bluetooth or NFC on phone" it's just write bad or it will really not work in any ways ?
19:08:33 <pkgbuild[m]> The most common way of accessing OAuth 2.0 APIs is using a “Bearer Token”. This is a single string which acts as the authentication of the API request, sent in an HTTP “Authorization” header. The string is meaningless to clients using it, and may be of varying lengths
19:11:57 <strcat[m]> USB security keys via NFC or USB both work fine
19:11:57 <pkgbuild[m]> i don't know if uaf functions are much different on phones
19:12:01 <strcat[m]> OAuth is not relevant to this
19:12:24 <strcat[m]> Vanadium does not support it right now because Chromium uses a Play services library to do U2F/FIDO2
19:12:33 <pkgbuild[m]> ok thanks
19:12:34 <strcat[m]> so it's not supported in Vanadium or other Chromium-based browsers atm
19:12:38 <strcat[m]> or other apps using ONLY that library
19:12:45 <strcat[m]> stuff like the yubico app works fine
19:13:36 <pkgbuild[m]> Thank you
19:22:40 <AppAraat[m]> Is Aurora Store timing out for anyone else here?
19:24:32 <r8qwvgijb8p3hw[m> <TheJollyRoger "r8qwvgijb8p3hw: Hum, very strang"> It worked! The factory reset menu in the factory image had an option to also delete downloaded eSIMs, which I think did the trick. GrapheneOS is now running using only the physical SIM. Thank you so much to both of you for the help!
20:13:32 <fantazma> Hi
20:16:00 <Telegram-Bridge> <g​ochoingles> How does somebody download an eSIM?
20:30:59 <Wonderfall[m]> <AppAraat[m] "Is Aurora Store timing out for a"> It happens regularly if you're trying to use an anonymous account from them. Try later or use an account you made
20:32:29 <Wonderfall[m]> And yeah for what it's worth, Yubikey 5C works great on GrapheneOS. Except U2F/FIDO2 (reason above)
20:34:49 <Telegram-Bridge> <L​73689> I've got a yubikey 5c, but i wish I knew more how to get the most out of it
20:36:52 <Wonderfall[m]> I use it primarily for touch-triggered OTP, it acts like a 2FA and Bitwarden supports it for instance
20:38:19 <came2complain[m]> does anyone know if it is possible to manually switch partitions for the pixel 4a? as far as I understand when I install graphene OS the stock image will stay on the other partition...
20:38:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <L​73689> Ahh OK is bitwarden better than keepass
20:42:25 <Wonderfall[m]> <came2complain[m] "does anyone know if it is possib"> I don't quite understand what you mean. GrapheneOS will be installed on the OS partition
20:42:35 <Wonderfall[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<L73689> Ahh OK is bitwarden bet"> Not necessarily
20:42:58 <Wonderfall[m]> I prefer it since I have lots of devices (Windows, iPad, Mac) to work with
20:43:20 <came2complain[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "Not necessarily"> there is 2 partitions a and b - a new os will always be flashed to the 2nd partition and the old one stays on the other.
20:43:29 <came2complain[m]> > <@wonderfall:targaryen.house> Not necessarily
20:43:29 <came2complain[m]>  * there is 2 partitions a and b - a new image will always be flashed to the 2nd partition and the old one stays on the other.
20:46:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> <came2complain[m] "there is 2 partitions a and b - "> That's incorrect
20:47:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you are on a and flash b you should expect that on a successful boot a may become unbootable
20:47:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> * If you are on a and flash b you should assume that on a successful boot a may become unbootable
20:47:26 <came2complain[m]> ok
20:47:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> This won't happen with grapheneos
20:47:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> It does happen on stock due to system_other
20:48:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> The A/B ota is applied in a 2 step manner in that case
20:56:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> What happened
22:37:56 <pkgbuild[m]> Installing all these apps like YouTube etc on another profile is pretty safe right? We get tracked much as we use this profile, when switching again we are again cleared of all those trackers?
22:40:52 <DemiMarie> Has using Signal as the default SMS app been considered?  Right now, having to install (and verify) both it and its updates manually makes it difficult to use, to the point where I have not done so yet.
22:41:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> <DemiMarie "Has using Signal as the default "> No
22:41:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Signal is not a very good sms app
22:41:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> It would break stuff if we added it
22:41:32 <DemiMarie> <anupritaisno1[m] "It would break stuff if we added"> What would break?
22:41:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also we'd get on moxie's bad side. He doesn't want the app to be shipped that way
22:42:21 <pkgbuild[m]> There is nothing that bind some ID of the user when switch profile? I think no maybe number but this is an app prerogative
22:42:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <DemiMarie "What would break?"> Encrypt the sms with a key you backed into keystore and you've already broken a few apps
22:42:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also how do you share the sms messages between profiles?
22:43:04 <pkgbuild[m]> I'm using silence from day one and I didn't had any problem
22:43:23 <DemiMarie> <anupritaisno1[m] "Also how do you share the sms me"> I had not considered that as I have never used multiple profiles.
22:43:47 <DemiMarie> <anupritaisno1[m] "Also we'd get on moxie's bad sid"> Would he be willing to submit it to GrapheneOS’s store once one exists?
22:44:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why are you asking me this?
22:44:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do you think I know the answer?
22:44:43 <DemiMarie> <anupritaisno1[m] "Do you think I know the answer?"> Sorry

23:14:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> So I had this silly idea. What if you took a Raspberry Pi 4, and gave it a custom EEPROM boot image that asks the user for a password, which then decrypts a bootloader on an SD card or USB drive. No key, no bootloader.
23:15:28 <cyborgninjaneer[> Then let's say the encrypted bootloader holds a key to verify the OS before actually booting that.
23:16:04 <cyborgninjaneer[> So in a sense you're using the user's brain as a root of trust.
23:18:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> Of course it's a bit silly because an attacker with hardware access could replace the boot image on the EEPROM.
23:19:09 <cyborgninjaneer[> You also only have 512 KB to work with.
23:25:10 <cyborgninjaneer[> So maybe the password prompt could display some kind of visual hash of its code plus the contents of the password prompt as the user types. If it doesn't look right, the user can stop typing and power the device down.
23:25:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> cyborgninjaneer: there's already an equivalent thing in standard password encryption
23:25:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "So maybe the password prompt cou"> No nevermind it's different
23:26:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Sent it before you sent that, but element sucks
23:26:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And lagged
23:27:01 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yeah, everybody ought to use Session instead. It's a bit buggy too, but no worse than this.
23:27:12 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Signal
23:27:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But that's centralized unfortunately
23:27:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Oh
23:28:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> Signal requires a phone number and displays it to all participants in the room. Also the 4-digit pins are likely a backdoor.
23:28:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Session is onion network I see
23:28:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Signal requires a phone number a"> Eh that's more privacy
23:28:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Not security but I understand
23:28:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> 4 digit PIN tho...wut
23:28:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> Session uses the Signal protocol, but has decent anonymity.
23:28:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Session uses the Signal protocol"> Ah
23:29:20 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Also how are 4 digit pins a backdoor
23:29:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Bad security yes
23:29:40 <cyborgninjaneer[> Signal uses a 4-digit PIN by default, so if you compromise Intel SGX on the Signal server, you can decrypt a lot of user data in a reasonable amount of time.
23:29:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Still, you can easily do more than 4 digits
23:29:58 <TheJollyRoger> They aren't. You can set 6-word passphrases there if you want. Disabling the PIN simply tosses the key.
23:30:13 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <TheJollyRoger "They aren't. You can set 6-word "> Yeah that's what I thought
23:30:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's a default you can override, yes.
23:30:47 <TheJollyRoger> Also, Signal's use of phone numbers is deliberate; anyone who finds that a point of contention should read the university study from University of Bonn, University-College London, and Stanford about contact finding.
23:31:28 <TheJollyRoger> It's called "Obstacles to Adoption of Secure Communication Tools" and the authors actually presented it to the EFF at one point.
23:31:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "It's a default you can override,"> Then it's not a backdoor
23:31:31 <cyborgninjaneer[> Signal has a specific use case, which is not analogous to Element or this chat room, and therefore irrelevant to what I was talking about
23:31:50 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If people willingly use 4 digit PINS that's their fault for being dumdums
23:32:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Same as windows telemetry
23:33:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Then it's not a backdoor"> Yes and no. It's a sort of soft back door for the ignorant. Most users will run with the default. That's good enough for the US government, if that is in fact what's going on. There's no proof, it's just a possible vulnerability that I find a bit noxious even if it doesn't affect most users.
23:34:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Yes and no. It's a sort of soft "> The US government doesn't care about everyone's data and mesaages
23:34:22 <cyborgninjaneer[> Session is more of an Element/matrix competitor.
23:34:24 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They care more about everyone's metadata
23:34:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If you're a suspected terrorist for example, that's when they try getting your data
23:35:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And obviously, they will try to see whoever you're talking to, when, where you are, eyc
23:35:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * And obviously, they will try to see whoever you're talking to, when, where you are, etc
23:36:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Kind of ingenious if you ask me, I kind of like the NSA compared to other US government agencies lol
23:37:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Not their spying obviously but they're the coolest agency in how they do it
23:38:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> Signal's centralization could allow some traffic analysis. Google can help with that too by running timing attacks on Google cloud notifications, although that's getting less effective with more users.
23:40:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> I think the main reason for invading signal servers would be to assemble social graphs. That's still rather noxious since concealing social graphs is half the point of using Signal.
23:40:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm hoping to see Session become a little more competitive with Matrix or even Discord in the future as UX improves.
23:42:36 <cyborgninjaneer[> Anyway, I'm actually kind of curious about that RPi thought experiment. It honestly seems like an inconvenient but at least somewhat sound.
