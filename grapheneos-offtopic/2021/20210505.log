09:10:49 <strcat[m]> I suggest looking at the driver
09:11:10 <strcat[m]> they don't share memory, the hardware copies it
09:11:26 <strcat[m]> and that's not how they 'communicate' it's part of how data is transferred
09:11:40 <strcat[m]> it's not how it receives events etc.
09:11:43 <strcat[m]> just not how it works
09:12:11 <strcat[m]> they don't use the same memory, the driver marks certain memory for the hardware to copy to / from
09:13:09 <strcat[m]> like other components: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and others
09:14:18 <strcat[m]> it's not something specific to this
09:15:05 <strcat[m]> memory can be marked as accessible to hardware to allow the memory controller to do copies to / from it
09:15:21 <strcat[m]> it's not the memory used by that hardware internally though, it's a place it copies to / from

10:50:32 <Leo[m]5> What does that switch do
10:54:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> There is an issue about it on GitHub
10:57:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's already in the Styles and Wallpapers options
10:57:43 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> As of May update
10:58:44 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/523
11:05:28 <ishikawa[m]> Curious does anyone use orbot? what is its purpose if we have Tor browser for android?
11:05:28 <ishikawa[m]> it made sense when it was orbot and orfox.
11:11:32 <souvlaki[m]> it's primarly used to torify your whole device, pretty useless imo
11:12:04 <souvlaki[m]> cause torifying your whole device is not a good idea imo
11:12:33 <ishikawa[m]> Yeah i didnt think torifying my whole device was a good idea
11:13:23 <souvlaki[m]> but it actually has more useful case - when you need to run specific apps through tor
11:13:32 <souvlaki[m]> you can select those in orbot
11:14:43 <ishikawa[m]> Yeah i can see how that is usefull, this only works if the apps support tor proxys right?
11:14:57 <ishikawa[m]> Or can your force any app through
11:15:03 <ishikawa[m]>  * Or can your force any app through?
11:15:11 <souvlaki[m]> no, for any app supposingly, it acts like a system vpn
11:15:18 <souvlaki[m]> selective system-wide vpn
11:16:26 <souvlaki[m]> ie i use it to torify signal which doesn't have any proxy settings at all
11:17:38 <ishikawa[m]> Oh i see, it utilises the vpn feature of the phone to torify the connection.
11:17:38 <ishikawa[m]> Thats neat.
11:18:24 <ishikawa[m]> So i can send signal through tor?
11:19:06 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <ishikawa[m] "So i can send signal through tor"> Yes
11:19:50 <souvlaki[m]> you can send any app through tor
11:21:14 <ishikawa[m]> nice! might send a few through it right now.
11:36:04 <anonym1984[m]> Should i use Vanadium with orbot or just stick to the Tor Browser
11:36:35 <souvlaki[m]> use tor browser
11:37:00 <souvlaki[m]> the more you vary from most of tor users, the easier is to track you
11:37:21 <souvlaki[m]> that's why it is not advised to install addons in tor browser also
11:40:13 <souvlaki[m]> like when you wear a mask, you don't put an unique number or "MY NAME IS BRIAN" on it
11:40:21 <souvlaki[m]> same with tor browser
11:42:39 <Thatcher[m]> I'm curious as to what security setting the majority of To Browser users use (Safe, Safer, Safest)
11:42:50 <Thatcher[m]> Tor*
11:43:21 <souvlaki[m]> i use safer cause some sites tend to break on safest
11:44:04 <souvlaki[m]> not that i used tor outside of onion domains too much, but sometimes it can be a pain in ass
11:46:41 <ishikawa[m]> <anonym1984[m] "Should i use Vanadium with orbot"> I use vandium as is and use tor browser as is also.
11:47:41 <ishikawa[m]> I also don;t sign into personal accounts using tor.
11:47:41 <ishikawa[m]> Just general Tor practices i guess.

11:48:09 <ishikawa[m]> Or "preferred" practices

11:49:07 <souvlaki[m]> wide famous and it's all fault of onion routing flaws
11:49:23 <souvlaki[m]> (joking, don't take everything too seriously)
11:50:11 <ishikawa[m]> Im sure now he probably uses Qubes OS with a disposable whonix vm etc
11:50:59 <souvlaki[m]> now he uses russian airport's public wifi ap
11:51:38 <souvlaki[m]> i guess that could be considered true anonymity btw

11:55:12 <souvlaki[m]> no, nothing that i've heard before
11:55:39 <ishikawa[m]> Yeah probably spam....ironic i guess
11:56:37 <souvlaki[m]> the most ironic part of it is i am obliged to use mac at work

12:27:39 <ishikawa[m]> Judging by your threat model.
12:30:01 <ishikawa[m]> Just use a combination of Tor when you need it and a hardened browser with limited extensions installed.
12:30:01 <ishikawa[m]> But do your own research...i always recommend people do there own research first to understand their treat model.

18:17:45 <helloworldkk87[m> Bromite is also based on chromium
18:18:07 <alba[m]> so, surely the Graphene dev is knowing what he's doing but with bromite I haven't heard those complains
18:18:59 <alba[m]> or does vanadium do the connectivity check in the meantime to its own server?
18:19:00 <MrSenshi[m]> Does anyone know why autofill is disabled or removed or not working in Vanadium?
18:19:30 <MrSenshi[m]> Just on the topic of the browser.
18:21:29 <helloworldkk87[m> <alba[m] "so, surely the Graphene dev is k"> I dont get what are you saying. Both bromite and vanadium are based on google's open source chromium. That doesnt mean there is Google in it. Chromium just happens to be alot better than something like firefox like having better sandboxing and exploit mitigations etc
18:22:39 <EV-9600[m]> Chromium does phone home though
18:22:58 <alba[m]> even I don't know what I mean ^^ look, I read a (privacy) blog post in November and there were some minor issues with Graphene - that didn't stop me to flash it
18:23:16 <alba[m]> however, one thing was about the connectivity check to a google server
18:23:23 <alba[m]> which bromite doesn't have
18:23:48 <helloworldkk87[m> The connections that GrapheneOS and the bundled apps make are documented here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
18:24:49 <alba[m]> CTRL + F "connectivity": "By default, the GrapheneOS connectivity check server is used via the following URLs:"
18:24:59 <alba[m]> HTTPS: https://connectivitycheck.grapheneos.network/generate_204
18:25:06 <alba[m]> nevermind, I had old news
18:25:28 <alba[m]> seems like it's really not calling to google anymore
18:26:00 <alba[m]> oh, next paragraph: "You can change the connectivity check URLs via the Settings ➔ Network & internet ➔ Advanced ➔ Internet connectivity check setting. At the moment, it can be toggled between the GrapheneOS server and the standard Google servers used by billions of other Android devices. This can be used to blend in with other Android devices, both with and without Play services. Changing this to the Stand
18:26:00 <alba[m]> (Google) mode will use the same URLs used by AOSP and the stock OS along with the vast majority of other devices:"
18:26:55 <helloworldkk87[m> Yeah no worrys, anyways going to sleep, really late here, goodnight everyone:)
18:27:13 <alba[m]> night
18:27:33 <Wonderfall[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
18:27:46 <Wonderfall[m]> Vanadium is designed for GrapheneOS and has more security hardening
18:27:56 <Wonderfall[m]> But Bromite is fine too
18:28:23 <Wonderfall[m]> (highly suggest sticking with Vanadium though)
18:29:58 <Cliff[m]> <TheLoneWanderer[ "Use Argon2id if you're going for"> Could you explain more about this? I havent been able to find the best settings for this online, i did change the transformation rounds to 10 million.
18:30:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yo, I tried to install hardened-malloc on Manjaro. How so I check to see if it's actually in use?
18:32:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> OK Firefox won't launch so it must be trying to use it. Go figure how that pos would have memory bugs
18:33:14 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: look at /proc/PID/maps
18:33:17 <strcat[m]> it's really easy to tell
18:33:23 <strcat[m]> from all the guard pages and isolated regions
18:33:31 <strcat[m]> and you can see the library is loaded since it's mapped into the address space
18:33:38 <strcat[m]> `cat /proc/self/maps`
18:34:37 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: https://gist.github.com/thestinger/750571c4a015fd7a4f87a4f13668bcdf as a trivial example
18:34:39 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yep, it's in there.
18:34:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> Heck yeah I fucking broke Firefox
18:35:08 <cyborgninjaneer[> Success!
18:35:26 <strcat[m]> I think it was working fine with it but maybe they broke it again
18:35:48 <strcat[m]> memory corruption bugs in applications come and go
18:36:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> This is on ARM
18:37:22 <cyborgninjaneer[> That might be part of it. I'm screwing around with a Raspberry Pi
18:37:30 <strcat[m]> ah haven't tested desktop Firefox on ARM with it
18:37:58 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: unfortunately mainline Linux kernel lacks the memory label feature
18:38:14 <strcat[m]> it's one of the optional things Android common kernel adds (doesn't really add anything mandatory anymore)
18:38:30 <strcat[m]> it makes it easier to see what's happening
18:39:27 <cyborgninjaneer[> Is the hardening as effective without that or is it more of a dev tool?
18:39:59 <TheLoneWanderer[> <Cliff[m] "Could you explain more about thi"> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2/
18:42:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> Next I want to figure out how to find and report the bug in Firefox so I can start being a huge pain to developers everywhere.
18:42:51 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: labels don't impact hardening
18:43:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> Cool
18:43:02 <strcat[m]> it fully works with glibc but glibc lacks other hardening unrelated to malloc
18:43:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's good to know. Also I don't like glibc.
18:44:13 <cyborgninjaneer[> I don't like GNU very much in general.
18:44:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> Kinda sad Vanilla Linux never took off.
18:45:59 <Cliff[m]> The Lone Wanderer thanks, what are your security settings on keepass dx? Encryption and key derivation function
18:48:03 <TheLoneWanderer[> I personally don't use KeePassDX
18:48:08 <TheLoneWanderer[> Only KeePassXC
18:48:57 <TheLoneWanderer[> There's a noticeable performance difference
18:51:29 <TheLoneWanderer[> Otherwise, AES256 and Argon2id (16, 128MiB)
18:56:34 <Cliff[m]> <TheLoneWanderer[ "Only KeePassXC"> I only found keepass dx in f droid is there a reason you use XC? In dx i can only choose aes, twofish or chacha20 for encryption not the cipher and no mib
18:57:26 <TheLoneWanderer[> <Cliff[m] "I only found keepass dx in f dro"> Oh, KeePassXC is for desktops (Think Windows, Linux etc.)
18:58:37 <TheLoneWanderer[> The defaults are perfectly fine
18:59:12 <TheLoneWanderer[> I just suggested Argon2id because maximum sekuritee
19:01:44 <Cliff[m]> I will use that and leave the encryption on aes. I to prefer maximus securitus
19:13:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> Does the security of Keepass forks come primarily from the format of the database files?
19:14:33 <cyborgninjaneer[> So for example, do the results of the European Commission audit of Keepass more or less apply to KeepassDX?
19:41:36 <Cliff[m]> cyborgninjaneer the european commission audited keepass? What for
20:02:44 <trail_undergroun> <Cliff[m] "cyborgninjaneer the european com"> There should be more information on the KeePass site on their audits
20:03:13 <trail_undergroun> <cyborgninjaneer[ "So for example, do the results o"> I believe it does, but I’d have to double check
20:07:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> <Cliff[m] "cyborgninjaneer the european com"> They recommended it for use to several countries. Nation state actors were using it, and might still be.
20:08:05 <Cliff[m]> Ok cool didn't know about that.
20:22:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> I was looking at Alpine Linux and it's most of what I would want in a distro except they switched back from libressl to the (IMO inferior) openssl.
20:47:13 <GhostSplinterSix> Qubes + Whonix will be my next  OS. Once I'm more familiar and knowledgeable with Cyber security, I'd like to try out BlackArch.
20:50:20 <Lestat[m]> Who was the guy using PowerISA around here
20:50:33 <Baobab> Isn't blackarch like regular arch but with pentesting tools preinstalled?
20:52:22 <dnull> Baobab: Essentially
20:52:58 <Lestat[m]> <Baobab "Isn't blackarch like regular arc"> It is
20:53:48 <Lestat[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "I was looking at Alpine Linux an"> every linux distro did
20:54:01 <Lestat[m]> Gentoo, alpine, void
20:54:15 <Baobab> Lestat[m], you can still use libressl on gentoo
20:54:44 <Lestat[m]> Oh? Its still available?
20:54:55 <Lestat[m]> I thought they dropped it
20:54:55 <Baobab> yeah
20:55:19 <Baobab> Lestat[m], they dropped official support for the libressl flag
20:55:26 <Baobab> *use flag
20:55:31 <Lestat[m]> Oh
20:55:33 <Lestat[m]> As of 2021-02-01, LibreSSL will no longer be officially supported in Gentoo. It will still be possible to use LibreSSL to some degree after this date but migration to OpenSSL is strongly recommended. The interested users will continue the development of unofficial LibreSSL support in the LibreSSL overlay.
20:55:52 <Baobab> yeah
20:56:06 <Baobab> the libressl overlay was around for a while
20:57:39 <strcat[m]> LibreSSL doesn't really have enough resources
20:57:52 <strcat[m]> it's missing a lot of improvements that happened in OpenSSL and doesn't fix it nearly as much as BoringSSL
20:58:02 <strcat[m]> BoringSSL very aggressively rewrote / fixed it
20:58:09 <strcat[m]> didn't bother maintaining API compatibility
20:58:13 <strcat[m]> fixed the API instead
20:58:21 <Lestat[m]> Void devs said libressl was a cunt to work with
20:58:22 <strcat[m]> ripped out all the cruft, legacy things, bad ideas
20:58:32 <Baobab> I use boringssl in place of openssl on one of my musl boxes.
20:58:34 <Lestat[m]> So boringssl - best?
20:58:38 <strcat[m]> well if they think that they absolutely couldn't use BoringSSL because it's a totally different API
20:58:39 <Baobab> it's pretty good.
20:58:39 <strcat[m]> Lestat: yes
20:58:49 <strcat[m]> Lestat: but it requires actually having resources to keep up with an improving API
20:59:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> InterestingSSL when
20:59:06 <Lestat[m]> ah
20:59:07 <strcat[m]> shouldn't be used by projects without resources to move to improved / fixed APIs
20:59:21 <strcat[m]> they kinda discourage people from using it to avoid fallout from that
20:59:29 <strcat[m]> Android uses BoringSSL as the only OS TLS implementation now
20:59:36 <strcat[m]> they reimplemented the Java APIs in terms of it, etc.
21:00:18 <strcat[m]> Chromium uses it of course
21:00:20 <Lestat[m]> Man linux development outside of android/chromeos is kinda sad lol
21:00:25 <strcat[m]> nginx supports it and it's required for HTTP/3, etc.
21:00:51 <strcat[m]> Rust's ring crypto library is a port of BoringSSL to Rust reusing a lot of it
21:01:03 <strcat[m]> rustls uses ring
21:01:19 <strcat[m]> so that's kinda BoringSSL too, it's an actively done port of BoringSSL to Rust kept in sync with it
21:01:29 <strcat[m]> reuses assembly code etc.
21:01:43 <strcat[m]> Google is funding that stuff now
21:01:53 <strcat[m]> Android is heavily using Rust for Android 12 and beyond
21:02:01 <strcat[m]> and they're heavily using it elsewhere
21:02:15 <Lestat[m]> man FUCK canadian mail
21:02:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah great now I must learn rust
21:02:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Lestat[m] "man FUCK canadian mail"> That's lewd
21:02:28 <strcat[m]> AOSP, Chromium, Fuchsia are using it
21:02:33 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yeah you do
21:02:35 <Lestat[m]> 2 and a half months ive been waiting for shit from canada to come
21:02:44 <strcat[m]> the AOSP build system has Rust support in Android 12 and they build a lot of components with Rust
21:03:04 <strcat[m]> the support is kinda there in Android 11 but wasn't really production / finished
21:03:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Outdated skillset be like
21:03:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll do it
21:03:15 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth will work better
21:03:17 <strcat[m]> being rewritten in Rust
21:03:28 <strcat[m]> so we won't have to deal with all those memory corruption bugs being uncovered after most is ported
21:03:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Is rust hard?
21:03:50 <strcat[m]> can also see Google is making a framework to use Rust for writing Linux kernel modules
21:03:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: not if you actually know C and/or C++ really well
21:04:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> C, sure
21:04:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> C++, ouch
21:04:18 <strcat[m]> along with being familiar with functional language ecosystem stuff like pattern matching and type classes
21:04:32 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I mean the ownership / lifetime aspect of C++, and destructors, move semantics, etc.
21:04:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "along with being familiar with f"> Nah not really familiar with that
21:04:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: I mean the owners"> Ehm sure
21:16:23 <cyborgninjaneer[> Aaaaaack alpine is the only distro I can find that's not complete garbage and it doesn't have the packages I want for ARM
21:17:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> I've tried to go through LFS a few times but I always end up with a lot of problems.
21:18:53 <cyborgninjaneer[> It really sucks that Vanilla Linux didn't take off. I read about it and it was more or less what I wanted to create.
21:18:56 <Lestat[m]> What about void?
21:19:15 <cyborgninjaneer[> Is void still maintained?
21:19:18 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'll look

21:33:01 <jk539[m]> <jj1013[m] "Strange, you can't talk about pr"> Most people who use windows don't see it as a private OS. Closed sores skepticism I presume.
21:38:35 <EV-9600[m]> Is it possible to add iptables rules if I build Graphene from source?
21:38:39 <Ghosts-In-My-Wir> <cyborgninjaneer[ "It doesn't look like Void suppor"> It does but its super finiky to get working.
21:43:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> Alpine was weird too. I had to rearrange stuff and edit the configs because the way they had it set up in the downloaded image didn't work.
21:44:04 <skwisgaar[m]> jj1013.: pretty sure privacy is off limits because the topic is security, and because people in the group would derail the conversation with misinformation and paranoia if privacy was a permitted topic.

22:46:23 <Wonderfall[m]> And you're right, everyone has to evaluate their threat model, that's a fair point.

22:46:38 <Wonderfall[m]> Very easy to use without deep knowledge, tons of libraries

22:46:45 <jj1013[m]> Also, IMO it needs too much memory. I prefer sticking with a CPU language like C or Rust.
22:46:52 <jj1013[m]> Memory, as in storage.
22:47:15 <Wonderfall[m]> You can do anything with it as lons as it doesn't involve too much calculation
22:47:15 <Wonderfall[m]> That being said, Python can be interfaced with C and even Rust code
22:47:25 <Wonderfall[m]>  * You can do anything with it as long as it doesn't involve too much calculation
22:47:25 <Wonderfall[m]> That being said, Python can be interfaced with C and even Rust code
22:47:38 <Wonderfall[m]> So in fine you get the best of both worlds
22:47:58 <Wonderfall[m]> <jj1013[m] "Also, IMO it needs too much memo"> Yeah, but it's a matter of what tool is adequate for the right task
22:48:09 <Wonderfall[m]> You can do everything with C/Rust
22:48:27 <Wonderfall[m]> But some things you can do really fast without a lot of debugging with Python
22:48:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> true
22:49:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> my fav lang is Wolfram Mathematica tho
22:49:13 <Wonderfall[m]> Python is great for scripting, system automation, it's easy to read and learn, in less than a week everyone can produce decent Python code, which is awesome
22:49:17 <Wonderfall[m]> Rust is another story haha
22:49:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you can't really do good differential equations solving using C/Rust afaik
22:50:02 <Wonderfall[m]> I tend to forgot but I was into iOS dev back in 2015, and I used Swift when it was a new thing
22:50:12 <Wonderfall[m]> Make my first mobile app with it
22:50:17 <Wonderfall[m]>  * Made my first mobile app with it
22:50:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> ahah, classic
22:51:49 <jj1013[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "Yeah, but it's a matter of what "> I am still looking for an appropiate language to make a lightweight (lean & mean, low on storage low on resources) videogame.
22:52:00 <Wonderfall[m]> I'm also very eager to try Flutter, but first I'm not finished with learning Rust
22:52:17 <Wonderfall[m]> (Flutter uses Dart)

22:52:56 <jj1013[m]> When I search "cake wallet", is the top result the actual app or a rip-off?
22:53:06 <jj1013[m]> Oh, wrong group. Sorry.
22:53:21 <Wonderfall[m]> I've seen some videogame devs interested in Rust
22:53:44 <Wonderfall[m]> (Really you should learn Rust too!)
22:54:01 <GhostSplinterSix> I read the video game message and then "cake wallet" as "cake walk" 😆
22:54:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> hey ghost!
22:57:09 <GhostSplinterSix> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> hey ghost!"> 🤜🏻🤛🏻 What up!
22:59:26 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i find it to be the most easy/productive/effective to start writing a project in a very very high level language, and then re-writing it in a lower level one if needed
23:04:05 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> lower level in this context does not refer to assembly in this case, but more like C is relatively lower when compared to python, which is lower compared to Wolfram Mathematica
23:05:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <g​ochoingles> jj1013[m]: I find myself on a Monero Matrix group, just in case you ask.
23:52:25 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> So just swapped sim from iOS device to gos pixel. Telegram "secret chats" survived on previous device.
23:53:07 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> What can that mean? Previous exp tells me telegram wipes secret chats when sim removed
23:54:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> Monero 👌
23:58:38 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> Prev understanding is that telegram only supports e2e on sim devices. All previous sim removal has caused loss of secret chats from device
23:58:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> No, that's not how it works
23:58:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> OK, how?
23:59:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Telegram only uses your phone number for account creation and authentication
23:59:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Your secret chats are tied to the client on the device
