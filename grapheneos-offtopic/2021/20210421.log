07:51:21 <dazinism> cstrriderbanjo  has to be a monitor thats compatible https://www.displaylink.com/
07:52:02 <dazinism> Or I guess a displaylink docking station would allow you to use a different monitor??
07:53:04 <dazinism> The phone doesn't provide enough power to power up the monitor directly, so need a usb c hub to give the extra power
07:55:51 <dazinism> Should note that with my Pixel 3 the monitor can lag a bit at times behind the speed stuff happens on the phone
07:58:28 <dazinism> I guess a displaylink docking station will let you use a non displaylink monitor?
07:59:00 <dazinism> Haven't really looked at them
08:00:58 <dazinism> With my setup I don't find the lagging hugely annoying.
08:01:23 <dazinism> I first noticed it when I was testing it by playing a game
08:01:53 <dazinism> Where it was more noticeable / annoying.
08:03:31 <dazinism> Not sure if a more expensive/powerful displaylink monitor might not do that or if its due to combination of the phone/app/OS
08:04:22 <dazinism> Heres the details of mine
08:04:30 <dazinism> https://web.archive.org/web/20161117170605/http://www.asus.com/uk/Commercial-Monitors/MB168B/
08:04:42 <dazinism> It's a discontinued model
08:13:32 <catfish[m]> dazinism: do you have to use the displaylink app? And can you use a mouse/keyboard?
08:14:32 <dazinism> Yeah have to use the app. As well as the monitor I also plug usb keyboard and mouse into my usb c hub
08:17:26 <catfish[m]> Ace. I'd seen this page https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2865484?hl=en-GB but I wonder if any displaylink hub would work. Will spend some pound notes and see because surely that's the most secure desktop I could get.
08:19:21 <dazinism> Other thing to note is sometimes the phone / app doesn't react when you plug the monitor in. It always works in the end with some unplugging replugging
08:26:36 <dazinism> catfish Also some secure/private apps don't trust the external.display. Most of them have settings to allow them to be shown on the display. Do a search in the logs of these channels for displaylink for more details
10:29:13 <withinfire[m]> hi, in the logs for this channel it looked like the Huawei AppGallery was mentioned. I guess those are de-Googled and could potentially be a solution for phones on GOS? Are people currently doing that? Or would we then have the problem of de-Huawei-ing it? :p
10:47:21 <catacombs[m]> any one have any knowledge getting data to work with GrapheneOS, specifically, how to edit an APN into phone.
10:47:44 <catacombs[m]> Mine has Verizon at the top of APN, and is greyed out.
10:49:13 <catacombs[m]> I have done chat with Google techs.  Carrier techs (Straight Talk) who think I should be able to directly type a new name in, that does not have Verizon at top.
10:49:47 <catacombs[m]> It is like the graphene phone is locked to Verizon.  It was purchased directly from Google Store as an Unlocked phone.
10:51:42 <catacombs[m]> Straight Talk is the carrier from WalMart and allows a number of different carriers.   In this area, CDMA works best, and indeed, it is a Verizon - Trac Fone I use.  Straight Talk insists the name in the APN must begin with Straight Talk   and then secondly have VZWINTERNET
10:52:36 <catacombs[m]> Google forum shows it is a common problem that Google Pixel do not automatically download APN's but do not offer any solution
10:53:13 <catacombs[m]> further I see one example of where the APN has a period entered between the first line and the second line.
10:53:27 <dazinism> catacombs: I think editing the APN is restricted by some carriers
10:54:07 <catacombs[m]> supposed to be an unlocked phone, unless Google Store slipped me the version of Google Pixel meant only for Verizon
10:54:31 <dazinism> The carrier settings are included in GrapheneOS
10:55:04 <catacombs[m]> Since this is a Graphene, and Data did start to work in Android.
10:56:05 <catacombs[m]> Where can I look to change the setting which locks me out of .  Might be I am not sitting under the Straight Talk Tower, and might be using someone elses cell tower to access network
10:56:31 <dazinism> Unfortunately the way carrier stuff is included / implemented is a mess. Different carriers do stuff in different ways
10:56:50 <catacombs[m]> It looks like, I could either roll it back to Android.   or spend a bunch of money buying another SIM card Data plan.
10:57:11 <dazinism> Its not just about APNs some carriers need other stuff included on the phone
10:57:39 <catacombs[m]> I suspect you are correct, that the APN also identifies a bunch of settings
10:58:04 <catacombs[m]> we used to have a number to dial to program a phone.
10:58:46 <dazinism> GrapheneOS grabs all this kind of stuff from the stock Pixels (as its not included in AOSP)
10:59:33 <catacombs[m]> I am out of money.  My usual older phone is about to be out of days of service.    and porting the number to the new phone , so I am told, means I must buy a new SIM card, new plan and call ST carrier before I start.
11:00:05 <catacombs[m]> I do not want to run
11:00:10 <catacombs[m]> Android.
11:00:16 <dazinism> There was a load of work done on GrapheneOS early this year which improved stuff considerably and issues like you are having have become far less common, but I guess unfortunately that doesn't help you.
11:00:59 <catacombs[m]> If i bit the bullet and returned the phone to the Google Store they would say I have irrivocably damaged their phone
11:01:22 <catacombs[m]> I will run out of days to return phone before the month of service goes out
11:02:10 <dazinism> You can flash the stock OS again and its exactly the same as when you got it.
11:02:14 <catacombs[m]> If I again, flashed the Pixel, with the SIM card out.   might that help
11:02:35 <catacombs[m]> I asked the Google tech support, they do not have download or flasher
11:02:43 <dazinism> I doubt it. Guess you could try just pulling out the SIM
11:03:04 <dazinism> See if you can set anything with no SIM inserted??
11:03:07 <catacombs[m]> said they do not support our flashing phones.
11:03:13 <dazinism> Guess unlikely
11:03:31 <catacombs[m]> I tried removing SIM turning phone on and off.
11:03:54 <dazinism> And highly likely all the APN stuff will change when you insert the sim
11:04:38 <catacombs[m]> I have not tried these solutions while trying to sit in a place, In my car, where I am pretty sure that the Straight Talk tower is right there
11:04:56 <dazinism> catacombs: yeah guess you are unlucky and its down to the way that carrier has implemented stuff
11:05:29 <catacombs[m]> I was hoping someone had some other way besides me spending money
11:05:53 <catacombs[m]> and has anyone actually have any experience rolling back to Android
11:06:04 <dazinism> Guess theres a chance things could change with an OS update
11:06:19 <dazinism> Loads of people have moved back to Stock
11:06:53 <catacombs[m]> I see some sites that say I have the version of Android you want.  hmmm.
11:07:31 <dazinism> catacombs: have a look in the logs of this room for how to flash stock
11:07:40 <dazinism> It's been discussed loads
11:08:17 <catacombs[m]> I guess I have not looked back far enough
11:08:20 <mysterytesty[m]> What kind of pixel you have ? Someone said on a forum that they put the sim in a Pixel 4 xl and changedthe APN to vzinternet and then put it in a pixel 4 and it worked ?
11:08:24 <dazinism> Theres a Google site that works in a similar way to the GrapheneOS web installer
11:08:46 <dazinism> catacombs: use the search function.
11:08:49 <catacombs[m]> I have a Pixel 4A with 5 G
11:10:17 <catacombs[m]> I see it flashes AOSP
11:10:25 <catacombs[m]> or Android

11:10:54 <mysterytesty[m]> that was on a forum. seems he had the same issue as you
11:11:28 <somenerd[m]> > catacombs: have a look in the logs of this room for how to flash stock
11:11:28 <somenerd[m]> afaik, it's also on the GrapheneOS site
11:11:30 <dazinism> catacombs: it flashes stock android, the OS on the phone when you buy it
11:12:47 <catacombs[m]> at the bottom of the Graphen install is a button to uninstall the Graphene lock that, page says, must be removed to flash stock.  No advice about where to get stock or flash tool I can trust
11:12:47 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
11:13:26 <catacombs[m]> I have never looked at the cli, just the webinstall
11:13:29 <dazinism> Ah sounds like its an issue in stock as well as GrapheneOS.  I would imagine Google would get it fixed pretty quick
11:14:01 <somenerd[m]> > I have never looked at the cli, just the webinstall
11:14:01 <somenerd[m]> I believe that there's a web install to revert to stock
11:14:16 <dazinism> Once Google releases the fix in their monthly update Graphene should also get it
11:14:40 <catacombs[m]> actually, it was odd, Data would not work in Android.  the google forum had someone say that Pixel will not automatically download APN
11:14:50 <somenerd[m]> https://flash.android.com
11:15:02 <somenerd[m]> afaik, this is the flash tool to revert to stock
11:15:19 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
11:16:30 <catacombs[m]> after a lot of trouble,  and a few days, it just started working.   I suspect someone on ST tech fixed the carrier.  Possibly, just fixing it so it would use Verizon.  and I am leery about trusting just anyones version of Android or flashing tool
11:17:35 <somenerd[m]> I think the GrapheneOS one should work fine
11:17:40 <catacombs[m]> I guess I could trust a google site
11:17:43 <somenerd[m]> since it'll revert to the Pixel stock
11:18:09 <somenerd[m]> (it doesn't flash anything, just removes the GrapheneOS third party key)
11:18:36 <catacombs[m]> I would rather find a way to get the Graphene working.  Data and one or two apps and I am fixed
11:19:04 <somenerd[m]> yeah, that's probably a better idea
11:19:17 <dazinism> It is somewhat bizarre that all the carriers do stuff in different weird ways making it hard for phones to support them, rather than all doing the same thing
11:21:58 <dazinism> Carriers in the US have been particularly bad. Sprint requires the phone to include software which effectively allows them to do anything.  Good job they are going/gone
11:22:17 <catacombs[m]> Some of this is about money.   That I have to have a new sim card and a new monthly plan to move a number, to the same carrier, seems off to me.  My Iphone on ST and the same CDMA, perhaps an older SIM model, says TFW LTE.
11:23:53 <catacombs[m]> I keep looking for info, I have searched a bit.  I am not at putting Android back on.  Does Flash work if I  remove SIM card.
11:24:04 <dazinism> GrapheneOS never connected to Sprint because they required phones to have this
11:24:06 <dazinism> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMA_Device_Management
11:25:19 <dazinism> I think Verizon does/did want something similar, not quite as bad. But would still work without it included.
11:27:04 <dazinism> catacombs: having a Sim card in or out the phone should not effect its ability to flash an operating system
11:27:41 <catacombs[m]> well some group has locked this phones APN,  Might be the Pixel model, the SIM card, The Carrier in some way.  I have been told that Trac Fone owns Verizon, which sounds off to me, and on or the other of them has the franchise with Wal Mart, Straight Talk.   but they are all in cahoots together
11:28:10 <catacombs[m]> and what I thought about not having SIM card in while doing Flash is so it would not lock APN before I had a chance to get to it.
11:28:54 <dazinism> Yeah it can get confusing. Generally theres a few carriers that own the infrastructure, other companies pay to use that infrastructure
11:29:32 <dazinism> Then some companies have more than one carrier brand
11:29:50 <catacombs[m]> Perhaps wiser is to accept the inevitable let my older Iphone service lapse.  With my next Social Security Payment, buy a new SIM card and plan.
11:29:52 <dazinism> And then theres carriers buying or merging with other carriers
11:31:10 <dazinism> Also often a carrier is owned by a bigger telecoms company
11:31:13 <catacombs[m]> Yeah,   I think Straight Techs are capable of fixing this, but really are required to get me to spring for another plan at $63.00
11:35:24 <catacombs[m]> I think it may be a matter of who makes management decisions.   When I got to east Texas, I asked an engineer which carrier to use.   He said, do not use Verizon.   At one time the company had a lot of really good technical people, who put together a really reliable dependable fast system..  Verizon was bought up by businesses, management types, who proceeded to use company to pillage and plunder.  Made a
11:35:25 <catacombs[m]> lot of money.  Because of an oddity in where I live.  Verizon is the only carrier which works well.   Other companies do not want to invest in towers for a low population density area
11:36:53 <catacombs[m]> Canada has some interesting cell phone laws.   Carriers are not allowed to sell phones.   So one can actually see the deal versus the price.
11:48:00 <Wonderfall[m]> <trismous[m] "The problem I do have with the M"> An iPad wouldn't be an iPad with macOS. iOS has a strong security model, and while macOS has SIP and an app sandbox model too, it doesn't come close in that aspect.

18:36:12 <secrypt[m]> 10 is to new for that application
18:37:55 <TheLoneWanderer4> A10 no longer allows apps to access persistent hardware identifiers such as IMEI as mentioned above by secrypt
18:39:06 <TheLoneWanderer4> You'll get a blank value or an exception (if you target SDK29+)
18:43:27 <mistazaki[m]> I see .. I think it's because GO really2 privacy. So all A10 no longer allows apps to access persistent hardware.
18:43:30 <mistazaki[m]> Thanks
18:45:47 <TheLoneWanderer4> A10 in general. Not only GOS
18:47:09 <cyborgninjaneer[> Sorry if I've asked this before, but is the Firebase API able to send out information without the help of a Google Play Services installation?
18:55:00 <strcat[m]> if an app has network access, any of the code is able to send data to anything
19:29:58 <covid-1984[m]> Wow... And it's the ones you don't hear about: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH%2FfM%2FTsbmcZzwnXâŠ™kc/ "University Banned From Contributing To Linux Kernel For Intentionally Inserting Bugs" is the article that featured it.

19:37:16 <u5p4y[m]> I meant, can it be applied to desktop.
19:45:54 <u5p4y[m]> * I meant, if it can be applied to desktop.
19:46:40 <secrypt[m]> Depends on if your talking about windows or Linux
19:47:01 <secrypt[m]> And generally desktops are less secure out the box.
19:47:22 <secrypt[m]> In terms of browsers. Most browser exploits occur on windows.
19:56:24 <onyxrubber> hey, which FOSS e-mail client do you recommend for gmail account?
19:58:42 <mrx777[m]> K9Mail via fdroid
19:59:58 <mrx777[m]> FairMail is also recommended
20:00:16 <onyxrubber> fairmail cant handle gmail
20:01:34 <secrypt[m]> The best email client for gmail is gmail.com with push notifications enabled
20:01:47 <covid-1984[m]> <onyxrubber "fairmail cant handle gmail"> works for me
20:01:59 <covid-1984[m]> Just use the github built

20:02:18 <covid-1984[m]> Cuz I'm sure you have 2FA on ;)
20:04:12 <onyxrubber> mrx777[m] k9mail keep showing me alert, the app has been made for older android versions

20:20:53 <hypokeimenon[m]>  340 passwords?
20:20:55 <hypokeimenon[m]> Wow.
20:21:21 <hypokeimenon[m]> Sounds like you've had a lot of adventures on the internet.

22:31:45 <Cliff[m]> What are the pros and cons of downloading signal from aurora store instead of official apk from signal.org ?
22:34:12 <jj1013[m]> <Cliff[m] "What are the pros and cons of do"> You end up having to trust Google.
22:34:27 <jj1013[m]> <Cliff[m] "What are the pros and cons of do"> Why don't you use https://molly.im?
22:37:47 <skwisgaar[m]> Cliff: signal apk will prompt you when a new update is out. Aurora store version (google play) doesnâ€™t have that functionality.
22:38:21 <skwisgaar[m]> Functionality of the app is the same otherwise
22:43:33 <sign4l[m]> On GrapheneOS I get the message there is an update and I get the update...
22:52:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Which GrapheneOS features will (probably) never arrive upstream?
22:53:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and why?
22:54:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <gâ€‹ochoingles> root.
22:54:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <gâ€‹ochoingles> It is a huge downgrade in security, for which reason GrapheneOS avoids it at all costs.
22:55:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Nope dude, you didn't understand my question
22:56:10 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Which GrapheneOS feature will (probably) never arrive at upstream stock Android?
22:56:28 <Telegram-Bridge> <gâ€‹ochoingles> OH.
22:57:51 <Cliff[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "Cliff: signal apk will prompt yo"> I have been waiting for the auto update for the apk a couple weeks and still nothing do you know what might be the problem
23:00:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <gâ€‹ochoingles> Most likely LTE-only mode.
23:04:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Yeah, that's quite probable, but at least for me, LTE-only mode is not really usable
23:16:27 <skwisgaar[m]> Cliff: I have experienced that in the past, so I just switched to the aurora version. I donâ€™t know what the issue is.
23:17:02 <skwisgaar[m]> Are you sure there is a newer version available?
23:17:17 <skwisgaar[m]> Auto update seems like it works for most people

23:41:28 <jpds> Cliff[m]: Weird, I use the apk from the signal site and I'm on 5.7.6
23:45:23 <TheJollyRoger> @Hulk - features that won't arrive upstream likely include the hardened memory allocator, exec spawning, the hardened application runtime, network and sensors permission toggles, and hardened kernel and hardened libc. These changes will likely break some backwards compatibility.
23:47:29 <TheJollyRoger> In fast, modern, flagship phones, they have a near-negligible performance impact, but on extremely budget devices and older SoCs that are severely resource constrained, they also do also carry a perceptible performance impact, which some people will make a big deal out of, and let's not kid ourselves, a lot of android phones on the market today by the numbers are usually cheap budget
23:47:32 <TheJollyRoger> phones that are made by the lowest bidding ODM.
23:48:20 <TheJollyRoger> The network and sensors permission toggles are also forbidden by the Android compatibility documentation and standard, GrapheneOS deliberately chose to break away from the standard there.
23:50:43 <TheJollyRoger> Although this is not specific to GrapheneOS, Seedvault also will likely never be adopted upstream, simply as Google has their own backup system in place that ties the handset to the user's Google Account, and the need for a local, encrypted backup system is not seen as particularly desirable to them when they already treat the user's Google account as the root of trust for the phone.
23:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> Upstream has a very fine balancing act to meet: they need to cater to reverse compatibility, but they also need to bear in mind that Android isn't going to be running on ultrafast flagship phones, and it's likely going to be utilized by large numbers of embedded, low-power devices and older SoCs, as well as large numbers of cheap budget phones, many of which are on older generation
23:53:13 <TheJollyRoger> chips with substantially less memory, slower processors, and slower, older flash, or even eMMC storage rather than proper SSDs.
23:53:31 <Cliff[m]> <jpds "Cliff: Weird, I use the apk from"> I tried downloading a never version from the site before 5.5.5 and still no autoupdate do you use a vpn?
23:53:40 <TheJollyRoger> Since that's not a concern for us, GrapheneOS can afford to cut the past loose in favour of greater security.
23:53:55 <TheJollyRoger> Upstream isn't likely to make the same choice anytime soon, though.
23:54:47 <Cliff[m]> Does anyone know how many people use molly i cant find alot of info on it online is it rather new?
23:55:06 <TheJollyRoger> **when they already treat the user's Google account as the root of trust, for that particular user, on that device.
23:55:11 <Cliff[m]> Molly is nice that it updates through f droid
23:55:41 <TheJollyRoger> @!Hulk I hope this explains it, a little bit.
23:59:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Wow, thanks for the detailed answer TheJollyRoger! The amount of work done in GrapheneOS Project is really amazing. Let's keep the ship floating P.-)
23:59:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
