00:08:22 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> what part of Authy doesn’t work without Google services?
01:00:39 <mm3am[m]> What's the closest browser to vanadium on desktop?
01:01:07 <mm3am[m]> I know it doesn't utilize filter blocking, which is good.
01:37:20 <thomashensel[m]> propably brave though that comes with it's own problems but it's a semi hardened privacy focused version of chrome
02:43:08 <Wonderfall[m]> <mm3am[m] "What's the closest browser to va"> Probably regular Chromium
03:21:47 <squidward_snowde> Speaking of browsers... What do y’all think of what should be used on Mac? I heard Safari had decent anti-fingerprinting but I’m not sure how true that is or how it compares to chromium-based browsers for security.
03:23:40 <thomashensel[m]> Depends on your definition of security, if its just exploit mitigation and sandboxing than chrome/chromium is propably the safest. If it's privacy you are looking for, librewolf or brave (depending on wether you trust them) is propably best
03:29:23 <squidward_snowde> Yeah it’s tough
03:29:39 <squidward_snowde> Aw well. No browsing for me.
03:30:41 <thomashensel[m]> it's not tough, just depends on your choices
03:31:28 <squidward_snowde> Idk. I need to be sure the NSA can’t hack me. I have very sensitive pictures of my cats that are worth millions.
03:31:47 <thomashensel[m]> nsa can hack you anyway
03:32:36 <squidward_snowde> Hmmmmm. I followed the advice of some random youtuber so I’m pretty sure they can’t do anything. /s
03:51:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "Depends on your definition of se"> Tor browser
03:52:00 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's the only great privacy browser
03:52:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Brave is decent but Tor browser is best
03:53:14 <thomashensel[m]> librewolf implements a lot of featrues and mitigations from the tor browser and tor browserdoesn't have  alot of practical privacy features like ad blocking integrated
03:53:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Tor Browser has all the anti fingerprinting
03:53:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Ad blocking isn't proper privacy
03:54:09 <thomashensel[m]> it's more complicated then that
03:54:13 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Tor Browser quite certainly has many practical privacy features
03:55:02 <thomashensel[m]> and for daily use, tor browser + tor is not actually a great recommmendation because almost everyone will get annoyed by it fast and return to safari/chrome etc
03:55:18 <thomashensel[m]> better recommend something everyday useful and use tor when necessary
03:55:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Tor Browser is fine for daily use
03:55:39 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Pages load in 5 sec and are usable after 2 sec
03:55:56 <thomashensel[m]> using tor
03:55:58 <thomashensel[m]> ?
03:56:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Yes, how else
03:56:12 <thomashensel[m]> just wanted to be sure
03:56:18 <thomashensel[m]> i would call that impractical
03:56:24 <thomashensel[m]> and unusable for daily use
03:56:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "using tor"> Using clearnet? Using yggasidril? I2p?
03:56:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> :P
03:56:50 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "i would call that impractical"> No it's not
03:57:13 <thomashensel[m]> taking 5 seconds to load is enogh to make 90% of users ragequit
03:57:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> That's their fault then
03:57:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> That's not a long time at all
03:57:50 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Imagine what people did with dial up internet
03:58:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If slightly slower loading times mean much greater privacy, I'll take it
03:58:23 <thomashensel[m]> you would
03:58:25 <thomashensel[m]> most wont
03:58:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> People are far too impatient then
03:58:43 <thomashensel[m]> which is way recommending a privacy focused browser without tor gets people 90% there
03:58:57 <thomashensel[m]> bettter then chrome/safari
03:59:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If not Tor Browser use brave or safari
03:59:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Firefox browsers inherently have horrible security
04:00:09 <thomashensel[m]> proof it
04:00:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html
04:01:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Bad sandboxing, bad binary mixing, etc
04:01:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Firefox security is pathetic
04:03:34 <thomashensel[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Firefox security is pathetic"> unncessary polemic bs, chromium security is arguably better then firefox but that kind of rethoric doesn't help
04:03:40 <thomashensel[m]> isn't tor browser also firefox based
04:03:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Yes it is
04:04:15 <thomashensel[m]> well then it can't be "pathetic"
04:04:21 <thomashensel[m]> just not as good as chromes
04:04:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Yes, it can
04:04:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "well then it can't be "pathetic""> .
04:04:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Firefox has severe architectural issues
04:06:09 <thomashensel[m]> if it's good enough for the tor project it's good enough for me. You recommended it yourself
04:06:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Yes but it is still very insecure
04:07:08 <thomashensel[m]> depends on how you use it, in a qubes container it really doesn't matter much
04:07:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Firefox is still insecure
04:07:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just the insecurity is contained
04:07:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And there's still other sites
04:08:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Which malware, if exploited, can see
04:10:00 * thomashensel[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/IKndSigCLCJJfTOvnmCrVPMJ/message.txt >
04:10:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You can opt our
04:10:23 <thomashensel[m]> no need for malware to exploit it, thats literally built in
04:10:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * You can opt out
04:10:33 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "You can opt our"> .
04:10:51 <thomashensel[m]> i don't have to opt out when using librefox
04:11:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Ok?
04:11:16 <Railgun_Lover[m]> That doesn't matter much
04:11:40 <thomashensel[m]> matters enough for me that i wouldnt trust, use or recommend it
04:11:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just click a few buttons how hard is it
04:12:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Brave has decent anti fingerprinting
04:12:08 <thomashensel[m]> so has librefox
04:12:12 <thomashensel[m]> no cryptocurrency needed
04:12:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And librefox has horrible security
04:12:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "no cryptocurrency needed"> You don't need BAT to use brave
04:14:19 <thomashensel[m]> pff, i'd rather deal with questionable security on firefox by sandboxing it then with cryptoshit and reward program bs. In fact i'd rather use chrome then brave, it's impressive how many turnoffs they managed to integrate
04:14:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You can opt out of all of them
04:14:50 <thomashensel[m]> i don't trust their opt out
04:14:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Sandboxing Firefox won't make it any more secure
04:14:55 <thomashensel[m]> i don't trust them opting me in at a later point
04:14:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "i don't trust their opt out"> Wut
04:15:01 <thomashensel[m]> i don't believe in opt out in general
04:15:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Brave has been auditrd
04:15:18 <thomashensel[m]> sandboxing it in a qubes vm sure as fuck makes it more secure
04:15:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's open source too, if you prefer auditing by reading code
04:15:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "sandboxing it in a qubes vm sure"> No it doesnt
04:15:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just contains insecurity
04:16:10 <thomashensel[m]> which has the same result to me
04:16:35 <Railgun_Lover[m]>  No, malware in one site can now access all your sites
04:16:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It most certainly is not the "same result"
04:16:54 <thomashensel[m]> unless is seperate them via qubes which is the whole point
04:17:03 <thomashensel[m]> anything rmotely worth protecting gets their own cube
04:17:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Please explain how you separate Firefox sites
04:17:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> That's an internal sandboxing issue
04:18:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You won't sandbox it in QubesOs
04:18:14 * thomashensel[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/KETFeTsocEJYZxhUsdJKxrLz/message.txt >
04:18:30 <thomashensel[m]> no better sandboxing is possible on a singular machine
04:19:09 <thomashensel[m]> arguably, for onlinebanking it's not entirely a bad idea to use a seperate devicec entirely
04:19:13 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But then any sites you visit inside those will still be visible to malware...it's not a proper substitution for a secure browser anyway
04:19:35 <thomashensel[m]> In my banking qube i don't visit any other websites, neither do i do it in my mail
04:19:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Firefox inherently is insecure
04:19:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "In my banking qube i don't visit"> Yes but your general web browsing too
04:19:53 <thomashensel[m]> in the disposible qubes, that might be possible but they are short lived
04:20:25 <thomashensel[m]> and agian, it couldnt get to the actually critical parts like email, banking etc
04:20:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Using qubesos is very resource hungry, it's not for most people
04:20:39 <thomashensel[m]> > its not for most people
04:20:39 <thomashensel[m]> > recommends tor for daily use
04:20:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Yes, because tor browser is not alow
04:21:09 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Yes, you get captchas
04:21:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You can use brave when tor impossible
04:21:56 <thomashensel[m]> i just prefer a decent vpn setup over tor. Trumps it speedwise and the privacy is "enough" for my purposes
04:22:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And Firefox is insecure regardless of your setup
04:22:04 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "i just prefer a decent vpn setup"> No
04:22:12 <Railgun_Lover[m]> For your purposes maybe
04:22:34 <thomashensel[m]> please show me how you could hack my banking firefox in it's own qubes vm
04:22:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> What is a "decent VPN setup" by your standards
04:23:01 <thomashensel[m]> really, please do, it's important for me to make sure its setup as secure as i can because in practice, thats what my livelyhood actually depends on
04:23:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "please show me how you could hac"> That doesn't change that Firefox is inherently insecure
04:23:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Certainly you can take steps to mitigate that
04:23:45 <thomashensel[m]> irregardless of setup, which is my point, given a decent setup the security is almost meaningless
04:23:54 <thomashensel[m]> but again
04:23:56 <thomashensel[m]> i agree
04:24:02 <thomashensel[m]> secuirty wise chromium > firefox
04:24:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "irregardless of setup, which is "> What? It's not meaningless
04:24:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Without security you can't sustain privacy
04:24:46 <thomashensel[m]> > tor browser disagrees
04:24:59 <thomashensel[m]> as for vpn
04:24:59 <thomashensel[m]> in my case, mullvad Vpn running on my openwrt router paid by cash
04:25:17 <thomashensel[m]> enough to prevent your general litigation type issues
04:25:34 <thomashensel[m]> and propably a lot of government agencies too
04:25:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "and propably a lot of government"> No definitely not
04:26:03 <thomashensel[m]> lol, most definelty, given what is public knowledge about german governemnt agencies
04:26:13 <thomashensel[m]> posteo.de regularly publishes reports
04:26:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They can easily force mullvad to log
04:26:22 <thomashensel[m]> they could
04:26:24 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Traffic correlation is easy
04:26:40 <thomashensel[m]> possible but not easy
04:26:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * Traffic analysis us easy
04:26:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * Traffic analysis is easy
04:26:53 <thomashensel[m]> most agenecy arent even able to file a valid request for data to a company as proven by posteo.de privacy report
04:27:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> No, that's not true
04:27:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Actually it is
04:27:33 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Wait let me get established
04:27:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Ok
04:27:51 <thomashensel[m]> https://posteo.de/en/site/transparency_report
04:28:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> There are many ways to defeat VPNs without forcing logging
04:28:04 <thomashensel[m]> of 22 request, 20 were formally incorrect thus denied by posteo
04:28:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> The website about Firefox also talks about vpns
04:28:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You should read that
04:30:32 <thomashensel[m]> i have pretty detailed knowledge of it. again it depends on your threat scenario. Mine is external websites tracing my via IP adresses and litigation from the copyright mafia. If the german governemnt wants to fuck with my they can just send a SWAT Team.
04:30:57 <thomashensel[m]> for that, mullvad works just fine
04:31:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Certainly
04:31:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If that's all you care about then yes
04:32:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Ip address is almost irrelevant tho
04:32:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> For websites
04:32:11 <thomashensel[m]> and again, the german government is barely able to send a correct request for accessing my webmail, unless your a terrorist or a high value target a vpn in a diffreent jurisdiction protects you a lot even from the governemnt
04:32:21 <thomashensel[m]> hatespeech laws for example
04:32:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> The data requests for posteo could have been faked
04:33:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Do you think agencies are stupid?
04:33:22 <thomashensel[m]> some of them sure are, at least here in germany
04:33:42 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Intelligence agencies are highly intelligent and sophisticated
04:33:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Its in the name
04:34:14 <thomashensel[m]> the german verfassungsschutz, the ones supposed to protect the constitution, also an intelligence agency, "accidentaly" supported a right wing murder squad for decades
04:34:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> That doesn't make them stupid
04:35:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They know what they want, and they make plans for getting it
04:35:09 <thomashensel[m]> malicious or stupid, my bet is on the formet but who knows
04:35:29 <thomashensel[m]> sure if i became a high value target they could get me but just using e2e crypto, a vpn and a decent browsersetup makes dragnet surveillance a hell of a lot harder
04:35:34 <thomashensel[m]> thats enough for me
04:35:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Anyway vpns are not a proper way of privacy for anything above your use case
04:35:43 <thomashensel[m]> sure
04:36:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "sure if i became a high value ta"> NSA kills based on metadata
04:36:24 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If they see the wrong communication patterns, expect to be drone striked
04:36:43 <thomashensel[m]> prove a single drone strike ever happened inside german territory
04:36:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> A hellfire missile is a terrible way to go
04:36:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <thomashensel[m] "prove a single drone strike ever"> Don't be pedantic
04:37:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> My point stands
04:37:05 <thomashensel[m]> dont be paranoid
04:37:06 <sign4l[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Apple products offer great priva"> I totally disagree... Apple is payed 2 billion dollars every year from Google to have set it at default search engine. All this "privacy" they marketing is only to fight Facebook at the moment...

04:37:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Seems simple
04:37:39 <thomashensel[m]> yeah apple is using privacy as a red hering

04:39:11 <thomashensel[m]> they are likely better then not using any

04:40:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> sign4l: why shouldn't apple accept billions of dollars
04:40:49 <thomashensel[m]> my vpn provider does not. they still might but it's less likely. My point is you critisize products for their privcay and security by sighting drone strikes as an example, yet reject scepticism against apple for very obvious reasons
04:40:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> sign4l: Google search is what people are familiar with and it's the best engine

10:03:32 <jalb> Hello, what's the difference about the encryption between a normal android smartphone and GOS?
10:04:10 <jalb> I watched a program yesterday and how they extract information from 98% of smartphones today doing forensics
10:05:14 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <thomashensel[m] "Depends on your definition of se"> Using librewolf sounds like a great way of being fingerprinted

10:18:14 <jalb> that's true, they say that when it's not possible they use other  techniques
10:18:23 <jalb> maybe it's something that was remained in memory?
10:18:25 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> As a general rule, if law enforcement take your phone away, then give it back to you, you should never use it again
10:18:38 <jalb> ha ha yes
10:19:05 <jalb> in fact this person is a former intelligence agent
10:19:13 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> And just use a iPhone 12 or Pixel with Titan M and disable cloud backups, you will be ok
10:19:32 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> Unless you are a serious target like Snowden
10:19:48 <jalb> and the other is a company here that collaborates with police, government, etc
10:20:20 <jalb> they also extract information about drones, gps devices, etc
10:20:33 <jalb> Well, I think Pixels are safe
10:20:36 <jalb> :)
10:22:55 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> An example of a secure setup would be to use GrapheneOS on a newer Pixel device, and use a secondary user profile (not the admin profile) as your daily driver
10:23:20 <jalb> yes, that's what I do
10:23:30 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> And install the minimal number of apps, through Aurora Store

10:25:00 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> Most ppl in the world, for example in 3rd world countries, use low-cost, insecure android phones
10:25:24 <jalb> Yes

12:57:21 <snowlynx[m]> But Daniel Micay said most Titan M firmware is updatable so that's a point for Pixels 😁

13:15:58 <Guest50779> snowlynx: please stop spreading FUD, thanks
13:16:22 <Guest50779> not going to have much patience for it atm
13:16:44 <jpds> Guest50779: They did provide sources
13:17:26 <Guest50779> sources for what?
13:17:47 <jpds> Guest50779: For what they were talking about
13:17:49 <Guest50779> they linked an article which has been identified as FUD here on multiple occasions, and they repeatedly try to spread misleading claims about things
13:17:51 <Guest50779> no, they didn't
13:18:26 <Guest50779> moderation of the channel isn't up for debate
13:18:29 <Guest50779> they've been doing this for days
13:18:43 <jpds> OK, so what exactly are you referring to as "FUD"?
13:19:28 <Guest50779> they know what I'm referring to
13:19:33 <Guest50779> because they've been told multiple times
13:20:19 <GhostSplinterSix> <jpds "OK, so what exactly are you refe"> FUD is an acronym for "Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt."
13:20:30 <jpds> GhostSplinterSix: I know that
13:20:56 <GhostSplinterSix> Okay.
13:21:02 <Guest50779> this isn't an appropriate place to debate channel moderation, if you want to do that you do it out-of-band
13:21:17 <Guest50779> please don't get involved in moderation of the channel if you aren't a moderator
13:21:22 <Guest50779> it will result in a ban
13:21:38 <jpds> Guest50779: Part of the issue is that from IRC, you're just showing up as "guest"
13:22:40 <madaidan[m]> <jpds "strcat: Part of the issue is tha"> Saw that from Telegram too. Weird.
13:23:34 <jpds> So it just looks like a random person to going "FUD!!!"
13:25:01 <jpds> And back to guest
13:27:33 <snowlynx[m]> strcat: sorry no idea what you are referring to I am not spreading one of these spreading FUD. He got a CVE and a reward, it's too easy to just delete it
13:28:08 <strcat[m]> think you misunderstand what a CVE is
13:28:22 <strcat[m]> and it has been stated multiple times that article makes misrepresentations and inaccurate claims
13:28:40 <strcat[m]> the fact that there was a valid bug does not in any way demonstrate that post doesn't do those things
13:28:49 <strcat[m]> and for the past several days you've repeatedly made misleading claims about this topic
13:29:15 <snowlynx[m]> What are you talking about??
13:30:07 <strcat[m]> stop trying to mislead people about it
13:30:07 <strcat[m]> thanks
13:31:14 <strcat[m]> 09:00:04      snowlynx[m] | Just make sure to check 🤣
13:31:16 <strcat[m]> just stop
13:34:21 <snowlynx[m]> His Titan M firmware got not updated. Another reddit user posted an adb output proving the same. Google aknowledged it. I don't get your problem except it makes your claims about perfect Titan M look bad? Sorry that's really not a way serious people like you should talk, discrediting others like that. Have fun.
13:37:38 <strcat[m]> never made any such claims and snowlynx has spent days spreading inaccurate claims
13:38:42 <strcat[m]> trying to create unnecessary concern about something via misinformation
13:39:18 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure what people not having updated firmware on devices they have unlocked and run a non-production OS on is meant to 'prove'
13:39:35 <strcat[m]> the Titan M is not supposed to accept firmware updates from the OS if it does not properly authenticate
13:39:45 <strcat[m]>  * the Titan M is not supposed to accept firmware updates from the OS if it does not properly authenticate when the user logs into the Owner account
13:40:02 <Cliff[m]> <CrowmacMcCarthy[ "Since fdroid's security is worse"> Source?
13:40:04 <strcat[m]> if you have an OS that does not properly set that up and do it, it's not supposed to accept updates, until it's wiped via factory reset
13:40:28 <strcat[m]> people spreading false claims and insinuations here is not permitted
13:40:51 <strcat[m]> taking a real issue and misrepresenting repeatedly in order to repeatedly try to create concern about something that is not a problem is not allowed and will result in a ban
13:41:01 <strcat[m]>  * taking a real issue and misrepresenting it repeatedly in order to repeatedly try to create concern about something that is not a problem is not allowed and will result in a ban
13:41:11 <strcat[m]> if you're going to be consistently dishonest in these channels, you won't last long
13:41:51 <strcat[m]> there are sometimes people who come here and their only input is to repeatedly concern troll about topics, day after day, making misrepresentations and false claims about them
13:42:12 <strcat[m]> and based on analysis of hostmasks, sessions, etc. among other things it is quite clear that it's the same few people
13:42:19 <strcat[m]> more than tired of it
13:42:55 <strcat[m]> the Titan M had a real issue where some exceptions thrown in the Titan M were not properly reported by the OS API, that is fixed
13:43:11 <strcat[m]> updates of it work fine, GrapheneOS has never had any issues with that
13:43:38 <strcat[m]> other alternative OSes have had issues, and things like Magisk have been known to break it too
13:43:41 <strcat[m]> not a firmware issue
13:45:26 <strcat[m]> I should not need to invest my time into repeatedly debunking clearly false and misleading claims, over and over again
13:45:30 <strcat[m]> the same ones
13:45:31 <strcat[m]> simply going to be banning people who do this stuff more eagerly
13:46:04 <strcat[m]> tired of people concern trolling
13:46:24 <strcat[m]> trying to make other people worried about non-existent problems they've been repeatedly told aren't an issue
13:46:57 <strcat[m]> that Titan M error reporting issue was fixed 2 years ago and the firmware update thing is a security feature...
13:47:46 <strcat[m]> (and lack of supported combination of options was / is lack of a feature, not a security bug, the only bug was that it didn't report the exception thrown, but rather returned something like 0xdeadbeef as the result)
13:50:18 <strcat[m]> instead of contributing people constantly raid the channel, use sockpuppets, concern troll and generally try to cause problems, drama, conflict and burn time/energy of developers
13:50:38 <strcat[m]> this channel will be closed down if it isn't beneficial
13:52:00 <strcat[m]> again, this is perhaps the 30th time debunking this same thing, and as always someone uses it as an opportunity to try attacking the project and myself based on the moderation
13:52:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> <Cliff[m] "Source?"> Have a look at the channel logs for offtopic and on topic, and look at the FDroid issues themselves. Should find a bit about where they admit they need to improve.
13:52:33 <strcat[m]> very clear that we simply need to start banning people that are malicious much earlier rather than assuming good faith for so long and simply not explaining why
13:52:53 <strcat[m]> do not actually have to explain why someone is being banned, and if that's causing harm then we simply won't
13:55:27 <Cliff[m]> hypokeimenon 🏳️‍🌈 how can i check the log using element?
13:56:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> Using Element? I would just use the search in that case.
13:56:58 <hypokeimenon[m]> I guess you might get to discussions quicker with a keyword like "v1"
14:43:18 <cstrrider[m]> So I just noticed an app called Fritter in F-Droid that let's you follow people on Twitter without being logged in to an account. Since I use twitter like a glorified RSS feed and rarely answer, this is perfect, but Fritter seems a bit bare bones. Is there any other apps that allow for something similar?
14:44:32 <cstrrider[m]> It would be nice to be able to export the list of users at least so I don't have to reenter the 75 or so that I follow if I reinstall
15:12:41 <pkgbuild[m]> Anyone had issues with WiFi after latest update?
15:24:22 <theychuckthisfro> I haven't noticed anything.
15:45:13 <pkgbuild[m]> I can't connect, after send the message it connected, now after lost connection with my WiFi I'm again disconnected and can't connect to
15:49:38 <pkgbuild[m]> It's happened again 😳
15:55:17 <strcat[m]> pkgbuild: probably an issue with the Wi-Fi network
15:55:35 <strcat[m]> such as the router having a broken DHCP implementation not clearing out entries when it gets full
15:55:43 <strcat[m]> unlikely that it has anything to do with an update
15:55:52 <strcat[m]> just because something happened after you rebooted for an update doesn't mean the update caused it
16:00:07 <pkgbuild[m]> Isn't happening anymore but I also checked the router I will try to use per-network Mac address now and adding it 🤷‍♂️
16:00:44 <pkgbuild[m]> Anyway if you use an qr code to join the network the camera icon remain on the upper bar until the settings app isn't closed
16:01:19 <Telegram-Bridge> Luke (@L​73689) has joined the Telegram Group!
16:13:33 <strcat[m]> pkgbuild: known that it works that way, and you don't need to close it
16:13:44 <strcat[m]> it will stop when it has been in the background for a while
18:22:35 <squirtdrinkr> Is there any FOSS recovery software to extract data from a broken Android phone? The phone in question is a Sony Xperia XZ F8332. Battery will not charge, and computer doesn't recognize it when plugged in. This phone did not have any custom OS loaded.
18:25:05 <strcat[m]> don't see how you'd extract it due to encryption
18:25:14 <strcat[m]> if it can't boot then you're not getting anything off it
18:25:39 <strcat[m]> look at https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption for how it works on devices with full hardware encryption support
18:26:19 <strcat[m]> but even crappy low-end phones have enough hardware support that if you can't boot up the SoC / OS you aren't getting the data without sophisticated tooling/exploits
18:56:29 <Thatcher[m]> All those nudes... Gone.
19:20:43 <squirtdrinkr> Yep. gg
19:26:25 <crazycryptofreak> Hey guys I know it's offtopic but can anyone help me to connect dino-im using tor in tails ? Looks like I can't get a connection to jabber servers and no idea where to config.
19:26:25 <crazycryptofreak> Starting from comandline with "torsocks dino-im" doesn't work
19:48:01 <jpds> crazycryptofreak: What exactly do you mean by "doesn"
19:48:05 <jpds> 't work*
19:51:22 <abff> crazycryptofreak: you properly configured the socks5 proxy in dino?
19:52:01 <jpds> crazycryptofreak: The wiki says the command is "torsocks dino" by the way
20:39:57 <whiskey0111[m]> Which smartphone OS would you recommend users for which Graphene is too complex (like elder people)?
20:40:17 <mefistofeles> iOS
20:41:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <m​adaidan> How is GrapheneOS too complex? It functions just like any other Android device.
20:41:37 <whiskey0111[m]> yeah but you cant use all apps from the app store
20:42:21 <GhostSplinterSix> Like what?
20:42:32 <whiskey0111[m]> and it lacks many accessibility/design settings, like accent colors, vibration strength....
20:42:41 <whiskey0111[m]> for example snapchat
20:43:21 <whiskey0111[m]> thats the only one i noticed, but many apps need google services to work
20:44:10 <mefistofeles> bank apps
20:44:16 <GhostSplinterSix> Using SnapChat and Google on this OS would defeat the whole purpose of the OS...
20:44:41 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> GhostSplinterSix: that's not true
20:44:55 <whiskey0111[m]> yes but still you need some knowledge to use Graphene
20:45:04 <Cliff[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "Using SnapChat and Google on thi"> ??
20:45:04 <whiskey0111[m]> its not built for the normies
20:45:28 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Privacy is not the only goal of GrapheneOS project
20:45:34 <whiskey0111[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "Using SnapChat and Google on thi"> yes but some people want to use it, its their choice
20:46:12 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> whiskey0111[m]: it's either GrapheneOS or stock
20:46:29 <GhostSplinterSix> Sure it is, Hulk. GrapheneOS is  security-hardened and privacy focused.
20:46:37 <whiskey0111[m]> ok what about iOS?
20:46:40 <skwisgaar[m]> Graphene is designed to be a flexible OS. If your use case involves google services or whatever, then there’s nothing wrong with that.
20:46:45 <GhostSplinterSix> * Sure it is, Hulk. GrapheneOS is  security-hardened and privacy focused.
20:46:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> iOS is stock
20:47:03 <skwisgaar[m]> If you read the website, it doesn’t take a stance against google services (beyond the invasiveness of play services)
20:47:06 <whiskey0111[m]> oh ok 😅👍
20:48:26 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Just a sec, let me get a link
20:48:29 <GhostSplinterSix> <skwisgaar[m] "If you read the website, it does"> Correct. GrapheneOS will never include either Google Play services or another implementation of Google services like microG. There's a reason for that.
20:50:26 <skwisgaar[m]> Yeah exactly. My point is that if you need to use an app that has privacy issues then graphene is a perfect place to use it, especially in a separate profile if you’re extra concerned.
20:50:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> +++
20:51:06 <skwisgaar[m]> You benefit from having excellent security and privacy, better than basically any other OS
20:52:33 <jpds> whiskey0111[m]: If they find Graphene complex, which is stock Android, then presumably they'll find any Android complex
20:53:56 <GhostSplinterSix> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> +++"> What is "+++" supposed to mean?
20:55:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Means "I agree with the above statement"

21:38:13 <mermator[m]> Does the pixel 4 have a camerablocking phone case?
21:38:32 <mermator[m]> Ed snowden recommended to remove the camera and the microphone and to install graphene os
21:38:39 <mermator[m]> However removing the camera seems a bit drastic
21:39:02 <mermator[m]> Does anyone know where to buy a phone case that blocks the front facing camera
21:39:09 <topipik> Just use electrical tape and case over it to stay in place
21:40:04 <strcat[m]> mermator: there are cases like that and also little camera shutters you can open/close
21:40:18 <strcat[m]> which you stick on
21:41:31 <strcat[m]> https://www.amazon.com/EYSOFT-Webcam-Cover-0-7MM-Thin/dp/B075FCNF4B/ these are presumably total garbage but just as an example of what I mean
21:42:06 <strcat[m]> it's only relevant if your device is actually deeply compromised, i.e. they compromised the OS and got all your data, etc.
21:42:28 <mermator[m]> Something like that would be perfect for a phone
21:42:50 <mermator[m]> Better to assume you're already compromised as a way to not give anyone the data they would need
21:43:11 <strcat[m]> otherwise just don't give camera perm to apps other than your camera app (and even then, the camera app can't use camera permission in the background, only when in foreground, and it shows an indicator)
