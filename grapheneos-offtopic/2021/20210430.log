01:00:17 <koncrete[m]> Does anyone know a way to use and open a usb drive on a insecure laptop for example a school laptop
01:21:46 <entry1> <koncrete[m] "Does anyone know a way to use an"> So the contents that are sensitive are on the USB drive?
01:23:06 <entry1> If you only care about opening the files, create a TailsOS bootable USB then boot the insecure device using it (only if you know the Bios isn't compromised). Don't connect to the internet once TailsOS opens, and then plug in your USB
01:43:37 <Baobab> >Does anyone know a way to use and open a usb drive on a insecure laptop for example a school laptop
01:43:37 <Baobab> I'm not sure what you're trying to do.
01:47:17 <Thatcher[m]> You can use a laptop to open a usb drive, but you will probably scratch the laptop if you aren't careful. I would use a workbench or some other hard surface. Depending on the usb drive, you can use some pliers and a flathead screwdriver to try and pry it open.
01:47:45 <Thatcher[m]> In all seriousness, use Tails as suggested by entry1
01:48:32 <GhostSplinterSix> Tails 🤓
01:50:05 <Thatcher[m]> I haven't used Tails since like 2014 and gosh darn has it come a long, long way. I remember this shit looking like windows xp
01:50:52 <Thatcher[m]> It used to have a Windows XP decoy mode
01:51:35 <entry1> <Thatcher[m] "I haven't used Tails since like "> Not much different now lol. Yeah I'm astounded by how little lack of funding it has. GrapheneOS and Tails are probably the coolest OS's out there imo
01:51:55 <entry1> * Not much different now lol. Yeah I'm astounded by how lack of funding it has. GrapheneOS and Tails are probably the coolest OS's out there imo. Deserve so much more attention
01:52:56 <Thatcher[m]> I heartily agree that Graphene and Tails are the coolest OS's.
01:54:54 <acronym[m]> <koncrete[m] "Does anyone know a way to use an"> Would Cryptomator portable be an option?
01:55:03 <Thatcher[m]> This is really awesome. I had to recover some stuff from an old neglected laptop of mine and it was between using Tails and Parted Magic. Now that Parted Magic has a subscription, Tails it was.
02:13:35 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm trying to be responsible and resist splurging on a Librem 14 and QubesOS flash drive and instead save up for them lol.
02:14:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I'm trying to be responsible and"> Nah, Chromebooks are fine, they support custom verified boot keys
02:15:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Chrome OS though...meh
02:16:13 <GhostSplinterSix> Not sure what Chromebooks have to do with me wanting to purchase a Librem 14.
02:16:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "Not sure what Chromebooks have t"> What I mean is that if you want security Chromebooks are probably the best
02:16:50 <Baobab> If you really wanted to, you can use depthcharge with any corebootable device.
02:17:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> MacBooks and Surface are also nice, surface is still behind but catching up
02:18:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> MacBooks physically disconnect the microphone and the camera light is hardware based, it is in the circuit for the camera so impossible for malware to disable it
02:18:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * MacBooks physically disconnect the microphone when closed and the camera light is hardware based, it is in the circuit for the camera so impossible for malware to disable it

02:19:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Chromebooks kinda suck for other stuff but security is almost unmatched
02:19:52 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Plus they retain security when you use other OSes unlike Apple stuff
02:20:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> School Chromebooks are pretty crap tho
02:20:55 <Baobab> I don't think locking down an os to the point that it's only chrome + a file manager is a good idea.
02:21:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Theres a Chromeos flag you can change to enable local account signin
02:21:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Baobab "I don't think locking down an os"> Yeah
02:21:06 <Baobab> *depending on what you want to do

02:23:20 <Baobab> Mine's 128GB of storage

02:23:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Baobab "Mine's 128GB of storage"> Ok better
02:23:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> That's actually decent storage
02:23:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> When I looked up c201 all the first search results were 2GB RAM 16GB storage
02:23:59 <Baobab> I think even including my Music, it only takes up 14GB.
02:24:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Dang
02:24:41 <Baobab> I have Gentoo instead of chromeos, so I'm not sure if that changes things.
02:24:46 <Baobab> *space wise
02:25:13 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Linux is fun
02:25:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It powers practically everything
02:26:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Servers helicopters nuclear plants desktops Android chromeos
02:26:05 <Baobab> yeah, you can have a lot of fun with messing around with it
02:26:35 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Honestly im glad Linux focuses on performance rather than security
02:26:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It makes it what it is
02:27:09 <Baobab> You can easily apply patches to it to harden it.
02:27:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's still an insecure kernel
02:27:54 <Baobab> and compiling your own kernel with minimal configs also helps
02:28:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Linux security is a disaster, putting patches is only a small fix which doesn't remove the underlying issue of a complex, monolithic kernel
02:28:39 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's like 30 million lines
02:28:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Sure you can compile your own, but it is still insecure
02:29:16 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just less so
02:29:21 <Baobab> Well the thing is most kernels are very monolithic.
02:29:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's why Google is switching to Fuchsia
02:29:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Baobab "Well the thing is most kernels a"> Yes but they realize that it's an isur
02:29:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * Yes but they realize that it's an issue
02:29:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Linux doesn't care
02:30:23 <Baobab> A thing that I don't like about linux is that they're more like a rolling release.
02:30:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If fuchsia can retain Linux stability, performance, and resource requirement then I will switch to it
02:30:42 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Baobab "A thing that I don't like about "> Eh
02:30:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Could use debian
02:30:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Or derivatives
02:30:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They're not rolling releade
02:31:05 <Baobab> Well even if you're using lts it's very rolling-like
02:31:09 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * They're not rolling release
02:32:21 <Baobab> >It's like 30 million lines
02:32:21 <Baobab> I get your point, but I think it's nuanced than that.
02:33:23 <Baobab> Typically big projects are divided into much smaller sections.
02:35:31 <Baobab> So it isn't like you have one big blob of code that everyone tries to make sense of.
02:42:32 <Baobab> >very rolling-like
02:42:32 <Baobab> Probably a poor choice of words, what I mean is the linux kernel is very fast paced.

11:13:36 <Wonderfall[m]> Too bad GDPR did nothing to enforce it
11:16:04 <Wonderfall[m]> And it's not that useful, most websites don't really care. You tell them you would like not to be tracked, but really it's just a HTTP header field. Nothing forces them to respect that

17:41:33 <helloworldkk87[m> Tbh depends on your threat model, its your call. If you do go with linux go for something like Qubes (Qubes is not linux tho), whonix or tails
17:42:41 <helloworldkk87[m> Madaidan has also written a good linux hardening guide tho it wont fix everything https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html
17:43:32 <GhostSplinterSix> <helloworldkk87[m "Tbh depends on your threat model"> I agree. QubesOS, Tails OS and Whonix are consistently among the best privacy- and/or security-related OSes.

18:15:31 <GhostSplinterSix> 👎🏻
18:19:45 <TheJollyRoger> pkgbuild[m]: I would say that GrapheneOS is probably the best operating system to keep invasive apps contained, if you want to keep them away from your contact list and then freeze them when you aren't using them, by all means install them into a separate profile. Of course, they may refuse to run without Google Play Services, just a heads-up.
18:20:22 <pkgbuild[m]> 👍️
18:20:34 <pkgbuild[m]> Thank you.
18:20:38 <TheJollyRoger> Hope this helps!
18:21:24 <TheJollyRoger> Note that in the case of apps like Instagram, GMail, and such, it's entirely possible that the app could be entirely privacy-respecting, but the service that it dials out to invasive.
18:22:01 <TheJollyRoger> So you will have to bear that in mind; it's possible for apps to be respecting but the service they depend upon itself be invasive.
18:22:14 <TheJollyRoger> All it requires is the right design.
18:24:12 <TheJollyRoger> *the service that it dials out to be invasive.
18:25:40 <covid-1984[m]> <pkgbuild[m] "what you think, install instragr"> The only one you need is Instagram right?
18:26:18 <covid-1984[m]> Gmail -> use another client
18:26:22 <covid-1984[m]> YouTube -> use browser

18:27:48 <Baobab> If you really want to use instagram, there's a project on sr.ht that acts like an instagram sanitizer.
18:28:08 <pkgbuild[m]> Yes, that is the point to imagine GOS the best OS to have one of these installed in a profile made only for this, we can't do nothing in how the service is used and my number is public, anyway i have another question, when an app have in their permission to read the biometric sensor what they mean?
18:28:17 <covid-1984[m]> Last time I tried sr.ht it barely worked for instagram
18:28:56 <covid-1984[m]> <pkgbuild[m] "Yes, that is the point to imagin"> GOS doesn't solve the problem when an app needs some access for it to work correctly, and you give it that access.

18:47:51 <covid-1984[m]> I'm on Linux and I love it and will not get into security discussion about it in this channel :)
18:49:39 <TheJollyRoger> I think all of us in this channel love Linux to some extent. Windows NT stopped supporting my architecture of choice in the 1990's, and Macintosh OS did the same in 2005.
18:51:07 <Baobab> >To read all the Linux insecure stuff, I was like oh nooooooo
18:51:07 <Baobab> It depends on what you're trying to do.
18:51:29 <TheJollyRoger> Well, again, just because I love Linux, it doesn't mean I can't criticise it.
18:52:32 <TheJollyRoger> I'm a big fan of Star Wars, but at the same time, I'll also be the first person to tell you stuff I don't like about it if asked, and a lot of the time I find myself agreeing with a lot of the negative things that some people say about the Prequels and the Sequels and the Extended Universe.
18:52:51 <TheJollyRoger> That doesn't mean I don't like Star Wars. It means that I don't like certain parts of it.
18:53:27 <r0tt0r[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Well, again, just because I love"> with some efforts and compiling you can integrate grsecurity selinux and other stuff. i did so but selinux for example can be a bitch when trying to create rulesets
18:54:16 <TheJollyRoger> I think that's something everyone needs to realize; liking something is not a simple binary choice. We're not computers, we just use them. We're often complex beings and it's possible for us to like certain parts and facets of something, without liking, or even disliking other facets or other parts.
18:55:10 <TheJollyRoger> r0tt0r[m]: yep! You certainly can! I was actually trying to create an SELinux profile for POWERPC64 in Little Endian for a bit. There's still much more I need to learn to do it.
18:55:38 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I'm a big fan of Star Wars, but "> Honestly, people can not complain about the small main character death count of the sequel trilogy IMO. There are times which main characters survived deaths by miracle in the original trilogy.
18:55:38 <r0tt0r[m]> yep true words. thats why we use gos, we sacrifice some to gain other aimings
18:56:10 <TheJollyRoger> I do have the prerequisite SELinux stuff installed, just I have no profiles and no rules yet; so once I booted the computer in enforcing mode by accident and then wondered why the computer wouldn't allow me to do anything at all.
18:57:07 <r0tt0r[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I do have the prerequisite SELin"> hehe ye i guess everyone started there..like the first time using vi..how tf to exit this,
18:57:08 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: Yeah, I'm still kind of salty about my favourite main character being written out in a way that stuck me as being somewhat mean-spirited to everyone who liked that character.

18:59:14 <Baobab> jj1013[m], qubes doesn't really solve anything.
18:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: not quite. The Xen Hypervisor has a considerable amount of attack surface, and needs a considerable amount of hardware support.
18:59:38 <TheJollyRoger> It also uses virtualization as a panacea, while forgoing the hardening of the individual domains.

19:00:36 <jj1013[m]> Sure thing.
19:01:18 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: Qubes is not perfect, far from it. That's the thing about software; at this point in time, software is still quite an immature field in technology and it's progressing much faster than we can collectively understand it.
19:02:11 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "jj1013.: Qubes is not perfect, f"> Worse yet ─ I can't find a way to trust Windows 10 without not updating.
19:02:30 <Baobab> Qubes is only secure as the profiles that powers it.
19:02:31 <TheJollyRoger> So while Qubes is a very worthwhile and a very meaningful effort to use existing software provisionally to port a mobile-like security model to the desktop, it's not perfect.
19:02:37 <TheJollyRoger> Baobab: Spot on!
19:03:18 <jj1013[m]> And I'm not sure what's the non-bloated non-security-downgraded version I can get.
19:03:40 <r0tt0r[m]> <jj1013[m] "Worse yet ─ I can't find a way t"> good, as soon you not trust you handle it different. see lulzsec hackers got catched. dont think these guys only run tor and vpn and thought their securw
19:03:41 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: To be honest, if you're not updating Windows 10, you are doing it wrong.
19:04:32 <Baobab> >Qubes is only secure as the profiles that powers it.
19:04:32 <Baobab> As in using a debian profile + fedora profile on a qubes machine is no better than plain debian on machine A and plain fedora on machine B.
19:04:33 <jj1013[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "good, as soon you not trust you "> What?
19:04:42 <TheJollyRoger> Remember what I've said about software: it's inexact. It's in a state of continual obsolescence, because security is always going to be relative to the progression of exploits.
19:04:58 <TheJollyRoger> The best you can do, is continually patch, and hope for the best.
19:05:32 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "jj1013.: To be honest, if you're"> That's the point.
19:05:57 <TheJollyRoger> If you've decided to go full on TPU and decide to stop patching, you've essentially chosen to let exploits continue to get better while doing nothing to match them.
19:06:11 <r0tt0r[m]> <jj1013[m] "What?"> you remember lulzsec hackers? read how they got hacked by one member working for 3char agency. and these are not ppl that only install tor and be on the secure side
19:06:46 <jj1013[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "you remember lulzsec hackers? re"> I'll research on that...
19:06:47 <r0tt0r[m]> i bet they had a lot of precautions, security protocols, mobitoring etc
19:07:13 <TheJollyRoger> Regardless of whether or not you hold back updates, you are still trusting Microsoft. The question is, whether you want to add cybercriminals who own month-old canned vulnerabilities into that mixture as well.
19:07:15 <r0tt0r[m]> * i bet they had a lot of precautions, security protocols, monitoring etc
19:07:49 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Regardless of whether or not you"> How old are the exploits Qubes can be vulnerable to?
19:08:32 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: New ones pop out virtually every month, mate. That's why you need to keep dom0 updated.
19:08:50 <TheJollyRoger> Sometimes, emergency updates as well.
19:09:49 <TheJollyRoger> because hyperjacking is a real thing.
19:09:59 <TheJollyRoger> And THAT is what destroys the Qubes security model.
19:11:02 <TheJollyRoger> Again, remember what I've said: software is not a mature technology like steelmaking or metallurgy.
19:11:32 <TheJollyRoger> New advancements in it are being made faster than we can understand how those advancements /work/.
19:12:06 <TheJollyRoger> The best you can do until that changes is be able to fix it post-delivery.
19:12:48 <TheJollyRoger> I've said this before but I'll say it again:
19:13:01 <TheJollyRoger> The only way for an airplane not to crash, is for it not to fly.
19:13:23 <jj1013[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "you remember lulzsec hackers? re">  TeaMp0isoN?
19:13:39 <TheJollyRoger> So in aerospace, we put in all sorts of backups and redundancies, in the hope that should one system fail, the backups will last the plane until it can make a forced or emergency landing.
19:13:44 <TheJollyRoger> Computers are the same way.
19:13:57 <TheJollyRoger> The only way for a computer to not be exploited, is for it to not be turing complete.
19:14:09 <TheJollyRoger> If it's not turing-complete though, it's not a computer. Similarly to an airplane that can't fly.
19:15:25 <TheJollyRoger> So in computer security, the new philosophy is to, much like in aircraft design, implement sandboxing, exploit mitigations and automatic updates, in the hopes that should a hole be discoveredin one layer, we can roll out a provisional fix and get everyone using it before they get nailed.
19:15:43 <TheJollyRoger> The best you can do, from your chair, is to hold on tight and not try to strike out on your own.
19:15:50 <jj1013[m]> Then I will still look forward to using Qubes.
19:15:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yep.
19:16:30 <r0tt0r[m]> <jj1013[m] " TeaMp0isoN?"> check wiki lulzsec, hector was the one tracking down the teammembers
19:16:32 <TheJollyRoger> No matter where you go, no matter which platform you use, it will have its own imperfections. The best we can do though is keep moving forward.
19:17:40 <Baobab> jj1013[m], if you want to use qubes because of security, I recommend using one of the profiles first on bare metal.
19:18:36 <Baobab> If you jump to qubes, you'd have to secure more than one profile anyway.
19:20:05 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "jj1013., if you want to use qube"> What do you mean by "bare metal"?
19:20:44 <Baobab> jj1013[m], like installing an os on hardware
19:20:51 <Baobab> instead of on qubes
19:21:33 <jj1013[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "check wiki lulzsec, hector was t"> Hector was one of the founders.
19:22:13 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "jj1013., like installing an os o"> I have this Debian on my computer.
19:23:12 <Baobab> jj1013[m], if you're going to use a debian profile, perfect.
19:23:40 <jj1013[m]> <Baobab "jj1013., if you're going to use "> I was thinking of using both Debian and Windows profiles.
19:26:57 <Ghosts-In-My-Wir> So I connected my phone to my computer but I did not get my message to allow it to use photos? How do I bring but that notifications
19:27:11 <eagle90> i was thnkinking of using qubes
19:28:01 <eagle90> i was thnkinking of using qubes
19:28:41 <eagle90> and with my skill it isn't as easy to use as other even updating it is headache , and the community isn't easy to reach or as friendly as graphene
19:32:49 <TheJollyRoger> Ghosts-In-My-Wir: Hot plug it (unplug, plug back in) and Pull the notifications down until you see the USB settings.
19:33:14 <TheJollyRoger> eagle90: Yeah, Qubes is a bit different, still a little rough around the edges!
19:33:25 <TheJollyRoger> eagle90: Well then, welcome aboard, shipmate P.-)
19:34:22 <eagle90> TheJollyRoger thanks captin :D
19:35:43 <souvlaki[m]> yeah, f that, gonna install qubes on one of my hard drivers right now
19:35:52 <Baobab> I should probably get grapheneos.
19:35:52 <souvlaki[m]> * yeah, f that, gonna install qubes on one of my hard disks right now
19:36:15 <Baobab> currently I don't have a smartphone, lol
19:36:21 <eagle90> Baobab you will not regret it
19:36:33 <Baobab> 🙂
19:37:03 <Baobab> Wait, why did dino convert it to an emote
19:37:06 <Baobab> :)
19:37:10 <Baobab> that's better
19:37:23 <souvlaki[m]> even though now your mobile os is completely secure since you don't use any
19:37:56 <Baobab> souvlaki[m], true, lol
19:37:59 <TheJollyRoger> eagle90: Yarr~
19:38:10 <Baobab> The most secure data is no data at all :D
19:38:16 <TheJollyRoger> Baobab, I wholeheartedly recommend it!
19:38:34 <Baobab> yeah, I like the community.
19:38:39 <souvlaki[m]> yeah, it's the best you can get of your phone
19:40:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Baobab "The most secure data is no data "> 🤯
19:43:21 <souvlaki[m]> damn, qubes iso is almost 5 gigs
19:43:36 <souvlaki[m]> guess not now but after a couple oh hours then regarding my connection
19:43:43 <souvlaki[m]> * guess not now but after a couple of hours then regarding my connection
19:43:50 <Baobab> >5 gigs
19:43:50 <Baobab> !!! bloat !!! :DDD

19:45:08 <Baobab> I couldn't help myself, lol
19:45:34 <covid-1984[m]> Luke Smith... Nice guy
19:46:45 <Baobab> That was a screenshot of a telegram channel that my friend was in.
19:46:59 <Baobab> It was so funny I kept it, lol
20:19:51 <Ghosts-In-My-Wir> <TheJollyRoger "Ghosts-In-My-Wires: Hot plug it "> I think i disabled the notification by accident. How do I reenable it.
20:31:17 <Atom63> Hi
20:31:27 <Baobab> salute
20:31:36 <TheJollyRoger> Ghosts-In-My-Wir: I don't think you can disable the USB notification, it's listed as a system notification.
20:33:52 <Atom63> I'm currently having a problem with location on Pixel 4A on RQ2A.210405.005.2021.04.22.20 build. No matter what app I use and give permission it doesn't register location. I've tried OsMand Maps / Navigation, the VOI scooter app and some other. At first I thought it was broken apps from aurora store, but it's absolutely everything with the location
20:33:52 <Atom63> that is broken. I've tried to search on google, subreddit and github, can't find anything. Anybody else experiencing this or know a solution?
20:35:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hey Atom63, the first time you've installed GrapheneOS you need to let the GPS align. This can take a while, during which your phone needs to be able to recieve signals from the satellite network, so you need to be able to be outdoors for a while, in a big open space.
20:36:00 <Atom63> Well... I've had the phone for 14 weeks and spend a proper amount of time outside. Should I open something or do something specific to let it allign GPS?
20:36:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, very strange. It should align automatically if you've been outdoors for enough, provided there's nothing over your head.
20:36:45 <Atom63> This includes two to three hours in open sites without forrests or tall buildings.
20:37:09 <Atom63> Should I try a beta build or something else perhaps? Or?
20:37:23 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think so. Stick around and we'll see if anyone else is experiencing this.
20:37:32 <Atom63> Alright. :)
20:38:11 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck, and welcome aboard!
20:38:36 <Atom63> Thank you man! Primarily on this journey due to TheHatedOne. :)
20:39:33 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha well, glad to have you onboard the ship! This community's a great one for mobile security (it's our game!), sharing opsec tips, that sort of thing.
20:40:15 <Atom63> Glad to hear!
20:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr~
22:40:02 <Cliff[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I agree. QubesOS, Tails OS and W"> Tails is easy to setup, i tried whonix in a vm on windows 10, how hard is it to setup and use qubes daily?
22:46:18 <akc3n> Cliff[m], do you use Linux much?
22:46:45 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Note that in the case of apps li"> What do you mean with invasive? I installed graphene for my gf to try, and setup whatsapp and instagram in a different profile. This way they can't see the data from main profile right?
22:49:43 <akc3n> Cliff[m], Qubes is a xen hypervisor, btw.
22:52:36 <jj1013[m]> <Cliff[m] "What do you mean with invasive? "> Yup.
22:53:19 <jj1013[m]> Then again, you should still be careful with what you do or store on those profiles.
22:56:52 <GhostSplinterSix> <Cliff[m] "Tails is easy to setup, i tried "> I've only used Tails. I will be using Qubes once I have the money for a Librem 14.
22:58:26 <Baobab> GhostSplinterSix, depending on what you want out of the librem 14, you might just want to get a thinkpad and slap coreboot on it,
22:58:26 <strcat[m]> suggest buying a laptop with decent security rather than falling for a scam
22:59:37 <GhostSplinterSix> I want a Librem 14 for more than just QubesOS.
23:00:23 <strcat[m]> promoting those products in these channels isn't permitted
23:02:00 <Baobab> GhostSplinterSix, if you want to have most of ime removed, there's this project on github that removes it
23:02:10 <Baobab> lemme find it
23:02:37 <Baobab> https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner
23:03:06 <GhostSplinterSix> I don't think anyone is promoting anything. We're simply having a conversation about OSes.
23:03:22 <Baobab> >that removes it
23:03:22 <Baobab> depending on what version you have
23:03:51 <strcat[m]> GhostSplinterSix: no, you're promoting a scam in the channel consistently, stop
23:04:09 <strcat[m]> that's not an OS
23:04:12 <strcat[m]> it's a product
23:04:31 <jj1013[m]> <strcat[m] "suggest buying a laptop with dec"> Laptops designed for security?
23:05:03 <Baobab> jj1013[m], he probably means a non x86 laptop with vboot
23:05:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> > <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> Laptops designed for security?
23:05:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> > I haven't heard of such a thing. Which do you suggest?
23:05:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Macbook
23:05:13 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Chromebook
23:05:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Surface
23:05:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Most PC OEMS suck
23:05:46 <jj1013[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I don't think anyone is promotin"> He's right. What you are promoting is a Linux smartphone, which surely does worse than an Android-powered device.
23:06:09 <Baobab> jj1013[m], the librem 14 isn't a phone.
23:06:17 <jj1013[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Surface"> Can a Microsoft Surface have another OS installed?
23:06:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <jj1013[m] "Can a Microsoft Surface have ano"> Yes
23:07:04 <Baobab> I wish there were more non-x86 laptops.
23:07:20 <jj1013[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Yes"> OK. I'll try to get my desktop sold in exchange for that then.
23:07:21 <GhostSplinterSix> I wasn't promoting a product. Someone asked me about QubesOS and I simple stated that I haven't used it yet and mentioned what I'd be using it on. Now that I know your stance on it, I'll remember it from here on out and respectfully not talk about it.
23:07:33 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <jj1013[m] "OK. I'll try to get my desktop s"> Eh don't need to
23:07:39 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Security ain't everything
23:07:48 <strcat[m]> GhostSplinterSix: talking about QubesOS is not a problem and isn't what I said
23:07:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Desktops are better for productivity than laptops
23:08:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> GhostSplinterSix: purism falsely markets their products
23:08:05 <Baobab> GhostSplinterSix, I think he meant librem 14.
23:08:11 <akc3n[m]> GhostSplinterSix: librem 14.
23:08:17 <akc3n[m]> Its scam
23:08:29 <Baobab> I'm not sure if I would call it a scam.
23:08:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> GhostSplinterSix: madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html
23:08:48 <strcat[m]> it's very literally a scam from a company that thoroughly misrepresents their products and alternatives to them
23:08:50 <strcat[m]> on a regular basis
23:08:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "GhostSplinterSix: madaidans-inse"> You see how purism falsely markets?
23:09:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> That applies to their other products too
23:09:08 <strcat[m]> I don't know how more clear cut of a scam it can be when they flat out lie about it non-stop in many different ways
23:09:08 <Baobab> Railgun_Lover[m], we're talking about laptops
23:09:13 <strcat[m]> look: you promote scams here, you get banned
23:09:14 <strcat[m]> end of story
23:09:22 <GhostSplinterSix> <strcat[m] "GhostSplinterSix: talking about "> Oh. I know. I was just explaining how Purism was brought up and that promoting it wasn't intended. 👍🏻
23:09:29 <jj1013[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Security ain't everything"> It is, if you are looking for privacy.
23:09:53 <GhostSplinterSix> I can respect that and will remember it for the future
23:10:15 <Baobab> I'm pretty sure GhostSplinterSix meant no ill will.
23:10:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> > <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> It is, if you are looking for privacy.
23:10:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> > I have been gaslighted by r/degoogle into using Gecko-based browsers, which is just not right, not only because they love eating RAM, but by many, many other security problems, alongside other false beliefs.
23:10:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> No
23:10:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Without security you can't SUSTAIN privacy
23:11:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Doesn't mean you need the most secure hardware to have decent privacy
23:11:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And some gecko browsers are great, specifically Tor browser
23:11:58 <GhostSplinterSix> <Baobab "I'm pretty sure GhostSplinterSix"> I didn't but now that I know the rule and people's opinion on the company, I'll remember. 👍🏻
23:15:44 <jj1013[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "And some gecko browsers are grea"> I do recognize that.
23:16:36 <akc3n> GhostSplinterSix, I think strcat[m] said it best here.... https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210409#c7560354
23:18:25 <strcat[m]> they are substantially worse than typical privacy/security companies
23:18:29 <strcat[m]> they do substantial harm
23:18:30 <Cliff[m]> <akc3n "Cliff, do you use Linux much?"> No only tails and i have a mint live usb laying around. Heard and read alot about qubes and always figured it is quite difficult to get working
23:19:12 <Cliff[m]> > <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> Yup.
23:19:12 <Cliff[m]> > You should keep both WhatsApp and Instagram in their own profiles though.
23:19:12 <Cliff[m]> I tried but they are both needed in same profile for ease of use
23:20:05 <jj1013[m]> <Cliff[m] "> <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> Yup"> OK.
23:21:03 <jj1013[m]> <Cliff[m] "> <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> Yup"> As long as it's separated from the main profile (the one with sensitive info), it is all right.
23:21:11 <jj1013[m]> You could read the GrapheneOS website.
23:21:17 <jj1013[m]> https://grapheneos.org
23:24:31 <GhostSplinterSix> <akc3n "GhostSplinterSix, I think strcat"> What am I looking for on there?
23:43:20 <akc3n[m]> GhostSplinterSix:
23:43:20 <akc3n[m]> > so, sorry for not putting misleading or dishonest marketing BS / claims on the site like nearly anyone else
23:47:48 <akc3n[m]> IMHO, meaning... core values of the grapheneos project and devs is honesty and integrity..
23:49:24 <GhostSplinterSix> Ah, okay. I can understand that.
23:49:30 <akc3n[m]> * IMHO, meaning... core values of the grapheneos project, Daniel, and devs is honesty and integrity..
23:52:41 <mistazaki[m]> <akc3n[m] "Its scam"> Scam?
23:56:26 <mistazaki[m]> I just ordered librem 14
