00:18:58 <koncrete[m]> Hey ive already installed and flashed Tails on my USB drive
00:19:07 <koncrete[m]> When I try to boot tails
00:19:31 <koncrete[m]> Through powering my computer on and pressing f9
00:20:24 <koncrete[m]> I get into the "Boot option menu"

00:21:07 <koncrete[m]> And when I press Windows Boot manager it boots me to the regular os and not tails
00:21:13 <koncrete[m]> Help
00:21:36 <koncrete[m]> Windows 10
00:24:06 <koncrete[m]> Oh no wait I somehow made it work

00:24:31 <koncrete[m]> Its cuz I didn't press enter
00:41:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> Yeah Wondows Boot Manager is the Windows bootloader, it will look for Windows and boot that
01:21:45 <entry1> <koncrete[m] "Its cuz I didn't press enter"> That's weird, normally it will a default you in as long as you changed the boot device order without touching the keyboard. Glad you got it to work. Only things that are suspect in my eyes about Tails is that Tor Browser loads up to tails.boum.org each time and that only the Tails version of Tor Browser comes default with uBlock origin. Really dumb in my opinion

02:28:06 <akc3n[m]> <GrassFedBooks79 "Tails, Riseup, Linux, Tor, and G"> Minus the Calyx**
02:28:12 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> I kinda don't know about the other mentioned projects. Actions tell otherwise
02:29:05 <GrassFedBooks79> Linux, Coreboot, Libreboot, Trisquel and Debian OS, FSF, Signal.apk, NewPipe
02:29:09 <GrassFedBooks79> Calyx OS and Graphene OS
02:29:14 <GrassFedBooks79> Riseup and Calyx institute
02:29:19 <GrassFedBooks79> Are all awesome
02:29:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's fine to have that opinion atm, but suggest reading more about them, and the public chat logs
02:29:59 <entry1> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "It's fine to have that opinion a"> Agreed
02:30:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not everything that looks like nice are actually good
02:30:41 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not discussing those any further as these are embargoed topics in the main room
02:31:10 <Baobab> coreboot is a really nice project
02:31:31 <GrassFedBooks79> What do you thinking?
02:31:40 <GrassFedBooks79> Whats wrong with Calyx
02:31:49 <GrassFedBooks79> Assuming it doesnt have agents spreading misinfo
02:33:38 <akc3n> Interesting timing.
02:33:43 <GrassFedBooks79> howso
02:38:00 <akc3n> GrassFedBooks79, https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos-offtopic/20210503#c7867814 there is quite a bit from today on this topic, read and scroll down.
02:40:13 <louipc> GrassFedBooks79: lol thats not 5 minutes. thats 8-10 yrs
02:40:30 <louipc> re path to billionaire
02:40:41 <entry1> <GrassFedBooks79 "howso"> We don't discuss that project in here due to the ongoing attacks on GrapheneOS. Would recommend searching the logs like akc3n linked to with the lead developer expressing the issues they've brought to the project.
02:42:23 <CaptainPicard[m]> Calyx is openly hostile to this community and our lead developer. If you came here to promote/shill them you will be kicked. They cause significant harm with their words and actions.
02:42:28 <GrassFedBooks79> 5 minutes to setup
02:42:31 <GrassFedBooks79> 3 years to mine
02:42:39 <GrassFedBooks79> occasional updates and restarts, letting pc cool off
02:42:40 <GrassFedBooks79> But generally

02:42:53 <GrassFedBooks79> billions
02:43:13 <TheJollyRoger> GrassFedBooks79 has been banned for a previous ban evasion as Adam1177
02:44:48 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Ah.
02:45:17 <akc3n> Thanks TheJollyRoger that explains it. Thanks for letting us know.
02:47:31 <louipc> lol
02:48:29 <Core6255> the legend of adam1177
02:48:55 <GMOGrains> I think Graphene should just block/ignore any 'calyx agents'. So much time is wasted, just block and move on.
02:52:43 <Baobab> Is adam1177 like christianbob?
02:52:54 <Baobab> wait, wrong window, lol
02:53:03 <CaptainPicard[m]> Ugh this guy is like a weed
02:53:38 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Yeah lol, pretending to be some third party bystander and promote their ideology-like misinformation

02:55:09 <CaptainPicard[m]> I donate my money (and time, where possible) here. I love this project and have gotten so much from it. Wish more outside our community had an open mind and could do the same
02:55:52 <amsterdam2> I think the best idea is to just ignore or block the calyx hoes.

03:01:24 <CaptainPicard[m]> Sounds good
03:04:01 <CaptainPicard[m]> I spent most of the second half of last year fighting misinformation about the project on the likes of Reddit. When the Calyx stuff started I got pretty burnt out and really busy with school so I took a few months away. It's good to be back though.
03:11:15 <j8bitmigrujc[m]> <CaptainPicard[m] "I spent most of the second half "> i avoid reddit when possible.  but i get it.  never let cognitive load get too high.  unplug.  come back to things.
03:12:21 <TheJollyRoger> CaptainPicard[m]: it's good to have you back! If you have to take a break, take it, you need to have time for yourself. I appreciate you sticking yourself out for us!
03:12:27 <CaptainPicard[m]> Yeah. It's a cesspool of pretty bad information for privacy and security stuff and I wanted to try to be a part of changing that
03:12:27 <CaptainPicard[m]> Reading what Daniel wrote here and on the GOS sub went a long way towards seeing who the charlatans are and what information was true.
03:13:43 <TheJollyRoger> On behalf of the project, thank you!
03:14:05 <j8bitmigrujc[m]> some may not like what he has to say, but he's blunt and honest.  i respect that.
03:14:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:14:22 <CaptainPicard[m]> <TheJollyRoger "CaptainPicard: it's good to have"> Aww thanks so much man! Happy to do anything I can to help the project. I'll be done with finals in a few weeks and will have a lot more time to work on it again because I'll just be focusing on my research.
03:15:00 <CaptainPicard[m]> On an unrelated note if the project ever needs a mechanical engineer for some reason please tell me
03:15:05 <TheJollyRoger> Beautiful! Take your time, and--
03:15:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hotdamn, you speak my language. I'm a mechanical designer! Maybe we will, or at the very least could build something fun!
03:16:10 <CaptainPicard[m]> That would be awesome!
03:16:24 <CaptainPicard[m]> My research is basically Matlab and SolidWorks simulator at this point lol
03:16:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah man! I've been hoping to do a 3D printed case someday, or possibly something gimmicky for GrapheneOS.
03:16:51 <TheJollyRoger> Solidworks, legit! For me it's Creo, and Inventor, ahaha.
03:17:02 <j8bitmigrujc[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hotdamn, you speak my language. "> i envision an automated conveyor system full of pixels being loaded and build tested.
03:17:34 <CaptainPicard[m]> Yeah most of my work is with SolidWorks. I've done a bit with fusion and creo for some clients I've worked for but nowhere near as much as SW
03:17:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hahahaha! Now that would be kinda neat, automated flashing :P.
03:18:13 <louipc> and im a machinist ;)
03:18:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It seems that everyone sort of has their own preferences.
03:18:17 <TheJollyRoger> \o/
03:18:21 <TheJollyRoger> We got a crew!
03:18:53 <CaptainPicard[m]> Mostly the course work at my school all uses SW. I also had the chance to take the CSWA/CSWP so I did those
03:20:30 <TheJollyRoger> Beautiful.
03:22:50 <j8bitmigrujc[m]> i mig/tig/arc weld.
03:23:25 <louipc> kool. what do you use DC+ for on a tig welder
03:23:29 <TheJollyRoger> Being able to weld would be incredibly useful!
03:23:39 <TheJollyRoger> Especially if it's for small, fine parts with TIG welding!
03:24:24 <CaptainPicard[m]> That's awesome! Something I've always wanted to learn how to do
03:24:35 <louipc> what small parts do you want to do
03:25:12 <CaptainPicard[m]> I've never welded at all so anything I can learn is good haha
03:25:32 <louipc> small parts better to be soldered or spot welded
03:26:47 <CaptainPicard[m]> I remember that from a couple classes. Never put it into practice though, unfortunately
03:27:17 <CaptainPicard[m]> I'm a full time student and work ~20 hours/week so my life gets VERY busy sometimes, unfortunately
03:27:43 <louipc> as an engineer your life will be spreadsheets and meetings sorry to say
03:28:11 <CaptainPicard[m]> Oh I know
03:28:18 <CaptainPicard[m]> I've had a few jobs in industry
03:28:19 <louipc> designer will get the cad work. trades will play with the machines
03:28:37 <j8bitmigrujc[m]> <louipc "kool. what do you use DC+ for on"> last time i made something was decades ago. i never had a reason to run dc+ unless i start starting a ball then moving to ac on aluminum
03:29:10 <j8bitmigrujc[m]> end up blowtorching your setup and material.
03:29:16 <akc3n[m]> My friend lives up by fort Mac in Alberta, and has his own welding business.  makes 350$ cad an hour doing welding. Then after 8 hour shift it goes to time and half. And usually gets in an extra 3-4 each shift. 2 weeks on, 1 week off.
03:29:16 <akc3n[m]> I was shocked when I found out.

03:30:29 <CaptainPicard[m]> <trail_undergroun "I don’t know what I want to do. "> That's okay! Nothing wrong with that.
03:31:25 <trail_undergroun> I think I wanna get into CS but I got a learning disability so math and concentration is a real pain
03:31:55 <trail_undergroun> Ooo ooo. I’ll be a “privacy youtuber” and spread information I found on Reddit. 😏
03:32:04 <CaptainPicard[m]> NOOOOOOOOOO
03:32:08 <trail_undergroun> lol
03:32:08 <CaptainPicard[m]> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
03:32:24 <louipc> good luck
03:32:41 <CaptainPicard[m]> Real talk CS is really cool. A lot of my good friends went that route. I ask myself sometimes if I should have. All in all I'm happy with my choice though.
03:32:53 <CaptainPicard[m]> My girlfriend went that route actually
03:32:54 <trail_undergroun> “Buy my 6 year old Android phone and my VPN service”
03:33:26 <trail_undergroun> Yeah idk. CS seems hard. I’m afraid I’m not smart enough.
03:33:53 <trail_undergroun> I took computer engineering courses in HS and that was fun. 🤷🏻‍♂️
03:34:39 <CaptainPicard[m]> If there's one thing I've learned from observations in college and the workforce, it's that hard work beats talent if talent doesn't work hard
03:34:55 <CaptainPicard[m]> If you want it and you're willing to put in the work that will get you most of the way to nearly anything
03:35:42 <louipc> if you want it you'll do it
03:36:14 <trail_undergroun> I suppose. It’s tough but I think I might as well try.
03:36:53 <CaptainPicard[m]> Yeah it'll be tough, but lots of things that are worth doing are ;)
03:37:09 <louipc> and CS is a niche thing anyway
03:37:12 <j8bitmigrujc[m]> trail_underground:  advanced mathematics is not required for all areas of computer science.
03:37:34 <louipc> most people dont need CS in the purest sense at all
03:38:02 <trail_undergroun> <j8bitmigrujc[m] "trail_underground:  advanced mat"> I was wondering which specific fields require more complicated math and which are a bit less taxing, but I haven’t done any research

04:19:25 <strcat[m]> that's a very malicious and dishonest person who orchestrates this nonsense to promote himself and CalyxOS
04:19:36 <strcat[m]> he has a grudge against us for not making him a moderator or promoting his channel
04:20:09 <rny[m]> whats there to hold a grudge for not being a moderator
04:20:13 <strcat[m]> CalyxOS works with him and helps promote him so he took a strong liking to them and they work together to harm GrapheneOS to benefit themselves
04:20:17 <rny[m]> who even goes around asking for more responsibility?
04:20:21 <strcat[m]> rny: he's super bitter about it and regularly mentions it
04:20:56 <strcat[m]> the thing that made him really hate me is this one time I talked about my struggles with depression and how what Copperhead was doing was screwing up my life
04:21:08 <strcat[m]> he left the channel and started orchestrating raiding and harassment
04:21:13 <strcat[m]> and it has just escalated from there
04:21:21 <strcat[m]> similar experience with Calyx and they work together on this
04:21:26 <strcat[m]> the channel gets raided all day for a reason
04:21:29 <koncrete[m]> And the dudes who do raids get paid by peole
04:21:40 <strcat[m]> it's not because we did something, it's because they raid it to benefit themselves

04:32:57 <louipc> is the way the wind blows. and a journey in learning how to moderate a community and discussion
04:36:21 <Baobab> I get the feeling that TheGentoopenguin isn't very bright.
04:36:57 <CaptainPicard[m]> Oop I think we got one in the other room
04:37:31 <CaptainPicard[m]> Let's see
04:47:48 <TheJollyRoger> Hey guys. I'm just going to set the channel to +m for a bit, so I can concentrate on other things.
04:52:26 <Thatcher[m]> <trail_undergroun "Looks like GrapheneOS will be hi"> Got a release date for his next book? 😀
04:58:23 <CaptainPicard> Good night y'all
05:46:35 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Iphone question. Is apps that uses the secure enclave still protected when the phone is unlocked?
05:46:35 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Like if an app says that it stores the credentials in the secure enclave and uses an separate code from the lock screen code, is it then protected or does the lock screen code give access to everything stored in the enclave?
08:13:48 <stencil[m]> Is this reportable? https://gitlab.com/micah
08:15:06 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Wrong room?
08:15:35 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> No idea if account reporting is a thing in gitlab
08:15:43 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> If that's a question
08:17:20 <stencil[m]> I mean it's literally 'Micah' that contributes to calyx so....
08:17:47 <sphinx[m]> stencil: it's his actual name
08:17:52 <sphinx[m]> https://micahflee.com/
08:19:21 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not to be confused with Daniel Micay
08:20:25 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <sphinx[m] "https://micahflee.com/"> Thanks for clarification
08:22:29 <sphinx[m]> I've seen in their social media that he uses it
08:24:13 <janjaap[m]> Can anyone explain why microg does not work on graphene? I installed the stock google camera app and block its network permissions. The app only works when microg is installed. So to me it seems that microg at least does something. Thanks for your answer.
08:26:01 <akc3n[m]> <janjaap[m] "Can anyone explain why microg do"> microG is a very small subset of Google play services.
08:26:31 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> https://grapheneos.org/faq#google-services may help answer your question too

08:29:44 <janjaap[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "https://grapheneos.org/faq#googl"> Ok, ill check your link. Can you comment about the idea of installing google stock apps, gboard, camera, calendar,... and preventing them from accessing the internet?
08:30:24 <janjaap[m]> <janjaap[m] "Ok, ill check your link. Can you"> If they cant call home, the cant do any harm, right?
08:30:36 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Some of them have hard dependency on Play services and will not work, but Gboard, Google Photos, Google Maps work fine without it
08:32:11 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <janjaap[m] "If they cant call home, the cant"> It's harm reduction, but not without guarantee, since app can communicate with other apps in the same user profile with consent (of the app developers). That being said, you can use Gboard with most other apps Network permission revoked, then force stop it, and turn it off as an option in keyboard settings
08:33:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Some notable information about interprocess communication in Android:
08:33:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> https://gist.github.com/Peter-Easton/3af0af2d1c4c2eca24a9e324e0a22145
08:34:47 <janjaap[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "It's harm reduction, but not wit"> I dont get the last step, which keyboard settings, system ones or the gboard ones?
08:35:31 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> System settings
08:36:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Turn it off first at system settings, then force stop Gboard to end jobs/process currently running on it*
08:37:52 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Just be wary that keyboard is still a (highly) trusted app (can read clipboard, can read keystrokes)
08:38:55 <janjaap[m]> Yes, I know. But I like the swiping.
08:39:19 <janjaap[m]> And switching keyboards is frustrating at times.
08:42:02 <janjaap[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Some of them have hard dependenc"> Ok, now that you say that maps work, I'll create a second user profile just for navigation which will include newpipe, gmaps and session.
08:42:23 <janjaap[m]> (I use session to send data between my profiles)
09:18:00 <trail_undergroun> <Thatcher[m] "Got a release date for his next "> He said he will be releasing it early since he has so much new information. IIRC I believe he said this summer?

10:08:06 <withinfire[m]> All the questions about whether apps will work or not, has the collective user experience ever been collected and published somewhere? Would a section on the graphene os website work? I am going to switch to GrapheneOS later today and am very curious/anxious whether some of the core critical apps will work via the Aurora store and trying to research that in advance to make a guesstimate is very difficult?
10:10:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> search the logs here
10:11:29 <withinfire[m]> Thanks yeah I have done that and it works but wouldn't necessarily call it convenient? :P
10:13:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> look, "making a list of apps that work" is a good idea on paper, but then this list must be updated every time when an app gets updated
10:15:08 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you can never be sure that an app that works today will work the same way tomorrow
10:18:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> therefore, just install GrapheneOS, check whether your desired apps work
10:18:26 <withinfire[m]> yeah i see what you're saying
10:18:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if you think that you can't use GrapheneOS, just go back to stock
10:18:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you lose nothing, except some time
10:19:03 <withinfire[m]> time is money though right /jk
10:19:10 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> even your phone's warranty would still be intact
10:19:44 <withinfire[m]> that is very nice. i'll have a go tonight and report back to get it in the logs just in case ;)
10:20:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> 👍

14:50:47 <EV-9600[m]> <nscnt[m] "There's no recommendation"> It says: "Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are officially supported for building GrapheneOS", I figured this meant I should be fine if I'll compile it on it.
14:51:00 <EV-9600[m]> Any suggestions on what to do?
14:54:46 <nscnt[m]> @EV-9600:matrix.org: I would just try to do it again from the beginning. Delete the keys/<device> directory and do it again. Maybe you missed a line or something

15:44:31 <nscnt[m]> @EV-9600:matrix.org: Have you set the passphrase when generating it? It doesn't prompt you to set one when generating, only if you use the script
15:45:14 <EV-9600[m]> No, I am running the command and then it asks for a passphrase

16:06:43 <gaddybrick[m]> with LineageOS it is recommended to follow these instructions:
16:06:43 <gaddybrick[m]> https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/gta4xlwifi/install
16:06:58 <helloworldkk87[m> That is not supported
16:07:00 <gaddybrick[m]> instead of the LOS recovery I'd prefer TWRP

16:07:12 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> This is not, LineageOS room
16:07:25 <gaddybrick[m]> but it's off topic
16:07:34 <gaddybrick[m]> and you don't know yet, where I'm going ^^
16:08:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> You're right, sorry for being a bit hostile
16:08:02 <gaddybrick[m]> i'd prefer going for LineageOS for microG
16:08:33 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> You can build that OS yourself, no provided prebuilt images for that device model though
16:09:15 <gaddybrick[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "You can build that OS yourself, "> me? I'm afraid I can't since I'm noob
16:09:29 <nscnt[m]> @EV-9600:matrix.org: Have you built the otatools?
16:10:48 <gaddybrick[m]> so, the reason I'm about to ask this here is, because I assume you guys are 1 lvl ahead of LOS in terms of privacy
16:10:48 <nscnt[m]> @EV-9600:matrix.org: The script expects them. Build them
16:11:33 <gaddybrick[m]> from what I read and why I use GrapheneOS on my main device (pixel) is that LOS is at no terms "google free"
16:11:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> I should stop you right here
16:12:20 <gaddybrick[m]> me?
16:12:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Both LineageOS and GrapheneOS don't include Google Play services by default
16:13:03 <gaddybrick[m]> ok, good for LOS
16:13:45 <gaddybrick[m]> now, to use some conveniences anyway, I want to install LOS for microG on the tablet
16:14:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Yes, I don't see why you would prefer TWRP over the default LOS recovery
16:14:45 <helloworldkk87[m> <gaddybrick[m] "now, to use some conveniences an"> You should ask from the LineageOS community as they can help you better
16:15:39 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> That is true, we don't know everything :P
16:16:25 <gaddybrick[m]> nah, they hate data protection
16:16:47 <gaddybrick[m]> i take that back
16:18:10 <gaddybrick[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> Yes, I don't see why you"> with TWRP i can flash other OS'es as well, whenever
16:18:47 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Also, by installing microG you break your "google freedom"
16:19:06 <gaddybrick[m]> and with plain vanilla LOS I don't?
16:19:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> That is correct
16:19:34 <gaddybrick[m]> and I can use f-droid?
16:19:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Sure
16:19:45 <gaddybrick[m]> and aurora?
16:19:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Yes
16:19:58 <gaddybrick[m]> and my german corona-warn-app?
16:20:16 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> That I don't know
16:20:22 <gaddybrick[m]> :P jk
16:21:16 <gaddybrick[m]> I'll go for pure LOS then
16:21:39 <gaddybrick[m]> it's worth a try and still can augment my necessities
16:21:43 <gaddybrick[m]> ty
16:22:25 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Although, I would definitely recommend you stay on stock on your Samsung Galaxy Tab S6
16:23:15 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Cause by installing LOS you disable a lot of security features on your device
16:23:44 <gaddybrick[m]> oh no
16:23:51 <gaddybrick[m]> don't tell me those stuff
16:24:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Welp, it's your device, so it's your choice at the end of the day
16:24:30 <gaddybrick[m]> so I can't have best of both worlds: privacy AND security?
16:25:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> You know that you can be "fairly private" on stock?
16:25:43 <gaddybrick[m]> on the other hand: if I have security issues, wouldn't that mean that some hackers might do damage but the chance is lower than being analyzed by big mega crops for my behavior?
16:26:10 <gaddybrick[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> You know that you can be"> no
16:26:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Apps don't have access to data if you don't provide to them, it give the permission

16:26:39 <gaddybrick[m]> do you trust this?
16:27:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> If you don't like the invasiveness of the default apps, just revoke the permissions

16:27:58 <gaddybrick[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> If you don't like the in"> let me rephrase: are you (pretty) sure that if you revoke permissions on stock rom that they are really permitted?
16:28:13 <Wonderfall[m]> <gaddybrick[m] "on the other hand: if I have sec"> Keep in mind that if your system is compromised, it's also the biggest breach in privacy.
16:29:19 <gaddybrick[m]> yeah, but wouldn't LOS be a larger security service for a ...let's say...first time user, than using stock rom and having to go thru all the apps to revoke permissions?
16:29:26 <Wonderfall[m]> LineageOS weakens the security model of Android substantially
16:29:47 <gaddybrick[m]> and LOS for microG even more?
16:30:16 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> I do trust the stock pixel, but I'm not as sure when it comes to other stocks. (I find Xiaomi and Huawei to be specifically less trustworthy from my pov)
16:30:31 <Wonderfall[m]> Yeah it's even worse, it weakens security and privacy too. "Open-source" Play Services implementation is still a Play Services implementation (but a weaker one now)
16:30:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <gaddybrick[m] "let me rephrase: are you (pretty"> You can check it out yourself
16:31:09 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just install a root TLS Certificate and mitm the communication
16:31:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I trust Google, OnePlus, etc
16:31:47 <gaddybrick[m]> lol, railgun...I could translate mitm, but that's about it I can do in IT
16:32:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <gaddybrick[m] "lol, railgun...I could translate"> Basically, use a root TLS certificate (this allows you to trick your phone into using your own keys)
16:32:31 <gaddybrick[m]> I don't understaand the concept and especially I couldn't check it myself
16:32:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You can then decrypt all communications from your phone
16:32:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <gaddybrick[m] "I don't understaand the concept "> Then just look it up and see if there are any scandals
16:32:56 <gaddybrick[m]> I can't, believe me
16:33:42 <gaddybrick[m]> before I came here I just wanted to know if I go for LOS or LOS4microG
16:33:51 <gaddybrick[m]> now I am taking Stock ROm into account
16:34:08 <gaddybrick[m]> I just want to use messengers like this and browse a little

16:59:37 <covid-1984[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> it's not a gos limitatio"> But both AuroraDroid & F-DROID have automatic updates features
16:59:49 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that's not how they work

17:00:14 <covid-1984[m]> Maybe I just can't parse their terms
17:00:19 <cstrrider[m]> <covid-1984[m] "Was hoping someone would know ho"> Aurora includes an auto update feature but you need root which you can't get with GrapheneOS.
17:00:23 <fireclaw722[m]> Without the privileged extension, it's all manual. And the privileged extension requires either an unlocked bootloader or being built into the ROM.
17:00:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> go to aurora/fdroid to complain about it
17:00:33 <covid-1984[m]> I'm not complaining man

17:28:43 <gaddybrick[m]> I'm kinda mad
17:28:58 <gaddybrick[m]> how irresponsible these instructions are
17:29:21 <EV-9600[m]> <nscnt[m] "@EV-9600:matrix.org: Have you bu"> What are those? I didn't see them mentioned in the build proccess
17:29:22 <gaddybrick[m]> appes = apps*
17:31:17 <nscnt[m]> @EV-9600:matrix.org: Right before `script/release.sh [...]` https://grapheneos.org/build#generating-signed-factory-images-and-full-update-packages
17:32:53 <EV-9600[m]> Oh, yeah I ran those
17:32:55 <dazinism> gaddybrick: its best to update to the latest stock before installing LOS as you'll get the latest firmware updates which aren't included for many LOS devices
17:33:22 <EV-9600[m]> <EV-9600[m] "Oh, yeah I ran those"> And it said "success" in green so I assumed it went well
17:33:33 <dazinism> I'd consider staying on stoci and de-bloating using
17:33:41 <dazinism> adb shell uninstall
17:34:25 <gaddybrick[m]> <dazinism "gaddybrick: its best to update t"> that may be, but it shows update 4 of 31
17:34:28 <dazinism> Have a good look on XDAdevs for your device. What pre installed bloat can be safely removed
17:34:35 <gaddybrick[m]> that couldn't be "firmware"
17:35:10 <dazinism> Mmm. Yeah, guess its updating apps...
17:35:28 <gaddybrick[m]> yeah, why?
17:35:36 <dazinism> *staying on stock
17:36:23 <gaddybrick[m]> do you get my question? why is it LOS wants me to update all the apps?
17:36:23 <dazinism> Because sensibly thats what it will try to do whenever its got network, unless you set it otherwise.
17:36:52 <dazinism> Maybe the default is when its on WiFi it auto updates
17:37:14 <gaddybrick[m]> then why don't they explain? https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/gta4xlwifi/install
17:37:45 <gaddybrick[m]> what do I know if google forever connects my mac-address to the mac-address of my routerß
17:37:58 <gaddybrick[m]>  * what do I know if google forever connects my mac-address to the mac-address of my router?
17:38:18 <dazinism> Theres a lot to consider
17:38:21 <gaddybrick[m]> why did they want to connect me in the first place?
17:38:41 <dazinism> They don't know what condition your device is in
17:38:48 <gaddybrick[m]> lol
17:39:29 <EV-9600[m]> <nscnt[m] "@EV-9600:matrix.org: Right befor"> Where is the zip supposed to appear?
17:41:49 <dazinism> gaddybrick: think its likely because you need network to enable OEM unlock
17:42:08 <dazinism> And all you have is wifi
17:46:22 <gaddybrick[m]> where did you get that quote of me?
18:01:21 <ryan[m]1> What to do about apps that dont open in a user profile? My oura app just hangs on the splash screen
18:10:41 <strcat[m]> ryan: report a bug to them
18:10:48 <strcat[m]> it's very rare that an app doesn't work in a secondary profile
18:45:46 <chmod700[m]> Does anyone know of a good guide getting linphone and twilio setup on graphene?
19:02:41 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> i know linphone is/was on fdroid so that is easy. Michael Bazzell (privacy author, etc.) i believe has a tutorial for exactly what you describe.
19:05:50 <chmod700[m]> Ahh I'll check his site, i assumed you have to buy the book
19:43:12 * mistazaki[m] uploaded an image: (106KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UvOFWqosOdIKWmHNfWNyrYlW/Screenshot_20210505-034246.png >
19:43:19 <mistazaki[m]> This what problem?
19:43:32 <mistazaki[m]> Orbot problem or os problem?
20:14:10 <lococovid007[m]> Would a cellular carrier know which device you connect to a data sim when using a mifi router?
20:14:32 <lococovid007[m]> Aside from the IMEI of the mifi router itself
20:37:41 <pkgbuild[m]> Until this evening I had no "close session button" but only an white window and the close session on the lock screen, without press the button
22:59:22 <Baba[m]> Didnt get the latest updates on my P3 till yet..... 🤔
22:59:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> afaik, it's in beta
23:01:14 <Baba[m]> Okkkkkyyyyyyy
23:19:43 <TheJollyRoger> Some releases may still be in internal testing, as well, before they reach beta.
23:20:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> hi Jolly, how are you?)
23:20:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy @Hulk, all is well, yourself?
23:21:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> not being very productive lately :P
23:21:28 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> but that's okay :)
23:21:33 <TheJollyRoger> Ah that's alright!
23:28:50 <akc3n[m]> The new Styles & Wallpapers settings is so cool!!!!
23:30:53 <billinmtl[m]> <akc3n[m] "The new Styles & Wallpapers sett"> Agreed - nice addition to the OS
23:40:35 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo! Thanks for testing akc3n[m] and billinmtl[m]! I'll be able to get my report posted shortly!
23:51:37 <akc3n[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Woohoo! Thanks for testing akc3n"> It was fun!
23:51:43 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe X3.
23:52:33 <TheJollyRoger> I'm trying out seedvault in another profile right now, too. I futzed with a few of the settings and the appearance and style app, and then used an old legacy app (simple calendar) that allows backup to seedvault, made some events in it, saved some stuff, and now I'm just letting that back up to my Corsair USB drive.
23:52:51 <TheJollyRoger> Seedvault for secondary profiles is now a game changer.
23:53:10 <akc3n[m]> Totally!
23:56:04 <janjaap[m]> Looking forward to the update!
