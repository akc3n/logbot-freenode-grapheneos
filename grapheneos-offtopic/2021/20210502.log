02:29:22 <faxing[m]> Is a VPN better than Orbot to use system-wide on GrapheneOS?  Since I was just told that using Orbot systemwide is pretty bad if you're logged in places due to mixing IDs.

02:36:51 <jjstopper[m]> Hi. I don't know if this is a Pixel question or a Grapheneos question. When the Pixel finishes booting up Grapheneos there is a notification sound I cannot seem to turn off. I cannot find it in settings. Does anyone know if this is something that cannot be turned off? Thanks
02:39:21 <Pratyush[m]> There is sometime a you have new messages notification and it's make noise.
02:39:21 <Pratyush[m]> Are you talking about that one?
02:39:23 <faxing[m]> <jjstopper[m] "Hi. I don't know if this is a Pi"> I solved it by putting my phone in do not disturb / silent before rebooting for the update, that fixed it.  Updates are rare enough though.
02:40:29 <faxing[m]> Pratyush I'd love to use multiple profiles, I have since the start. The only problem is the fact that you can't get notifications between profiles, which makes it hard to use day to day for me.
02:41:18 <jjstopper[m]> Pratyush: no it happens after you start or restart the phone. The notification goes off when its finished booting up. So annoying
02:41:34 <faxing[m]> <jjstopper[m] "Pratyush: no it happens after yo"> Mhm
02:44:51 <Pratyush[m]> I am not 100% sure but may be work might be your solution.
02:44:51 <Pratyush[m]> Technically it's a user profile, managed by an admin app in owner profile.
02:44:51 <Pratyush[m]> But to be fair i don't it's limitations. May be someone with advance knowledge in this ‚Äúwork profile‚Äù thing can give you a idea.
02:46:40 <CaptainPicard[m]> You can use a work profile, which Pratyush is referring to. You'd use Shelter or Island to make it work. Its implementation is generally less robust, due to the app management, and it has substantially more attack surface than a standard profile. It is up to you to decide if this is an acceptable compromise for your use case
02:46:53 <Pratyush[m]> * I am not 100% sure but may be work profile* might be your solution.
02:46:53 <Pratyush[m]> Technically it's a user profile, managed by an admin app in owner profile.
02:46:53 <Pratyush[m]> But to be fair i don't it's limitations. May be someone with advance knowledge in this ‚Äúwork profile‚Äù thing can give you a idea.

03:00:13 <jjstopper[m]> faxing: I turned on do not disturb and restarted the phone and didn't get a notification. It would be a pain to do that everytime
03:06:18 <faxing[m]> <jjstopper[m] "faxing: I turned on do not distu"> I mean, it's not ideal but if it bothers you that much then there you go, at least until there's a toggle possibly in the future.

03:09:09 <Pratyush[m]> App info -> permission -> (top three dot) -> all permission.
03:09:10 <Pratyush[m]> (View network connection or something similar).
03:12:40 <faxing[m]> So like "have full network access" is fine, but if it says specifically "ACCESS_NETWORK_STATUS", then uninstall. That correct?
03:21:46 <ryan[m]1> If I believe my gos p4 to be compromised is it better to get a new phone or is re-imaging sufficient. I guess the question becomes is p4 hardware fully immune to firmware exploits, and the answer to that is probably no, nothing is.
03:30:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <ryan[m]1 "If I believe my gos p4 to be com"> Just reboot
03:30:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Verified boot will undo changes and compromises because it has error correction data
03:31:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If it is unable, it simply won't boot
06:36:37 <Jasper[m]1> Is there any documentation on graphene‚Äôs Linux-hardened kernel? Just wondering whether arch with Linux-hardened would be a good path to take since it doesn‚Äôt have SELinux (or apparmor) profiles for most packages available afaik. With something like Fedora you‚Äôd have those out of the box
06:54:47 <strcat[m]> Jasper: it's not a substitute for access control, it doesn't provide that
06:55:02 <strcat[m]> Jasper: and also, Fedora does not provide a proper SELinux / MAC deployment
06:55:07 <strcat[m]> and neither does any other traditional distribution
06:55:18 <strcat[m]> they lack any meaningful application security model or isolation
06:55:25 <strcat[m]> and also lack proper isolation between users
06:55:33 <strcat[m]> those aren't comparable to a modern secure OS
06:55:50 <strcat[m]> linux-hardened does do what you seem to think, at all
07:00:22 <Jasper[m]1> No I‚Äôm aware it doesn‚Äôt do MAC but I was wondering if the added hardening to the kernel would make more of a meaningful difference to the overal security than having SELinux of Fedora.
07:02:33 <strcat> it's not comparable to access control
07:02:35 <strcat> it's not the same thing
07:03:01 <strcat> and having SELinux is not some binary thing, it's like saying a system has POSIX permissions, what matters is what you do with it
07:03:06 <Jasper[m]1> It‚Äôs a bit of a vague question since SELinux and Linux-hardened do entirely different things and one can‚Äôt replace the other..
07:11:43 <Jasper[m]1> Tried to rephrase it a dozen times but it remains a silly question.
07:16:25 <Jasper[m]1> But I take it there‚Äôs no documentation on the hardened kernel yet?
07:17:39 <strcat[m]> docs on what exactly?
07:17:54 <strcat[m]> it's aimed at doing self-protection
07:18:07 <strcat[m]> and most of the historical features were landed upstream, although it still does a fair bit
07:18:20 <strcat[m]> it's not meant to provide user-facing stuff
07:18:34 <strcat[m]> or userspace-facing stuff
07:20:22 <Jasper[m]1> Docs on what it adds on top of the kernel and hasn‚Äôt been landed upstream
07:23:51 <strcat[m]> look at the commits?
07:23:59 <strcat[m]> commits have commit messages
07:25:18 <strcat[m]> and bear in mind that project hasn't really been revived yet as a standalone project
07:30:15 <Jasper[m]1> It‚Äôs just that Arch lists it as an officially supported kernel but there‚Äôs not much in the way of documentation on what mitigations it adds, apart from git commits
07:31:56 <Jasper[m]1> Why it‚Äôs officially supported even though it‚Äôs not actively maintained anymore is beyond me
07:33:31 <Jasper[m]1> It is maintained. Yes. Nvm
07:40:19 <strcat[m]> it has basic maintenance
07:40:25 <strcat[m]> not active development as a standalone project
07:49:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> What is with the weird number of people coming into the rooms asserting that their phones/OSes are "compromised"?
07:52:21 <Jasper[m]1> I thought the rooms were supposed to be closed to new members because of the copperhead trolls?
07:53:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> <Baobab "I wish there were more non-x86 l"> Surface Pro X, Qualcomm and maybe Whitechapel Chromebooks in the pipeline,  M1 MacBooks, Pinebook Pro etc. hopefully the options will continue getting better with time.
07:55:58 <strcat[m]> Jasper: Copperhead stopped raiding the channels and making other attacks on GrapheneOS for the time being but they caused a lot of harm propagating misinformation and that's being being carried on by CalyxOS people
07:56:06 <strcat[m]> the channels are only closed to new people when it gets really bad
07:56:14 <strcat[m]> some of the new users in the main channel were very suspicious
07:56:24 <strcat[m]> in the past hour
07:56:38 <strcat[m]> I suspect some of them are the same person who joined via multiple irc names
07:56:55 <strcat[m]> there's a lot of trolling that goes on
07:57:07 <strcat[m]> and then there are really sick people with serious issues who waste a lot of time like Adam
08:15:37 <Jasper[m]1> You‚Äôd think people have better things to do in life.. I don‚Äôt get what motives them. Does copperhead have any incentive whatsoever for this? Surely ill informed people will continue to buy their scam devices regardless of this community. It‚Äôs not even a threat to their ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù
08:39:57 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yeah, don't give that behaviour the attention it is likely craving. Moderation already have a plan in place to deal with it.
10:40:14 <Pratyush[m]> <faxing[m] "So like "have full network acces"> yes uninstall it or use it with tor, VPN is fine, just because VPN already don't give you anonymity and may be app can and they might be not doing that.
12:20:36 <hemingr[m]> Maybe the wrong place to ask, but I'm missing too many notifications for my comfort. Is there a sane way to reenable these on a pixel4a?
12:24:34 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> check the apps' notifications settings? And if it needs to have battery optimization disabled?
12:29:59 <hemingr[m]> Yeah , checked that. Optimization is off, notifications enables both in os and app. But nothing. App in question is protonmail.

12:51:34 <RahoonGOAWAY[m]> I just refresh when expecting stuff
12:55:13 <Jasper[m]1> Android without play services is quite niche. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a bad decision to rely on it. Especially given that doing push notifications yourself without draining the battery is quite difficult. Signal has the same problem

13:05:47 <RahoonGOAWAY[m]> Should've done my own research beforee saying this
13:16:42 <Jasper[m]1> <RahoonGOAWAY[m] "¬øwhat do you mean, signal notifi"> Yes but it means that Signal has to maintain its own connection to their servers. If each app does this it‚Äôs unnecessarily draining energy. The beauty of GCM is that it‚Äôs the only service that maintains a connection to listen for notifications. All notifications can be delivered through that one connection and wake up apps as required rather than requir
13:16:42 <Jasper[m]1> all of them to turn in the background constantly.
13:18:26 <Jasper[m]1> It seems GCM is now superseded by FCM, which is also available on other platforms and not run by Google directly but rather a subsidiary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebase_Cloud_Messaging
13:19:45 <Jasper[m]1> Since FCM is a cross platform independent thing, shouldn‚Äôt it work without play services ü§î
13:22:21 <RahoonGOAWAY[m]> That seems nice, but it is still google that is running it.
13:22:21 <RahoonGOAWAY[m]> And would it need to be implemented in GOS to work or that in the hands of the app developers?
13:27:12 <Jasper[m]1> It shouldn‚Äôt matter much who runs it, you don‚Äôt have to trust it. You could just add your own layer of encryption. Register the client with the server, do a little key exchange and use FCM to deliver the notifications.
13:29:42 <Jasper[m]1> I‚Äôm not sure whether it‚Äôs just something you can build into your app or whether the system needs to support it. I would assume that the system needs to have it built in, otherwise you‚Äôll still end up with each app doing its own notification thing. But it‚Äôs also supported on iOS so.. I‚Äôd have to check the documentation
13:34:02 <hex2a2b> Hi, just installed GOS for the first time and wondering how to transfer all the SMSs from the old phone without involving google? I've tried "SMS Gate" from f-droid but it kept 'hanging'.

17:34:21 <Baba[m]> <catfish[m] "hex2a2b: I did this with the sil"> How silence is not recomm?
17:36:23 <Baba[m]> Its not only maint on regular basic. But it actually work well. The drawback is that has no privacy. i-e carrier know who u r and whom u are talking to.
17:36:23 <Baba[m]> Txt body is highly encrypted anyway.
17:40:26 <helloworldkk87[m> Because there are better messengers and silence is dead and is not being updated
17:41:31 <Baba[m]> Sure there are. But im talking about sms. Anyway silence doent need any update. As its working ofline if not using msm feature
17:42:19 <Baba[m]> Mms"
17:42:59 <helloworldkk87[m> I dont get why would you want to use sms in the first place. And updates are very important no matter what the app is
17:44:16 <Baba[m]> Sometime ppl need to send sms. Its not that wifi or mobile data is aval all the time. Few carrier support free sms featured.
17:44:49 <Baba[m]> Anyway there was alot of debate on this top earlier
17:45:13 <helloworldkk87[m> Yeah you can do what you want but its not recommended
17:45:36 <Jasper[m]1> In what scenario would there be sms service, but no mobile data? Not even 2G ?
17:45:40 <Baba[m]> You cannot say what is recomm and what is not.
17:46:30 <Baba[m]> <Jasper[m]1 "In what scenario would there be "> Yes i face problem like such. Mainly in mountanious area.
17:47:10 <helloworldkk87[m> I myself would not recommend Silence and many experts like madaidan and daniel agrees with this
17:48:10 <Jasper[m]1> If SMS is all you got there‚Äôs not much of an alternative I suppose.
17:48:24 <Baba[m]> <helloworldkk87[m "I myself would not recommend Sil"> Those genious only recomm encrypted IM over silence due to privacy issuer only.
17:48:59 <Baba[m]> <Jasper[m]1 "If SMS is all you got there‚Äôs no"> Yes i hv no alternative and thts why
17:50:06 <Baba[m]> Problem with sms is that carrier know who you are talking to.
17:50:45 <Baba[m]> Silence only make it difficult for carrier "what you are talking about" by encrypting the sms body
17:51:13 <Baba[m]> Now its up to the user
17:51:37 <Baba[m]> Compromise on privacy and preserve the security
17:52:34 <Baba[m]> But again the carrier will get suspicious about the txt encryption. Govnt or agency can get alert by the communication made on silence
18:26:53 <madaidan[m]1> Silence is an ancient fork of Signal and hasn't been updated in over a year. You should not be using it if you care at all for security or privacy. SMS is fundamentally insecure and there isn't much worth in papering encryption over it when you can just switch to something modern and secure like Signal.
18:27:53 <deadlydata[m]> Yeah SMS is major vulnerable, you should use signal.
18:28:42 <billinmtl[m]> I know you can use Signal for SMS, although not encrypted - is it better than stock SMS ?
18:29:12 <madaidan[m]1> <billinmtl[m] "I know you can use Signal for SM"> Not much difference.
18:30:17 <fomijafi[m]> It's still SMS. Daniel often recommends using a different app for SMS than signal. I believe this is to avoid getting confused or a false sense of security.
18:32:40 <strcat[m]> using SMS shouldn't be comfortable
18:32:47 <strcat[m]> you should be explicitly doing something insecure
18:38:48 <pkgbuild[m]> i wasn't able to open an sms received on the second account, but yes on first one and there was silence installed
18:39:07 <pkgbuild[m]>  * i wasn't able to open an sms received on the second account, but yes on first one and there was silence installed on the primary
18:41:48 <strcat[m]> Silence is a dead project
18:41:50 <strcat[m]> shouldn't use it
18:42:01 <strcat[m]> not maintained, and not really useful anymore since you can'
18:42:10 <strcat[m]>  * not maintained, and not really useful anymore since you can't do E2E encryption without the other end installing it anyway
18:42:17 <strcat[m]> it doesn't get security updates
18:45:24 <Jasper[m]1> Using an sms app that doesn‚Äôt receive updates anymore might also leave you susceptible to attacks. (RCE vulnerabilities wouldn‚Äôt be patched)
18:46:51 <Jasper[m]1> So on top of not adding anything meaningful if adds additional attack surface
18:47:03 <pkgbuild[m]> ok i will uninstall it anyway it was installed on primary profile and i recevied the message when i was one the secondary, without silence installed, i had to go back on the primary to read it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
18:48:33 <Wonderfall[m]> Yeah Silence is a very old fork of SMSSecure (now known as Signal), with codebase updates, don't use it

18:53:58 <Wonderfall[m]> Stock app should be more than fine
18:54:03 <Wonderfall[m]> SMS itself should be avoided though
18:54:13 <pkgbuild[m]> visually i remember stock gets silent updates

21:27:26 <cyborgninjaneer[> You know what I think I should do is fool around with trying to get Micay's hardened-malloc working with Alpine. I'm not completely sure how to change the memory allocator though.
21:27:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> Then I can go through a bunch of the customizations in madaidan's guide

22:08:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> Where do you see the advantages? I thought that Qubes is based on hyper-v?
22:09:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
22:09:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Qubes isn't based on hyperv
22:09:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hyper-v has stronger isolation and assumes guests are malicious to some degree
22:09:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> Sorry, my bad ... misread. üòû
22:10:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> At the same time hyperv has attack surface when you connect to the vm. It actually tells you to use RDP or ssh
22:10:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can pass through a GPU
22:10:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> But never run an untrusted OS directly using the connect button
22:11:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> You have to ssh, RDP or use DDA to pass a GPU and other peripherals
22:12:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can use VNC too
22:12:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> So start your VM
22:12:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then connect to it using ssh
22:12:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or something
22:13:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> * But never look at the screen of an untrusted OS directly using the connect button
22:13:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> IIRC Qubes has templates shared between the VM, saving disk space and updating effort. Does hyper-v offer something comparable?
22:14:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> Have to read up on hyper-v min. requirements. Also have not used Windows for quite a while.
22:15:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's basically known attacks if you use "connect" to connect to a compromised VM
22:15:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since the connect button spawns a session that isn't sandboxed and has full system access
22:16:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> üò≥
22:18:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well ideally you aren't ever supposed to connect
22:18:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> All this is why I asked about using a GOS-Pixel with PC peripherals above ... seems to me that most of the use cases would be covered with higher security and less additional effort.

22:21:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> Which requires building GOS myself, right? Steep learning curve ahead ... üòâ
22:21:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> You only need dtbo.img
22:21:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might need to enable a few options in kernel
22:21:58 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> ...and some understanding about what I am doing, I guess. Which I am sadly lacking as of now.
22:22:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Think Qualcomm has a config option for MHI
22:22:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unsure
22:22:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> And this is not supported officially for lack of maintainers or because it opens attack surface or ... ?
22:23:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> A starting point is finding out why Google disabled the feature in the first place
22:23:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> They enabled it initially, cited regressions and then disabled it
22:23:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> Interesting.
22:25:00 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> My thinking is that, instead of additionally diving into Tor, Whonix, Qubes, Clip etc. to secure my PC, maybe I should invest the time into understanding Android / GOS better and focus on making that work for most of my needs.
22:26:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> So the information that this could be possible in principle already helps a lot. Thanks. üòä
22:28:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> I use windows in S mode xd
22:32:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> I am still a Linux user and until recently believed myself pretty safe because of that ... üò≥
22:37:03 <Cliff[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I use windows in S mode xd"> Is s mode free? And can i run wdga+edge in s mode?
22:37:17 <Cliff[m]> I have 10 pro
22:37:38 <Cliff[m]> Wdag*
23:04:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2865484?hl=en
23:05:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> Just found this in the main channel and thought I add it here in answer to my question about phone as PC if anybody is interested.
23:06:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Cliff[m] "Is s mode free? And can i run wd"> That's what I am trying to understand rn
23:06:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can switch to S mode by using an unattend file for now
23:41:54 <ypm[m]> i would avoid windows
23:42:29 <ypm[m]> linux may be "insecure" by default on a lot of distros but windows is unverifiable
23:42:52 <ypm[m]> You're better off hardening linux IMO
23:43:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html
23:43:20 <secrypt[m]> You know what's better then Linux
23:43:32 <secrypt[m]> ?
23:43:40 <secrypt[m]> Nothing.
23:43:44 <ypm[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "https://madaidans-insecurities.g"> yeah like i said youre better off hardening linux
23:44:10 <[r|y`a_n]> verifiability is not very useful if nobody is doing the verifying
23:44:43 <ypm[m]> If you are being targeted you have every reaosn to do that verifying yourself
23:44:51 <ypm[m]> and only linux and *bsd have that
23:44:59 <ypm[m]> possibility
23:45:08 <[r|y`a_n]> "possibility"
23:45:54 <ypm[m]> If you aren't being targeted by a dedicated adversary then anything works, really. just follow basic common sense rules
23:45:58 <[r|y`a_n]> as things are today, Linux kernel is unverifiable within a reasonable timeframe no matter who you are
23:46:42 <[r|y`a_n]> this is definitely not something anyone on this channel could reasonably achieve
23:46:51 <ypm[m]> You have even less of a clue with windows or macos
23:47:24 <ypm[m]> Like I said if you are being targeted youre better off running something like qubes or a custom hardened distro
23:47:37 <ypm[m]> Not windows
23:49:14 <[r|y`a_n]> perhaps, but the real reasons for that have nothing to do with verifiability
23:49:39 <Baobab> I'm confused with what you guys are talking about.
23:50:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Baobab: just ramblings going on here, don't have energy to deal with this shit
23:50:50 <[r|y`a_n]> whether or not "verifiability" is actually a meaningful attribute when it comes to comparing the security of "normal" operating systems
23:51:26 <Cliff[m]> I use windows 10 only for gaming, wich is too much work on linux.
23:51:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> madaidan.
23:51:35 <ypm[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Baobab: just ramblings going on "> something something spoon theory
23:52:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> ypm: something something moderator warning for spreading FUD
23:52:31 <Cliff[m]> I would still prefer my macbook over linux for ease of use and still being pretty secure.
23:53:41 <ypm[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "ypm: something something moderat"> im just saying im not trying to start an argument over here, spoon theory is a metaphor for dealing with mental fatigue so i get it
23:54:00 <ypm[m]> not sure how im spreading fud?? but ill drop it
23:55:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> ypm: please read what I linked you to
23:56:51 <ypm[m]> ive read their site some time ago, and i agree with most of what they say
23:57:02 <Baobab> what site?
23:57:29 <ypm[m]> the one linked some messages above
