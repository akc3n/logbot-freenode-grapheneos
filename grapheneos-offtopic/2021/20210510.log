07:52:28 <strcat[m]> you're going to need to be more specific
07:55:30 <izymandias[m]> i watched the dissident recently and they talk about how they were able to track jamal khashoggi by sending a text to his friend that contained the pegasus malware
07:56:07 <izymandias[m]> he clicked on a link in a text
07:56:33 <izymandias[m]> that basically allowed them to extract all the data from his phone
07:56:46 <izymandias[m]> was wondering if this is something that can still be done
07:59:16 <strcat[m]> you're not really asking a specific enough question to answer
07:59:28 <strcat[m]> of course iPhones still have RCE bugs, if that's the question
08:01:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <izymandias[m] "he clicked on a link in a text "> sounds more like social engineering than any real hacking
08:07:32 <izymandias[m]> check out the documentar. its really good.
08:08:38 <izymandias[m]> was just surprised to hear that they had access to ALL his data
08:09:08 <izymandias[m]> thought that data would be encrypted
08:11:31 <izymandias[m]>  * check out the documentary. its really good.
08:16:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> encryption is only useful when the data is at rest
08:16:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> which is almost never for an android phone
08:17:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> grapheneos supports user profiles and allows the user to make the data in a profile go back to rest
08:19:27 <izymandias[m]> what about iphones?
08:20:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> not really aware

09:16:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> how does the strength of encryption matter
09:20:00 <kayront> then again it's not meant to stop zero days when the data isn't at rest, so

09:44:49 <Pratyush[m]> and .... it always create that "vs" effect in community. (i hate when people ask this or that, just do your own research on both and make your own conclusion why people always like to get misinformed).
09:47:26 <hypokeimenon[m]> You can't really dance around the idea that one platform may be better for certain things than the other. If you are talking about tribalism around one platform vs. the other I agree it is misguided but that sort of thing is really pervasive in modern society right now.

15:12:23 <kayront> i skipped 10 altogether, so some of those changes came as a shock lol
15:12:49 <kayront> my pretty layout of many years, and now on a bigger screen, and i can't pull it off because i can't customize grid size anymore. thanks google!
15:12:49 <kayront> :D
15:13:23 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> You still technically can, but the options are 3x3, 4x4, 5x5
15:13:59 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <kayront "my pretty layout of many years, "> So they kinda kept it, I guess? At Styles and Wallpapers apps
15:14:58 <kayront> think i missed that indeed, i was looking in home settings
15:16:06 <kayront> hmmm, so i installed fdroid in profile A and created profile B, and froid doesn't show in profile B .. which matches what seems sane, but seems to contradict the popup that said that any user could update any apps for any other
15:16:39 <kayront> also nice that i can't seem to see the contents of /sdcard etc from the different profiles (again, matching what seems sane)
15:18:11 <kayront> everything is put at rest for real when you switch, right? like, apps actually stop running
15:19:18 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <kayront "everything is put at rest for re"> That's only if you press end session, found when holding power off button or at lock screen at secondary users
15:20:08 <kayront> yeah. but for instance now i'm in profile B, the apps in the owner profile are *really* stopped and the data at rest too? or is owner special
15:22:31 <kayront> also .. say i wanted to copy over stuff from owner profile to another profile, or even between user profiles. given the isolation, is it possible without transfering off-device and importing ?
15:22:48 <kayront> (i'm beginning to realize i should perhaps minimize usage of the owner profile, heh)
15:25:47 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <kayront "yeah. but for instance now i'm i"> You can technically force stop some apps, but some system components will keep on running for functionality reasons

16:01:47 <covid-1984[m]> You guys have any idea how YouTube knows what country a SIM card is from? I'm pretty sure I didn't watch YT vids in Vanadium over LTE - but I might have. Anyway, I had a SIM in from another country for a day or so - and now all YouTube video ads are in that language/for that country :P I don't really care; just a curious phenomenon.

18:14:50 <djentosaurus[m]> oh! My apologies
18:15:49 <djentosaurus[m]> My problem when I try to charge my phone is that it flashes the whole time. It connects and disconnects constantly
18:18:08 <djentosaurus[m]> very annoying
18:18:15 <djentosaurus[m]> and unusable
18:18:27 <djentosaurus[m]> sometimes it works for a few secondqs
18:18:30 <djentosaurus[m]> seconds
18:22:09 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Yes, this shouldn't be expected. Are you using the original charger and cable and the charger is plugged into a power outlet?
18:22:22 <djentosaurus[m]> yes
18:22:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> He's got them second hand tho
18:22:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> (or she, or they)

18:23:07 <djentosaurus[m]> an old ipad charger
18:23:13 <djentosaurus[m]> It works but is slower
18:23:19 <djentosaurus[m]> I want the rapid charge
18:23:28 <ypm[m]> are you using a power extension?
18:23:34 <ypm[m]> or plugging directly to the wall
18:23:35 <djentosaurus[m]> what is that?
18:23:47 <djentosaurus[m]> directly into the wall
18:23:53 <djentosaurus[m]> with the official charger
18:24:02 <ypm[m]> ok then i dont have a clue
18:24:14 <djentosaurus[m]> Same here
18:25:33 <ypm[m]> try swapping cables/chargers so you can deduce which is the faulty one
18:25:40 <ypm[m]> it could just be the cable
18:26:02 <ypm[m]> its most likely the cable, imo
18:27:35 <djentosaurus[m]> I tried a new cable as well
18:27:50 <djentosaurus[m]> My Ipad charger works with it
18:27:54 <djentosaurus[m]> but it's slower
18:28:25 <djentosaurus[m]> I'm going to send a video so you guys can see the problem
18:28:44 <nscnt[m]> Sounds like you figured it out then?
18:29:30 <djentosaurus[m]> I'm not sure...I think it's weird it does connect sometimes
18:29:42 <djentosaurus[m]> for a few seconds
18:29:50 <djentosaurus[m]> and then the flashing starts

18:33:19 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Make sure that there is no dirt in the connections of the cable and the phone port
18:34:13 <nscnt[m]> Just to rule that out
18:35:32 <djentosaurus[m]> keeps flashing
18:36:20 <djentosaurus[m]> tried different outlets as well
18:37:10 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Does it work with the iPad charger but the same cable? If so, it sounds like the charger is the source of error
18:37:37 <djentosaurus[m]> Yeah, the ipad charger with the cable work fine
18:38:27 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Alright, seems like you were able to track down the problem
18:39:35 <djentosaurus[m]> New charger it is
18:42:43 <nscnt[m]> I think so. However, without guarantee ^_^
18:43:01 <djentosaurus[m]> I just hope that when I buy a new charger it will work
18:45:39 <nscnt[m]> A good return policy at the shop would be helpful in case it doesn't solve the problem
18:46:08 <djentosaurus[m]> When I restart the phone and charge it, it does seem to charge
18:46:10 <djentosaurus[m]> weird
18:46:22 <djentosaurus[m]> When I'm not on my homescreen
18:46:56 <djentosaurus[m]> my mistake, it doesn't
18:47:04 <djentosaurus[m]> sometimes it works for a couple of seconds
18:49:27 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: It' certainly not a software problem. A reboot or similar will not solve the problem
18:49:37 <nscnt[m]> *It's
18:51:51 <djentosaurus[m]> Isn't it weird that there is a pattern going on when I try to charge it
18:52:03 <djentosaurus[m]> charge uncharge charge uncharge
19:03:10 <bypassbobby[m]> Hello people just wanted to ask a question. If you use the same password under 2 profiles in graphene they have different encryption. Is it the same for apps like keepass?
19:10:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <bypassbobby[m] "Hello people just wanted to ask "> Depends on their implementation
19:32:24 <bypassbobby[m]> Keepass specifically using aes encryption
19:51:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <bypassbobby[m] "Keepass specifically using aes e"> I don't mean the algorithm - I mean stuff like filesystem-based encryption
19:57:24 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Read grapheneos.org/faq#encryption and stuff about the encryption structure
20:10:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> So...
20:10:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I know it's insecure, but anti-fingerprinting wise how is Librewolf?

20:24:33 <skwisgaar[m]> I am impersonating Railgun_Lover: the documentation says that over 500 various patches are applied to the browser, so that will substantially hurt fingerprinting by making your browser very unique.
20:25:22 <Railgun_Lover[m]> skwisgaar: right but does librewolf do a good job of making all users look the same?
20:27:52 <skwisgaar[m]> I am impersonating Railgun_Lover: based on their priorities I highly doubt it. Seems their philosophy is very unlike that of vanadium.

20:36:16 <djentosaurus[m]> What about Graphene?
20:36:27 <djentosaurus[m]> Is it not safe after 1 year for me then?
20:39:33 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "If they wanted to make users loo"> Well that's not what they would do
20:39:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They would try to prevent differentiating between different librewolf users
20:40:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just like how Tor Browser differentiates between different users, but doesn't care about looking like Firefox
20:41:33 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "Is it not safe after 1 year for "> Sort of
20:41:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You won't get updates and that ruins the point of the OS
20:42:27 <djentosaurus[m]> Too bad...sigh
20:42:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> read grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
20:43:22 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "Too bad...sigh"> You can still use your device, it won't become a wasteland of death and destruction used for DDoSing websites the second it stops being updated
20:43:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But it is still insecure
20:44:18 <djentosaurus[m]> It's like using windows 7 in 2021 then
20:44:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> So if reducing e waste and cost outweighs the security risk, you could be OK, though you should at that point just give it to some poor kid
20:44:34 <skwisgaar[m]> I am impersonating Railgun_Lover: I disagree, I think that the philosophy of vanadium is the correct one for typical browsers, where vanadium tries to blend in with chrome.
20:44:49 <skwisgaar[m]> Remember that tor browser is a very unique case
20:45:12 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You fundamentally cannot make a browser look like another browser, without effectively being that browser
20:45:29 <skwisgaar[m]> That‚Äôs what vanadium is designed to do
20:45:54 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Anti fingerprinting will make it obvious that you're using tor browser/librewolf/brave
20:46:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> The issue is can you differentiate between different users
20:46:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> At least, that's to my knowledge
20:50:23 <skwisgaar[m]> Fingerprinting is a bit more complicated than that. For example, vanadium is not as easily fingerprinted as other chromium derivatives, because it attempts to blend in with chrome. It hasn‚Äôt implemented ‚Äúanti-fingerprinting‚Äù in this case, but is still harder to fingerprint. Unless you consider blending in with chrome to be anti-fingerprinting I guess.
20:51:09 <x-seraph-x[m]> <Baba[m] "https://rethinkdns.com/"> So which DNS option on grapheme would be best to use?
20:52:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "Fingerprinting is a bit more com"> Yeah but that means they're preventing differentiating between users

21:09:43 <strcat[m]> please read what it says about using alternate DNS with a VPN
21:11:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> skwisgaar: Now that I've read the LibreWolf documentation, it seems their anti fingerprinting is very bad and doesn't actually do much except make one stand out.
21:12:33 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It just had a decent reputation so I thought it would be decent...apparently it just adds a bunch of "privacy" extensions which don't actually improve privacy.
21:26:53 <Cliff[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "So it makes the herd larger"> Is there any data on how many people use vanadium or graphene os?
