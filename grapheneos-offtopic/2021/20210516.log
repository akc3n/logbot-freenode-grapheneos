00:00:26 <bearbyte[m]> <dazinism "Think the only extra thing an ap"> That's already pretty much
00:00:44 <bearbyte[m]> You could track people with that pretty well
00:01:22 <bearbyte[m]> Is there a possibity to restrict that? Would the storage option be that permission?
00:01:31 <dazinism> No way
00:01:42 <M7777777y[m]> I think having a graphene OS VM on qubes could be interesting, especially if you could mod it to have like a regular screen size for a computer - to benefit from all the graphene hardening.
00:01:43 <M7777777y[m]> Last I saw there was some problems getting android working well on qubes but it should be possible
00:01:49 <dazinism> Other than using a different profile
00:02:20 <akc3n[m]> <bearbyte[m] "I think kinda virtualization wou"> Shelter does not provide any sandboxing at all.
00:02:26 <M7777777y[m]> Qubes mostly uses linux VMs but linux still has a lot of security problems

00:03:33 <_[m]3> is parrot a privacy focused OS, IE wont steal my data and watch what I do?
00:03:34 <dazinism> actually doing stuff in a profile where no apps have network permission would have benefits over just relying on the app sandbox
00:03:52 <bearbyte[m]> <_[m]3 "is parrot a privacy focused OS, "> Isn't that a pentesting os?
00:04:06 <_[m]3> yes
00:04:14 <_[m]3> Im talking about home edition though
00:04:16 <bearbyte[m]> <dazinism "actually doing stuff in a profil"> Why?
00:05:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> because interprocess communication is thing
00:05:16 <dazinism> Because all apps in the same profile can talk to each other via mutual consent
00:06:25 <dazinism> Currently, I think, the only pre installed app that will let another app without network permission reach the network is vanadium
00:06:48 <bearbyte[m]> <dazinism "Because all apps in the same pro"> So would it be possible for an app to "spy" on me using the network permission of an other app to send data home though theoretically very unlikely?
00:07:06 <bearbyte[m]> <dazinism "Currently, I think, the only pre"> Ah I see
00:07:11 <bearbyte[m]> How do I check that?
00:08:18 <dazinism> The second app woukd have to open a webpage that you would see - it would come into foreground
00:08:42 <dazinism> The data sent out would be via a very long url
00:09:11 <bearbyte[m]> Okay already thought its possible in the background...
00:09:45 <blaqkbsd[m]> Does graphene check the binaries crc in case of exec jailbreak? Trip-wire like program?
00:16:21 <dazinism> 7y: theres some funding available for work on porting GrapheneOS to qubes. Some details somewhere in the qubes github issues
00:16:47 <akc3n[m]> <_[m]3 "is parrot a privacy focused OS, "> There is also distro-morphing, whonix developers made kicksecure which hardened_malloc.
00:17:17 <M7777777y[m]> Kicksecure is very easy to install into a debian-10-minimal template in qubes!
00:17:35 <M7777777y[m]> You definitely should be using it instead of stuff like fedora that is included by default
00:18:38 <M7777777y[m]> dazinism: I think it would be great, especially, to use graphene OS on a computer with free firmware and qubes OS, then you can take advantage of graphene without the google firmware
00:18:43 <dazinism> <M7777777y[m] "Kicksecure is very easy to insta"> Is that process documented anywhere? Thought it still needed some work

00:20:17 <dazinism> Tried hardened malloc?
00:20:39 <M7777777y[m]> No, in the documentation actually says "if you are using qubes do this command instead"
00:21:00 <dazinism> Apparmor everything?

00:21:13 <M7777777y[m]> But regular apparmor profiles and stuff are

03:09:04 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Lol"> :P
03:09:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> ramenweekend: but legitimately, duckduckgo is such a bad search engine
03:09:40 <ramenweekend[m]> Really? Oh no!
03:09:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Apparently they take Bing results and do the impossible
03:09:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They make them worse
03:10:09 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Eh, Bing is around as bad
03:10:27 <ramenweekend[m]> They'll start mining for ETH hidden in their privacy policy.
03:11:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Duckduckgo isn't really a good search engine for anything other than basic stuff
03:11:47 <M7777777y[m]> Let's be real, are there any good search engines at all?
03:11:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <M7777777y[m] "Let's be real, are there any *go"> Google
03:12:12 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You can type a date and you will get what you're looking for

03:13:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's because they legitimately make excellent products

03:13:50 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <ramenweekend[m] "If it wasn't obvious. I'm "basic"> RIP
03:13:51 <M7777777y[m]> But the trade off to give them power to manipulate is not worth it
03:14:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <M7777777y[m] "They have a lot of resources to "> So they're a good engine
03:14:13 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <M7777777y[m] "But the trade off to give them p"> Sure, that's your choice
03:14:37 <ramenweekend[m]> Tech as a hobby is fun until you run into people that know a lot more than you which was obvious.
03:14:39 <M7777777y[m]> By good engine I also mean privacy respecting and not bad forsociety
03:15:04 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <M7777777y[m] "By good engine I also mean priva"> Makes sense
03:15:06 <M7777777y[m]> But yeah specifically getting good results of course google does best
03:15:13 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I was referring to finding what you're looking for
03:15:17 <M7777777y[m]> But theres nothing that ticks all the boxes
03:15:26 <M7777777y[m]> Sadly
03:15:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Google is weird with Tor users
03:15:51 <ramenweekend[m]> Are you referring to the Captchas?
03:15:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Sometimes they let them pass, though you get Hungarian results
03:16:03 <ramenweekend[m]> You're flagged as a robot.
03:16:04 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <ramenweekend[m] "Are you referring to the Captcha"> Yes
03:16:05 <M7777777y[m]> Anything thats goign to give captchas that require js is unusable for me lol
03:16:27 <M7777777y[m]> But actually I can get google through startpage and it works on tor so that's helpful sometimes
03:16:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Sometimes they let them pass, th"> Other times you have to complete 5 captcha tests that they forcibly mark as wrong even though you got everything
03:17:13 <ramenweekend[m]> It has to be intentional to frustrate us "robots"
03:17:13 <M7777777y[m]> Yes sometimes after I get it right
03:17:14 <M7777777y[m]> It's like
03:17:24 <M7777777y[m]> Alright you finished the captcha but you sent too many requests, bug off
03:17:30 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Please try again
03:17:38 <M7777777y[m]> Nah it just straight up says nope
03:17:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> True, that sometimes happens
03:18:20 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But I notice my captcha performance is far better otherwise, than in Google tor
03:18:32 <M7777777y[m]> Soemthing like yaci might be a good solution to tick all the boxes, but yaci is very like, not that good yet
03:18:42 <M7777777y[m]> It needs a lot of users and more development
03:19:05 <M7777777y[m]> I tried yaci over tor once and I got basically the most irrelevant results I could have possibly imagined
03:19:16 <M7777777y[m]> I found like random stuff from 2003 basically
03:19:22 <ramenweekend[m]> Isn't that the same thing with map makers putting in fake places to catch people copying their work. Other search engines will copy each other.
03:19:23 <M7777777y[m]> That didnt even have any of the keywords
03:19:58 <M7777777y[m]> I think I would have gotten better results if I wasn't using tor and allowed like, yaci to like sync more with my device or something though
03:20:18 <M7777777y[m]> It lets you index locally
03:20:29 <M7777777y[m]> Which is amazing
03:20:44 <M7777777y[m]> Imagine something almost as good as google but its indexed locally on your device
03:20:56 <ramenweekend[m]> I'm guessing "yaci" isn't a cosmetics line 😂
03:21:07 <M7777777y[m]> Yaci is a decentralized search engine
03:21:29 <M7777777y[m]> Maybe its spelled yacy I forgot
03:21:32 <ramenweekend[m]> 1st result on DDG was the cosmetics line.
03:21:40 <ramenweekend[m]> It's YaCy
03:21:48 <M7777777y[m]> My bad
03:21:57 <ramenweekend[m]> I'm open to trying it out.
03:22:15 <M7777777y[m]> In any case, GNUnet aims to have like locally indexed search engine
03:22:40 <M7777777y[m]> Basically gnunet wants to solve evevrything thats broken about the internet, which is almost everything, so, it's basically a new internet
03:23:34 <ramenweekend[m]> Until someone writes a blank check and they sell out or they create something that kills the internet ("Silicon Valley" reference).

10:16:23 <hypokeimenon[m]> <M7777777y[m] "I thought signal wasn't federate"> Signal can be federated. Moxie and co. just don't because when they used to do it, the development costs and degradation of the service were too much for their liking.
10:16:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> exfoliat: that's expected behavior
10:16:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> The storage permission is legacy for most apps
10:17:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can "download" most stuff and save it
10:19:13 <strcat> exfoliat[m]: it's not
10:19:22 <strcat> exfoliat[m]: storage permissions are legacy, modern apps don't use them
10:23:12 <strcat> you shouldn't give apps bulk access to the profile's storage directory, that's a legacy thing
10:23:43 <strcat> hasn't been needed since Android 4.4 (for files) and 5.0 (for directories) since they can request case-by-case access to shared storage
10:24:50 <strcat> Android 10 started removing it and Android 11 continued that, API 30+ apps can't ask for that anymore (there are still some coarse media access permissions, but for generic shared storage access it's phased out)
10:25:38 <strcat> apps always have acces to their own internal storage and their own app-specific directory in shared storage, so they don't need to request anything if they don't actually want to access shared storage from elsewhere or have the user save files to arbitrary places

12:54:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT allows for finer-grained read/write access for certain files instead of allowing an app to see your whole profile storage directory

17:01:21 <hypokeimenon[m]> When you're starting out, a lot of your questions will be vague.
17:02:45 <surveillexxxx[m]> I just installed graphene OS on a pixel and was wondering what apps would be good for Messaging, Email, Hiding myself.
17:05:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> Compartmentalising your information is the best option IMO. Use multiple user profiles - one for personal/friends/family, another for increased privacy. Most people don't need Orbot or Briar for everything
17:06:02 <surveillexxxx[m]> What is briar
17:06:33 <GhostSplinterSix> A messaging app
17:06:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> It's a P2P messaging app that can route traffic through Tor network. It's not a great app, but if you want to communicate anonymously it's a good option.
17:07:10 <surveillexxxx[m]> is session good?
17:07:57 <Baba[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<CrowmacMcCarthy> It's a P2P mes"> And why it ia not great?
17:08:57 <GhostSplinterSix> Briar is one of the best.
17:09:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> It's not a great messaging app in terms of experience in my opinion. I'm not saying it's not good for anonymity.
17:09:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> What is 'good'?
17:10:07 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> Messaging apps are mostly useless if their userbase is tiny
17:10:29 <Baba[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<CrowmacMcCarthy> It's not a gre"> Yes in term of use. Like you can find very rear people to communicate. I think its for power users. Not simple users
17:36:20 <acronym[m]> <tharg[m]1 "> <@tharg:matrix.org> Hi team "> I do not think this is possible with Messaging app.
17:42:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> @CromacMcCarthy every messaging app had a small userbase at the beginning.
17:45:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> True, but I don't think Briar will get as big as Element, let alone Telegram
17:46:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> it is a niche app
17:55:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> surveillexxxx: Others will offer more opinions, but I am not too keen on Session. Transitioned to a protocol with no forward secrecy or deniability in the middle of a *short* security audit.
17:56:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> They also started off marketing a lot of features they had not really implemented yet, if I remember right.
17:56:23 <surveillexxxx[m]> Would Briar be better
17:56:54 <hypokeimenon[m]> Depends on what information you wish to protect/hide, and who from.
17:57:19 <surveillexxxx[m]> I want no one seeing my messages except the recipitent
17:58:23 <hypokeimenon[m]> For what it's worth, I like Briar. I think the usability would take some getting used to, and having it only on Android and Linux is a big barrier.
17:59:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> Any end-to-end encrypted messenger would suffice. Why not just use Signal?
18:00:24 <surveillexxxx[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<CrowmacMcCarthy> Any end-to-end"> I do, Signal has just been going down lately since the coin
18:05:44 <hypokeimenon[m]> surveillexxxx: There are some cool resources you can read around this sort of thing. The tl;dr is that what suits you best is something only you can answer yourself after having done a bit of good research. If you understand what you need from the messenger, then you know what to look out for. It is difficult to recommend one app without mentioning the possible downsides, and every app has them.
18:06:13 <surveillexxxx[m]> what are the downsides of briar
18:06:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> Having said that, there are some options you should probably stay away from if your objective is security/privacy. Things like Telegram, for example.
18:07:17 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> You say that, but Element's Windows desktop app is objectively worse than Telegram's
18:07:50 <surveillexxxx[m]> element is bad?
18:08:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> Element: shitty Electron desktop app. Telegram: nice, Windows store app
18:11:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> surveillexxxx: If you pretend that Matrix is like email, Element is more like the default mail app on a given OS. It is one of many clients you can use for Matrix. Matrix itself is a work-in-progress, and unfortunately Element is the most full-featured client at the moment if you need all the functions.
18:12:26 <surveillexxxx[m]> what is a good privacy focused one I can use
18:12:39 <surveillexxxx[m]> I dont need all the details and pretty UI's
18:13:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> I think that's a question better asked in #matrix:matrix.org
18:33:13 <M7777777y[m]> Element is super bloat
18:33:24 <M7777777y[m]> - Me, An element user
18:34:13 <M7777777y[m]> I dont think element is significantly worse for privacy than any of the others
18:34:16 <M7777777y[m]> It's just bloat
18:34:34 <M7777777y[m]> The only thing I can think of maybe there is more attack surface in it because of that
18:35:10 <hypokeimenon[m]> What do you consider bloat?
18:35:17 <M7777777y[m]> electron
18:35:47 <M7777777y[m]> JS in general
18:36:09 <M7777777y[m]> Dont get me wrong elements not that bad its just slow as fuck for me
18:37:52 <M7777777y[m]> Surveillexxx if you want a terminal client you can try gomuks
18:41:27 <M7777777y[m]> Sadly I don't know of any good matrix terminal clients written in C, if someone knows of one let me know
18:44:36 <akc3n[m]> Weechat is pretty good.
18:45:48 <GhostSplinterSix> <M7777777y[m] "Dont get me wrong elements not t"> Yeah, it's slow at times for me, too, even if I have full bars and/or am connected to WiFi at home.
18:45:50 <akc3n[m]> And you can get weechat-matrix-rust plugin
18:46:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <C​rowmacMcCarthy> Not to be confused with WeChat😉
18:49:41 <georgeaux[m]> What could be the best way to publish a general guide for privacy and security if it is not your profession, but you are familiar how to refer on publications and you do not want to recommand things, just to inform people in your country. And you also see that noone else want to take this responsibility, even people who might be more familiar with the topic.
18:51:23 <hypokeimenon[m]> I think start with a compendium of all the information, then get experts to help you on writing the actual basic guides and tutorials.
18:57:51 <akc3n[m]> <georgeaux[m] "What could be the best way to pu"> Tangibility.
18:59:14 <akc3n[m]> And then go in further about why this is good and provide resources, citations and reasons for this, as well as leading into privacy topics and small little guides.
19:01:22 <georgeaux[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "I think start with a compendium "> So you say that first i should figure out what could be the content, chapers, sections, headlines of the guide and then ask an expert to recommand trust worthy sources for those?
19:02:10 <akc3n[m]> Just my two cents and own personal project of how I think maybe helpful to my community. Since everyone here all talk about privacy and security but don't actually say anything at all that's on point or accurate. I figured it would be worth while to do something where they can relate to it, hence the hiking and biking stuff using GrapheneOS and those apps I mentioned above.
19:02:10 <akc3n[m]> At the very least, I get a great experience from it, both educationally and health wise as well.

19:30:31 <M7777777y[m]> Imagine if they kept most of the bitcoins, with what it's worth now, they would have quite a bit
19:30:41 <M7777777y[m]> And lucky for them
19:30:47 <M7777777y[m]> China has monopoly over the bitcoin mining

19:52:55 <GhostSplinterSix> Qubes + Whonix is where it's at. Combined, the two provide advanced security and anonymity. There's also Tails.
19:55:39 <M7777777y[m]> Tails doesn't seem very secure though
19:55:58 <surveillexxxx[m]> Will I still be able to install a desktop environment of my choice though?
19:56:11 <M7777777y[m]> TBB/Firefox ESR is not so secure and to be running javascript in tails would be a bad idea

20:37:23 <h3rb_> Hello everyone
20:37:42 <Thatcher[m]> Hi h3rb_
20:37:44 <h3rb_> Can someone please explain to me what is the difference between using Irc directly over Matrix + Element client
20:37:53 <akc3n[m]> Hi h3rb_
20:38:37 <akc3n[m]> Ones fast while the other lags. 😏
20:38:48 <h3rb_> I can't seem to understand difference between the both. Is matrix more secure?
20:39:43 <h3rb_> I have grapheneos on my phone and I'm trying to understand if getting on chatroom via matrix is the norm?
20:40:49 <h3rb_> Or am I good using good old basic IRC? Sorry for the off topic question but I don't understand the technicality behind this. Maybe someone can shed some light of the same. Thank you guys
20:41:01 <h3rb_> On*
20:48:18 <Thatcher[m]> In 2015 I became a 20 year irc veteran and never looked back. Element is the way to go. It's generally more private and secure by default for the average user. Lets you post inline images without uploading to hosts like imgur. Supports emojis, calls, end to end encrypted group chats that are way better than OTR. No fumbling around with nickserv and other crap to hide your IP from other users. No bridges or
20:48:18 <Thatcher[m]> hoppers required to stay logged in. And so much more.
20:49:20 <blaqkbsd[m]> Why does the Install guide (www) say nothing about OEM locking in the developer options after OS install?
20:50:00 <blaqkbsd[m]> I'm using Matrix just temporary for setting this up. I don't like the interface
20:51:28 <dnull> It does. https://grapheneos.org/install/web#disabling-oem-unlocking
20:53:00 <h3rb_> Thank you for explaining Thatcher
20:53:09 <h3rb_> Have a wonderful day ahead :)
20:53:37 <blaqkbsd[m]> <dnull "It does. https://grapheneos.org/"> Thanks
20:54:25 <h3rb_> One last thing is it possible to join rizon or dalnet server via matrix + element and will I get access to all the channels that come with those servers?
20:55:29 <Thatcher[m]> h3rb_ if they have a bridge to Matrix, then yes
20:55:59 <h3rb_> How can I know if they do?
20:56:34 <Thatcher[m]> One thing about most irc users i know from my experience is that they are old school and absolutely hate new stuff like matrix and element
20:57:19 <Thatcher[m]> A lot of servers do not have bridges to matrix, and never will
20:57:29 <h3rb_> Hmm. I'm willing to shift if it has more features and most importantly secure
20:58:07 <h3rb_> Got it so I will need a little bit of both
20:58:31 <h3rb_> Thank you for your time Thatcher
20:58:40 <Thatcher[m]> A lot of the stubborn irc base that are still active today also tend to be Ham radio operators
20:59:39 <h3rb_> Do you use irc or completely shift to matrix ?
21:00:12 <Thatcher[m]> I use matrix, no more irc
21:00:15 <h3rb_> Shifted*
21:00:23 <h3rb_> Ok cool
21:01:53 <Thatcher[m]> The lack of irc clients for mobile devices is synonymous to its popularity
21:05:04 <dazinism> To get to IRC networks that arent bridged to matrix I use conversations.im
21:05:27 <wags> good weekend all
21:05:51 <evdevd> the lack of irc clients for mobile clients is because irc is not compatible with the way mobile devices work
21:06:04 <dazinism> There are public xmpp <>IRC bridges that bridge users from any XMPP server to any IRC network
21:06:22 <evdevd> irc requires a constant connection to the server which is a problem for battery life
21:11:13 <Thatcher[m]> No privacy in irc servers either. Server moderators can snoop on the chats, even password protected chats, without your knowledge. Happened to me a few times on Freenode.
21:14:00 <dazinism> Using a public xmpp <> irc biboumi gateway and IRC messages get saved when you aren't online https://biboumi.louiz.org/
21:26:22 <dazinism> The Conversations xmpp client has really low battery draw

22:57:47 <akc3n[m]> <tharg[m]1 "> <@acronym:matrix.org> I do not"> AOSP upstream, "SMS" (messaging app included) nothing to do with GrapheneOS.
23:05:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> SMS is really bad
23:05:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Expensive, insecure, no idea who you're talking to
23:06:00 <Railgun_Lover[m]> MitM attacks
23:06:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> What if you use a stingray device to capture your entire neighborhood's texts and calls, lol
23:07:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Get 3 and track everyone
23:12:34 <jjstopper[m]> Question please: does anyone know the timeline for Pixel phones to become obsolete for Grapheneos? Specifically I'm wondering about the Pixel 4 and 4XL

23:13:17 <lackshan[m]> As soon as google stops releasing security patches afaik
23:13:35 <lackshan[m]> The supported devices section on the grapheneos website explains it in detail
23:14:13 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> after the final security update from Google, you should not expect GrapheneOS to support the phone, but it might get a few more months to live
23:28:38 <Telegram-Bridge> Moctezuma (@M​0ctezuma) has joined the Telegram Group!
23:29:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> @M0ctezuma yeah, never seen a research paper on GrapheneOS
23:29:10 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> No
23:29:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Thats what makes me nervous
23:29:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> 😅😅
23:29:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you can always write one yourself)
23:30:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> anyway, many Android security papers relate directly to GrapheneOS
23:30:41 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Lol if i find vulns i would sell them to russia lol
23:30:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Just joking 😅
23:31:08 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Can you give examples?
23:32:00 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> https://hub.libranet.de/cloud/and-priv-sec/Documents/android_security.pdf
23:32:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> this is a bit outdated already, but it's quite good)
23:32:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> And publish it for free so our shitty idiocracy government can use it against us. Great idea 😅
23:32:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Thx will take a look
23:33:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> step one: find a vulnstep two: report to GrapheneOS devsstep three: write up an article
23:33:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> by the time it gets published, it's likely gonna be fixed
23:34:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if not, it is either not so important or not so easy to exploit
23:36:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <m​adaidan> https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05572
23:38:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> oh nice, they updated it, tnx madaidan!
23:38:47 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> ♥️
23:41:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> The only way i'd do it😉
23:46:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> What i dont understand is, in nearly every paper they say, if they got a an unrooted phone in bfu state, with adb developer settings turned off, they have to root the device to extract personal data or evidence, how they call it. Wtf, the times i tampered with odin were 10years ago, but i remember the rooting process always "wiped" the data I know you cant wipe a phone 100%, but the thing is, even if you can resto
23:47:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <M​0ctezuma> Or do i got something wrong?
