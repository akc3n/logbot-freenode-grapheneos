00:20:08 <dnull> ypm[m]: SimpleCalendar from f-droid may be an option
00:27:57 <ypm[m]> ty for the suggestion
01:52:18 <squarmkt[m]> Repost from main: Anyone have an error, where if you go into a secondary profile and open an app that gives a no gapps installed message crashes if you don't hit okay the first time. It then shut the phone down and then on first restart went into recovery, but booted when I just said start normally
01:52:29 <akc3n[m]> Hi squarmkt  which app are you referring to?
01:54:02 <squarmkt[m]> Amex
01:54:18 <squarmkt[m]> * Amex (american express)
02:00:04 <akc3n[m]> <squarmkt[m] "Amex"> Have you tried using the Vanadium browser to access the mobile version of Amex. I had issues with my BMO canada banking app. However, using Vanadium browser, I was able to have the exact same UI and experience in Vanadium, as I would have with the app. But I understand however, it doesn't always work the same for other financial institutions.
02:23:09 <squarmkt[m]> <akc3n[m] "Have you tried using the Vanadiu"> The web ui is much different, but it will work in browser, was just trying to recreate it and I couldnt. First time I've had it crash the phone, so not terribly worried
02:25:30 <akc3n[m]> Gotcha.

04:48:13 <evdevd> yes

05:02:53 <Core6255> shame, I got termux so I could ffmpeg on my phone, lmao
05:03:10 <evdevd> just move the files into the termux directory
05:07:15 <Core6255> and you consider that a real solution ?
05:07:26 <evdevd> that's the only solution
05:07:28 <Core6255> I'm pretty mad

07:30:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!X> Imho exporting the history to USB in the old profile, switching to the new one and importing from USB following the standard instructions for changing phones on the WhatsApp website should work.
07:37:19 <covid-1984[m]> strcat: I'm curious if you think (some of the) improvements you made to Vanadium could be added to ungoogled-chromium (by their maintainers).
08:15:41 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> They technically can

08:26:33 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Grant it legacy Storage permission
08:27:18 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Grant it legacy Storage permissi"> (Not that recommended, imho)
08:31:47 <covid-1984[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "They technically can"> Was reply to me? Doesn't seem like they could join projects to deduplicate... But it would be cool if UG could benefit from any vanadium improvements.
09:03:57 <hypokeimenon[m]> covid-1984: I think Bromite borrows some nonspecific patches from Vanadium.
09:04:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <s‚Äãurfhard> I did try this several times and followed the instructions, but it continued giving me an error.But I just "solved" it üòÖüëè  I realized it was due to lacking permissions - so yeah, my bad, ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ haha.Whatsapp don't ask for the permission to access your files during the "restore backup" process, but it needs it.

09:49:17 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Besides not using email for sensitive information, maybe using encrypted mails in Tutanota/Protonmail (just another option)
09:51:10 <enjoy_the_silenc> Emails are to be considered as postcards. Those without gpg are postcards without an envelope while those with gpg are postcards with an envelope. It's easy to read the content in both cases and that's why every message should be considered as a postcard, and as we know people don't write private things in postcards.
09:52:16 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Maybe eposts would be a better name for them, but here we are lol
09:52:56 <enjoy_the_silenc> Thanks to all for the answers. So does OpenKeychain create GPG keys?

12:49:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> it is not recommended to install 3rd-party keyboards
12:50:15 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> as a keyboard app has a lot of special permissions, and therefore power
12:50:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <S‚Äãalimium> Yes i see, I previously used Gboard / Swiftkey disabling network access, but looking for a more trusted alternative
12:50:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> but if you do install, no one is going to stop you
12:51:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> disabling network access does not necessarily mean that they won't be able to send anything
12:51:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> interprocess communication is a thing
12:51:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <S‚Äãalimium> Apart from my conscience haha, would like a feature request for gesture. I do remember seeing an experimental option in some AOSP keyboards
12:52:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <S‚Äãalimium> Agree Hulk
12:52:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> afaik, it is planned to find an alternative keyboard and at some point replace the default AOSP keyboard
12:54:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> but iirc there are no good open-sourced, well supported, stable, and properly licensed keyboard that meets GrapheneOS projects requirements
12:59:46 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> references: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210505#c7885702
13:02:17 <Telegram-Bridge> <S‚Äãalimium> Many thanks for your answer and pointer, helps a beginner like me learn and contribute

13:04:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you're welcome!
13:05:16 <somenerd[m]> > <!Hulk> disabling network access does not necessarily mean that they won't be able to send anything
13:05:16 <somenerd[m]> it's not really a good idea to keep malicious or distrusted apps in privileged positions, and then assume that revoking network stops the app from doing anything
13:12:27 <trttl> you can try anysoftkeyboard. it's open source with an apache license, works without any permissions and this is from their github wiki: _Notice:_ This app _does not_ have _Internet_ permission, so it can not send any of the collected data (contacts or files) to anyplace outside your phone!
13:13:08 <Telegram-Bridge> <S‚Äãalimium> I just installed it and testing now, many thanksOpenboard didn't have gesture swype FYI
13:32:48 <stencil[m]> Was this talked about?
13:32:48 <stencil[m]> https://voidlinux.org/news/2021/02/OpenSSL.html
13:37:24 <Wonderfall[m]> yes, LibreSSL couldn't really keep up

13:39:28 <dazinism> trttl: Salimium : I think florisboard is possibly a better choice. Its new and still under heavy development, but has some nice features that Any Soft Keyboard does not.
13:40:41 <dazinism> Also the way Any Soft Keyboard interfaces with different keyboards, loaded as seperate apps/apks has security implications
13:41:11 <dazinism> *different keyboards / languages
13:41:29 <Telegram-Bridge> <S‚Äãalimium> I'll try it. Anysoftkeyboard settings GUI would really benefit from a redesign, took me 30 focussed minutes to customise it
13:41:48 <dazinism> https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard
13:42:27 <dazinism> Yeah theres a whole load of settings to play with in ASK.
13:42:35 <dazinism> And its confusing
13:42:59 <dazinism> But then florisboard settings is kind of similar
13:43:33 <dazinism> Florisboard does also have swype typing
13:44:46 <Telegram-Bridge> <S‚Äãalimium> Many thanks, will check it out
13:59:00 <trttl> i don't know much about florisboard haven't used it but of course see which one you like more
13:59:44 <trttl> yeah there's a bunch of settings in ask but you have to go through that once
14:00:04 <trttl> if you want something flexible usually it comes with the territory
14:26:30 <Core6255> evdevd If you install termux, then install a bunch of pkg's, then uninstall termux -- does it uninstall all the pkg's you installed earlier?

14:39:40 <trttl> on your old phone?
14:40:03 <djentosaurus[m]> no on the new one
14:40:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> fsamevljan[m]: you can check the logs, i'm pretty sure that you're adding an attack surface by doing so
14:40:34 <djentosaurus[m]> text messages in general
14:40:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> djentosaurus[m]: text messages don't get stored on a sim card
14:40:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> afaik
14:42:20 <fsamevljan[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> f.samevljan: you can che"> How so? Can you elaborate a little bit?
14:42:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i can, but i'd rather not
14:42:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> check the logs, i'm pretty sure this was discussed a lot
14:44:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> ok, maybe small elaboration: if an attacker finds a way to get to your "web admin panel", they can remote wipe your phone.
14:44:44 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that's a DoS attack
14:44:54 <djentosaurus[m]> Oh okay Telegram-bridge
14:46:24 <fsamevljan[m]> Ah, I see, thank you, I'm just wondering if the remote wipe benefit outweighs this risk.
14:46:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> depends on your threat model
14:48:05 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> look, if an attacker gains physical access to your phone, they can put it in a Faraday cage to make it inaccessible by any EM waves
14:48:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that is, the phone will have no internet connection, no radio, no gps, nothing at all
14:48:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> which makes a remote wipe completely useless
14:49:51 <Core6255> nvm, figured it out, app data > clear storage/cache.
14:50:38 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> fsamevljan[m]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage
14:50:43 <fsamevljan[m]> True, 100% agree, but that's if an attacker gains physical access. What if the phone is simply lost, I would much rather have that functionality available to me so I could know it's just a brick lost somewhere rather than my personal data ü§î

18:48:58 <just-a-bugger[m]> I recently disabled Firefox's DNS-over-HTTPS setting because I don't like the idea of my DNS requests going through cloudfare. But it got me thinking. Is this a good idea? Also, how does it compare to OEM-android's "Private DNS" feature?
18:48:58 <just-a-bugger[m]> Thanks dawgs
18:51:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> just-a-bugger[m]: you can read this https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/encrypted-dns.html
18:52:26 <just-a-bugger[m]> Yeah i actually recently read through that and similar articles. But I still think I am just a layman, so I wasn't sure if changing the default was even a good idea. Seems like it is
18:54:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i don't know, it's up to your threat model i guess
19:07:12 <ypm[m]> seems to me it encrypted dns doesnt really matter
19:07:21 <ypm[m]> your isp sees the IP ypure connecting to anyways
19:07:31 <ypm[m]> youre just adding another party to the mix
19:07:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah, theatrics
19:11:52 <skwisgaar[m]> I think I remember either str cat or madaidan mentioning that DoT is preferable to DoH, but I don‚Äôt exactly remember why.
19:12:16 <skwisgaar[m]> Was quite a while back and I can‚Äôt find those messages atm
19:13:03 <hypokeimenon[m]> Interested in that if you find it
19:14:33 <skwisgaar[m]> Don‚Äôt take my word for this but I think it was related to DoH having greater attack surface.
19:23:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "Don‚Äôt take my word for this but "> I guess it makes sense since DoT only needs IP, TCP and TLS to be considered whereas you get [HTTP as well](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484#section-8.2) with DoH.

19:42:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> I wonder if "find my phone" works perfectly on GrapheneOS
21:16:43 <djentosaurus[m]> Malwarebytes app on Graphene...yay or nay?
21:17:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> nay
21:17:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> antiviruses don't make you secure
21:18:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> instead they increase your attack surface
21:22:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> "Antivirus programs don't make you secure," is a bit heavy-handed. While true, I don't know if you have large email services deployed without that sort of thing nowadays. I am not disagreeing with Hulk's point by the way, it is near pointless on current mobile operating systems.
21:22:36 <hypokeimenon[m]> It's true however that antivirus is a bad way of dealing with the problems it attempts to solve.
21:22:55 <hypokeimenon[m]>  * It's also true hat antivirus is a bad way of dealing with the problems it attempts to solve.
21:53:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> hypokeimenon üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà: many antiviruses have lots of attack surface and follow poor security practices
21:54:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> Not defending antivirus.
21:54:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If done right, it doesn't decrease security but most antiviruses decrease security
21:54:22 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Not defending antivirus."> Right
21:54:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I know just saying

23:21:21 <trail_undergroun> <Railgun_Lover[m] "hypokeimenon üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà: many antivi"> Could you elaborate?
23:24:07 <GhostSplinterSix> What anti-virus would you recommend? Which would you not?
23:24:47 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> Remember the time Avast had an unsandboxed JS interpreter with poor exploit mitigations running with system privileges by default as part of a larger process that handles untrusted input
23:26:15 <GhostSplinterSix> I do not
23:27:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> https://github.com/taviso/avscript
23:27:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> Don't use AVs k
23:27:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> If on Windows, stick with defender
23:28:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Gabe> i am so using this to prove a point in work meetings
23:28:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> On Linux and mobile operating systems, they're useless
23:29:16 <GhostSplinterSix> <Telegram-Bridge "<madaidan> On Linux and mobile o"> What do you recommend then to stay safe from malicious intent?
23:29:28 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> Gabe the fact that they also often undermine the integrity of TLS by MITMing you is another good point that applies generally across many AVs
23:30:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Gabe> i have a personal level gripe with darktrace because of this
23:30:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Gabe> its a really bad way to do things
23:30:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> And of course, they often run with high privileges and are riddled with vulns
23:31:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> E.g. https://landave.io/2020/11/bitdefender-upx-unpacking-featuring-ten-memory-corruptions/
23:32:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> GhostSplinterSix: use an OS with an actual security model
23:32:16 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> And be very cautious
23:32:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Gabe> AOSP alone with its permission based access controls for apps solves this really
23:33:13 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Gabe> an av on android is basically at best going to state the obvious "the user installed evil app"
23:33:54 <GhostSplinterSix> Tor isn't evil. ü§ì
23:34:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Gabe> average android malware is installed because of the user pressing allow or ok when they should not have
23:35:21 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah. I don't do anything like that. I just like to hear recommendations about stuff and thought I'd ask.
23:35:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> The vast majority of spyware on Android requires the user to explicitly grant accessibility service capabilities
23:35:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Gabe> this is also how most spyware maintains persistence on android
23:41:16 <GhostSplinterSix> Exactly. Just be smart with what you install and grant permission to. If something looks suspicious, don't click on it...
23:48:17 <strcat[m]> the GrapheneOS WebUSB installer had to be modified to work around Kaspersky AV injecting code into our page and changing the content security policy, etc.
23:48:18 <strcat[m]> and breaking it
23:48:28 <strcat[m]> all those AV systems significantly harm TLS security
23:48:34 <strcat[m]> and browser security
23:49:02 <strcat[m]> on a mobile device they are sandboxed like any other app and can't actually do anything aside from enumerating badness for scanned apks (and even then they need the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission for it)
23:54:00 <Wonderfall[m]> Funny how AVs are in fact anti-security
23:54:16 <Telegram-Bridge> <m‚Äãadaidan> And even if they weren't sandboxed, verified boot or attestation is a SIGNIFICANTLY better approach
23:55:04 <flawedworld[m]> AV's doing MITM of TLS also can break certficate pinned applications
23:55:53 <flawedworld[m]> Zoom for example you need to set a group policy if you MITM TLS traffic and it will accept any cert once you do this
23:56:02 <flawedworld[m]> really scary to see to be honest
23:58:26 <GhostSplinterSix> Oh, god....Zoom.
