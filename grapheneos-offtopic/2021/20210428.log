15:48:17 <strcat[m]> a database of Wi-Fi networks isn't somehow tracking you unless you're taking your router with you elsewhere, doesn't make any sense
15:48:24 <covid-1984[m]> <strcat[m] "what are you actually worried ab"> Not worried, just surprised there isn't a standard solution for this yet. Supposedly our WiFi APs are still mapped even if they don't broadcast BSSID.

15:49:56 <strcat[m]> the solution is using a random name + MAC for an AP that you take around with you
15:50:12 <strcat[m]> covid-1984: don't do privacy or security theater like using a hidden AP which makes it possible to track you
15:50:14 <strcat[m]> that's my suggestion
15:50:39 <strcat[m]> use a hidden AP -> your Wi-Fi network is still completely visible when in use and now your devices you connect to it can be tracked
15:50:47 <covid-1984[m]> I haven't yet... Just probing for ways to stay off the global map.
15:50:52 <strcat[m]> your Wi-Fi router cannot be 'tracked' if you aren't taking it around with you
15:50:57 <strcat[m]> the Wi-Fi router is not 'you'
15:51:11 <covid-1984[m]> Ya but what about them associating people/profiles with home addresses?

15:52:15 <strcat[m]> it is not 'tracking' you
15:52:20 <strcat[m]> it doesn't move
15:52:29 <covid-1984[m]> I would have to type a lot (talk a lot) to describe methods I see deducation happening on their global map
15:52:37 <strcat[m]> you put a radio tower in your house broadcasting a MAC / SSID
15:52:44 <strcat[m]> it does not provide a way to track you
15:52:49 <strcat[m]> it's an immobile object
15:53:07 <strcat[m]> unless you are taking your router with you and it's using same MAC / SSID in other places you go
15:53:10 <strcat[m]> that's not a way to track you
15:53:22 <strcat[m]> so, sure, if you take it with you when you move, people could figure out someone moved
15:53:33 <sign4l[m]> covid-1984: then turn off your wifi and use LAN cables. I also use an usbc LAN connector and no wifi
15:53:34 <strcat[m]> so: here's a solution, get a new router if you move and are worried about that
15:53:39 <strcat[m]> or use a router where you can set a new MAC
15:53:54 <strcat[m]> and just change the MAC / SSID if you move (keep in mind they can probably detect rough model of the router too)
15:53:59 <souvlaki[m]> how anyone could track you if they don't have any entry points to track you? aps are static and MAC is changed for each ap in Graphene
15:54:07 <strcat[m]> it's a non-mobile radio tower
15:54:09 <souvlaki[m]> unless you turn it off
15:54:31 <strcat[m]> so, you care that every time people come near it, they can see it's still there? that's not tracking, it's immobile
15:54:42 <strcat[m]> there is nothing to track unless you move it to other places
15:54:57 <covid-1984[m]> Ya can change router name or whatever. I just think that immobile objects broadcasting can be very useful for tracking. For example: 1) it gets onto their map 2) someone with one of their devices (Android or iOS) connects to your AP 3) now they have IP & router name associated too.
15:55:11 <strcat[m]> covid-1984: so, as you just stated
15:55:14 <strcat[m]> the issue is not the immobile AP
15:55:16 <strcat[m]> that doesn't make any sense
15:55:32 <strcat[m]> the issue is you connecting with a mobile device (laptop, phone) to a network in a trackable way
15:55:35 <strcat[m]> that's an issue whether or not it's your AP
15:55:41 <strcat[m]> I don't understand what you're trying to claim
15:55:44 <strcat[m]> it truly makes no sense
15:55:49 <strcat[m]> the same thing applies to a coffee shop AP
15:56:16 <covid-1984[m]> I'll just stop talking

15:56:44 <strcat[m]> covid-1984: no, you're not asking something
15:56:57 <strcat[m]> covid-1984: and here's the answer: you aren't tracked by an immobile object, that doesn't make sense

16:22:20 <strcat[m]> it's a setting
16:22:48 <strcat[m]> the purpose of the stock OS way is that it doesn't break networks requiring authentication tied to MAC address (which is silly / broken, but it's not usually your choice)

16:28:17 <souvlaki[m]> does in pick MAC randomly or uses vendor-based presets?

17:07:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <W​axEq> Hi all.   I have pixel4a.   I'm not getting any notifications from signal when messages drop inBut all seems on in settingsI just updated signal.app via aurora play store .but still no notificationsCan anyone help please
17:09:37 <souvlaki[m]> the solution is simple: https://signal.org/android/apk/
17:09:51 <souvlaki[m]> download apk from signal website directly
17:10:34 <souvlaki[m]> this version does not rely on GSF, so notifications will be working
17:14:46 <giffgaff[m]> When ending a user profile session sometimes the phone behaves strange.

17:16:00 <nscnt[m]> giffgaff: It's a known upstream issue
17:16:11 <Pratyush[m]> giffgaff  yes it sometime does. Most of the time it's due to upstream bug. But if you manage to get some logcat you  can create a issue on github.
17:16:45 <nscnt[m]> There's already an open issue and it's upstream
17:17:25 <Pratyush[m]> nscnt  any link or something ?
17:17:51 <nscnt[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/435
17:26:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <W​axEq> Thanks.   Ive installed that apk directStill no notifications though ?Any ideas please ?
17:26:42 <Baloo> Does Vanadium also disable this feature: https://www.zdnet.com/article/brave-browser-disables-googles-floc-tracking-system/
17:28:38 <Wonderfall[m]> <Baloo "Does Vanadium also disable this "> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/commit/cb45efe3f0ab2faf1e85abc83224346ec3565fa9
17:29:06 <Baloo> Wonderfall; Thank you
17:29:48 <Wonderfall[m]> You're welcome. Eventually FLOC will be opt-in anyway in its final implementation
17:31:51 <strcat[m]> Baloo: it already wasn't used
17:32:02 <strcat[m]> coverage of this has been highly misleading, which is typical
17:32:10 <Wonderfall[m]> Yeah
17:32:30 <strcat[m]> it's currently in a trial phase, and is only enabled for users who explicitly sync all their history to Google among other things
17:33:05 <Wonderfall[m]> Still added it to the Permissions-Policy header of my websites, but I'm not sure of the move. Good article on that: https://seirdy.one/2021/04/16/permissions-policy-floc-misinfo.html
17:33:44 <strcat[m]> you need to have third party cookies enabled + sign into Chrome with Google account + enable Sync with history sync enabled + do not set a sync passphrase + have web & app activity enabled + have toggled enabled for Chrome history to be included in that + have ad personalization enabled + have web & app activity toggle enabled for ad personalization
17:34:12 <strcat[m]> and then you are a candidate for the trial (does not imply it is enabled, just that you are one of the people they may to test it with)
17:34:29 <strcat[m]> when it's finished it will just be the replacement for the third party cookie toggles (those will just be disallowed)
17:34:34 <strcat[m]> assuming they go ahead with it
17:34:41 <strcat[m]>  * when it's finished it will just be the replacement for the third party cookie toggle (those will just be disallowed)
17:34:45 <cx7dd[m]> Hey everybody,
17:34:46 <cx7dd[m]> is it possible to disable the mic/camera indicator?
17:35:10 <strcat[m]> no
17:35:10 <Wonderfall[m]> https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/MmijXrmwrJs
17:35:14 <strcat[m]> why?
17:35:28 <Wonderfall[m]> It'll likely be a fully opt-in thing
17:35:49 <strcat[m]> Wonderfall: it will probably work like third party cookies do today, and the toggle will probably be inherited
17:35:57 <cx7dd[m]> If want to record something but dont want people to see it if they look on my phone
17:36:07 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: no you can't do that
17:36:18 <strcat[m]> that's part of the point
17:36:29 <cx7dd[m]> ok thanks for the answer 👍
17:36:42 <strcat[m]> the main use case for it is anti-stalkerware
17:37:05 <strcat[m]> i.e. you gave someone permission to use your phone on your profile, like a boyfriend/girlfriend
17:37:08 <strcat[m]> and they installed some app to spy on you
17:37:21 <strcat[m]> so it's now running a foreground service spying on you
17:37:46 <strcat[m]> so rather than having to notice that the foreground service is running, then wondering why, and looking at the permission it has, there are indicators making it more obvious what's happening
17:38:48 <strcat[m]> the other way it helps is if you give the app the permission, like giving camera access to signal, and it's running a foreground service (push notifications, etc.)
17:39:16 <strcat[m]> the anti-stalkerware aspect would be totally ruined if you could turn it off
17:39:36 <strcat[m]> and also the anti-stalkerware aspect applies to a verified boot style threat model vs. remote compromise too
17:40:01 <strcat[m]> attacker compromises device -> loses privileged access due to reboot and/or updates -> still has apps installed with permissions granted
17:40:09 <strcat[m]> having a toggle for something like that weakens the permission model
17:40:21 <strcat[m]> because the attacker would toggle it while they have access
17:40:33 <strcat[m]> either because you gave them access (stalkerware) or because it was a remote exploit, etc.
17:40:45 <cx7dd[m]> Yeah thats right. I thought there might be a setting to temporarily turn it off for a specific purpose but maybe its more save if you cant do that at all.
17:40:58 <strcat[m]> it is a lot more valuable since you can't turn it off
17:41:01 <cx7dd[m]> <strcat[m] "either because you gave them acc"> Good point
17:41:06 <strcat[m]> same applies to other privacy and security features
17:41:15 <strcat[m]> if you can turn it off, it doesn't work vs. attacker that had access in the past
18:27:17 <annochris> I just got disconnected
18:27:21 <annochris> Sorry
18:28:19 <annochris> Hello
18:30:39 <annochris> Hello
18:52:24 <Baobab> salute
18:54:40 <annochris> Hi is anyone there
18:55:43 <Baobab> I think so.
18:56:00 <Baobab> Unless if my messages aren't sending.
19:32:41 <strcat[m]> Lynn 🏳️‍🌈: https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1387488562392805385
19:33:06 <strcat[m]> Lynn 🏳️‍🌈: plan on making Origin mandatory and dropping CSRF tokens, seems reasonable, especially since SameSite=Strict is there
19:33:17 <strcat[m]> and unlike SameSite=Strict I can enforce that Origin must be supported or the request is rejected
19:33:26 <strcat[m]> so legacy browsers are just rejected
19:33:50 <strcat[m]> for AttestationServer
19:34:24 <strcat[m]> just need to make sure Firefox ESR and their terrible mobile browser have Origin (if I care about them, I don't really, probably fine just rejecting them)
20:53:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> anyone familiar with PCAPdroid or have another suggestion for grapheneOS?
22:15:07 <onyxrubber> hi, how can i build app from source? Any advices?
22:15:07 <onyxrubber> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
22:33:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <onyxrubber "hi, how can i build app from sou"> Why not just download it
22:33:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If you really want to build, they probably have instructions
22:33:53 <onyxrubber> there is recomended way to build by my own
22:34:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Ah
22:37:37 <sign4l[m]> <onyxrubber "hi, how can i build app from sou"> well... you need some experience in developing... there is no 12 point howto do.... Install eclipse and the android libraries and build some hello world apps
22:38:03 <sign4l[m]> then you download the source via GIT in eclipse and build the app
23:25:18 <Wonderfall[m]> Stumbled upon this paper (published not long ago) on cold boot attacks to retrieve keys of FDE/FBE systems: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266628172100007X
23:25:44 <Wonderfall[m]> Didn't read it, just wanted to share if anyone's interested. We already know cold boot is very hard to pull off anyway
