00:00:03 <TheJollyRoger> Ye be welcome!
01:38:36 <fred`> since reading about that 'cellebrite-approach' i wonder if it would theoretically be possible for a android to 'fake' its 'os-specs' and let them only copy some 'currently-used profile' instead of the 'real one'

01:40:34 <fred`> ot its that already the case, since both profiles use different 'keys'?
01:40:46 <fred`> *or is that
02:19:58 <southwest[m]> <Cliff[m] "Does anyone know how many people"> The maintainer is in this room. I use it daily and have had no issues. Receive notifications almost the instant they are sent. The auto update is nice.
02:21:37 <southwest[m]> You could ask more questions  here: #freenode_#mollyim:matrix.org
02:44:37 <tidria[m]> <Cliff[m] "Does anyone know how many people"> I also use molly. Functionally its about the same as signal if you are curious about things like alerts/sending/receiving. The passphrase encryption is a great feature. The only thing to note for an average user is molly doesn't integrate SMS. If that is necessary for your use case it may be a deal breaker

05:05:28 <somenerd[m]> ><!Hulk> Which GrapheneOS features will (probably) never arrive upstream?
05:05:28 <somenerd[m]> Quite a few features, especially ones with performance costs
06:42:15 <noax8[m]> Good camera better than OpenCamera for a pixel 3a??
07:16:06 <iccedlemontea[m]> TIL that tutanota has email notifications that work perfectly on degoogled devices
07:16:30 <iccedlemontea[m]> Protonmail was such a head pain to use as it doesnt have degoogled device email push notifications
07:36:46 <philnthropic[m]> https://gizmodo.com/signals-ceo-just-hacked-the-cops-favorite-phone-crackin-1846733412
08:54:33 <GhostSplinterSix> Good morning, all. What apps would you recommend for those who use GrapheneOS? I know a simple web search would be able to tell me, but I'd rather see what ya'll recommend.
08:55:18 <Thatcher[m]> iccedlemontea Proton is developing a version of Protonmail that shows push notifications on degoogled devices. It'll be available in about 10 years. Patience is key!
08:55:44 <Thatcher[m]>  /s
08:56:05 <Thatcher[m]> I might switch to Tuta
08:56:38 <iccedlemontea[m]> Yep, my patience is only as dry as the RTX 3080 stock!
08:56:52 <iccedlemontea[m]> Man, the lada gotta speed it up. I gave up and switched to tuta
08:57:09 <GhostSplinterSix> <Thatcher[m] "iccedlemontea Proton is developi"> Hah! I love Proton Technologies.
08:57:19 <iccedlemontea[m]> Or just gonna forward all my emails via simplelogin or anonaddy to tuta cos of the PUSH NOTIFICATIONS
09:00:14 <iccedlemontea[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "Good morning, all. What apps wou"> Bromite/firefox for socials
09:00:55 <Thatcher[m]> GhostSplinterSix I use F-droid, Newpipe for youtube. KeepassDX for passwords. Vinyl Music Player, Tor Browser,   Molly, Element, and Threema, Protonmail (considering Tutanota for push notifications), Simple Calendar, Book Reader, and RedReader for reddit
09:01:01 * iccedlemontea[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/MpSkcfrOJiuTfdwRGPTxDJYX/message.txt >
09:01:27 <iccedlemontea[m]> Hell yeah man, vinyl is an amazing music app
09:01:39 <iccedlemontea[m]> VLC for videos too
09:02:56 <Thatcher[m]> I like Vinyl because the icon is nice and the letters are not cut off in graphene
09:05:37 <Thatcher[m]> I really like the interface of Inifinity for reddit but I hate that it makes me log in just to pin a subreddit. RedReader lets me pin subs without an account
09:06:30 <Thatcher[m]> Plus RedReader allows me to disable the frontpage aka /all
09:11:23 <GhostSplinterSix> I appreciate the responses, iccedlemontea and Thatcher. I switched from Sprint to T-Mobile yesterday and my SIM card should be arriving today so that I can activate my Pixel 4a that has GrapheneOS installed.
09:13:09 <Thatcher[m]> I use T-Mobile with GrapheneOS on a 4a, it's fantastic
09:17:16 <Thatcher[m]> Anyone interested in using Threema? I've got three promo codes I won from their Easter egg hunt and they expire at the end of the year and I have no use for them.
09:19:40 <Thatcher[m]> If interested, PM me. First come, first serve
09:24:09 <Thatcher[m]> Down to two promo codes
09:25:06 <GhostSplinterSix> <Thatcher[m] "I use T-Mobile with GrapheneOS o"> That's great to hear. My family and I were with them from 2011-2013 and cell service was god awful. I'm glad they've drastically improved since then.
09:27:32 <Thatcher[m]> Depends on where you are I guess. I'm in Southern California and T-Mobile service works pretty good here, even around the hilly Santa Monica mountains.
09:32:30 <GhostSplinterSix> I grew up in Northern Virginia right outside of Washington, D.C. and T-Mobile was spotty as heck. I went to college 3hr 15m away and only had cell service for about 30-40 minutes of the drive. This was 10 years ago, though, so I can't really complain about it anymore. 😆
10:06:47 <missfire[m]> hey, I see in my battery usage an app called "10175" (it doesn't seem to take away much battery though)
10:06:47 <missfire[m]> do someone know what it is?
10:10:29 <strcat[m]> not all the SoC support apps have user-facing names
10:10:41 <strcat[m]> you have to look at the more advanced info
10:11:01 <missfire[m]> I think it might be an uninstalled app
10:11:39 <strcat[m]> that's possible too, 10175 is an app id
10:12:12 <strcat[m]> the uid the app runs as (in the owner profile, secondary profiles prefix it with a user id like 1010175 for the first one)
10:12:42 <missfire[m]> I see, thanks
10:22:23 <strcat> missfire[m]: the ids start at 10000, each app gets a uid and a gid, ones in user profiles are prefixed with user profile id
10:22:29 <strcat> missfire[m]: so that's why you're seeing that
10:22:42 <strcat> missfire[m]: doesn't explain *why* it doesn't know the name, could be it was uninstalled, could be it simply has no name
10:58:51 <m2tu[m]> Thatcher: Threma is paid app or can that be used for free ?
11:02:18 <shurke> it's a paid app
11:02:23 <shurke> threema
11:10:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> completely unrelated, tho funny research paper on graphene (the material) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsnano.9b00184
11:13:18 <missfire[m]> strcat: I did some checking and uninstalled 2 more apps,
11:13:18 <missfire[m]> now I have 3 unrecognized apps at the battery usage. (all starts at 10000)
11:13:18 <missfire[m]> so I think it's safe to say that those are indeed uninstalled apps :)
11:13:23 <missfire[m]> thanks again
11:14:17 <dragonfly826[m]> hello everyone, I just wanted to ask if im running any significant security risks by installing whatsapp on a separate isolated profile, with the bare minimum permissions enabled? I truly hate this app, but the reality is that I cant let go of it yet. and my old phone which I specifically only use for whatsapp will likely not support it in the not too distant future, so I wanted to ask about this.
11:14:54 <missfire[m]> I don't think whatsapp in itself is a security risk
11:15:06 <missfire[m]>  * I don't think whatsapp itself is a security risk
11:15:28 <missfire[m]> only privacy nightmare
11:18:00 <somenerd[m]> The isolated profile isn't for sandboxing
11:18:14 <somenerd[m]> it's mostly for isolated workspaces
11:18:35 <somenerd[m]> A use case would be, for example, when you have to grant permission to contacts
11:18:46 <somenerd[m]> and if the app doesn't get access, it crashes
11:18:52 <somenerd[m]> a seperate profile could be used
11:19:55 <somenerd[m]> apps are already sandboxed
11:20:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> interprocess communication between apps is also a thing
11:21:05 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and using separate profiles does solve this problem
11:21:40 <somenerd[m]> > <!Hulk> interprocess communication between apps is also a thing
11:21:40 <somenerd[m]> this needs mutual consent from both of the apps
11:22:07 <dragonfly826[m]> I see I see. Just to add, I know this is not completly relevant to sandboxing, But arnt separate profiles on graphene encrypted with different keys? and by extension mean better security?
11:22:39 <somenerd[m]> Suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
11:23:18 <Thatcher[m]> dragonfly826 What keeps you using Whatsapp if you absolutely hate the app?
11:23:56 <dragonfly826[m]> too many people I need to speak with only use it
11:24:14 <Thatcher[m]> Damn
11:26:19 <dragonfly826[m]> also, Whatsapp has had some pretty bad exploits in the past (that time jeff bazos got hacked I think), does having whatsapp in a different profile help mitigate any vulnerabilities it may have?
11:27:14 <dragonfly826[m]> or rather prevent access to my main profile and by extension my data from an attacker?
11:29:50 <strcat[m]> apps are sandboxed whether or not you use profiles
11:29:59 <strcat[m]> they have access to the data you've given them access to
11:30:17 <strcat[m]> profiles provide separate workspaces with separated data and separate instances of apps, without being able to share data / communicate across them
11:30:23 <strcat[m]> you have the same sandboxing with or without profiles
11:30:30 <strcat[m]> profiles do not provide a stronger sandbox, not what they do
11:32:33 <dragonfly826[m]> Thank you! that information is most helpfull
11:34:03 <dragonfly826[m]> but lastly, is it okay to install whatsapp on graphene? im I increasing attack surface very significantly?
11:35:13 <dragonfly826[m]>  * but lastly, is it okay to install whatsapp on graphene? am I increasing attack surface very significantly?
11:37:02 <dragonfly826[m]> considering that on could see whatsapp as borderline malicious?
11:38:04 <strcat[m]> the OS does not have rules on what apps you're allowed to install or not, that's up to you
11:43:11 <dragonfly826[m]> aw hey I know that, I just dont want to install something that may be too hazardous for my OS's security. thats why im asking about the implications of installing whatsapp to better inform myself
11:44:12 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> hey dragonfly826[m]:

11:48:34 <strcat[m]> dragonfly826: nothing special about WhatsApp, same as asking about any other app
11:48:41 <strcat[m]> not going to get an official position from the OS on individual apps

13:14:31 <Cliff[m]> <somenerd[m] "it's mostly for isolated workspa"> Isolated workspaces that are separately encrypted from the main profile correct with their own cryptographic keys?
13:17:08 <secrypt[m]> Yes, this is correct
13:39:37 <dazinism> FDroid has finally sorted out all the issues that stopped apps being built, including reproducable builds, with v2+ signatures
13:40:09 <dazinism> Latest builds from their repository all appear to have v2 and v3
13:48:51 <dragonfly826[m]> Hello, im sorry to bother all of you again, but i feel i can make my original doubt a bit more spacific. Already sometime ago, there were several attacks involving a single WhatsApp call, that even if the user did not pick up or interact with, their phone was now infected with malware that found its way to gain root privileges of the device, even on iphones that are rootless phones. I believe with was all
13:48:51 <dragonfly826[m]> over the news in late 2019, and a lot of people were affected by this. I belive if im not mistakened that this exploit was developed by that infamos NSO group. Can graphene's sandboxing prevent an attack of this nature?
13:50:29 <dazinism> dragonfly826: all the hardening GrapheneOS adds makes it harder to exploit, nothing is completely secure.
13:51:28 <dazinism> Graphene adds stuff that makes common exploitation techniques harder to pull off.
13:55:28 <dragonfly826[m]> Of course, but let's think about safe enough. does the hardening reach a point that one can determine that its safe enough, or reasonably safe to have WA installed? Or is it a awful and inconsivable vulnerability to have that thing installed
13:56:15 <dragonfly826[m]> Its this question that brings me some level of unease and why I'm really trying to inform myself about this
13:57:41 <giffgaff[m]> For some reason I can not modify the permissions for location. The permissions are grayed out.

13:59:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> can't revoke any permissions on allowlisted privileged system apps like Settings
13:59:36 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Don't want to accidentally break functionalities by doing so
14:00:02 <dnull> Whatsapp is owned by fb. Can you ever consider it safe?
14:00:27 <dragonfly826[m]> That's not the question here
14:00:29 <dazinism> dragonfly826 Its somewhat likely most apps can be exploited if someone with enough talent looks at it for long enough. Chaining that exploit onto an app sandbox escape also happens, but takes another load of work.
14:00:30 <giffgaff[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "can't revoke any permissions on "> Thanks for the info
14:00:47 <dazinism> The security & privacy in android is pretty good now, its improved a lot over the last years. Graphene improves things further.
14:00:52 <dnull> But it's the answer once you work the problem.
14:02:07 <dragonfly826[m]> <dazinism "The security & privacy in androi"> So one can concluded that its reasonably safe to isntall  WhatsApp on graphene?

14:03:22 <dragonfly826[m]> Assuming I do that of course
14:03:52 <dazinism> Yes its reasonably safe. To have reasonable functionality you have to share your contacts with WhatsApp, which is arguably abusive of them
14:04:17 <dazinism> And sharing your contacts details with WA is arguably abusive to your contacts

Even if you do (the ones *not* on Special apps access section or the Accessibility), you can install it in separate user profile with Vanadium and most apps Network permission revoked

14:04:59 <dazinism> Yeah thats the way
14:06:06 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> A caveat is you'd only receive notifications when you are logged in on that profile, but at the same time, it cannot start without that user profile being logged in

14:51:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Proper threat modelling is a thing
14:52:04 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> Proper threat modelling "> Yeah
14:54:13 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> > <@leeya:kde.org> Orbot will help on that cause
14:54:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> > But as said here, there are some stuffs to be aware of: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210321#c7337663
14:54:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> If you decide to use VPN/Orbot in VPN mode, make sure to toggle on "Always on VPN" and "Block connections without VPN" and install that app offline on a user profile that never connected to internet, just to be sure. Also, log it out immediately after usage, and don't log it in with other user profiles (hope I got this correct), as the current active user profile's VPN is used system-wide
14:55:51 <dazinism> Yeah it gets complex...
14:57:51 <dazinism> I'm still not totally clear how the VPN functionality works with multiple profiles, when switching between them.
14:58:14 <dazinism> Also have to consider that main user is always running
14:58:57 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Ideally, owner user should be empty (if one opts to multiple secondary user usage)
14:59:39 <dazinism> Yeah that would make things clearer/safer
14:59:53 <dazinism> I don't really use the VPN functionality much
15:01:01 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <dazinism "I'm still not totally clear how "> Surely ending session would kill the app?
15:12:42 <dazinism> Crowmac McCarthy: yeah it does. Its just I'm not totally clear with everything. Like what happens if you have a VPN active in one profile then switch one on in a different profile.
15:13:59 <dazinism> Or how its handled with apps that use the VPN functionality, but don't actually provide a VPN.
15:15:23 <dazinism> Like eg. NetGuard or PCAPDroid
15:16:46 <dazinism> NetGuard is weird because it can't be run with 'block all connections outside VPN' as that blocks everything.
15:18:23 <dazinism> Which does have the side effect that it may be useful for blocking all network from a user profile if used with that on.
15:18:51 <dazinism> Initial testing suggests this is so, but I've not done thorough testing
15:24:18 <lvl1user> what do you guys think about Matrix riot chat aka elements?
15:24:28 <lvl1user> is is safe & anonymous ?
15:26:45 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's quite a wide question, but it's fine, depends on how you use it
15:26:45 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Registration method does give anonymity, but usage pattern, stylometry, chat logs, metadata leaks can deanonymize that user
15:27:42 <catacombs[m]> I wanted to thank all of you for your help  While much of Graphene is smooth and very polished. I never got data to working.   As someone here said, the different carriers have so many different ways to connect, manage connections it makes it difficult.
15:30:32 <lvl1user> DHFuchsiaOSwhen: do you think with orbot (tor)  or other vpn i can mitigate that risk ?
15:31:34 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not much, it's one of the various metadata points that gets leaked
15:32:28 <greipster> Hello
15:32:29 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Still relatively more anonymous, private and secure at private chats relatively compared to Telegram, for instance
15:32:35 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Hello
15:32:44 <catacombs[m]> Someone might warn others, if the phone already is working with Android on it.  Cruise over and write down the working APN for use later.   When I reinstalled stock Android, I immediately had data.   For me, in east Texas, WalMart Straight Talk with CDMA SIM card, has an APN which still has the first line of Verizon, and the second line is VZWINTERNET  Please note the APN is entered in all Caps.  Android has
15:32:44 <greipster> I need advice
15:32:44 <catacombs[m]> the much desired "Add APN available in the three dots.   Which Graphene did not allow.
15:33:23 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Go on, depends on what is it about
15:33:31 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <catacombs[m] "Someone might warn others, if th"> US carriers are weird for some reasons
15:34:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> (No idea why it's broken, never encountered that issue with some other countries' carriers)
15:34:24 <greipster> Do you know if I should try and install graphene on a non-pixel device?
15:34:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Sorry for the side comment, maybe somebody who has the same/similar carrier issue may help
15:34:34 <catacombs[m]> I wonder if Verizon is one of those Carriers which does something that Graphene does not allow, and therefore the data will not work.  Can anyone answer that and perhaps we can warn others.   I do want to thank the developers, I can understand that trying to prove up all this detail is not something they really have time to do.
15:35:11 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <greipster "Do you know if I should try and "> Not really, it will not work, unless you build one for your device, only with unlocked bootloadee most of the time
15:35:48 <greipster> Doing that is probably not a good idea?
15:35:58 <greipster> I assume
15:36:34 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <greipster "Doing that is probably not a goo"> Yep, bad idea
15:37:14 <catacombs[m]> My usual Iphone is about to lose service.  As I have to have a working phone for medical reasons, I will be back in a few weeks to try to fix phone up better.
15:37:41 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <catacombs[m] "My usual Iphone is about to lose"> Alright, I personally advise switching carrier...
15:37:42 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Ah, it's one of the infamous carriers that causes issues here due to some privacy-invasive implementations for some of its functionalities
15:37:42 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Also, see this for an overview:
15:37:42 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=Verizon&ch=grapheneos
15:38:46 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+verizon+is%3Aclosed
15:39:28 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Nonetheless, the configuration on GrapheneOS is the same as stock OS, besides stripping some privapps that asks for excessive permissions, like Sprint MDM
15:39:31 <catacombs[m]> Switching Carriers.  Good Answer.   I live in a rural community.  Verizon based services work.  Almost nothing else does much.  So few people that the major carriers will not spend money to install more towers for a small piece of a very small pie.
15:40:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <catacombs[m] "Switching Carriers.  Good Answer"> Yeah, apologies. Just saying an option
15:41:38 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Just saying it has caused quite some issues on GrapheneOS users afaict
15:42:00 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> One thing that may work is try flashing stock OS, provision it there, then flash GrapheneOS
15:42:22 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> (Based on what I've read and seen before with this community)
15:42:29 <catacombs[m]> I really do not like Android. While I can not do it now.  There is an open source hardened Android?  How good is it.
15:43:42 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> GrapheneOS is the only one matches that criteria tbh...
15:44:18 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> those*
15:44:38 <southron[m]> I have Verizon and it works fine.
15:45:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <southron[m] "I have Verizon and it works fine"> How? Thought that stuff was still broken on some functionalities?
15:45:32 <catacombs[m]> I have flashed Graphene like four times.  And the stock Android was working before I Flashed to Graphene the first time.   In reference to your other Idea, another carrier.   Maybe things have improved a bit.  Trying another Carrier with another Straight Talk SIM card is nearly free.   and perhaps If I Flashed Graphene again, with what I know about what the a
15:45:53 <catacombs[m]> APN should be, it might take off and work.
15:46:06 <catacombs[m]> Which Pixel do you have?
15:46:43 <catacombs[m]> I had a Pixel 4A 5G and it would allow me to talk and text.
15:47:27 <dazinism> Guess theres also the possibility that its to do with Straight Talk and a Verizon SIM may work fine.
15:47:55 <southron[m]> Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when?: I haven't noticed anything in particular. Is there a particular issue people are having?
15:48:05 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <dazinism "Guess theres also the possibilit"> Speaking of which: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/529
15:48:29 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <southron[m] "Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS wh"> What model, just wondering, and also just linked an issue related to Straight Talk and Verizon above
15:49:08 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/529#issuecomment-811447232
15:49:08 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> (This is what I meant, but I may have worded incorrectly/badly earlier)
15:49:17 <southron[m]> 4a5G
15:49:52 <catacombs[m]> Yes, if the documentation had warned me to record the APN which worked in Android.  I might have gotten to work the first time.  And Straight Talk techs do not really know all the ends and outs of getting data to work.   Plus only at the end did someone tell me the APN had to be all Caps.   I assumed the tech would tell me any conditions.
15:50:32 <southron[m]> I had to request a new sim as the 5G sim I had in my iPhone had issues, especially receiving calls.
15:51:52 <dazinism> catacombs: if you look at the link deggoggled just posted you see it's probably down to the way Straight Talk (in your case acting as a Verizon MVNO) have stuff set up.
15:53:05 <catacombs[m]> Even for normal Pixel Phones with Android, I saw a note that 5G with Verizon requires an extra payment.  And Google Pixel makes a special Pixel for Verizon to sell in their stores.
15:53:24 <dazinism> And Verizon purposely don't let you set the APN
15:54:34 <catacombs[m]> I was not aware they could block changes to APN,    I thought it might be the same as the story with the other carrier which Graphene realized broke security, so they would not allow.  And I am all for that.  Security is the reason I came to GrapheneOS.  RAH for our developers
15:56:25 <catacombs[m]> You can set the second line to be exactly like the APN used in stock Android.  Forget the first line is Verizon.  and edit in VZWINTERNET.   Straight Talk techs were all into the first line needed to be changed from Verizon to TRACFONE
15:58:14 <catacombs[m]> Someone here said that some problems went away with some Google ROM updates a few months back.   And there might be a Google update to fix more.  Hopefully Soon.
16:00:15 <catacombs[m]> and that change, I never tested.  well thanks for the info.  I was nearly at the point I wanted.   Still trying to have a secure phone is much much much harder for code cutters to write compared to just creating a functional system.
16:02:06 <catacombs[m]> Have a good day.  Don't let the Corona Bug Bite.
16:18:45 <lvl1user> hello again:D  i am still searching for a good groupchat solution. Unfortunately XMPP with OTR cant have group chats and Matrix is not so anpnymous/private ... any other ideas ?:D
16:25:05 <southron[m]> What exactly about Matrix don't you like?
16:26:56 <stencil[m]> Not OC, slow delivery, buggy client app(dark mode switches with black background and text, takes 45 second to sync), lack of good encryption
16:27:49 <lvl1user> what do you think about status.im ?
16:29:21 <sign4l[m]> etherium client... don't want this crap on my phone
16:29:35 <helloworldkk87[m> <stencil[m] "Not OC, slow delivery, buggy cli"> Lack of good encryption? On matrix?
16:30:30 <lvl1user> sign4l[m]: you dont need to use the eth wallet
16:30:32 <helloworldkk87[m> Afaik they use same encyption protocol as Signal, it just leaks alot of metadata
16:31:10 <lvl1user> how ? they claim no leak even less metadata than signal
16:31:24 <lvl1user> "Network metadata protections" ...
16:32:43 <helloworldkk87[m> Im pretty sure strcat talked about this long time ago and said it leaks alot of metadata.. Not sure tho
16:32:44 <sign4l[m]> the company behind status.im just has been sued by their investors this year...
16:33:48 <lvl1user> okay why? does that compromise the E2E encryption or something?
16:35:50 <helloworldkk87[m> No it just leak alot of metadata
16:36:16 <Telegram-Bridge> whorrible (@w​horrible) has joined the Telegram Group!
16:37:51 <helloworldkk87[m> Not sure about it tho, will have to wait for some expert to come
17:03:56 <stencil[m]> <sign4l[m] "the company behind status.im jus"> Status sponsors element btw
17:04:14 <stencil[m]> Reactions are not encrypted
17:04:36 <sign4l[m]> sponsors?

17:29:21 <lvl1user> stencil[m]: so which app would you recommend for private groupchats without much leaks?
17:52:20 <entry1> <lvl1user "stencil: so which app would you "> Just to let you know, groupchats are very risky because only one person has to be compromised to put all communications at risk. Only as strong as the weakest link. You can try Molly or  Element from what I know.
17:52:47 <lvl1user> okay thx
17:53:10 <lvl1user> but didnt u said element leaks soo much ?
17:53:57 <entry1> I've heard of that, but it is anonymous sign up and I haven't heard of the encryption being able to be compromised within encrypted rooms.
17:58:05 <lvl1user> okay cool good to known
17:58:25 <lvl1user> so do you recommend setting up a server myself or is it consodered safe to join another ?
17:58:50 <hypokeimenon[m]> Do you intend to talk in public rooms?
17:59:04 <hypokeimenon[m]>  * Do you intend to use public rooms?
17:59:43 <lvl1user> no
17:59:54 <lvl1user> i only need private groupchat
18:00:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> Then you should set up your own server, if you can.
18:00:15 <lvl1user> aight
18:00:24 <hypokeimenon[m]> Assuming all the other participants in your private group chat are using trusted servers.
18:00:31 <helloworldkk87[m> <entry1 "Just to let you know, groupchats"> Molly is Signal
18:00:57 <lvl1user> molly is signal ? oookay but without telepfone number registration maybe? :D
18:01:21 <helloworldkk87[m> No. You still need to use phone number afaik
18:01:40 <lvl1user> ah damn i hate that
18:01:53 <helloworldkk87[m> https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android
18:02:03 <lvl1user> why would you need to add telefon number on a privacy messanger ?
18:02:32 <helloworldkk87[m> To make it easy to use for everyone
18:02:40 <entry1> <helloworldkk87[m "Molly is Signal"> Yes, it is a forked version of Signal. I'm aware
18:03:42 <lvl1user> well for me its the opposite, nobody in my friend list wants to use it because they dont want to chat private with their tel. exposed
18:04:10 <lvl1user> for me its okay i can use sim cards without names but not everyone has access to such cards
18:04:32 <helloworldkk87[m> You could look into Briar
18:04:55 <lvl1user> yeah thats on my list too:)
18:05:51 <anonym1984[m]> Does anyone here have any tips on how to learn programming? Would love to eventually contribute to open source projects myself
18:05:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> <lvl1user "why would you need to add telefo"> Signal is a carrier-based SMS/calls replacement. Not a 'Super-Mega-Crypto-Private' messenger.
18:06:21 <lvl1user> well, i see ^^
18:06:51 <lvl1user> so u guys trust this briar ? never really checked it out too deeply
18:07:19 <lvl1user> anonym1984[m]: you can do some courses on freecodecamp , thats a really nice website to start and u can learn a lot
18:07:36 <lvl1user> www.freecodecamp.org
18:22:51 <helloworldkk87[m> <lvl1user "so u guys trust this briar ? nev"> I would trust it yes
18:25:12 <helloworldkk87[m> Its not on iPhones tho and cant send pictures or files or calls etc
18:30:19 <lvl1user> hm damn no pics?
18:30:25 <lvl1user> thats a bit bad
18:31:54 <helloworldkk87[m> Yeah
19:14:14 <hypokeimenon[m]> <sign4l[m] "the company behind status.im jus"> Where did you see this?
19:18:08 <dazinism> The main developer of seedvault, the GrapheneOS backup service is also one of the main developers of Briar
19:19:19 <dazinism> Pictures are apparently 'coming soon' to briar. The feature is implemented, just not yet released
19:19:32 <dazinism> But its been that way for a while
19:21:00 * tosmuciva[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/bGAYfcfMKVqWHRhUhzSOakWM/message.txt >
19:23:05 <dazinism> Pictures in briar were being held back as, due to the protocol, there is a maximum size (which is pretty small)
19:23:41 <dazinism> They were waiting to have bigger pictures, but have recently decided to release it as it is.
19:32:55 <sign4l[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Where did you see this?"> If you google this it links to a swiss laywer website from 15.04.
19:46:13 <Thatcher[m]> Why would someone want to use Briar over, say, secure messaging in Element?
19:47:27 <jpds> Briar uses Tor and Bluetooth for the messaging transport
19:47:28 <Thatcher[m]> I hear a lot of talk about Briar. What is so special about it?
19:47:47 <Thatcher[m]> Interesting
19:47:54 <jpds> But beyond sending text messages, it's kind of useless
19:50:41 <jpds> lvl1user: OMEMO works fine with group chats on XMPP. You shouldn't be using OTR for anything, it's known to be broken
19:51:49 <ayylmaos> Is there a way to change the homescreen grid size ?
19:53:41 <lvl1user> jpds: ah okay really? i didnt know, kann i use that in pidgin on tails too?
19:53:52 <jpds> lvl1user: Don't use Pidgin
19:54:13 <jpds> It's a crap XMPP client
19:54:31 <lvl1user> its the only client installed in tails :/
19:54:45 <lvl1user> but yeah i had troubles with certificates too
19:54:53 <jpds> dino
19:55:08 <jpds> dino.im - better XMPP client for Linux desktop
19:55:27 <lvl1user> aight thx i'll check it out:)
19:55:39 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> ayylmaos: you are very limited in terms of personalization on GrapheneOS launcher (which is basically AOSP launcher)
19:56:04 <lvl1user> so with that i can use omemo and group chats?:D  what client do u recommend for grapheneOS to join such a  group chat ?
19:56:34 <jpds> conversations.im
19:57:09 <lvl1user> oh cool i remember back years ago i used that one in javascript on a browser or soemthing :D
19:57:27 <jpds> That's impossible, it's an Android app
19:57:29 <lvl1user> aight if that really works you helped me alot:D  thx
19:57:59 <jpds> It's on f-droid, supports Tor in the advanced settings and does OMEMO out of the box
19:58:34 <lvl1user> perfekt:)
19:58:38 <jpds> https://github.com/dino/dino/wiki/Tor
19:58:51 <lvl1user> such nice much wow many thanks
19:59:46 <dazinism> ayylmaos: can change settings > display > display size
20:00:08 <lvl1user> i can use conversations.im with orbot no problem right?
20:00:21 <dazinism> Changes size of stuff in apps and elsewhere also
20:00:31 <jpds> lvl1user: Yes
20:00:35 <dazinism> lvl1user: the app has a toggle for using orbot
20:00:49 <lvl1user> woow
20:02:34 <dazinism> Also has video and audio calls
20:03:23 <dazinism> If you want extra phone numbers to use for SMS and calls you can use jmp.chat with it also
20:05:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <l​p4678> Oooo this looks interesting
20:05:55 <lvl1user> cool that looks pretty interesting too, that comes on my list thx:)
20:06:05 <lvl1user> this world is so advanced already :D
20:06:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <l​p4678> This would be useful because I don't want to put a sim inside my pixel
20:07:09 <jpds> Anything is more advanced than Pidgin
20:07:53 <lvl1user> haha:D  why the fuck is it still included in tails ?
20:08:21 <lvl1user> i am old i think :D
20:08:46 <jpds> https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/replace_Pidgin
20:09:28 <lvl1user> oh okayy so its dino vs gajin
20:09:37 <lvl1user> m
20:09:46 <jpds> Yeah, gajim works but it looks old school
20:19:49 <lvl1user> you dont have another of this magic apps for ios no? :D
20:20:29 <dazinism> Think Gajim has some extra xmpp functionality compared to Dino, but Dino is good for chats / group chats and looks better
20:20:54 <lvl1user> yeah looks better is a good argument if it doesnt sacrifice provacy
20:21:24 <jpds> lvl1user: No, all the iOS are absolute crap
20:21:32 <dazinism> Situation on iOS isn't as good. Think Monal or Siskin are best?
20:21:35 <lvl1user> yeah i feared that
20:21:41 <jpds> dazinism: They both suck
20:21:47 <jpds> Pathetically
20:22:09 <dazinism> I've never use iOS but heard them touted as best xmpp clients
20:22:41 <jpds> Conversations is the best by far
20:22:55 <dazinism> If they suck pathetically is that a double negative?
20:23:17 <dazinism> Yeah conversations is real good. Use it regularly
20:24:06 <dazinism> Main thing thats annoying is that all shared media/files are kept in shared storage
20:24:28 <lvl1user> yeah i am into that now:D  so i need to tell them apple heads to buy google instead to get conversations now ^^
20:24:28 <jpds> I've tried all three iOS clients with various friends on my server
20:24:29 <dazinism> Guess that may finally change when they move to SDK30?
20:24:58 <jpds> They all just randomly drop out or have OMEMO errors
20:25:12 <dazinism> Conversations has a build flag that changes that and keeps all media in app private storage
20:25:53 <dazinism> Which has been their for years
20:27:01 <dazinism> *there for years
20:34:24 <georgejanz[m]> why use XMPP?
20:35:47 <Baba[m]> <dazinism "Main thing thats annoying is tha"> Conversations as well?
20:42:51 <jpds> georgejanz[m]: It works
20:43:05 <jpds> (assuming you don't use iOS)
20:43:34 <georgejanz[m]> I mean there are better alternatives
20:43:43 <dazinism> Baba: yeah, not the text of chat. You can see it all in the Files app - in the Conversations directory
20:43:51 <jpds> georgejanz[m]: Such as?
20:43:52 * just-a-bugger[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/klfOCfUjshDrtMCbufmQzQHU/message.txt >
20:44:23 <georgejanz[m]> <jpds "georgejanz: Such as?"> element/matrix?
20:45:29 <jpds> georgejanz[m]: that comes down to personal preference but I've ran both XMPP and matrix servers and xmpp servers use /significantly/ less resources
20:45:29 <dazinism> The notifications / battery draw situation on element is real bad compared to Conversations
20:46:08 <jpds> Synapse is written Python, which doesn't really scale with loads of users on it
20:46:22 <dazinism> Yeah also matrix servers are heavy to run. But at lot less bad if your users don't join large public rooms
20:46:53 <jpds> Whereas ejabberd for example was written in Erlang, which was specially designed to handle hundreds of thousands of concurrent users
20:46:54 <skwisgaar[m]> just-a-bugger: it would definitely work, as long as you don’t mind the extra bulk of having it in a case. Certainly would be a more secure option than using some sketchy third party device location software.
20:47:08 <dazinism> Theres a few rooms that can be real server killers because they have so many users from so many home servers
20:48:22 <jpds> georgejanz[m]: Given the above, I personally think XMPP is better
21:25:43 <lvl1user> how about metadata leaks?
21:26:04 <lvl1user> xmpp omemo vs matrix ?
21:29:01 <jpds> lvl1user: About the same really
21:30:36 <jpds> Best thing you can do is run your own server if you're worried about it
21:38:26 <TheJollyRoger> Most important thing if you run your own XMPP server is to not federate, and instead keep all your users on the same server. Federated systems must leak metadata by nature of the way they are designed. To not do so would be akin to dropping a letter in the post with neither return nor destination address. Of course, keep in mind that in the absence of some way of obscuring the way the
21:38:27 <TheJollyRoger> packets flow, such as making it only reachable via a Tor Hidden Service, a Very Determined Adversary, or your colo service provider will still see where the packets go, and you'll likely have little if any cover traffic.
21:41:40 <jpds> Well, it's not exactly like there's no destination address
21:41:58 <jpds> XMPP doesn't bounce messages between random servers
21:53:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, there's no bouncing like in a peer to peer ecosystem, but the sending server must definitely disclose some metadata to another server outside of your immediate control. Although there were efforts, like DIME, which tried to minimize what metadata was disclosed to where (such as the sending server not needing to know who to send it to, only which server to send to), XMPP
21:53:32 <TheJollyRoger> definitely doesn't do that.
21:55:50 <jpds> That's generally fine, as you'd only be federating with people your friends with :D
21:56:24 <TheJollyRoger> Haha, well in that case you're golden!
21:57:01 <jpds> It's kind of both a pro and a con, in a way
22:25:07 <Dylanger[m]> Anyone think Google will have an answer to Apple's FindMy/Airtags?
22:27:49 <Pratyush[m]> in mobile space Samsung did it then apple so i am seeing almost every oem coming up with there own solution very soon.
22:27:49 <Pratyush[m]> google may be next year.
22:30:57 <alex[m]81> I'm just surprised this didn't exist earlier.
