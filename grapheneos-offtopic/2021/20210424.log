02:32:52 <TheJollyRoger> There always is food!

02:33:43 <dnull> That reminds me to setup mealie this weekend and start adding recipes
02:33:53 <akc3n> Ya I think TheJollyRoger worded it best a while back, mobile security, privacy, and hacking exploits for cooking. lol
02:34:00 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahaha :D
02:40:40 <Wonderfall[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!user> Is linux really that bad"> Check out the links above, they sum it up well. Bear in mind the worst comes to how GNU/Linux translates in desktop usage: too permissive, lack of mitigations, and sometimes very old and complex softwares (that applies to the GNU part very well).
02:46:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, indeed. We in the Open Source Software community allowed our hubris and pride to blind us. So for over a decade we didn't realize that Windows was doing things like implementing exploit mitigations like keystroke and graphical virtualization, hardware abstraction, they're even making efforts to try to move the drivers out of kernel space, something Linux by design isn't ever
02:46:17 <TheJollyRoger> going to do.
02:46:48 <Wonderfall[m]> We could say GNU is anti-security in a way
02:47:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The philosophy of "Do what the user tells the computer to do" sounds really fuzzy and all, until we realize that that philosophy dates back to the era when the only people who used computers, were the people who programmed them.
02:47:52 <TheJollyRoger> ...and hey, the person who gets you to run the shady .jpg.exe file in the E-mail they sent you is now, surprise surprise, a user!
02:48:03 <TheJollyRoger> *sounds really warm and fuzzy and all
02:50:27 <Wonderfall[m]> Yeah the desktop model paradigm is old, so it shouldn't be relevant for most people. It's changing, at least for Windows/macOS, but I'm afraid Linux-based "free software" distros will stick with an insecure model. And they seem to not even care that much.
02:50:54 <Wonderfall[m]> (Well at least they're getting rid of X.org, but it took some time)
03:00:38 <Telegram-Bridge> <!user> Madaidan's section about using windows or MacOS I read but didn't fully understand technically why linux is so bad aside from sandboxing.  I think I understand a bit that it's poorly implemented in linux.
03:03:08 <Wonderfall[m]> Linux itself is the kernel, it has its flaws due to being monolithic and written in a memory-unsafe language.
03:03:08 <Wonderfall[m]> But the most important part is the ecosystem: Linux-based "GNU" distros have no security model and they lack mitigations such as a sandboxing model (which is already huge as it is), CFI, verified boot, and so on. Not to mention GUI isolation if you're using Xorg for instance and many other flaws
03:04:05 <Wonderfall[m]> Also the "freezing" model which is common in many distros should be avoided for desktop usage
03:04:31 <Wonderfall[m]> Could expose you to n-days since it relies on backporting fixes based on CVE, and CVE is not a 100% reliable system
03:06:38 <Telegram-Bridge> <!user> I haven't used Windows for a long while.  As an audio engineer and musician I found it way too difficult at the time to get a reliable setup.  That's where I sort of found Ubuntu and haven't thought about it since.
03:07:25 <Wonderfall[m]> I don't know if it's a cliché but I always heard macOS is great for audio engineering
03:08:13 <Telegram-Bridge> <!user> @Wonderfall[m]:. Thank you so much for taking the time to explain this for me.
03:08:34 <Wonderfall[m]> You're welcome!
03:09:44 <Telegram-Bridge> <!user> MacOS is pretty good for it but back then when funds were tight and you just wanna make music using linux was enough for me.
03:12:12 <Wonderfall[m]> I can imagine, accessibility could be an issue for macOS unfortunately. But if you have the chance to get your hands on a M1 Mac, they're awesome
03:15:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <!user> I was close to pulling the trigger on one but I hate the feeling of falling deeper into the apple money pit.
03:18:02 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If you have Pro, be sure to give"> I am using this now thanks to your previous recommendation it is really nice, do you know if i can use my vpn inside the edge + wdag?
03:18:34 <Wonderfall[m]> You can't do that
03:18:58 <Wonderfall[m]> But you could get VPN working in a Windows Sandbox
03:24:13 <Cliff[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "But you could get VPN working in"> Could you explain the benefits, i run a vpn on router now to be able to use vpn
03:25:19 <Wonderfall[m]> If your VPN is set up at a router level, then there's no benefits to set it up inside the sandbox itself. Unless I misunderstood
03:26:09 <Cliff[m]> No i only set it up on router because it didnt work with the client on pc
03:45:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <l​p4678> Anyone know a decent YouTube app that doesn't have all the software ?

04:11:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Better than windows
04:12:12 <mefistofeles> you can now run graphical Linux apps in windows, why bother? xD
04:12:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Linux is better than windows tho
04:12:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Really
04:12:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Rarely crashes, very fast and stable
04:13:03 <somenerd[m]> I mean, it’s focused on performance and not breaking things
04:13:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Modular, can swap stuff out easily
04:13:08 <somenerd[m]> Just not good for security
04:13:12 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <somenerd[m] "I mean, it’s focused on performa"> Yeah
04:13:16 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <somenerd[m] "Just not good for security "> Tru
04:13:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I like the way Linux is now
04:13:32 <mefistofeles> it's not worse, either
04:13:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Even if insecure, it's far better than windows and macOS
04:13:46 <mefistofeles> and I'd argue it's better, by design
04:14:06 <mefistofeles> just that it has a lot of "substandard" software
04:14:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Am confused, are you saying Linux is better than Windows for security?
04:14:34 <mefistofeles> yep
04:14:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> No
04:14:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's not
04:14:47 <somenerd[m]> No, it really isn’t
04:14:51 <mefistofeles> I disagree
04:14:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Not unless you're Google and have ChromeOS and Android
04:15:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And Google is trying to switch to Fuchsia
04:15:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Because Linux is so insecure
04:15:22 <mefistofeles> that's not the reason
04:15:24 <somenerd[m]> It’s that Linux doesn’t care
04:15:36 <somenerd[m]> They don’t want to implement security
04:15:46 <somenerd[m]> Which is completely fair btw
04:15:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I am fine with that honestly
04:16:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But still bad for security
04:16:40 <mefistofeles> yeah, not worse, either
04:16:41 <mefistofeles> :P
04:16:45 <mefistofeles> doesn't make it good, but it's not worse
04:16:50 <somenerd[m]> How so?
04:16:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Linux is worse than Windows by far
04:17:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> For security
04:17:18 <mefistofeles> Railgun_Lover[m]: can you expand on that?
04:17:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And same with macOS
04:17:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <mefistofeles "Railgun_Lover: can you expand on"> The article
04:17:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I linked it a while back
04:17:43 <somenerd[m]> The kernel is monolithic (although other OSs have this problem too)

04:19:16 <mefistofeles> I just don't think it is a good one, fwiw
04:19:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's a good article
04:19:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Completely factual
04:19:52 <Railgun_Lover[m]> What issue do you have with it?
04:20:42 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles: it's not a bad article
04:22:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles: other security researchers share his views
04:25:09 <mefistofeles> Railgun_Lover[m]: yeah, again... showing linux is not secure doesn't mean others do it better, specially not in those cherry-picked examples that aren't even security-focused
04:25:26 <somenerd[m]> What cherry picked examples?
04:25:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles: he shows how other OSes are better
04:25:38 <somenerd[m]> And how is it not security focused?
04:25:51 <mefistofeles> I've been through this before and I got all this hostility here, I'd rather not go through it again
04:25:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <somenerd[m] "And how is it not security focus"> Windows, macOS not security focused
04:26:00 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Still more secure than Linux
04:26:14 <somenerd[m]> I meant the examples
04:26:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Ah
04:26:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles: no, it's a good article
04:27:08 <somenerd[m]> >I've been through this before and I got all this hostility here, I'd rather not go through it again
04:27:08 <somenerd[m]> Hostility?
04:27:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> the author provides plenty of evidence
04:28:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> He shows how other OSes are better
04:28:24 <Railgun_Lover[m]> want examples?
04:28:52 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles: macOS has full verified boot
04:29:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles: Windows has CFI
04:29:12 <somenerd[m]> I’d wait for them to reply
04:29:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Yeah true
04:30:10 <mefistofeles> don't worry, I'm not interested in convincing anyone
04:30:54 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Look, no one is angry at people for not knowing stuff
04:31:04 <Railgun_Lover[m]> This is a place to ask questions
04:31:13 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But you have to be willing to accept the answers
04:31:23 <mefistofeles> sure
04:31:37 <somenerd[m]> or try to understand the answers
04:31:58 <mefistofeles> I'm just not interested in making it a discussion, I'm fairly confident with my position and I really don't get much in return (other than hostility) when I discuss it
04:32:12 <mefistofeles> not much will be earn for anyone, so that's ok
04:32:17 <somenerd[m]> In this room?
04:32:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> There is no hostility
04:32:20 <mefistofeles> yes
04:32:46 <Telegram-Bridge> <l​p4678> Battle of the egos 🤣
04:32:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Only honesty
04:32:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You'll notice people don't insult others

04:34:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> @lp4678
04:34:51 <mefistofeles> that said, the single thing that made me not use grapheneOS was this channel and the drama around grapheneOS, which are two sides of the same coin, imho. I do think grapeheneOS is a nice project and hope you continue the good work, but I guess it's just not for me
04:35:06 <somenerd[m]> Which drama?
04:36:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <l​p4678> Actually this is a good point
04:36:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles: you referring to GrapheneOS defending itself as "drama"?
04:37:01 <mefistofeles> this drama in recent days/weeks... I guess you can check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx7CZ-2Bajg for a quick review on it
04:37:13 <somenerd[m]> Is this the techlore video?
04:37:16 <mefistofeles> yes
04:37:22 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Malicious YouTube channels shouldn't be taken as fact
04:37:28 <somenerd[m]> He’s quite malicious towards GrapheneOS
04:37:34 <mefistofeles> yeah, I agree
04:37:50 <somenerd[m]> And a lot of evidence there is taken out of context
04:38:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> @lp4678 btw, and this applies to anyone on the telegram side, try to directly @ people or ping them in replies
04:38:20 <mefistofeles> that doesn't mean there's drama, and I do think it's not all unjustifiable... as I said, not for me, that's it
04:38:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Fiery> The bridge doesn't show what people reply to which causes confusion
04:38:49 <mefistofeles> sorry, "there's no drama"
04:38:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles: it's fine if it's not for you
04:38:54 <mefistofeles> that's what I meant
04:39:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <l​p4678> Yeah
04:39:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just don't portray it as drama/hostility, that's all
04:40:01 <mefistofeles> well, drama was the exact word used in the official channel, btw
04:40:18 <mefistofeles> and hostility is just my perception... independent one, fwiw... so yeah, it adds up
04:40:32 <mefistofeles> nothing severe of course, I want to be clear
04:40:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> By drama I mean drama perpetrated by GrapheneOS, which is nonexistent
04:40:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <mefistofeles "and hostility is just my percept"> People are certainly honest
04:40:57 <mefistofeles> but I also realzied that one thing could've caused the other, grapheneOS being put in a defensive position and such
04:41:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "People are certainly honest"> But they don't insult
04:41:46 <mefistofeles> Railgun_Lover[m]: yeah, it's not that
04:42:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles: then what
04:42:07 <mefistofeles> I get honesty, but honesty without empathy is just an excuse for being mean :P
04:42:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> mefistofeles technical stuff doesn't require empathy
04:42:51 <mefistofeles> and this is also not uncommon, specially in similar open communities
04:43:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You get empathy if you accidentally brick your phone
04:43:12 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Or forget your password
04:43:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Not if you ask whether Linux is secure, that's a technical explanation
04:44:23 <mefistofeles> yeah, that's not it :)
04:44:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And there are plenty of people in here that give particularly custom tailored technical explanations

13:39:52 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> Quote: "A false base station[15]: in GSM could identify a subscriber via the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)[16]. The technique is called IMSI catching. In GSM an attacker could even eavesdrop on users' data. Later generation mobile networks, starting from 3G, prevent the eavesdropping attacks because the network is there authenticated to the user. However, IMSI catching attacks 
13:39:52 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> possible in 3G and 4G. In 5G standards, even IMSI catching attacks are prevented. This is through a technique where the user's long-term identifier is never transmitted over the radio interface in clear text. Further, 5G increases the frequency with which temporary user identifiers are updated, further improving privacy. "

16:30:07 <abff> and compilers can put backdoors in your software
16:31:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Many of Signal's design choices "> I think the forced PIN was badly handled. I also don't understand why moxie seemingly did not engage with discussions around user-hosted contracts once they move to other identifiers.
16:32:30 <Fios[m]> <abff "and compilers can put backdoors "> I'm not disagreeing with you in theory at all. But in reality is your whole family and most people you know currently using XMPP on a server you set up as their main messaging app? That's the real hurdle
16:34:21 <TheJollyRoger> hypokeimenon[m]: Yeah, there are definitely some things I really don't like about the way Signal has been very unwilling to engage with or talk to the community over issues like this, or implement large, sweeping changes such as the forced backing up of the contact list via SGX, or integration of wierd, arbitrary cryptocurrencies. Signal is by no means perfect, but some of the
16:34:24 <TheJollyRoger> decisions such as centralizing, and using a phone number were indeed deliberate.
16:36:28 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yep, I agree.
16:39:16 <Baba[m]> <TheJollyRoger "hypokeimenon 🏳️‍🌈: Yeah, there"> The pin feature.... Should be enable or disable. What are pro and cons?
16:39:51 <TheJollyRoger> Baba[m]: So, with respect to that...
16:41:10 <TheJollyRoger> In anticipation of finding alternatives to phone numbers as contact identifiers, Signal started storing clientside encrypted backups of your contact list along with your profile. If you disable the pin, the keys to the backup are tossed, and the backup cannot be decrypted later.
16:42:12 <TheJollyRoger> If you do decide to use the pin, use a long one (a large number of diceware words) since rather than rely on work factor, it relies on the trust in the SGX.
16:42:15 <somenerd[m]> You could enable it and use a 128 bit key (probably very inconvenient)
16:42:37 <TheJollyRoger> Well you only need to type it in when either restoring your phone or reregistering your number a second time.
16:43:13 <TheJollyRoger> Signal has a "pin reminder" function, I just turn it off, and record the pincode down somewhere safe.
16:43:13 <somenerd[m]> yeah, but it should work decently (according to the threat model of e2ee)
16:43:54 <abff> hypokeimenon[m]: full passwords are now a thing instead of just a numeric pin
16:44:42 <TheJollyRoger> They always have been, there's a little key you can hit to get your keyboard back.
16:47:18 <hypokeimenon[m]> <Baba[m] "The pin feature.... Should be en"> In  Moxie's own words, disabling is for special people who want to lost all their Signal metainfo when they move phones etc.
16:48:22 <strcat[m]> set a high entropy random one

21:10:10 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: So, with respect to using phone numbers, the reasoning why Signal chose to go that direction very deliberately is clearly explained in the study between University College London, University of Bonn, and Stanford University. You can read that study "Obstacles to the Adoption of Secure Communication Tools" and why they've kept with it; again, it's not a matter of what opsec
21:10:12 <TheJollyRoger> nerds and crypto-nerds will want, but rather a matter of what removes the barrier to secure communications. I highly suggest reading it, it's quite an eye-opener because a lot of us won't consider this.
21:11:28 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: There's slightly more to it than "seven days." Signal will only delete the pin if your device doesn't check in with the service for seven days. This means unpairing all desktop instances of Signal or switching it off, and either deleting the app, or turning off your phone for seven days straight. Otherwise, the pin stands. The trick is that all your devices must be /inactive/
21:11:31 <TheJollyRoger> for seven consecutive days, in order for the pin to be cleared.
21:12:31 <TheJollyRoger> *either deleting the app, force closing it and keeping it closed, or turning off either the app or the phone
21:15:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <g​ochoingles> That's a pretty nice confirm mechanic in case you lost passwords in a storage device failure.

22:02:02 <GhostSplinterSix> What's privacy?!
22:02:39 <jj1013[m]>  * Does Apple really offer privacy?

22:07:39 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Apple products offer great privacy and security especially for the average person
22:12:09 <entry1> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Apple products offer great priva"> They have certainly marketed that hard in our minds for the last year. I agree with security, but we will see about privacy
22:14:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <entry1 "They have certainly marketed tha"> No they actually have good privacy
22:14:30 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Don't use iCloud and you're fine
22:14:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They respect settings and all telemetry can be disabled, I'm not basing it from marketing
22:23:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> r.i.p. Kaminsky
22:25:39 <UlTiMaTeExTrAs> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Apple products offer great priva"> (If you need to dissapear or something, they're still total suicide.)
22:30:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <UlTiMaTeExTrAs "(If you need to dissapear or som"> If you're disappearing then don't use a cellphone
22:30:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Cell tower triangulation works regardless of your OS, it's basic radio physics
22:31:42 <UlTiMaTeExTrAs> (Right.)
22:57:56 <Wonderfall[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "No they actually have good priva"> In fact it can be hardly denied. Safari ITP (just Safari itself offers great blending), App Tracking Transparency, fully deactivable Advertising ID and diagnostics data. They offer good enough first-party privacy for the average people. Their third-party privacy is also great thanks to their app sandboxing model.
23:01:00 <GhostSplinterSix> I've been telling my Dad about GrapheneOS and the lack of bloatware and other common things found on big tech products and he's interested in switching.
23:03:04 <jj1013[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I've been telling my Dad about G"> You know...
23:03:08 <jj1013[m]> My dad doesn't give a shit.
23:03:20 <jj1013[m]> He even says DuckDuckGo is bad.
23:03:26 <M9thplayer[m]> damn
23:03:28 <jj1013[m]> He's stupid.
23:04:20 <M9thplayer[m]> Yeah some people are practically impossible to get them to even consider anything not mainstream
23:06:19 <thomashensel[m]> i can top that, my dad works as an IT proffessional and he's unconvincable to use anything but samsung and microsoft devices with every stupid app there is
23:06:24 <M9thplayer[m]> wow
23:06:45 <M9thplayer[m]> Like honestly i'm impressed how close minded people are with tech. It just feels so.. robotic.
23:07:06 <M9thplayer[m]> psychology is a hell of a drug
23:08:14 <thomashensel[m]> convenience is hard to beat
23:08:35 <M9thplayer[m]> that is true
23:09:09 <Guest50779> jj1013.: I mean, DuckDuckGo is honestly really bad, they take Bing results and somehow make them substantially worse
23:09:09 <M9thplayer[m]> yet, there are some things that are near the convenience of mainstream stuff if not better yet it is still denied
23:09:11 <thomashensel[m]> and using qubes/linux/grapheos/matrix etc. is inconvenient at first
23:09:28 <Guest50779> jj1013.: also involves a lot of openwashing / privacywashing
23:09:34 <thomashensel[m]> <Guest50779 "jj1013.: I mean, DuckDuckGo is h"> true, startpage.com is an alternative using google results which are usually better
23:09:35 <Guest50779> not sure how much I really trust them
23:09:42 <jj1013[m]> <Guest50779 "jj1013.: I mean, DuckDuckGo is h"> No, not about that. It's because how DuckDuckGo talks about Google.
23:09:47 <Guest50779> I would prefer having a better search engine to use by default
23:09:48 <jj1013[m]> <thomashensel[m] "true, startpage.com is an altern"> They were bought IIRC
23:09:50 <M9thplayer[m]> <thomashensel[m] "and using qubes/linux/grapheos/m"> Most of those for sure, matrix actually is pretty good. I got a good friend of mine that is not very privacy focused to use it alot with me.
23:10:03 <jj1013[m]> <Guest50779 "I would prefer having a better s"> Searx could be one, but privacytools' is kind of unstable.
23:10:12 <M9thplayer[m]> <jj1013[m] "They were bought IIRC"> Correct, by an Californian advertising agency
23:10:14 <jj1013[m]> For me.
23:10:47 <thomashensel[m]> <M9thplayer[m] "Correct, by an Californian adver"> not great but not necessarily horrible, they still claim strong privacy guranteest
23:10:54 <M9thplayer[m]> > <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> They were bought IIRC
23:10:54 <M9thplayer[m]>  * Correct, by an Californian advertising agency (or something like that)
23:11:10 <M9thplayer[m]> yeah, i just use qwant instead
23:11:21 <M9thplayer[m]> same idea but not owned by a advertising company afaik
23:11:25 <thomashensel[m]> honestly anythin is better then plain google/bing
23:11:30 <M9thplayer[m]> a bit rougher around the edges though
23:11:46 <thomashensel[m]> at least making it a little harder to combine all the info they got on you then google and fb cna
23:11:49 <M9thplayer[m]> <thomashensel[m] "honestly anythin is better then "> oh yeah for sure, i'd rather use startpage than plain google/bing
23:12:35 <M9thplayer[m]> Pretty much anything that is not directly malicious is better than google lol
23:13:32 <Wonderfall[m]> I guess I'm stupid then, I just prefer using Google personally. DDG has no guarantees afaik and much worse results
23:13:57 <thomashensel[m]> try startpage.com wonderfall, it's basically a google proxy
23:14:24 <thomashensel[m]> DDGs search results are terrible in my experience compared to google but startpage is very close to
23:14:32 <Wonderfall[m]> I know, I used to self-host searx for years behind a VPN. But there is issues with proxying search engines
23:14:37 <Wonderfall[m]>  * I know, I used to self-host searx for years behind a VPN. But there are issues with proxying search engines
23:14:55 <Wonderfall[m]> So I just use Google now
23:15:11 <thomashensel[m]> everyone has to die one death or another i guess
23:15:14 <GhostSplinterSix> DDG is great lol
23:15:53 <thomashensel[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "DDG is great lol"> depends on your definition of great. Privacy wise maybe, search result wise they are terrible
23:15:59 <M9thplayer[m]> I like it, feels faster and cleaner than google and has pretty good result in my experience.
23:16:06 <Wonderfall[m]> And privacy wise you can't know for sure
23:16:10 <M9thplayer[m]> * I like it, feels faster and cleaner than google and has pretty good results in my experience.
23:16:17 <Wonderfall[m]> Plus it's US-based
23:16:18 <M9thplayer[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "And privacy wise you can't know "> That is true
23:16:20 <M9thplayer[m]> Yeah
23:17:06 <M9thplayer[m]> I just use qwant when ddg doesn't cut it. Probably better than using straight google.
23:17:08 <thomashensel[m]> u can never konw for sure but i don't think it's unreasonable to give a service claiming and detailing their privacy policies the benefit of the doubt compared to google who explicitly openly deny you your privacy
23:17:14 <Wonderfall[m]> The way I see it, a search engine has good results because they collect data. I prefer efficiency rather than hypothetic privacy benefit
23:18:11 <M9thplayer[m]> Yeah, not had much issue with tracking less search results tbh. Not perfect but is satisfactory 90% of the time for me
23:21:36 <Wonderfall[m]> And obviously you can limit how your data will be identified (eg no Google account if possible, and if that's the case, opt-out in your settings)
23:21:36 <Wonderfall[m]> I rely too much on search engines to throw away Google, that's not an option for me. But then everyone defines their threats and needs
23:22:14 <thomashensel[m]> i also use google from time to time when the search results are unsatisfactory or i want ot use their shopping or news search eninge
23:22:22 <thomashensel[m]> i just do it in a private window lol
23:22:25 <M9thplayer[m]> Yeah, I can definitely see someone almost never getting good results from ddg lol. It just depends on what your search is
23:22:51 <Wonderfall[m]> Yeah, when I used DDG a few years ago I just ended up using the Google bang (!g) 90% of the time
23:22:54 <thomashensel[m]> and your location aswell, if you need for example german search results, ddg is useless
23:23:21 <M9thplayer[m]> <thomashensel[m] "and your location aswell, if you"> Yeah
23:23:48 <Wonderfall[m]> In France we also have an alternative called Qwant but it's horseshit. They also get the majority of their results from Bing and they're poorly managed
23:24:01 <GhostSplinterSix> <thomashensel[m] "depends on your definition of gr"> I haven't had any issues with search results.
23:24:28 <M9thplayer[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "In France we also have an altern"> Qwant is pretty ok in my experience, definitely a little rough though.
23:24:46 <M9thplayer[m]> Search results are pretty good though
23:24:51 <thomashensel[m]> a lot of websites only let google crawl them without hard limits
23:25:04 <M9thplayer[m]> True
23:25:32 <M9thplayer[m]> I'd say the success of a search engine for someone definitely depends on the person's needs lol
23:25:47 <thomashensel[m]> https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/how-google-dominates.html
23:25:54 <Wonderfall[m]> I wouldn't use it even for french results, but that's not the issue actually, their management is terrible and in a french interview they shared some strange visions about how search engine should work
23:26:11 <M9thplayer[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "I wouldn't use it even for frenc"> Wack
23:26:40 <M9thplayer[m]> Now I kinda wanna know what their visions are lol
23:27:09 <Wonderfall[m]> I like using searx, like a lot. Powerful settings, shortcuts, and stuff, great for multi-language search
23:27:20 <Wonderfall[m]> *liked, numerous issues that said
23:27:53 <M9thplayer[m]> funny enough, I've had meh experiences with searx when I tried it. I think our experiences are almost polar opposite 😆
23:28:00 <Wonderfall[m]> Most people won't get privacy from Search if they're self-hosting it behind a unique IP
23:28:06 <Wonderfall[m]>  * Most people won't get privacy from searx if they're self-hosting it behind a unique IP
23:28:07 <M9thplayer[m]> Searx is probably better now though
23:28:23 <thomashensel[m]> man i wish GDPR would be enforce, then this would all be so much easier
23:28:55 <Wonderfall[m]> GDPR has been a bless for us europeans, but there's room for improvements
23:28:59 <M9thplayer[m]> <thomashensel[m] "man i wish GDPR would be enforce"> Wish this wasn't a problem in the first place. On the bright side you learn a lot and it is at least a little fun
23:29:30 <thomashensel[m]> true dat, but if you really depend on it, like a journalist, a doctor or a lawyer its not fun anymore
23:29:37 <M9thplayer[m]> Oh 100%
23:29:58 <M9thplayer[m]> If your focking life depends on it everyday
23:30:17 <M9thplayer[m]> Almost life or death
23:30:35 <thomashensel[m]> Wonderfall: honestly, if GDPR was actually enforeced it would be hard to improve upon, privacy by design, minimisation of data collection etc. its just not enforeced at all
23:30:45 <M9thplayer[m]> Yeah
23:31:40 <Wonderfall[m]> I'm actually sending plaints regularly to the CNIL, the commission which has the role to enforce privacy laws here
23:32:16 <thomashensel[m]> i honetly dont bother with it, with the exception of nyob unless you sue, nothing happens
23:32:17 <Wonderfall[m]> That's funny, many services aren't even aware of GDPR
23:33:01 <thomashensel[m]> as a dev working for big companies, i promise you they are VERY aware they just chose not to implement it and know they can get away with it
23:33:13 <Wonderfall[m]> The big companies are for sure
23:33:18 <Wonderfall[m]> The smaller ones probably not
23:33:49 <Wonderfall[m]> has been pretty chaotic for them so far
23:33:54 <thomashensel[m]> can only speak for germany but yes they are. Every school in germany is debating it currenlty with remote schooling
23:34:16 <M9thplayer[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "The big companies are for sure"> I mean, LG straight up admits to breaking a warranty law on their website's chatbot
23:34:26 <M9thplayer[m]> And nobody cares
23:34:50 <thomashensel[m]> its not enforced, which is insane beause they could hire so many people just by the fines they could reap
23:35:11 <thomashensel[m]> and facebook should just get default fined
