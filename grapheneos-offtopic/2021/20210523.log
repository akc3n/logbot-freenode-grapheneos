16:41:55 <strcat2> louipcm: just kicking the freenode ones btw
16:42:15 <louipcm> yea ghosts
16:42:21 <strcat2> need a bot that kicks all the @freenode_* users
16:42:41 <strcat2> it's harmless to kick one that's still in irc since they just eventually reappear
16:44:24 <louipcm> ok
16:47:00 <namarrgo1> you could just kick everyone on irc side strcat2
16:47:08 <namarrgo1> use chanserv to clear the channel
16:47:30 <namarrgo1> presumably everyone will at least notice that
16:51:13 <strcat2> namarrgo1: don't want to do that
16:51:28 <strcat2> namarrgo1: the issue is Matrix thinks people that are gone are still here

19:54:42 <strcat> This room will continue to the exist for the time being but we're fully migrating to Matrix without a bridge to Freenode: #grapheneos:matrix.org #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org. We reserved #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat but we'll be focusing on Matrix.
19:54:44 <strcat> After you move to #grapheneos-new:matrix.org / #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org (or the libera.chat IRC channels, but keep in mind they aren't bridged to the main rooms) you can leave here.
19:54:46 <strcat> https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover
19:54:48 <strcat> If your Matrix client has the previous aliases cached with the old rooms, use #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org as a workaround.
19:54:50 <strcat> if enough people are interested in the libera.chat #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic rooms we'll figure out a leaner way to bridge it without having a bridge bot requiring mod powers in the Matrix room to invite/kick virtual irc users and kick Matrix users for lurking (really bad experience).
19:54:52 <strcat> There will be nothing beyond spam telling people to move to the new rooms here. We'll be focusing on the Matrix rooms.
