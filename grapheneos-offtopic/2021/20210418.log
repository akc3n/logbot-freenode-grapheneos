14:11:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> Nice.
14:19:13 <covid-1984[m]> When using go-mtpfs over USB 3.2 the transfer rate seems to vary between 1 & 10 mbps... strange
14:19:17 <covid-1984[m]> Mostly around 3mbps
14:19:43 <covid-1984[m]> What do you guys use?
14:24:42 <timeobo[m]> 30 mbps
14:24:48 <lain[m]1> i use windows and i don't have any problems
14:25:14 <timeobo[m]> Around 30 / 50 mbps
14:31:08 <covid-1984[m]> hmm ya I get about 30mbps until I hit about 680mb transferred
14:31:46 <covid-1984[m]> then around 750mb it disconnects
14:32:00 <covid-1984[m]> with 2gb to go unfortunately
14:32:46 <covid-1984[m]> will try rsync instead of file manager
15:12:38 <sign4l[m]> covid-1984 are you using an USB hub?
15:25:07 <missfire[m]> hey, is someone familiar with a way to do call recording? thanks
15:25:49 <sign4l[m]> This is illegal in some jurisdictions
15:26:01 <missfire[m]> illegal to record my calls?
15:26:13 <sign4l[m]> Yes
15:26:32 <missfire[m]> well, is there any way to do it?
15:27:36 <louipc> you can use a microphone
15:28:16 <louipc> or a headset that splits the audio signal to a recording device
15:28:40 <missfire[m]> I understand that this is not possible software-wise?
15:28:43 <louipc> maybe theres some bluetooth device that does it
15:29:13 <louipc> missfire[m]: it would need to be builtin to the phone app
15:29:18 <louipc> because of permissions
15:29:23 <missfire[m]> I see
15:29:35 <louipc> other apps should not be allowed to spy in your phone calls
15:29:51 <missfire[m]> <louipc "maybe theres some bluetooth devi"> i'll look for such thing, I would appreciate if you could help with that
15:30:36 <louipc> i cant help much further. maybe you can ask at a security/surveillance store
15:30:48 <louipc> or just google :p
15:30:48 <missfire[m]> I see, thanks.
15:34:48 <louipc> of course follow your local laws and regulation :)
16:01:14 <covid-1984[m]> <sign4l[m] "covid-1984 are you using an USB "> nope, direct into USB 3.2 (also tried 2.0) port on motherboard.
16:51:22 <TheLynx> Hello everybody, just insatlled the newes upgrade for my Pixel 3a and haven some issues with a 2FA App for my Creditcard. The issue started reproducible right after the update.
16:51:39 <TheLynx> Not sure if this has someting to do with "Vanadium: disable speculative service worker start by default" That is the link to the app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.fiduciagad.securego.vr
16:51:48 <acronym[m]> Does anyone know of a way to make a home screen shortcut to access the power button menu?
16:51:48 <acronym[m]> Activity Launcher perhaps?
16:51:48 <acronym[m]> Or is this something that can only be done on rooted phone?
16:51:52 <TheLynx> Does someone has a simillar issue or know waht i could do
16:53:18 <lynx> sorry fucked up my screen session
16:53:56 <acronym[m]> <TheLynx "Does someone has a simillar issu"> Is it necessary to use that 2fa app? Could you use Aegis?
17:01:11 <nscnt[m]> acronym: Yes. This is a legal requirement in Germany. Either with a piece of paper that is sent to you or the banking app.
17:02:18 <nscnt[m]> i.e. no other comfortable alternative if banking app doesn't work
17:06:34 <Babbot45> hi

18:10:24 <jj1013[m]> Wotcher cock.
18:55:44 <TheLynx> acronym[m]: This app is mandetory for some payment services for my creditcard
18:56:02 <TheLynx> worked just before the last GrapeheOS system update
18:56:16 <TheLynx> It just hangs on the splashscreen
18:56:35 <TheLynx> could be because of webviwe
18:56:41 <TheLynx> *webview
18:57:41 <dazinism> acronym: activity launcher System UI screen saver activity should fire the screen saver. By default phone locks five seconds later
18:58:55 <dazinism> TheLynx: guess you tried restarting the phone?
19:04:11 <TheLynx> yes, two times
19:04:22 <TheLynx> Vanadium: disable speculative service worker start by default
19:04:28 <TheLynx> maybe this is the issue
19:04:47 <TheLynx> I'm not sure how doe activate it again just for testing

19:11:12 <TheLynx> dazinism: must have something to do with the update, right before the update it worked fine
19:18:41 <dazinism> TheLynx: I'm not a developer, but it feels unlikely an app would be using a service worker. As I understand it they are more used so websites can do stuff more like an app would.
19:56:32 <jj1013[m]> <giffgaff[m] "In WIFI data usage What is the A"> There's Electrum for Android?
19:59:15 <Baba[m]> <akc3n[m] "Maybe -> https://alternativeto.n"> Thank you. Open note scanner is better even than camscanner offical playstore.

20:53:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Are you insinuating I was being dishonest when saying I forgot to change my name after a joke?
20:53:58 <acronym[m]> <dazinism "acronym: activity launcher Syste"> Was looking more for a way to get the power button menu (forget the proper name for this screen) so I can get to this screen to either end session or power off phone by way of home screen shortcut and not having to use the power button.
21:31:26 <Core6255> Ive never seen a channel get this many spammers. :S
21:34:12 <jj1013[m]> <Core6255 "Ive never seen a channel get thi"> As a matter of fact, this is the first time I have seen how far aggresive can competition become.
21:37:57 <sphinx[m]> it's the same person and not about 'competition'
22:27:44 <louipc> sounds fun jess
22:39:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> mods and trusted fellas, is there a list of banned users?

23:53:30 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone hears of an app called Invizible Pro? Seems like Orbot but with more features. Does anyone know how to chain proxys in android so the last part of the chain is a VPN the first Tor.
23:59:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <bypassbobby[m] "Anyone hears of an app called In"> That's a bad idea
