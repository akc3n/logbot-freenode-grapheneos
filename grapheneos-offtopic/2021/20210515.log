06:46:56 <Heuristik[m]> While Matrix does have its own flaws, it seems like an acceptable and probably the most future-proof (best potential) option to me - if one chooses a good Server (if possible, self-hosted) and good client. Me having my account on matrix.org is not a good example for that 😆

07:05:04 <trttl> on matrix pretty much nothing is e2ee encrypted except the messages themselves. all the metadata is available to the home servers that are involved in a conversation. you may trust yours but you can't possibly trust every HS of all the people you talk to
07:06:38 <trttl> on the upside you can sign up anonymously so that mitigates somwehat the metadata issue
07:07:53 <trttl> it's an alternative to irc or discord or jabber but not to a private hush-hush instant messenger
07:10:46 <Heuristik[m]> trttl: Thats why I said the Server you use matters. If you set up your own server, and your contacts do the same (or use the same server as you) the metadata is pretty much fine.

09:29:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> I'm pretty sure that all Bluetooth wireless earbuds will be able to pair with GrapheneOS to play music
09:30:02 <alba[m]> but the speech assistance will be obsolet?
09:30:23 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <alba[m] "like xiaomi Mi True Wireless Ear"> I would recommend Jabra Elite 75t or 85t

09:32:51 <alba[m]> which app?
09:36:10 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Yes, there won't be a speech assistant, because there is none in GrapheneOS
09:36:28 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> You can install it if you want to, and it might or might not work
09:37:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> It's advised to stay away from speech assistants as they add an attack surface

12:55:59 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yeah, Hulk. A whitelist based approach would be better.

13:43:09 <Railgun_Lover[m]> alex-resist: about the discussion from main
13:43:22 <Railgun_Lover[m]> https://www.themobileindian.com/news/hazardous-elements-in-your-phone-3552 (from a quick Google search)
13:44:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And remember, phones are used for about 3 years generally
13:44:27 <alex-resist> I would bet with you that all those materials can also be found in cars and TVs
13:45:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Again, you use cars and TVs far longer than phones
13:45:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> For example, I use a 13 year old TV, and cars can be used for several decades if treated well
13:46:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Phones, not so much
13:46:31 <alex-resist> Yes, as long as you're referring to cars and TVs that are not fully digital yet. You wouldn't want to use a 13 year old internet connected TV
13:48:35 <Railgun_Lover[m]> alex-resist: no, the same applies to even now
13:49:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And cars can be used for several decades, as I said
13:49:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> welp, alex is not wrong
13:49:44 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> They said "you wouldn't want"
13:50:16 <Railgun_Lover[m]> alex-resist It's not really wise to dumb down the issue of e-waste, especially with how badly humans are trying to ruin the environment
13:50:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Though, the only thing we are doing is suicide, so
13:51:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> The worst thing that's happening to the environment because of human activity is global warming
13:51:33 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> The worst thing that's h"> Not really
13:51:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's habitat destruction
13:52:39 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If humans hadn't been destroying habitats like Amazon, plants (and by extension animals) would have flourished, not that it is an actively good idea, but it wouldn't be as bad per se
13:54:22 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> If Amazon forests would suddenly return back to their pre-industrial state, global warming will not stop
13:54:33 <alex-resist> I'm pretty sure that, if all you do is using a GrapheneOS phone (for 3 years), a laptop (for, say, 5 years), a router and a Raspberry Pi home server, you're way better off resource- and energy-wise than 95% of the western population
13:55:41 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Either way, I don't think a conversation happening right now is useful/productive/educated enough
14:27:48 <M7777777y[m]> No, destruction of natural habitats is the worst thing for the environment.
14:28:12 <M7777777y[m]> Disrupting the balance is more damaging because it is a domino effect

18:56:15 <Wonderfall[m]> This day has come: now my bank forces us to use their app to confirm every operation instead of SMS. Which is great, on paper, because SMS is not a good 2FA option and prone to numerous attacks. But their app has a hard dependency on Play Services, so it's impossible to even log in. No alternatives (except for a hardware generator which comes with a subscription). I tried to talk to them, they literally
18:56:16 <Wonderfall[m]> said they don't care. Fortunately I have an iPad for this, but it irritates me.
18:57:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeeeii, you're lucky to have an iPad for this
18:57:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i'm back on stock becuase of the same issue :P
18:58:41 <Wonderfall[m]> It sucks, really sucks
18:58:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeap(
18:59:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you know what's strange?
18:59:12 <Wonderfall[m]> I mean I'm sure my Yubikey is 10 times more secure than their stupid app
18:59:32 <Wonderfall[m]> What is it
18:59:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah, they don't care
18:59:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> a strange thing is stock adaptive battery thing
19:00:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> seems like it's quite aggressive in terms of killing background apps, even when fully charged with no battery saver turned on
19:01:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> this is why i'm saying so: the Google app (assistant thing) by default always has access to microphone and location
19:02:24 <Wonderfall[m]> Is it something AOSP doesn't have? I'm not used to stock anymore
19:02:35 <Railgun_Lover[m]> How can they not have a web app and if necessary use 2FA
19:02:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, aosp doesn't have it, it's quite proprietary
19:02:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Using hardware key if necessary
19:02:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> What's the point
19:03:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> of them not having web app
19:03:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and so i have denied the microphone permission, but kept the location, because it shows the weather
19:04:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> after some time, it just stopped showing the weather
19:04:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> moreover, seems like the assistant is pretty much dead
19:05:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that's why i think that adaptive battery kills processes harshly
19:05:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> strange O_o
19:06:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> anyway, Railgun, it's quite easy to argue why not to have a web app
19:08:04 <Wonderfall[m]> In general I'm not fond of automatic aggressive apps killing (could end up in using more battery, which is ironic), but I'm sure Google made a better work than other shitty implementations like on Xiaomi devices
19:08:26 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> stuff like, "we don't want our users to use insecure desktops, and want them to stick to smartphones, which are by default much better in terms of security"
19:09:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and also stuff like "we just don't want to pay for a web app" is a killer argument
19:10:36 <Telegram-Bridge> <g​ochoingles> Those look more like excuses to me
19:11:12 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> they do, but my point is, you can't really argue with them
19:12:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <g​ochoingles> Does anybody know what haxlol does?
19:12:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <g​ochoingles> I'm still feeling paranoid.
19:12:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> no idea bruh

20:14:33 <flawedworld[m]> <tharg[m]1 "Hi team - where are the 'on devi"> The lone 'on-device' wallpaper we currently bundle is here: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/9db225a19b77ecc8f65ebb198afdf3156c995319
20:32:30 <Cliff[m]> What camera app are you guys using for pixel 4a?
20:33:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i used to use the default camera app
20:33:33 <GhostSplinterSix> Whatever comes with the OS. I'm not a big photo person.
20:33:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> because i also have a separate DSLR camera that I carry with myself to do actual photography
20:35:28 <Cliff[m]> Dslr is a mirror reflex camera right you always carry it with you. Sounds pretty heavy
20:36:06 <Cliff[m]> There was an app that was recommended here, but not for the 4a i believe.
20:38:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, that's what dslr stands for 👍
20:39:22 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you can install Google Camera if you want to
20:43:42 <trttl> 3/cc
20:44:48 <Wonderfall[m]> I have a DSLR too (Nikon D7500), but I admit Night Sight even for someone like me who is used to do astrophotography "the hard way"
20:44:48 <Wonderfall[m]> For now I keep using Gcam with as few as permissions as possible, even though its support is not guaranteed on GOS
20:45:04 <Wonderfall[m]>  * I have a DSLR too (Nikon D7500), but I admit Night Sight provides outstanding results even for someone like me who is used to do astrophotography "the hard way"
20:45:04 <Wonderfall[m]> For now I keep using Gcam with as few as permissions as possible, even though its support is not guaranteed on GOS
20:45:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah boi Wonderfall[m]
20:45:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i knew we were brothers XD
20:45:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> got a Nikon too)
20:46:36 <Wonderfall[m]> At first I thought it was just a gadget, then I tried it and... It's nice even as a tool
20:47:35 <Wonderfall[m]> But yeah of course it doesn't replace a good old DSLR
20:48:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> true, Google Camera does a good job at astrophotography (I've got shaky hands, so can't do it with the dslr)
20:49:45 <Wonderfall[m]> yeah a robust tripod is necessary for regular astrophotography
20:51:24 <Wonderfall[m]> Gcam detects it and adapts the exposure time
20:53:00 <Wonderfall[m]> That being said I value GrapheneOS more, so the day it won't work anymore, I'd just deal with it
20:55:46 <janjaap[m]> Hi, i just received a text via signal. The body of tge text contained something about a road. No street names where mentioned, just a message like 'have you taken the large road'. In the notification there was a button to open it in a mapping app. Upon clicking the button it suggested waze or maps.me. My question now is, who/what is performing these contextual analysis? Either waze is reading all my
20:55:46 <janjaap[m]> notifications or the operating system or signal? I really hope someone can anwser this question and that the answer is not waze.
20:56:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> it's the system, afaik
20:56:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> there are "defaults" that you can set per app
20:57:28 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> for example opening links starting with "maps."
20:57:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> let me phrase it better:
20:58:47 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if you install an app, for example Google Maps, it would tell the system: "hey, you know, i'm a maps app, i can handle links that start with "maps.google.com""
20:59:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and the system goes: "well, ok then, next time i see a link that starts with "maps.google.com" I will ask a user if he wants to open it with you"
21:00:16 <janjaap[m]> Ok, thats clear to me, thanks.
21:00:25 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you're welcome!
21:00:39 <janjaap[m]> But now there was no link or anything in the message
21:00:55 <janjaap[m]> Just the word 'street'
21:00:57 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you can also manage these defaults yourself by going to "default apps"
21:01:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and by clicking on "App info"->Defaults of a selected app
21:02:29 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i suggest you to go the app info of waze and maps.me
21:02:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and see what kind of links do they handle

21:04:37 <janjaap[m]> The strange part to me was the fact that there was no link present in the signal text.
21:05:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, that does sound strange
21:05:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> are you 100% sure, that there was no link, or anything similar?
21:05:32 <janjaap[m]> Yes
21:05:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> also janjaap[m]: completely unrelated note
21:06:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you should change your system navigation to Gesture mode
21:06:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> as this is what is going to be the default on the next GrapheneOS update
21:06:56 <janjaap[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> you should change your s"> Haha, ill give it a try ;)
21:07:19 <janjaap[m]> Ill try to reproduce the 'issue' with the suggested maps
21:07:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, play around)
21:12:23 <skwisgaar[m]> janjaap I just tried sending an address in signal. The app is guessing that you want to open a maps application. It’s just a convenience feature.

21:13:21 <janjaap[m]> This was the exact message
21:13:38 <janjaap[m]> This tine i send it via sms
21:14:10 <janjaap[m]> Translation: did you again use the small street next to the large road?
21:14:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> interesting)
21:14:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> what happens if you the map?
21:14:55 <skwisgaar[m]> Seems like it has to be the OS then. I’ve never seen that before so I assumed it was a signal feature.
21:14:58 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> * if you open the map
21:15:31 <janjaap[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> interesting)"> So, there is some kind of analysis done by the os??
21:16:00 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> apparently? 🤷‍♂️
21:16:27 <sign4l[m]> <janjaap[m] "Screenshot_20210515-231208~2.png"> you can disable this in the android settings -> Apps -> notification -> Actions behaviour
21:16:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> what happens when you click on "open map"?
21:16:51 <skwisgaar[m]> janjaap: yeah that seems to be the case
21:17:01 <skwisgaar[m]> iOS does something similar
21:17:01 <janjaap[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> what happens when you cl"> It suggests map and waze.
21:17:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah, click on one of them

21:22:01 <janjaap[m]> <sign4l[m] "IMG_20210515_231742.jpg"> Ty, i found the option. Glad its the operating system and not waze
21:22:09 <bikeman1234[m]> is there a way to setup a panic password that wipe the phone if you enter it? like encrophones had
21:22:37 <bikeman1234[m]> on pixel 5 with graphene
21:24:58 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> bikeman1234[m]: you can read about it here https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/GrapheneOS-Security-Q%26A.md#does-graphene-allow-me-to-nuke-my-data-if-say-the-phone-gets-ten-incorrect-guesses-at-the-pincode
21:25:02 <janjaap[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> ahah, that's hillarious!"> Are you able to reproduce similar behavior? Im still a little bit freaked out over the fact that the os knows that 'little street' is a restaurant.
21:25:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> sorry janjaap, i don't have a GrapheneOS nearby, someone else might want to reproduce that)
21:47:27 <bikeman1234[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> bikeman1234: you can rea"> this pretty much says its uneccessary and i should use a long password instead, i use 29-32 characters passwords and different ones for different profiles but i would still want a function to delete everything from lock screen, is it impossible?
21:48:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> it is possible, but it is not implemented in the Titan M itself
21:50:05 <bikeman1234[m]> ok but it would would like a normal factory reset?
21:50:13 <bikeman1234[m]> *would work
21:51:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you know what?
21:51:29 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> this exact question has been asked many many times
21:51:34 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> check the logs
21:51:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> TheJollyRoger and strcat did answer it a lot of times

22:25:01 <_[m]3> they are turning into big tech
22:25:24 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> there is a saying
22:25:48 <_[m]3> ?
22:25:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if a company does not work towards becoming bigger, it dies small
22:25:58 <bearbyte[m]> <_[m]3 "they are turning into big tech"> Money talks
22:26:29 <_[m]3> im gonna show moxie some fucking doxxie
22:27:16 <bearbyte[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> if a company does not wo"> I'm not an economy expert or anything similar but I think there are other sustainable business models that don't let your company die just because it earns millions less than a big tech one. For example tutanota protonmail etc.
22:28:00 <_[m]3> dude cant they just wait a few minutes and adopt monero?
22:28:07 <_[m]3> no they need it RIGHT FUCKING NOW
22:28:48 <_[m]3> is session a good app?
22:29:07 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> anyway please read this paper, before you shit on Signal https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2017/papers/84.pdf
22:29:14 <_[m]3> kk
22:29:23 <bearbyte[m]> <_[m]3 "is session a good app?"> Its a signal fork without monero so I guess so?
22:29:35 <_[m]3> im not trying to shit on them just madbc they were actually good
22:29:55 <bearbyte[m]> Nevertheless many opinions were that its still save to use signal for now. It won't turn into big tech in seconds
22:30:39 <_[m]3> <bearbyte[m] "Nevertheless many opinions were "> *Zuckerberg has joined the room* (Boom Big Tech In Seconds

22:34:31 <M7777777y[m]> Why did they adopt some coin I never heard of
22:34:43 <_[m]3> <M7777777y[m] "Why did they adopt some coin I n"> exactly
22:34:46 <akc3n[m]> Ok...but what I'm getting at is....
22:35:00 <_[m]3> I see now
22:35:20 <M7777777y[m]> Why does it need a specific crypto too
22:35:22 <_[m]3> they adopted it to get funding
22:35:34 <M7777777y[m]> Maybe just like add some api in for doing transactions in a chat idk
22:35:44 <akc3n[m]> What makes you think that this wasn't their business plan strategy from the get go. To have mobilecoin... Build up a userbase, then let everyone know that they are going to have a cryptocurrency....
22:35:44 <M7777777y[m]> I dont think there should be a specific coin
22:36:10 <_[m]3> I see what you are saying
22:37:30 <akc3n[m]> I mean, like any business, why would they put all their cards on the table for the get go? That's all I'm getting at. It's a tactic. Even though they are a non-profit per say. They are still a business that has expenses. And a business has a business plan and strategies, and phases for milestones...
22:37:30 <M7777777y[m]> Cryptocurrenciess are  pretty toxic anyways, all greed, people trying to get rich from being "in it before others" and "hodling it forever"
22:37:49 <GhostSplinterSix> ^
22:37:50 <M7777777y[m]> Not that USD is any better though

22:38:26 <_[m]3> I wonder what the 3 letter agancies will think :D
22:38:40 <_[m]3> oh a criminal is using your app for money and messaging?
22:38:49 <_[m]3> well seems like proper cause
22:39:04 <bearbyte[m]> Lol right
22:39:16 <bearbyte[m]> Then they'll start adding backdoors
22:39:20 <_[m]3> they never said they didnt keep any transaction data
22:39:26 <bearbyte[m]> And not updating their server source for years
22:39:43 <_[m]3> their source code hasnt been updated for a bit either aswell
22:40:03 <akc3n[m]> <bearbyte[m] "Good point. It might have but I "> That didn't seem to stop them in the past, example, server side code not being update, and thousands for months hit the forums and chats with huge backlash. And no responses. Up until recently, when they hit the news with the mobilecoin.....
22:40:29 <akc3n[m]> Well, the server code has been updated quite often in the last couple months.
22:40:31 <M7777777y[m]> It's funny because I bet signal is almost mainstream enough there will be drug deals with it
22:41:08 <_[m]3> is nitro key safe?
22:41:29 <akc3n[m]> <_[m]3 "their source code hasnt been upd"> yes it has, https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server/actions

22:42:31 <akc3n[m]> <_[m]3 "I will delete my comment then sr"> It's all good. This is a healthy discussion and in offtopic.
22:42:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> server side source code release means almost nothing tho
22:43:25 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> they could have run literally anything on their servers, and we would never know
22:43:53 <bearbyte[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> they could have run lite"> Right that's what I wanted to ask. If there is a possibility to actually check what is running on there
22:44:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, there is none
22:44:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> unless you are an insider, surely
22:44:55 <akc3n[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> they could have run lite"> Yes you are right. I'm just referencing the point that the bumps are happening on actions to the server code in regards to the comment that their server code hasn't been updated.
22:44:58 <bearbyte[m]> So trust seems to still be a big issue...
22:45:28 <bearbyte[m]> Obviously it'll always be with centralised communication services
22:45:34 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> bearbyte[m]: but that's the whole point
22:45:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> the client code should be good enough, so that we didn't had to trust the sever at all
22:46:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> * server
22:46:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that's the point E2EE
22:46:40 <bearbyte[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> that's the point E2EE"> Right good point. So why the outrage?
22:47:00 <bearbyte[m]> I mean how would it be possible to implement a backdoor? To what extent?
22:47:53 <bearbyte[m]> Let's say the signal server would be the NSAs laptop but it'd be still E2EE the only thing they would be able to read is metadata at most?
22:48:22 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> afaik, that is correct
22:48:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i might be wrong tho
22:48:51 <M7777777y[m]> If the client is doing E2EE you're probs fine
22:48:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> but perfect case scenario, that would be it, just the metadata
22:49:16 <M7777777y[m]> but you still need to distrust the infrastructure by verifying the fingerprints
22:49:36 <bearbyte[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> but perfect case scenari"> Well it can be acuallt confirmed for sure since the client side app is open source and you'd just have to check that
22:49:39 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, to prevent MITM attacks
22:49:40 <M7777777y[m]> And make sure you verify the client was not tampered with
22:50:09 <M7777777y[m]> Because if their download server is malicious they could give you a bad copy
22:50:11 <bearbyte[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> yes, to prevent MITM att"> How could you perform a MITM if its E2EE?
22:50:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah, that's about it
22:50:49 <M7777777y[m]> On element we verify keys because a malicious server could serve us a fake device under a user ID
22:51:01 <M7777777y[m]> I assume same goes for signal
22:51:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> well, Signal is TOFU afaik
22:51:07 <bearbyte[m]> <M7777777y[m] "Because if their download server"> So just  verify with the github source very time its updated.
22:51:23 <bearbyte[m]> Only use the version from github. The version you know the source code of
22:51:50 <M7777777y[m]> Bear, I agree, if you verify the integrity of the client and manually verify keys, your E2EE is probably safe
22:51:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> so MITM attacks can happen when you start a new convo with a new person
22:52:19 <bearbyte[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> so MITM attacks can happ"> Good point forgot about that
22:52:38 <bearbyte[m]> You'd have to manually exchange the keys then :D meet in person and exchange keys.
22:52:46 <bearbyte[m]> Or gpg
22:52:52 <M7777777y[m]> Also it's important to know - someone was saying that signal collects less metadata, - Is this done on the client level or the server level?
22:52:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeap :P
22:53:02 <M7777777y[m]> Bcuz if it's serverside it could be collected
22:53:10 <bearbyte[m]> <M7777777y[m] "Bcuz if it's serverside it could"> Yeah
22:53:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i think client level
22:53:23 <M7777777y[m]> GPG is not so great for this
22:53:25 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> stuff like sealed sender
22:53:34 <M7777777y[m]> One sec let me give you an article about gpg

23:05:22 <akc3n[m]> bearbyte: Latacora's - The PGP Problem is a great article with from a technical perspective. Link is above if you're interested in the technical stuff.
23:06:18 <akc3n[m]> Better off using AGE, https://github.com/FiloSottile/age rather then OpenPGP
23:06:19 <bearbyte[m]> Well okay basically most of the arguments address human error and metadata. But no one will be able to read the content of the message sure one could know who you are talking to how often etc. But the content stays hidden. And the point that RSA might be crackable.in the near future is a solid one but its just a speculation.
23:06:52 <bearbyte[m]> <akc3n[m] "bearbyte: Latacora's - The PGP P"> Thx for the link I'll check it out.
23:07:16 <M7777777y[m]> The point is that it's clunky and that there are a lot better options for communication
23:07:41 <M7777777y[m]> PGP only really makes sense now for software and updates

23:39:51 <akc3n[m]> Ahh okay. Gotcha. Thanks. I just came across that. Was a little surprised.
23:40:21 <Wonderfall[m]> Yeah I stumbled upon this too, but people are making too much fuss about it. It's an issue but not a new one, it's basically trusting the code you run
23:41:17 <akc3n[m]> Good to know. Thanks for explaining that.
23:45:21 <Wonderfall[m]> In this case I think running rust-analyzer in a container would be a good idea if having a separate machine/OS is not possible
23:45:25 <Wonderfall[m]> VSCode is working on that
23:46:00 <bearbyte[m]> What PDF reader WITH a search functionality do you recommend? Couldn't find many in the first place...
23:46:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> chromium :P
23:46:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> edge if you're on windows 10
23:46:51 <bearbyte[m]> On android
23:47:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Vanadium
23:47:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> actually, i haven't checked that
23:47:45 <bearbyte[m]> You actually cannot open PDFs with vanadium
23:48:00 <bearbyte[m]> At least not that I know of it would be great though.
23:50:03 <M7777777y[m]> There's a tool on linux you can convert PDFs to trusted PDFs
23:50:35 <M7777777y[m]> Where it basically scans the pdf text to an image, and then re converts it back to text, to make a new fresh, virus free pdf
23:50:39 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> that's not pretty handy XD
23:50:53 <M7777777y[m]> Would be cool to have something like that on graphene
23:51:06 <M7777777y[m]> Its included on qubes os
23:51:12 <exifran[m]> Yeah that's one feature of Qubes that's pretty cool
23:51:17 <M7777777y[m]> Well at least one that converts to image
23:51:26 <M7777777y[m]> But I think you can add another that will also convert to text
23:51:43 <M7777777y[m]> But it would be good to do this with images as well
23:51:52 <M7777777y[m]> Even, automatically would be nice
23:52:39 <M7777777y[m]> However graphene would probably have to sandbox the converter hard, idk if you can virtualize in android, on qubes its just converted in a temporary virtual machine
23:53:13 <bearbyte[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> that's not pretty handy "> True :D
23:54:50 <bearbyte[m]> <M7777777y[m] "However graphene would probably "> I think kinda virtualization would be using apps like shelter but those make use of androids profiles feature and not actually virtualization I think.
23:58:16 <dazinism> If you don't grant an app any permissions the app sandbox provides more or leas the same privacy and security as using a different user profile
23:59:28 <dazinism> Think the only extra thing an app can access is list of other apps in the same profile
