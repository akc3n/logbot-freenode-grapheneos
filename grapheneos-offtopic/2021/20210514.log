01:50:31 <vini43754[m]> Hello! Is there a way to cast media to devices such as chromecast on graphene?
01:56:33 <lackshan[m]> I can see a cast option in grapheme but I've never tried it out
01:56:40 <lackshan[m]> * I can see a cast option in graphene but I've never tried it out
01:58:05 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> how can you route everything through tor on graphene? do you think calyx vpv is safe?
02:49:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "how can you route everything thr"> Orbot
02:55:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You should avoid VPNs if possible, they fully trust the VPN to not log
02:56:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Use tor instead
02:57:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> (I have heard that using Tor for too many things, specifically unusual traffic like updating, etc can make it easier to identify)
03:41:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "how can you route everything thr"> This isn't recommended
03:41:54 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Agreed
03:42:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should use whonix or something dedicated for tor
03:48:37 <xyjet[m]> I've seen DisplayLink mentioned a few times here. Any security/privacy concerns in using it?
03:48:57 <Guest24338> yea of course
03:49:15 <Guest24338> if the framebuffer DKMS you use is fucked, you fuck your kernel
03:49:24 <Guest24338> and it taints the kernel too
03:49:25 <Guest24338> :P
03:49:48 <Guest24338> security problems mostly.
03:50:02 <Guest24338> but what do? you gotta use what you gotta use Zzzz
03:53:27 <xyjet[m]> Interesting, thanks. Guess I'll stick to a laptop for a bigger screen for now.
03:58:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Guest24338 "if the framebuffer DKMS you use "> What is dkms?
03:58:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <c‚Äãlannad> Hm

03:58:48 <Guest24338> yes dynamic kernel modules
04:09:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Guest24338 "but what do? you gotta use what "> Yeah, it's a bonus if it has horrible UX on any attempts to contain or secure it too

It's like nothing happens.I have tested my USB-C hub on another phone and it works fine. Do you have any idea what I'm missing, or which permissions I might need to enable?
06:51:55 <strcat> sounds like you're either connecting them when the screen is locked or you disable USB peripherals in Settings -> Security
06:52:04 <strcat> see https://grapheneos.org/features
06:52:26 <strcat> > Greatly reduced remote, local and proximity-based attack surface by stripping out unnecessary code, making more features optional and disabling optional features by default (NFC, Bluetooth, etc.), when the screen is locked (connecting new USB peripherals, camera access) and optionally after a timeout (Bluetooth)
06:52:45 <strcat> the default is that USB peripherals cannot be connected when the screen is locked
06:52:52 <strcat> you may have changed it to disallow them completely

08:30:03 <EV-9600[m]> <strcat[m] "shouldn't impact mobile Chromium"> It has nothing to do with extensions, it uses custom URLs
08:30:47 <EV-9600[m]> Which are also not supported in mobile
08:32:57 <strcat[m]> read the article
08:34:22 <EV-9600[m]> *it doesn't have to use extensions
08:34:32 <EV-9600[m]> Only 1 attack vector used them
08:34:35 <strcat[m]> read the section on Chrome
08:35:15 <EV-9600[m]> But there could be others, it is just the one the used, the problem's core is custom URLs, not extensions
08:35:34 <strcat[m]> if the mitigation worked properly it wouldn't be a problem

09:13:10 <EV-9600[m]> Can I add custom iptables rules if I build GOS from source?
09:42:36 <strcat[m]> you can change whatever you want if you build from source
09:42:38 <strcat[m]> sounds misguided though
10:16:06 <rny> strcat[m]: how do you try to explain to somebody that they are making an unfair comparison between two things, especially so when the security assumptions are completely different?
10:20:54 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <rny "strcat: how do you try to explai"> Following the question too
10:24:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> People still believe that only famous people need security

10:29:21 <EV-9600[m]> <strcat[m] "you can change whatever you want"> Where do I do that?
10:29:48 <strcat[m]> for the reasons elaborated on in many previous discussions here
10:29:52 <strcat[m]> what you're doing is most likely misguided
10:30:31 <strcat[m]> fine-grained firewall filtering based on destination ip/port/host or based on app doesn't actually work
10:30:51 <strcat[m]> so, chances are what you want to do doesn't actually work
10:32:15 <EV-9600[m]> I want to make tethering go through my VPN, how would you recommend to do it then?
10:38:05 <strcat[m]> someone should implement it properly (not with hacks) and submit a PR
10:38:40 <EV-9600[m]> Why are iptables considered a hack in your opinion?
10:38:41 <strcat[m]> definitely not as simple as some iptables rule
10:38:58 <strcat[m]> I don't think you understand how tethering works
10:39:02 <strcat[m]> feel free to do what you want
10:39:35 <EV-9600[m]> I am trying to understand what you are saying
10:40:03 <EV-9600[m]> What would be a "hackless" solution?
10:40:32 <sign4l[m]> strcat: little bit offtopic... but I want to thank you for creating GrapheneOS. You changed my life for the positive and I love every day knowing my meta data do not get tracked by Apple Google Amazon Cloudflare anymore. Thank you so much!
10:43:49 <EV-9600[m]> <EV-9600[m] "Where do I do that?"> Any way, can anyone provide me with an explanation of where can I change iptables when building from source?
10:46:21 <strcat[m]> netd
10:46:27 <strcat[m]> but as I said you seem to misunderstand how tethering works
10:46:49 <strcat[m]> https://source.android.com/devices/tech/connect/tethering-offload
10:47:32 <strcat[m]> not entirely sure we want that kind of feature since it's counter to our goal of supporting finer-grained VPN usage
10:47:53 <strcat[m]> we want to make the VPN actually per-profile instead of global but configured by the active profile
10:48:10 <strcat[m]> doesn't it make more sense for each computer to be able to use a different one? and then hardware offload still works too
10:51:47 <EV-9600[m]> No
10:53:02 <strcat[m]> not much of an answer
10:53:21 <EV-9600[m]> It doesn't make more sense in my use case
10:53:24 <strcat[m]> we don't want traffic from all profiles needlessly tied together, let alone from multiple devices
10:53:38 <EV-9600[m]> I do though
10:53:45 <strcat[m]> so if this was supported it definitely wouldn't be the default
10:54:20 <EV-9600[m]> <strcat[m] "https://source.android.com/devic"> So this just means I will have some overhead, its ok
10:54:42 <rny> can you provide the motivation?
10:55:00 <rny> cant understand the objective of global vs. per-profile
10:55:19 <rny> i meant cant understand what you can get in global that you cant get in per-profile
10:55:28 <strcat[m]> it will wake the device whenever the connected devices send packets instead of having it offloaded
10:55:31 <EV-9600[m]> My VPN is prebuilt in my build and should be transparent to the user

17:26:56 <sizzyb> Does anyone in here use AnySoftKeyboard??
17:27:05 <Thatcher[m]> You could make suggestions, but the best way to add new features or see improvement where needed is to contribute the code yourself. Small project with very limited resources, which prioritizes focus on security improvements of the system. Daniel is not a slave and he needs our help.
17:28:01 <Thatcher[m]> Motivation to start learning programming is key
17:30:12 <FreeEagle> Thatcher[m] i would love to learn programming but i don't know where to start
17:31:22 <Thatcher[m]> Start by finding a project you want to contribute to and learn to program for that project
17:33:08 <FreeEagle> ok i would love to make 2 things a scheduled messages app and a theme app for graphene
17:33:10 <kayront> Thatcher[m]: what's the bare minimum to get started ? RAM, software, etc
17:33:23 <kayront> i'm gonna guess 16GB at least and android studio/java
17:34:24 <Thatcher[m]> The bare minimum is the discipline and motivation to get started
17:36:42 <FreeEagle> which languages should be used to make apps for graphene
17:37:06 <kayront> sure Thatcher[m], but in terms of hardware and software, what is it?
17:37:21 <kayront> and any good books/resources you can recommend ?
17:37:28 <kayront> (from experience=
17:37:29 <kayront> )
17:37:34 <Thatcher[m]> https://developer.android.com/
17:39:13 <kayront> These documents teach you how to build Android apps using APIs in the Android framework and other libraries.
17:39:52 <lackshan[m]> kayront In terms of hardware, a quad core with 16gb of ram is plenty for app development (youll want something beefier for aosp dev). Software wise all you need is android studio
17:40:22 <kayront> 8 cpus and 32GB RAM beefy enough for aosp lackshan[m] ?
17:40:42 <Thatcher[m]> In terms of hardware, you go with what you have. When you start exceeding the capabilities of your hardware, scale up.
17:40:53 <lackshan[m]> As for resources, clean code and the basics help. Beyond that take a look at android projects and learn what they di
17:40:55 <lackshan[m]> *do
17:41:21 <lackshan[m]> kayront Yep. I have a ryzen 1300X and it takes 6h40m to build graphene lol
17:41:25 <lackshan[m]> Don't be like me
17:41:34 <lackshan[m]> You'll get it done much faster
17:41:52 <kayront> yeah Thatcher[m], it's not gonna work. i'm on qubes with 16GB RAM, pretty sure android studio wont' run properly here.. and even if it did there is some nasty bug with android tools and qubes, the device disconnects
17:42:01 <kayront> i'm asking for specs because I know i'd have to buy something :p
17:42:04 <lackshan[m]> Also read the build section on the graphene website. There's a section about code standards
17:42:38 <lackshan[m]> @kayront get an ssd and install Ubuntu on that. Its much easier to develop on bare metal than through a vm
17:43:02 <kayront> yeah but i need another machine. i have everything setup in qubes for years
17:43:24 <kayront> it works, i like it, it's staying. but i'm not against buying a machine to play around with this
17:43:26 <Thatcher[m]> Or another hard drive
17:43:30 <lackshan[m]> FreeEagle Read the build section on the graphene website. Generally its Kotlin for newer stuff but Java works fine too
17:43:46 <lackshan[m]> You can dual boot without getting rid of qubes
17:44:00 <lackshan[m]> But please get an ssd. Do not use a hard drive
17:44:03 <kayront> i almost never reboot Thatcher[m], it'd be problematic (also lackshan[m]). i have way too much stuff open all the time to be rebooting with any sort of frequency
17:44:18 <kayront> it's a nightmare to set it all up any time I do
17:44:18 <kayront> lol
17:44:19 <lackshan[m]> You'll waste so much time
17:44:30 <kayront> yeah, ssd or nvme for sure
17:44:35 <lackshan[m]> Ah right
17:44:52 <Thatcher[m]> Sounds like a nightmare. It won't let you do what you want to do. Learn programming .
17:45:01 <lackshan[m]> https://www.alsutton.blog/post/2021-aosp-build-machine/
17:45:08 <lackshan[m]> That may be helpful
17:45:34 <lackshan[m]> Bear in mind I'm advising you based on research I've done over the last few days
17:45:41 <lackshan[m]> I'm not an expert or anything üòõ
17:45:45 <kayront> Thatcher[m]: different machines, different limitations. i can (and do) program here just fine, just not android studio, it's too heavy
17:46:19 <kayront> i'll have a look lackshan[m]
17:48:52 <kayront> looks good
17:57:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <g‚Äãochoingles> dallemon[m]: That doesn't sound good. Nothing to worry about, though ‚îÄ the Matrix group will do. As strcat mentioned, a Matrix-Telegram group could be made.

19:18:14 <dream123[m]> To modify it directly at the building pc is not very handy...
19:27:06 <nscnt[m]> dream123: It's meant to be built with the Soong build system, not Gradle. It uses system APIs that only work when the Updater is built together with the system

19:28:53 <nscnt[m]> dream123: I don't know whether we have the same definition of debugging. What do you want to do?
19:29:36 <dream123[m]> to modify code with nice gui and debug as usual apk via android studio or eclipse
19:31:43 <nscnt[m]> dream123: Make your changes and then create incremental builds that you can flash
19:33:05 <dream123[m]> that how  do now. but, as i'm only started to work with system apps an grapheneos i was thinking that better way is present

19:33:50 <dream123[m]> it's kind of nightmare to work in that way
19:36:45 <nscnt[m]> A taste of development work, eh? :]
19:39:20 <dream123[m]> i don't believe that android was made without debugging and in that way. it has to be with proper dubug available and code editing.

20:18:10 <M7777777y[m]> But don't you have to trust signal with this same meta data?
20:18:45 <M7777777y[m]> The meta data problem on matrix could be reduced if p2p dendrite server releases successfully
20:19:13 <M7777777y[m]> Currently it's pretty centralized on the matrix.org homeserver, partly because it's quite resource intensive to host a server with synapse rn
20:20:25 <M7777777y[m]> It seems the main problems with matrix is that 1. the protocol seems to be quite resource intensive and 2. The problems that federation in general has also apply (distributed > federated)
20:28:51 <x-seraph-x[m]> <M7777777y[m] "But don't you have to trust sign"> I don't know. Its why I asked here. Eventually you have to trust someone and I trust the views of the experts on here. Am hoping they offer their views üòÅ

21:39:53 <akc3n[m]> kerf: Alex Anderson, aka SerpentSec, like hypokeimenon üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà mentioned above, simply provided snippet of a matrix metadata leak example, which in reference to discussion, I shared the link to the data. Not sure how or what `authority on cryptography and opsec` has anything to do in this case.
21:39:54 <akc3n[m]> You can read about who he is here, https://serpentsec.1337.cx/whoami and look through his git repos to see what he works on.
21:41:02 <kerf[m]> Alright then, thank you
21:41:13 <kerf[m]> How does he find the leaked metadata then?
21:41:57 <hypokeimenon[m]> I think they just opened an encrypted DM and looked up the source for messages.
21:43:24 <hypokeimenon[m]>  * I think they just opened an encrypted DM and looked up the source for messages, then did some experimenting to see what was and wasn't encrypted. Probably coupled with some looking over Matrix source
21:45:11 <akc3n[m]> <kerf[m] "How does he find the leaked meta"> If you take a look at the snippet, https://snippets.serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix-metadata-leaks and scroll down to `Someone joining an encrypted room` section, you can see the details there.
21:50:02 <M7777777y[m]> Yup, matrix metadata is bad, but is there a way around this in a federated model?
21:50:29 <M7777777y[m]> I would assume signal could see most of the same metadata
21:50:34 <M7777777y[m]> But I'm not very read into signal
21:51:14 <M7777777y[m]> I think the most realistic ways of getting around this is using something like GNUnet is proposing
21:51:24 <M7777777y[m]> Look into gnunet if you're interested
21:53:14 <hypokeimenon[m]> Signal doesn't see most of the same metadata.
21:53:49 <Yourmomuwu[m]> <M7777777y[m] "Yup, matrix metadata is bad, but"> no, maybe if you could implement Tor with Matrix it would be better

21:56:31 <M7777777y[m]> Probably not to whom, well, unless there was a way to time that
21:57:27 <M7777777y[m]> Your mom uwu: https://secushare.org/anonymity
21:57:27 <M7777777y[m]> Read this to see why tor isnt sufficient for use cases involving rapid transfers of small amounts of data (Like texting)
21:58:58 <M7777777y[m]> Might be better to focus on a GNUnet based solution than to try to do some clunky onionized matrix
22:01:20 <M7777777y[m]> But yeah in general check out various articles on that site secushare they have a lot of very interesting stuff
22:01:41 <hypokeimenon[m]> <Yourmomuwu[m] "Signal itself doesn't but your m">  Signal themselves acknowledge this partially in https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/ where they state: "These protocol changes are an incremental step, and we are continuing to work on improvements to Signal‚Äôs metadata resistance.

22:02:28 <hypokeimenon[m]> In the meantime you could (at your own discretion, because third-party clients are not officially allowed by Signal) support a client like Molly which acknowledges and actively tries to support mitigating some of these issues: https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/issues/12 or deal with it yourself on the official client app.

22:33:56 <Telegram-Bridge> S (@D‚Äãhqeu) has joined the Telegram Group!
22:38:28 <southron[m]> I've used mullvad for awhile and don't have any complaints.
22:51:20 <bearbyte[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "what do you think about mullvad "> In would use tor instead. Depends why you're using a VPN in the first place. Security, anonimity, privacy?
22:51:43 <akc3n[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "what do you think about mullvad "> Mullvad is great. Not sure about PIA or other mainstream commercialized vpn providers. I wouldn't trust them, but that's just me. iVPN is pretty good too. I personally don't use a vpn much (with the exception of irc/matrix on my public personal laptop/desktop/gos phone). Though for specific reasons on separate devices/laptops outside my home network ->
22:51:43 <akc3n[m]> hotspots/public wifi, etc) vpn is used.
22:52:09 <bearbyte[m]> A VPN is not anonymous hope you keep that in mind.
22:52:15 <akc3n[m]> <bearbyte[m] "In would use tor instead. Depend"> A vpn is not anonymous.

22:56:38 <akc3n[m]> If you're after anonymity that is...
23:04:22 <M7777777y[m]> and it's FREE
23:04:53 <M7777777y[m]> If you really need a vpn for sites that block tor
23:05:08 <M7777777y[m]> You can put tor first and then a vpn
23:05:19 <M7777777y[m]> but dont do it unless you have to
23:05:38 <M7777777y[m]> And only use that vpn acc over tor
23:06:27 <akc3n[m]> Interesting read about Tor relay's recent events. https://nusenu.medium.com/tracking-one-year-of-malicious-tor-exit-relay-activities-part-ii-85c80875c5df
23:08:34 <akc3n[m]> p8tuahpirua5ra: Definitely would NOT advise or recommend at all to use vpn over tor, nor vice verse.
23:08:47 <akc3n[m]> p8tuahpirua5ra: https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/vpn-tor-not-mRikAa4h/
23:09:08 <M7777777y[m]> Yeah its definitely not a gain
23:09:23 <M7777777y[m]> I just meant like only if you have to access something specifically that blocks tor
23:10:38 <M7777777y[m]> Tor should have HTTPS everywhere set to "block all unenrypted requests" by default, due to the exit node problem
23:10:46 <bearbyte[m]> <M7777777y[m] "I just meant like only if you ha"> Isn't a Tor bridge supposed to deal with this problem? Wouldnt need a VPN then.
23:11:04 <M7777777y[m]> Tor bridge is only if YOU can't connect to tor
23:11:21 <M7777777y[m]> But certain websites , ie  banking, gov stuff, will block tor but not block a vpn from connecting
23:11:27 <bearbyte[m]> <M7777777y[m] "Tor bridge is only if YOU can't "> Didn't you mean that?
23:11:37 <bearbyte[m]> Ah got it. Yeah right.
23:11:38 <M7777777y[m]> No
23:11:59 <akc3n[m]> Actually, you definitely want to use a Tor Bridge these days, please read the major issues over the last year with public tor relays.  https://nusenu.medium.com/tracking-one-year-of-malicious-tor-exit-relay-activities-part-ii-85c80875c5df
23:12:44 <Thatcher[m]> I use tor through a vpn all the time. What will happen if I keep doing this?
23:13:11 <akc3n[m]> Here is a great read too https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Bridges
23:14:45 <M7777777y[m]> Yeah tor bridge may also help protect you from a malicious guard node or from your isp knowing you are using tor
23:15:13 <M7777777y[m]> But powerful people can probably still determine you are using tor
23:15:26 <M7777777y[m]> But who will protect you from the malicious tor bridge haha
23:16:53 <M7777777y[m]> More relays and bridges would make tor a lot safer
23:17:04 <M7777777y[m]> I think we can always expect exit nodes to be hostile
23:17:12 <bearbyte[m]> Start hosting more üòÇ
23:17:14 <M7777777y[m]> Considering most people don't want to host an exit node, for obvious reasons
23:17:29 <M7777777y[m]> The answer to this is just to have more onions
23:17:36 <M7777777y[m]> And force https
23:19:52 <M7777777y[m]> Thatcher: Connecting to a vpn and then tor all the time will make your vpn a permanent entry node

23:40:40 <M7777777y[m]> Their policies only make things worse
23:41:05 <M7777777y[m]> Baba if you think "mass shootings" are one of the biggest world issues, you are brain washed
23:41:15 <Baba[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "People will always find a way to"> Very very true
23:41:18 <M7777777y[m]> They account for statistically so few deaths compared to many other things
23:42:04 <Baba[m]> <M7777777y[m] "Baba if you think "mass shooting"> Sorry to say but the one who shoots is brain washed.
23:42:34 <M7777777y[m]> Also, how is white supremacy a world issue when white countries are the least racist countries, taking in the most immigrants to an extent that they will replace themselves at this rate??
23:42:42 <M7777777y[m]> Whites are the least racist people
23:43:15 <bearbyte[m]> The one who shoots has problems with his/ her brain. Just ill. Idk if you can call it brainwash.
23:43:55 <bearbyte[m]> <M7777777y[m] "Also, how is white supremacy a w"> Grapheneos offtopic got really offtopic by now xd
23:43:55 <skwisgaar[m]> The media will convince people that whatever shocks and scares them the most is the biggest problem. It‚Äôs all emotion.
23:44:12 <M7777777y[m]> There has never been a time when whites have been less "supremacist"
23:44:14 <skwisgaar[m]> Well not all emotion but way too much of it
23:44:45 <Baba[m]> Why would one shoot people. Ofcourse on basic of racism, religion and politics. Therefor inspired from these things he got brainwashed by some idiot people
23:45:04 <M7777777y[m]> Nobody is defending mass shooters, they are sick and pathetic people
23:45:06 <bearbyte[m]> <Baba[m] "Why would one shoot people. Ofco"> Right forgot about that aspect.
23:45:25 <Baba[m]> Roger
23:45:42 <skwisgaar[m]> Mass shootings happen because of mental derangement
23:45:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> This is an off-topic room but keep non-privacy/security politics to a minimum please.
23:46:39 <bearbyte[m]> But the term "brainwashed" kinda takes away some guilt from the shooters in my opinion  (since brainwashed sounds like they cant do anthing about it) that's why I insisted not to use it.
23:47:20 <M7777777y[m]> It could be a combination of brainwashing and weakness
23:47:26 <Baba[m]> Any idea about OMEMO new version. And what all it will encrypt
23:48:15 <Baba[m]> Im a big fan of xmpp
23:49:12 <hypokeimenon[m]> I think they mentioned trying to address metadata.
23:49:58 <Baba[m]> You mean metadata will leak to minimum after new vwrsion of OMEMO?
23:52:41 <Baobab> omemo sadly doesn't encrypt files
23:52:52 <M7777777y[m]> https://wiki.404.city/en/XMPP_vs_Matrix
23:53:01 <Baba[m]> <Baobab "omemo sadly doesn't encrypt file"> Come onnnn. Who said so?
23:53:17 <Baobab> Baba[m], When you upload something using http_upload using omemo, the file is encrypted, but using AES symmetric cryptography, rather than recipient‚Äôs public key and your public key.
23:53:50 <GhostSplinterSix> <hypokeimenon[m] "This is an off-topic room but ke"> Such a serious subject on a Friday night.üòÜ
23:53:51 <Baobab> As it is symmetric cryptography the passphrase is stored somewhere else, in this case, it's stored in the uri
23:56:23 <Baba[m]> <Baobab "As it is symmetric cryptography "> Yes. And it encrypt file perfectly. I dnt knw why Baobab said so
23:56:45 <M7777777y[m]> What are your favorite XMPP clients?
23:57:40 <Baobab> M7777777y[m], I'm using Dino right now :)
23:57:58 <Baobab> There's this other client called psi+ that looks interesting too.
23:58:35 <M7777777y[m]> Hmm
23:58:47 <Baba[m]> <M7777777y[m] "What are your favorite XMPP clie"> Conversations
23:58:49 <GhostSplinterSix> I have been known to dabble with a several messengers. I just learned about this:
23:58:49 <GhostSplinterSix> https://github.com/maqp/tfc
23:59:05 <M7777777y[m]> Thanks I will check these all out
23:59:38 <M7777777y[m]> Does anyone use a very lightweight terminal client written in C?
