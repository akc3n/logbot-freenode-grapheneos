00:54:53 <ishikawa[m]> What would be the fastest way to flash multiple pixels at the same time.
00:57:31 <louipc> have a bunch of dedicated flashing rigs i guess
00:59:03 <covid-1984[m]> You could have like a USB squid of 127 devices on Linux. I actually did this before with other flashing software, but I don't know if you could get it to work with GOS or Android flashing software.

22:02:20 <strcat[m]> but you can organize more if you want
22:02:38 <strcat[m]> there's currently a flag to turn it off but I don't think the intention is that stays around
22:03:29 <strcat[m]> basically they added a tab bar and the old tab ui (tabs in same group) is accessed via the arrow on that rather than the main tab button
22:04:00 <strcat[m]> the same group tab overview is easier to push (bottom left of screen)
22:05:48 <strcat[m]> if you had never used either and were presented with both I think nearly everyone would pick the new one
22:06:23 <strcat[m]> if you don't want to use groups, don't use the old overview button, only use the new one for same group (bottom left) or just use the tab bar
22:35:43 <barfly21[m]> random, but just wanted to express my thanks to the grapheneos team for your work
22:38:53 <southron[m]> I've been looking for a way to open a fully encrypted USB drive on the phone encrypted by VeraCrypt  but I'm not sure that's possible. I've seen that EDS Lite can handle Veracrypt containers so maybe that's the route I need to go. If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it.
22:49:41 <barfly21[m]> what do you guys think of the controversy regarding signal/mobilecoin
22:50:13 <strcat[m]> silly, don't care if they add a cryptocurrency to it, don't particularly care if it's not a decentralized one either
22:50:37 <strcat[m]> Signal itself isn't peer-to-peer or even federated
22:50:58 <strcat[m]> won't use it, don't care they want to add it
22:51:19 <barfly21[m]> do you use signal, or something else?
22:51:26 <rny> is signal short on donations?
22:53:43 <barfly21[m]> it creeps me out a little bit that signal's not on fdroid, im thinking of moving to briar for family conversations
22:54:55 <GhostSplinterSix> Why does that creep you out?
22:55:22 <barfly21[m]> doesn't the fdroid stamp of approval mean something in foss? why aren't they in there?
22:55:46 <GhostSplinterSix> Why aren't a lot of apps on there?
22:55:56 <Thatcher[m]> For my own personal needs, I'm considering switching from Signal and Threema over to matrix; host my own matrix-synapse server and my friends and family use Element on my server
22:56:12 <barfly21[m]> yea i was thinking of something like that too
22:56:26 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> fdroid isn't that great, don't give it too much credit
22:56:36 <GhostSplinterSix> ^
22:56:53 <barfly21[m]> yea it's some laziness on my part, im just trying to find someone to trust
22:57:37 <southron[m]> If you can get everyone you know to switch more power to you. I had a hard enough time getting my contacts to Signal.
22:58:04 <barfly21[m]> yea i had a hard time with that, and now i feel stupid for trying to get them to switch
22:58:18 <Thatcher[m]> If they don't switch, fuck em. I will put them on radio silence.
22:58:29 <GhostSplinterSix> üòÜ
22:58:32 <barfly21[m]> that's what i've been doing
22:58:51 <barfly21[m]> just talk to my nuclear family +1-2 friends
22:59:52 <barfly21[m]> how's voice/video quality been for you on element app?
23:00:10 <Thatcher[m]> <barfly21[m] "how's voice/video quality been f"> Never tried it
23:01:15 <southron[m]> I've been using Molly and been pretty happy with it.  Seems to get regular updates.  I've also been using Session with a few contacts. I also do group voice chats on Wire.
23:02:02 <GhostSplinterSix> I wish more of my family and friends used a more secure messenger.
23:02:51 <jj1013[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I wish more of my family and fri"> There are many people who wish that exact same thing, me included.
23:03:36 <jj1013[m]> Meanwhile, for some reason people here at Venezuela still use WhatsApp after the Terms of Service incident.
23:03:40 <Thatcher[m]> The less people I have to communicate with online, the happier I am. For those that need online comms will need a secure messenger of some sort to chat with me.
23:03:52 <southron[m]> I had a family gathering and got them all setup at once. Just telling them never worked.
23:03:54 <j8bit[m]> <jj1013[m] "There are many people who wish t"> had similar problem with a relationship.  setup a bridge. decent compromise for practical reasons.
23:05:27 <jj1013[m]> <southron[m] "I had a family gathering and got"> Yet it is way easier to register on Matrix than on anything.
23:06:21 <j8bit[m]> <jj1013[m] "Yet it is way easier to register"> i only had two people who do not use signal. the bridge made sense for my personal operational model.
23:06:32 <Thatcher[m]> I wouldn't go to Briar though, that promotes continual use of non-Graphene android devices... Unless your family is all on Graphene.
23:07:15 <Thatcher[m]> iOS needs Briar, then it will be a realistic consideration
23:07:18 <barfly21[m]> yea im looking up molly and session now
23:07:40 <barfly21[m]> although it'd be nice if i could get by with matrix/element
23:07:52 <barfly21[m]> im curious to try the call quality
23:08:05 <jj1013[m]> <j8bit[m] "i only had two people who do not"> Bridge? That must have been a really tedious task.
23:09:35 <barfly21[m]> i didn't realize molly connects to signal servers
23:09:42 * j8bit[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/zrcfInFDJTiFoLsdEGwsMulD/message.txt >
23:10:15 <j8bit[m]> <barfly21[m] "i didn't realize molly connects "> yes, it's fork of signal.  nice way to have multiple signal ids on one profile if you so choose
23:11:25 <jj1013[m]> <j8bit[m] "> <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> Bri"> Again, the federation risk is not relevant due to the servers not being able to read my messages. As long as my data is E2EE and it's up to me the encryption, all is good.
23:11:46 <jj1013[m]> <barfly21[m] "i didn't realize molly connects "> It does.
23:11:59 <jj1013[m]> > <@barfly21:matrix.org> i didn't realize molly connects to signal servers
23:11:59 <jj1013[m]>  * It does.
23:11:59 <jj1013[m]> It's Signal, hardened, AFAIK.
23:13:13 <jj1013[m]>  * It does.
23:13:13 <jj1013[m]> It's Signal, but it lets you lock your messages on your phone with an encryption password.
23:13:18 <jpds> barfly21[m]: Signal have a history was f-droid, they basically believe that the majority of people should be using the play store
23:13:42 <barfly21[m]> yea wtf is that about
23:14:02 <jpds> Just their way of thinking
23:14:09 <jj1013[m]> <jpds "barfly21: Signal have a history "> Due to criticism, they started to upload a non-Play Store APK on their website.
23:14:15 <j8bit[m]> <jj1013[m] "Again, the federation risk is no"> ok
23:14:18 <jj1013[m]> <jpds "Just their way of thinking"> Moxie.
23:16:32 <barfly21[m]> in my utopia play store would be gone, so im not sure how i can reconcile myself with their way of thinking
23:17:14 <barfly21[m]> it makes me not even want to use their servers if i can find a viable alternative for calls
23:17:43 <jpds> barfly21[m]: Then don't, noone's forcing you to do so
23:18:19 <barfly21[m]> yea just looking for the right alternative, will check out some suggestions mentioned above
23:19:00 <jpds> I run a private chat server for my friends, and realistically; people have to compromise and use different apps for different people
23:19:45 <barfly21[m]> honestly i just care about keeping in contact with 4-5 people (mostly family)
23:27:36 <Thatcher[m]> Make it easy for your family and yourself with signal or molly, especially if you're on Graphene
23:29:21 <souvlaki[m]> what's molly? new kind of messenger?
23:29:54 <jpds> Sou
23:30:06 <jpds> souvlaki[m]: It's an alternative client for Signal
23:30:35 <souvlaki[m]> never heard of this
23:33:27 <Thatcher[m]> https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android
23:37:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Please read this https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2017/papers/84.pdf
23:39:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: anyway don't try that against windows unless you want to cry
23:40:23 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: Ha ha! Okay XP.
23:40:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Windows has a separate counter that can ask the TPM to wipe the decryption key
23:40:45 <TheJollyRoger> Wow. I did not know that!
23:40:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then you'd need to find the recovery key to decrypt your data
23:41:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's called machine lockout threshold
23:41:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> In secpol.msc
23:41:54 <TheJollyRoger> Wow.
23:47:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: so
23:47:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> How long would it take to crack a 64 character password
23:48:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Assume it has a bit of everything
23:48:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> On the titan M obviously
23:48:40 <TheJollyRoger> Uh...
23:48:45 <TheJollyRoger> I'll have to get back to you on that.
23:49:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: idk I have like 120 character passwords
23:49:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm aware it's theater but I can remember such huge bs anyway
23:49:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> *flexes memory*
23:49:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hahaha damnnnnnn
23:49:53 <TheJollyRoger> You know you have good memory when your passwords are stronger than the keys they are derived into!
23:50:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
23:54:14 <cyniara> <anupritaisno1[m] "TheJollyRoger: idk I have like 1"> I used to have 700+ character password for FB (I don't use it anymore though). üòè
23:56:43 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Sounds about just enough
23:56:57 <Core6255> Lmao
23:57:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cyniara "I used to have 700+ character pa"> Plaintext though
