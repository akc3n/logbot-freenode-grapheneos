16:49:28 <FreeEagle> i'm still doing my research
16:49:32 <jj1013[m]> Oh. XRP. Best way would be to use the official wallet... I don't have knowledge of XRP.
16:49:43 <FreeEagle> '=D
16:55:12 <jj1013[m]> Well, guess I couldn't find any XRP wallet. Though I shall advise you to use a decentralized cryptocurrency. If you really have to use XRP, you may not be able to count on me ‚îÄ I always thought of XRP as a useless cryptocurrency. I may invite you to use a cryptocurrency such as Litecoin (Electrum-LTC, this is not Android!) or Nano (Nault for PC, Natrium for smartphones) if you only want to earn money, though
16:55:12 <jj1013[m]> Nano is going through tough times right now. They are having some spam. If you really want privacy, Monero (Feather Wallet for PC, Monerujo for Android) is the way. I am assuming right now you want light wallets, so I'm just mentioning the ones that worked best for me. I couldn't get Monerujo to work on my smartphone, however, so I don't know about this one.-

17:09:32 <FreeEagle> or taking any other measures or just strong passwor
17:16:23 <jj1013[m]> <FreeEagle "or taking any other measures or "> No. Use a hardware wallet such as Trezor or Ledger.
17:16:57 <jj1013[m]> Cryptocurrency philosophy states that if the keys are stored on a device that has been connected to the Internet, it's not safe.
17:18:49 <jj1013[m]> Trezor and Ledger solve this by mantaining the keys offline, even when you connect it to a computer. Instead of giving the keys to the computer, they sign the keys.
17:18:54 <jj1013[m]>  * Trezor and Ledger solve this by mantaining the keys offline, even when you connect it to a computer. Instead of giving the keys to the computer, they sign the transactions.
17:19:18 <jj1013[m]> You can check the HW Wallet to confirm or deny the transaction, so nothing goes through without your permission
17:22:30 <jj1013[m]> You can also set a lock password on the HW Wallet, just in case the device ends up in wrong hands... or if they don't have the chance to smack you with a club. If they do, they might be able to get the password out of you instead of trying to crack the device.
17:26:50 <FreeEagle> ok perfect will check both now
17:27:16 <FreeEagle> i think with me they will need more than a club to make me spell the password
17:27:17 <FreeEagle> :D

If you worry about side-channel attacks (and are
19:50:29 <Cliff[m]> willing to sacrifice some GPU/ASIC resistance) or if you are developing a software where side-channel attacks could be a problem (e.g. a server service that operates with KeePass database files), use Argon2id

20:02:06 <TheLoneWanderer[> <Cliff[m] "I used to have it on 2id, but af"> The newer keepass db format will use Argon2id by default. In fact, the authors recommend the use of Argon2id unless you have specific requirements

20:04:44 <blaqkbsd[m]> I'm new to this OS and the FAQ couldn't help me with some questions. I hope to find some answers in chat.
20:04:49 <blaqkbsd[m]> Does GrapheneOS have an option to change IMEI on user request or is this a fixed hw identifier? And Netguard still needed or internal firewall ? And another question: can I do attestation using my first (single) device via the attestation app remote server or do I need 2 pcs of hardware to validate one with another?
20:06:02 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Netguard is not needed, Network permission does the work better
20:06:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Attestation: you either remote attest your GrapheneOS phone
20:07:19 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Or you use a second Android phone to do the attestation
20:09:11 <blaqkbsd[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> Netguard is not needed, "> I like how Netguard works but I'm intending to install a VPN so Netguard has to go. Is the remaining firewall in Graphene any good?
20:10:10 <blaqkbsd[m]> Attestation: Great I just needed to have that confirmed so make sure I read the FAQ right. Thanks for your help.
20:10:41 <blaqkbsd[m]> I think when migrating to this new OS I should set up several user profiles. Not used to this on a phone. Must be an Android 10 thing (I'm still on a v8 phone now)
20:12:27 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> User profiles were introduced in Android KitKat 4.4.4 iirc
20:13:07 <blaqkbsd[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> User profiles were intro"> I never used them. Now I feel stupid üôÇ
20:13:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> You can direct whole your traffic through your VPN and you block the traffic that does not go through the VPN
20:13:49 <blaqkbsd[m]> I read Graphene decrypts every User profile so if my Whatsapp profile is compromised its hard to get to other profiles right
20:14:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Encrypts*?
20:14:32 <blaqkbsd[m]> Encrypts the homefolders of those user profiles, I thought I read that in FAQ
20:14:49 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> You can read about it here https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
20:15:10 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Yeah you just made a typo in your previous message, I suppose
20:15:11 <blaqkbsd[m]> I want to make one profile for work, one for crypto, one for chat, one for propriety stuff like Whatsapp
20:15:22 <blaqkbsd[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> You can read about it he"> Cool, thanks
20:15:34 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> üëç
20:15:48 <sb13x[m]> I've been trying to avoid WhatsApp since moving to gOS but trying to encourage everyone I know including colleagues etc to Signal is a loss, what's the best most isolated way to use it with notifications? Work Profile? Trying not to use a different profile as I fear living in it just for one app.
20:17:18 <blaqkbsd[m]> That is so hard! I am dealing with groups of people who are very hard to convince. I already hacked their previous server but now they changed from a web interface to some app (not in F-Droid or Aurora). They have the same mentality as Whatapp people... if it doesn't integrate with their Facebook its a problem. People are hard to convince
20:17:22 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Afaik, work profiles is not a thing neither in AOSP, nor GrapheneOS
20:17:45 <blaqkbsd[m]> My family says "Why must I install signal just for you"... and I wonder why must I install Whatapp just for them
20:17:59 <blaqkbsd[m]> Maybe there is some bridging software
20:18:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> You can bridge WhatsApp with Matrix
20:18:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> But you'd need to host the bot yourself
20:19:28 <blaqkbsd[m]> All I need is a VPS right or use matrix.org with a client (over VPN) for some bots
20:27:37 <Wonderfall[m]> <sb13x[m] "I've been trying to avoid WhatsA"> All apps are sandboxed as part of the AOSP security model. Make sure you don't give WhatsApp extra permissions it doesn't need.
20:28:17 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Afaik you can't fix the missing notifications
20:28:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> You better off complaining to WhatsApp devs to make notifications work
20:29:16 <blaqkbsd[m]> So user profiles ads no extra security? I thought I read different profiles are encrypted with a unique key. Mayhbe useful for separating banking/crypto from chat, apps, regular use. Maybe I am wrong
20:29:27 <Wonderfall[m]> I heard it works well, it has a websocket fallback like Signal for push
20:29:27 <Wonderfall[m]> (I don't use it myself, fortunately all my contacts are on Signal :) )
20:29:53 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Yes, they have a separate set of keys
20:30:05 <Wonderfall[m]> <blaqkbsd[m] "So user profiles ads no extra se"> It prevents some cases where apps can communicate with each other. But even that is very restricted on the same user profile
20:30:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Yes, this set of keys has a different key decryption key for each profile
20:31:54 <sb13x[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "It prevents some cases where app"> I've been using Shelter for the Work Profile so I can freeze certain apps for when I'm not using Tracker Control as the VPN.
20:31:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> But it doesn't make it harder for a malicious app to escape its sandbox
20:31:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> I think, I understood this part correctly)
20:32:11 <blaqkbsd[m]> Ok great. I'm ready to install this. What do you use as Firewall app (I'm a Netguard user) but thats not possible because I'm getting a VPN on the new phone
20:33:35 <akc3n[m]> Its built in.
20:33:40 <Wonderfall[m]> Keep in mind work profiles are here for convenience, not security
20:33:40 <Wonderfall[m]> Also if you want to prevent apps from exfiltrating data, use the network permission. It works better than a VPN app for that
20:33:57 <Wonderfall[m]> (but keep in mind apps can communicate at an API level too, so it's not 100% bulletproof)
20:34:13 <akc3n[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: https://grapheneos.org/faq#firewall
20:34:44 <blaqkbsd[m]> <akc3n[m] "Its built in."> Is it as good as Netguard with all the shine and detail? (I'm getting my pix next week so I am doing homework here)
20:34:59 <Wonderfall[m]> It's much better
20:35:01 <akc3n[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: in my past experience, and what worked for me to understand everything better was to read the FAQ several times over.
20:35:58 <Wonderfall[m]> Just use the build-in network permission, and use profiles if you want compartimentalisation
20:36:04 <Wonderfall[m]>  * Just use the build-in network permission, and use user profiles if you want compartimentalisation
20:36:10 <Wonderfall[m]>  * Just use the built-in network permission, and use user profiles if you want compartimentalisation
20:36:21 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Wonderfall, how are you?)
20:36:26 <blaqkbsd[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "It's much better"> I feel tingles everywhere hearing this. akc3n told me RTFM (the FAQ) in the main chat 3 times and here too but I read that already. Also the firewall part. The online documentation is not very satisfying though.
20:36:43 <Wonderfall[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> Wonderfall, how are you?"> Just passing by, going to prepare dinner :)
20:37:00 <blaqkbsd[m]> Maybe adding screenshots of unique menus to Graphene on the site will draw more people?
20:37:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> iirc, having larger user base is not the goal
20:37:56 <Cliff[m]> <TheLoneWanderer[ "The newer keepass db format will"> Source?
20:37:56 <Wonderfall[m]> It's just that Netguard is a very flawed solution for preventing an app to access Internet
20:38:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Ooo, what's for the dinner tonight?
20:38:52 <Wonderfall[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> Ooo, what's for the dinn"> Well I'm going to figure it out :)
20:40:01 <akc3n[m]> <blaqkbsd[m] "I feel tingles everywhere hearin"> I never once said to RTFM. Nor would I ever use a swear words in chat or in real life.
20:40:36 <blaqkbsd[m]> I'm sorry its just the expression I use with a smile. You are correct you never said that. Just pointed at the FAQ.
20:41:01 <blaqkbsd[m]> And you helped me with that other question in the general chat. Sorry didn't mean to be witty or rude
20:42:13 <akc3n[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=Netguard&chs=%23grapheneos&chs=%23grapheneos-offtopic&w=a
20:42:13 <blaqkbsd[m]> By the way we sometimes say RTFM means read the fine manual :)
20:45:08 <blaqkbsd[m]> I'm just excited getting my new phone that's all
20:52:05 <blaqkbsd[m]> On profiles. Documentation provided here in chat says it allows every profile to have their own VPN but when switching (leaving apps in background) those apps might be routed over a new VPN. This is contradicting. Does the new / main VPN take over connections from suspended apps after a profile switch?
20:53:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah, the info there might be a bit outdated
20:54:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you can search the logs to find a more up-to-date info on that one
20:56:37 <akc3n[m]> <blaqkbsd[m] "I feel tingles everywhere hearin"> A lot of care went into writing stuff in a way that it doesn't get misinterpreted. It explains how things work. Some sections are meant more for technical details and somewhat of an understanding of those topics.
21:03:35 <blaqkbsd[m]> akc3n I will try the logbot. Didn't know it was here
21:06:00 <blaqkbsd[m]> I read a little about Daniel and his thing with Copperhead. I totally support this guy. I don't know him but I recognize a corporate glowie in the shade when I see how that bigger team fight a small (but tech superior) OS like Graphene. Glowies in the shade made my life horrible and I know a million of good devs who went through similar shit. So supporting Daniel is a nobrainer for me

21:21:24 <blaqkbsd[m]> Just for the record: Brave Browser is not recommended in 2021 on this mobile platform?
21:22:26 <GhostSplinterSix> <blaqkbsd[m] "Just for the record: Brave Brows"> Vanadium and Bromite are recommended for GrapheneOS.
21:22:34 <akc3n[m]> Bromite as a secondary browser
21:24:03 <blaqkbsd[m]> Vanadium is more security leaning and Bromite more privacy leaning but the 2 projects are growing towards eachother? I should try this on Linux instead of my extremely tuned ESR (still better than stock Brave)
21:24:47 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Bromite for ad-blocking mostly, afaik
21:25:53 <GhostSplinterSix> Bromite provides integrated ad-blocking and more advanced anti-fingerprinting. For now, Vanadium is more focused on security hardening and Bromite is more focused on anti-fingerprinting. The projects are collaborating together and will likely converge to providing more of the same features.
