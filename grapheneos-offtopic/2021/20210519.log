00:34:43 <noobie62> Hello again
00:35:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> hello noobie
00:35:17 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> did you do your homework?
00:36:34 <noobie62> yeah, I chose graphene, but I ran into a roadblock installing it
00:37:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> good, let me help you
00:37:10 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> what's your problem?
00:39:32 <noobie62> First the technical details, I'm installing on a Pixel 3a using Windows
00:40:09 <noobie62> I already unlocked the bootloader and reenabled usb debugging
00:40:36 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah, you're definitely doing it wrong
00:40:49 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> are you watching a youtube guide or smth?
00:45:03 <noobie62> I'm using the website guide, but I actually started using the lineageos guide. I assumed it didn't matter since both have similar instructions to get fastboot and use it to unlock the bootloader
00:45:30 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i see
00:45:36 <noobie62> THis for reference: https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/sargo/install
00:45:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> well that's completely wrong
00:45:42 <noobie62> oof
00:45:47 <akc3n> LOL COMPLETELY WRONG!
00:46:25 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> noobie62: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
00:46:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> do not follow anything else except this guide
00:47:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> LineageOS installation is simply different, it does not apply
00:47:44 <noobie62> So what do I do if the buttons don't work?
00:48:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> what error messages do they return?
00:49:07 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> akc3n, yeah, i am not using the most accurate words all the time XD
00:58:12 <noobie62> Simply nothing, they're unselectable
00:58:35 <noobie62> I'm going to try relocking the bootloader and starting from step 1
00:59:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> noobie62: does your windows PC come with USB-C port??
00:59:50 <noobie62> no ._.'
01:00:10 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> ok, do you have another Android phone with USB-C port?
01:10:06 <noobie62> Yes, what does that entail?
01:10:34 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you can just use it instead of your windows pc
01:10:40 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> for the installation
01:10:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> which Android phone is that?
01:11:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Hulk: Unless his desktop computer's USB ports suck (since USB A ports often do) he doesn't need a USB C port
01:12:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Unless I'm missing something
01:14:58 <noobie62> AENRGJHESJSRTLJNERSLBJNRTNB THE PROBLEM WAS FIREFOX
01:16:14 <noobie62> so the buttons work in Edge, gonna keep working
01:16:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> noobie62: Yep, don't use Firefox, as they refuse to implement WebUSB
01:17:14 <noobie62> technologys wack sometimes
01:18:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Don't be edgy
01:18:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> be brave
01:41:54 <noobie62> it's happening!!
01:43:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Railgun_Lover, I prefer people using USB-C ports because most USB C-to-A cables suck
01:44:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Also some folks were assuming that they could do the flashing by using USB 2.0 (facepalm)
01:56:09 <noobie62> And now I have a phone! :D  tysm!
02:22:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> noobie62: nice
02:22:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> Also some folks were ass"> wait why not? Is it because of incompatible firmware?
02:38:59 <noobie6285> huh
02:45:07 <noobie6285> can I remove the "different operating system" notice or is this normal?
02:57:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <noobie6285 "can I remove the "different oper"> This has been explained many times, please search logs
03:58:55 <tkennedy365[m]> Hey hey
03:59:05 <tkennedy365[m]> What Linux distros do you guys run? And why?
03:59:24 <Baobab> I run gentoo because I'm held hostage
04:00:11 <Baobab> I can't seem to find another distro that fits my needs.
04:01:33 <tkennedy365[m]> Ooh what's gentoo like?
04:01:46 <tkennedy365[m]> What's the use case?
04:01:56 <Baobab> I use gentoo for everything
04:02:58 <tkennedy365[m]> Oh okay, is it Debian based?
04:03:41 <Baobab> No, it's an independent distro.
04:04:14 <tkennedy365[m]> Also, thoughts on MX Linux, Fedora, and Manjaro as daily drivers? Do they each have a good reputation?
04:04:23 <tkennedy365[m]> <Baobab "No, it's an independent distro."> Oh really? I'm going to go check it out then
04:04:43 <Baobab> tkennedy365[m], it isn't for everyone.
04:05:11 <Baobab> if you don't care for portage, alpine is also good
04:05:32 <tkennedy365[m]> <Baobab "tkennedy365, it isn't for everyo"> Oh alright
04:05:43 <Baobab> I run a very strange setup.
04:06:19 <Baobab> which requires portage
04:07:01 <tkennedy365[m]> Oh okay then, I'm looking at alpine now as well
04:07:30 <Baobab> the thing with alpine is that they support zfs out of the box
04:08:44 <Baobab> Plus I'm very biased torwards Musl.
04:09:28 <tkennedy365[m]> What's zfs?
04:10:36 <Baobab> It stands for zettabyte file system.
04:10:56 <tkennedy365[m]> Oh okay
05:33:01 <akc3n[m]> <tkennedy365[m] "What Linux distros do you guys r"> Opsec wise and depending on threat model, in general, it's not something people may reveal.
05:33:20 <akc3n[m]> From what I hear... ðŸ¤“
05:45:17 <Baobab> What does telling the distro you use have to do with threat modeling?
06:18:07 <TheExplorer[m]> <ypm[m] "just make sure to use the upstre"> Yea that's what I do, thanks !
06:43:30 <stencil[m]> What's the thought about void switching to openssl. They explained it well imo, but it was one of it's marketing features
06:58:22 <Telegram-Bridge> !Alice has joined the Telegram Group!
07:38:42 <strcat[m]> stencil: LibreSSL isn't a substantial improvement over OpenSSL and doesn't have 100% compatibility so it requires work to use i
07:39:03 <strcat[m]> if you're going to put in work to modernize code you should be using BoringSSL which is substantially stripped down and more secure, with more modern / safer APIs
07:39:18 <strcat[m]> requires having the resources to actually actively maintain the software though
07:40:24 <strcat[m]> too much functionality (including security improvements) missing from LibreSSL now since it diverged from OpenSSL
10:51:26 <trismous[m]> is hardware 2fa (like Nitrokey) worth the hassle and money?
10:53:17 <joromonni[m]> I don't have one but I think it would be worth at least  trying it.
10:57:52 <man[m]> <trismous[m] "is hardware 2fa (like Nitrokey) "> its secure but its very easy to lose
10:58:09 <man[m]> i would keep using otp
10:59:18 <trismous[m]> alright, thanks. I'll stick with otp for now and maybe try the Nitrokey later
11:24:13 <man[m]> No problem. Good luck

12:32:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Baobab, this was sent a few days already
12:32:38 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Mods and devs are notified about the issue
12:32:46 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> yes?
12:33:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> my bad, not all mods/devs were notified
12:34:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> I've been having some problems irl
12:34:26 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> on top of that there's also a cyclone going on here rn
12:34:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> so what did I miss?
12:34:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Freenode troubles that is
12:35:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> i do miss my mango tree which died during the cyclone
12:35:25 <GhostSplinterSix> <Telegram-Bridge "<clannad> on top of that there's"> I hope all is okay!
12:36:14 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> it isn't
12:36:25 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> huge damages everywhere and power cuts too
12:36:33 <Baobab> There's also this: https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409
12:37:00 <Baobab> I can't verify if it's a good source or not though.
12:37:05 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> understood
12:37:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> :c
12:37:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> i will talk with the teleirc admins and perform the migration for the bot
12:39:07 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> Gabe check docs for the bot
12:39:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <câ€‹lannad> i'm going to go and ask the teleirc devs
12:42:39 <Erraverunt> Hmm, has the recent troubles of freenode network been discussed here and are just-in-case plans put into operation if shit hits fan to move graphene channels to another (irc)network?
12:44:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Gabe> Don't believe there will be any friction by changing networks. It's just changing freenode hostname to the new one.
12:46:17 <Erraverunt> I was just made aware of the situation and need to read more but seems kinda like hostile takeover.
12:50:36 <stencil[m]> *important: https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cryptographic-attestation-of-personhood/

13:42:37 <tasanox[m]> I live in Sweden and it blows my mind that we have an app called BankID that can transfer money and stuff, but you can't use it as real ID to buy cigarettes. Truly astounding logic there
16:06:58 <globbot> channel logging requested by strcat: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos-offtopic
16:07:13 <strcat> inviting back the bot since kicking it removed the old logs
16:07:20 <strcat> this restores it
16:10:09 <GhostSplinterSix> I appreciate you doing all of this.
16:23:59 <valldrac> strcat: do you plan to re-open the channels in another IRC network?
16:29:03 <strcat[m]> valldrac: we're likely just moving to Matrix completely
16:29:05 <strcat[m]> recommend joining the Matrix rooms
16:29:27 <strcat[m]> the Matrix <-> IRC bridge is super problematic and makes things a lot worse in the Matrix room because it kicks users who don't post a message for 30+ days
16:29:34 <strcat[m]> so the community shrinks based on people getting kicked
16:29:42 <strcat[m]> they have to keep rejoining every month to lurk in the channel
16:29:49 <strcat[m]> not how Matrix is really supposed to work
16:29:57 <strcat[m]> we're going to bridge Telegram to the Matrix room directly
16:30:06 <valldrac> strcat[m]: agree, but it's sad to have to leave IRC
16:30:14 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to make a bridge from an IRC channel but we're definitely not using the same kind of bridge as before
16:30:25 <strcat[m]> probably just 1 IRC user representing the bridge which would be a lot more lossy
16:30:32 <strcat[m]> valldrac: freenode is screwed up though
16:30:43 <strcat[m]> we have a channel reserved on oftc but I'd rather just have everyone move to Matrix
16:30:53 <strcat[m]> rather than some people moving to oftc and needing a bridge to there
16:30:59 <strcat[m]> I think the bridge slows down the channel a lot too
16:31:23 <valldrac> strcat[m]: I was thinking on moving Molly to OFTC too... still undecided
16:31:40 <valldrac> Maybe they deploy a better bot
16:32:00 <strcat[m]> valldrac: the bridge is run by matrix.org
16:32:12 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc
16:32:27 <strcat[m]> it's possible to host your own and disable the kicking but you need an arrangement with the IRC server to permit you to make a huge number of connections
16:33:41 <valldrac> strcat[m]: that's the point, not sure what side the problem is
16:37:19 <strcat[m]> @room please join #grapheneos:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org, we're replacing the old rooms
16:42:58 <ForeverNoob[m]> You should @room once more for good measure :p
16:44:34 <strcat[m]> you can leave this room after you join the new one :P
16:44:40 <strcat[m]> I'll probably tombstone it eventually
16:45:10 <strcat[m]> just want people who are confused to be able to ask questions etc. so they understand they need to join the new one
16:45:16 <strcat[m]> not every client will handle a tombstone well
16:49:04 <TheLoneWanderer[> strcat using an emoticon? That's unexpected
16:50:22 <ForeverNoob[m]> :D
16:50:42 <ForeverNoob[m]> I think I was in both of the new rooms after the first notification.
16:50:58 <ForeverNoob[m]> but I'll stick around here just in case lol
18:12:33 <hypokeimenon[m]> The Lone Wanderer: Not really, they do it all the time.
18:19:45 <strcat[m]> @room if your Matrix client is bugged and caching the old aliases you can use these:

21:37:59 <strcat[m]> @room please migrate to the new channels #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org (the old aliases without -new were also moved to the new channels, but some home servers seem to cache those...)
