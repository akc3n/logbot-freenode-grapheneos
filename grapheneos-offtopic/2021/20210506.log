00:00:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> Not true. Previous sim change involved same number, and that device lost all secret chats
00:00:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Secret chats are lost when switching from one telegram client to the other
00:00:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Like when you're trying to migrate from one device to another
00:01:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> OK, in first instance was iOS to ios. Lost secret chats. In this instance iOS to gos, iOS retained secret chats sans sim
00:02:04 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> All same number
00:02:23 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> You have misunderstanding of how it works
00:02:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> I'm sure I do
00:02:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Look, your telegram account is not tied to your SIM card
00:03:06 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Again, it's only used for account creation and authentication
00:03:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> But I don't get it. I've lost all "secret chat" every time until now
00:03:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> You can have telegram on a phone with no SIM at all
00:04:00 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> By using a separate phone to get the SMS for authentification
00:04:24 <m1tr4[m]> How is non secret chats with Telegram? Is it secure? Can like gov tap in?
00:04:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> I know that. But, again having "secret chat" has, in past, depended entirely upon sim presence,
00:04:48 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> Yes is on servers
00:04:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Now, when it comes to secret chats, secret chats are not backed up to telegram servers
00:05:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> So if you delete your secret chat on your device, it's gone
00:05:31 <m1tr4[m]> Do they disclose Telegram conversations if asked by gov? Everyone says Telegram is so secure and nobody I know uses Signal.
00:05:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> If lose your device, it's gone
00:05:52 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> That is what I'm saying. Now sinless iOS has retained secret chats even after having manually deleted prior to sim swap
00:06:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> Simless
00:06:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> If you delete telegram from your phone, and then reinstall it, secret chats are gone
00:07:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Are you sure that those were the secret chats, and not the regular chats?
00:07:59 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> Sure, but my gripe is this: tele cannot provide e2e for non sim devices, and now I can run simultaneous "secret chats" on two devices, one simless
00:08:16 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> 100%
00:08:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Yes, you can have secret chats on simless devices
00:08:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> If you have two phones, you can have two separate sets of secret chats
00:09:03 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> How? No one I know without telegram on sim phone can use secret chat
00:09:16 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> I cannot even invite them
00:09:18 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Again, their tied only to the device and the client
00:10:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Privateer Monkey> I have telegram on like 50 devices. Has always been the case that only the device with sim can do e2e
00:10:29 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Check pm
00:19:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> m1tr4[m]: I would say, use Signal
00:19:29 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> But telegram is really handy for non essential things
00:20:12 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Also, much easier to read GrapheneOS chat rooms on telegram then on matrix imho
00:21:57 <Wonderfall[m]> For some reason the main channel is very slow to get messages from for me, but not others. Might be the fact that I'm running my own instance (on gVisor), but it doesn't show any other issue. Perhaps matrix[.]org homeserver is slow itself

09:39:35 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> are you looking for a laptop?
09:40:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> No, a tablet.
09:41:40 <hypokeimenon[m]> I am aware that best practice is to stick with the iPad line if that sort of thing is needed.
09:41:42 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> afaik, the most secure tablets are iPads
09:42:43 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Microsoft Surface's are also great in terms of security
09:43:23 <hypokeimenon[m]> An android tablet.
09:44:25 <hypokeimenon[m]> I guess you could run some Android apps on a Qualcomm ChromeOS 2-in-1..
09:44:32 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> there is none that would come close to the security of iPad or Surface afaik
09:45:46 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, chromebook are also great at security

09:49:00 <EV-9600[m]> According to Graphene's homepage: "improvements to sandboxing, exploit mitigations and the permission model."
09:49:00 <EV-9600[m]> Isn't the permission model a type of sandboxing technique?
09:50:05 <hypokeimenon[m]>  * I guess you could run some Android apps on a Qualcomm ChromeOS 2-in-1..
09:50:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> EDIT: Nevermind. Qualcomm-SoC Chromebooks are not on the Android compatible list https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps
09:50:56 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> why would you want to have specifically android on a tablet?
09:51:07 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you can run Android apps on chromOS
09:53:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> No specific reason. I am curious as to whether there are good options.
09:55:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i see

21:49:16 <jesqow[m]> - it said the f-droid app may be out of date, how do I trigger an update? The settings say that updates are fetches automatically..
21:49:16 <jesqow[m]> - Is updating the repos the same as updating the app? If not, how do i trigger the repo update?

21:57:48 <akc3n[m]> jesqow: Sometimes, you have to go into F-Droid -> Settings -> My Apps Section -> Repositories -> Toggle the F-Droid Repo off, wait 15 seconds, toggle it back on, then go back to Updates, and swipe from the top down, to reinitialize repository updates.

22:35:05 <jesqow[m]> <akc3n[m] "jesqow: just personal choice. If"> Thanks, much appreciated!
22:36:40 <akc3n[m]> jesqow: you are very welcome
22:37:39 <skwisgaar[m]> Worth noting that madaidan recommends recommends Aegis for 2FA. A security researcher he knows (who I believe is in here) analyzed the code and wrote a report on it.
22:38:37 <trail_undergroun> Is Aegis for Android only?

22:39:02 <ramenweekend[m]> jesqow asking the good questions. As for me, I want my podcasts üòÇ any help would be appreciated akc3n
22:39:43 <akc3n[m]> ramenweekend: I'll get back to you shortly. Just on hold on home telephone line with bank ATM.
22:42:25 <jesqow[m]> <ramenweekend[m] "jesqow asking the good questions"> Maybe here's another one: do i really need to lock my 2FA with another password/biometric?

22:42:57 <jesqow[m]> Maybe here's another one: do i really need to lock my 2FA app with another password/biometric?
22:43:38 <ramenweekend[m]> That question will sit rattling in my head for a few hours jesqow
22:45:44 <akc3n[m]> <jesqow[m] "Maybe here's another one: do i r"> That's just it... Why? IMHO and in my experience, what works for me and solves the issue is GrapheneOS security lock. I use biometrics on secondary profile. And if I must, I can quickly end session.
22:46:06 <covid-1984[m]> <jesqow[m] "Maybe here's another one: do i r"> Maybe it should be your phone pin - so you don't have to store your password for your OTP app in your password manager (since it sounds like you're not wanting to have OTP & passwords together)
22:46:50 <covid-1984[m]> I'm not saying that is the most optimal, security-wise... (Obviously unique passwords are best.)
22:52:49 <ramenweekend[m]> How do you guys not go down the rabbit hole of wanting to FIDO everything?
22:55:34 <flawedworld[m]> <ramenweekend[m] "How do you guys not go down the "> bold of you to assume i havent
22:55:38 <flawedworld[m]> ;)
23:01:38 <akc3n[m]> <ramenweekend[m] "jesqow asking the good questions"> Hi ramenweekend was a bit tied up with a few questions in que from a couple different users pm's. I personally don't listen to podcasts, nor do I have any experience what so ever in the subject. There is far more qualified people here with experience to answer your question about podcasts.
23:23:15 <lackshan[m]> ramenweekend Easy to not go down the rabbithole when fido needs Play Services üòõ
23:35:12 <covid-1984[m]> Tnx for saving me that research
23:52:36 <strcat[m]> lackshan: apps *can* implement it without Play services
23:52:43 <strcat[m]> but since Play services has a library for it they tend to use that
23:52:53 <strcat[m]> we need to make a Vanadium implementation without that
23:57:14 <lackshan[m]> strcat Oh that's good to know. I'd be happy to help test it  if needed.
23:59:53 <covid-1984[m]> Maybe of interest here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27069036
