01:32:49 <strcat[m]> @room We're migrating to upgraded Matrix rooms without a bridge to freenode: #grapheneos:grapheneos.org #grapheneos-offtopic:grapheneos.org . Please join the new rooms and you can leave these legacy ones to stop being bothered by pings.

03:52:51 <strcat> This room will continue to the exist for the time being but we're fully migrating to Matrix without a bridge to freenode: #grapheneos:grapheneos.org #grapheneos-offtopic:grapheneos.org.
03:52:53 <strcat> We reserved #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat but it won't be bridged the same way. We'll make a bridge via a leaner bot with a single user on both sides.
03:52:55 <strcat> After you move to the new Matrix rooms you can leave these ones. There will be nothing other than spam here.

14:45:46 <aleeeeeeex> Hi there
14:48:09 <aleeeeeeex> Need help with the installation
14:49:21 <aleeeeeeex> When I try to execute flash-all.bat it open and close automatically
14:49:37 <aleeeeeeex> The bootloader its unlocked
14:49:37 <strcat> aleeeeeeex: this is just the offtopic channel
14:49:51 <strcat> you should go to the Matrix rooms (or libera.chat if you insist on using IRC)
14:49:59 <strcat> these channels are dead, we don't use freenode anymore
