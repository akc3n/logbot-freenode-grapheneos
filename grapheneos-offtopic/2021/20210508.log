00:12:08 <taabcndefodvgkry> Should I remove my sim card before flashing stock rom
00:46:26 <Pratyush[m]> <taabcndefodvgkry "Should I remove my sim card befo"> no
00:47:41 <taabcndefodvgkry> Why would my phone not connect in fastboot mode?
00:48:14 <taabcndefodvgkry> If it's not the port or cable
00:48:23 <strcat[m]> bad USB connection, or not following the instructions on either udev (on the supported desktop Linux distributions) or driver install on Windows
00:48:25 <strcat[m]> it's all covered there
00:48:31 <strcat[m]> it's unlikely it's anything not covered there
00:49:15 <taabcndefodvgkry> <strcat[m] "bad USB connection, or not follo"> udev?
00:49:20 <taabcndefodvgkry> It is not the cable
00:49:23 <strcat[m]> it's all covered there
00:49:30 <strcat[m]> how do you know it's not the port or cable?
00:49:44 <strcat[m]> if it's the cable that comes with the phone it's probably not the cable but it could easily be the port or USB drivers
00:49:47 <strcat[m]> you don't say what you're using
00:49:47 <taabcndefodvgkry> <strcat[m] "how do you know it's not the por"> Because adb worked with same port and cable on different phone
00:49:51 <strcat[m]> you don't say the OS, or the device model
00:49:57 <strcat[m]> taabcndefodvgkryhz: doesn't mean it works properly
00:50:10 <taabcndefodvgkry> pixel 4a running graphene, macbook pro on macos
00:50:14 <strcat[m]> that's just not how USB works, it can be broken and still mostly work with one device but not another
00:50:19 <strcat[m]> taabcndefodvgkryhz: use the cable that comes with the phone
00:50:36 <taabcndefodvgkry> I have tried the cable that comes with the phone, plus two others
00:50:40 <strcat[m]> it's probably the cable, or the port, flip it over and plug it into a different port, make sure it's snug, make sure there's no dirt
00:51:03 <strcat[m]> use one that comes with phone too
00:51:19 <taabcndefodvgkry> I tried both ports with all three cables
00:51:26 <strcat[m]> and make sure the phone is booted into bootloader interface (fastboot mode)
00:51:35 <strcat[m]> make sure adb is not running too
00:51:50 <strcat[m]> adb starts a service that runs in the background and can / will screw up trying to flash
00:51:54 <taabcndefodvgkry> "device state: locked" is not a problem, correct?
00:51:55 <strcat[m]> reboot computer
00:52:02 <strcat[m]> taabcndefodvgkryhz: that's supposed to be that way
00:52:04 <strcat[m]> before you unlock
00:52:15 <taabcndefodvgkry> ok that's what I thought
00:57:50 <taabcndefodvgkry> still not working
00:57:56 <taabcndefodvgkry> just restarted computer
01:04:36 <taabcndefodvgkry> Fuck. Super frustrated as I need a phone that can do GSF ASAP. Really appreciate the help @strcat but I think the phone might be screwed up.
01:05:42 <strcat[m]> flash it from another phone
01:05:45 <strcat[m]> instead of your computer
01:05:51 <strcat[m]> you can flash it from another Android phone
01:06:04 <taabcndefodvgkry> How?
01:06:20 <taabcndefodvgkry> The guide requires a computer right
01:07:42 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
01:07:55 <strcat[m]> you could also try the web installer on your laptop
01:08:01 <strcat[m]> make sure to reboot so you are sure adb isn't running too
01:08:55 <taabcndefodvgkry> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/install/w"> That is only for installing graphene though, right?
01:09:01 <taabcndefodvgkry> I want to flash stock rom
01:09:33 <strcat[m]> use the flash button at https://developers.google.com/android/images
01:09:43 <taabcndefodvgkry> <strcat[m] "use the flash button at https://"> That requires adb
01:12:14 <strcat[m]> no
01:14:06 <taabcndefodvgkry> strcat: that method isnt working as my phone doesnt connect in fastboot
01:19:01 <taabcndefodvgkry> strcat: I was in an accident a couple weeks ago in which my phone was slightly bent. I have had no issues whatsoever since then; that accident wouldn't be causing this, right?
01:35:48 <taabcndefodvgkry> I guess I will just buy a new phone
01:35:59 <taabcndefodvgkry> How unfortunate
01:36:31 <taabcndefodvgkry> Would anyone here buy my slightly bent Pixel 4a?

03:29:20 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Hello all, GrapheneOS needs testers. If you can test, maybe spare even a few minutes, please message anupritaisno1 so he can give you further instructions.
03:50:10 <dnull> Railgun_Lover[m]: Where is it on the website?
03:50:44 <dnull> Otherwise, why should we trust a random user suggesting another random user?
03:51:48 <sphinx[m]> anu is not a random user
03:52:08 <dnull> They are to me.
03:52:48 <GhostSplinterSix> Anu is a moderator.
03:52:55 <dnull> And?
03:53:01 <dnull> It's irc.
03:53:21 <dnull> Or discord, or telegram. Whatever.
03:53:26 <GhostSplinterSix> You must be new here...
03:53:38 <dnull> Not really.
03:53:51 <dnull> Yet my point still stands.
03:54:03 <GhostSplinterSix> Then you'd be familiar with who that is.
03:54:09 <dnull> Why does someone else need to announce it?
03:54:19 <dnull> I am.
03:54:33 <dnull> Yet my point still stands.
03:54:51 <GhostSplinterSix> If you're familiar with them, how are they a random user?
03:55:23 <dnull> Because some random user advertised it.
03:55:42 <dnull> And if they needed testers, why not put it on the website?
03:56:02 <dnull> I dunno, maybe /testers?
03:56:30 <GhostSplinterSix> Neither person would be a random user to you if you aren't new here.
03:56:39 <dnull> ok
04:02:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> dnull: what kind of ridiculous argument is this
04:02:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Lol
04:02:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Don't be so cynical
04:03:08 <GhostSplinterSix> They just want to be difficult.üòÜ
04:03:19 <dnull> It's not an argument. It was a question.
04:03:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> dnull: if you look through the logs you'll see that anu is a moderator and developer
04:03:54 <dnull> And healthy paranoia should be expected.
04:04:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Not sure any paranoia is healthy, but let's roll with it
04:04:18 <dnull> I know who they are.
04:04:22 <GhostSplinterSix> <Railgun_Lover[m] "dnull: if you look through the l"> He knows. He's not new. ü§≠
04:04:44 <dnull> My question is why are you advertising it and not the devs?
04:05:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> dnull Just chill out
04:05:07 <dnull> But ok
04:05:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> dnull: no need to do suspicious
04:05:30 <dnull> Ok
04:05:31 <GhostSplinterSix> How do you know they aren't a dev?
04:05:35 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * dnull: no need to be suspicious
04:05:45 <dnull> How do you know they are?
04:05:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Lmao what has happened here
04:06:21 <GhostSplinterSix> You tell me. You aren't new.
04:06:28 <dnull> Always a need to be suspicious, otherwise we wouldn't use Graphene.
04:06:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> GhostSplinterSix: not a developer
04:06:47 <GhostSplinterSix> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Lmao what has happened here"> I'm feeding into his difficulty. ü§ì
04:06:47 <dnull> Just use stock right?
04:06:55 <GhostSplinterSix> <Railgun_Lover[m] "GhostSplinterSix: not a develope"> Lol I know
04:07:12 <Railgun_Lover[m]> GhostSplinterSix: I know but also saying it to clarify to others
04:07:24 <GhostSplinterSix> ü§úüèªü§õüèª
04:07:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Aight I think that's enough derailing of the chat for one lifetime
04:08:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> üôÉ
04:08:23 <GhostSplinterSix> üòÜ
04:11:08 <dnull> My apologies if you thought I was being difficult. I wasn't. Just chat systems are easy to spoof so trying for a chain of trust.
04:11:38 <dnull> All I meant by it.
07:36:34 <kayront> i installed grapheneos recently and things have been working more or less smoothly (what hasn't is basically android 11 specific stuff), but one thing is killing me. so far i had always-on vpn and blocking connections outside the vpn because i have not found the famed "firewall" yet (supposedly it had at least equivalent functionality to afwall, but so far i have only found an "allow/deny network" toggle for individual apps)
07:37:41 <kayront> so anyway, after realizing that the "block connections when VPN is not on" does not respect route exceptions in the openvpn app (I have services in other VLANs here that I need to access while the VPN is on), i disabled the always-on and only-through-vpn in settings->network&internet->advanced->vpn
07:38:19 <kayront> great, can connect to the services here as well, but now openvpn disconnects shortly after screen goes dark. battery optimization, I thought. so I disabled it, but still the same problem
07:38:31 <strcat[m]> blocking connections not via VPN works fine with properly done exceptions in a VPN app
07:38:52 <strcat[m]> don't understand what isn't working for you or what other functionality you expect
07:39:01 <strcat[m]> the FAQ and features page explains why things are the way they are
07:39:23 <strcat[m]> we don't do features that can be bypassed / don't work
07:41:02 <strcat[m]> finer-grained filtering doesn't work due to how DNS works, due to interprocess communication and more realities of networking
07:41:21 <strcat[m]> the network toggles needs further enforcement in apps and that's a hard enough sell
07:41:42 <strcat[m]>  * the network toggle needs further enforcement in apps and that's a hard enough sell
07:41:58 <kayront> i've had the openvpn profile configured like this for years, i just exported it to the new phone. in the ROUTING tab of the profile in the openvpn app, in "Excluded Networks", i have the broadest possible network/cidr for my setup - which again, has always worked. if i try to connect to local services if "block connections without VPN" (in settings, as above) is toggled, then it immediately fails with "permission denied"
07:42:59 <strcat[m]> and were you blocking all connections not via the VPN on the other phone?
07:43:05 <strcat[m]> that's not a GrapheneOS feature
07:43:17 <kayront> nope, in the other i did not have the always on vpn - i trusted the firewall :p
07:43:37 <kayront> but without the exception in the openvpn app, connecting to my services wouldn't work, the packets would get routed over the tunnel
07:44:21 <strcat[m]> sounds like the OpenVPN app you're using may not implement it properly
07:44:26 <strcat[m]> recommend reporting it to them
07:44:31 <strcat[m]> we don't change how this functionality works
07:44:38 <kayront> and in the new one, the fact that it immediately says "permission denied" leads me to think the exception is being respected, because it correctly recognizes that it's "going around" the VPN .. but I expected the exception to be honored, as it was explicitly configured
07:45:00 <strcat[m]> in the app, not in GrapheneOS, seems the app is doing something wrong
07:45:06 <strcat[m]> suggest using a different app or reporting it to them
07:45:13 <strcat[m]> I doubt it works differently for us than AOSP/GrapheneOS
07:45:27 <kayront> agreed
07:45:40 <strcat[m]>  * I doubt it works differently for us than AOSP or the stock OS
07:45:54 <strcat[m]> the VPN app can send the traffic where it wants
07:45:56 <kayront> and about the vpn disconnecting when screen goes off, any insight? only thing i could think off is batt optimization, which i've already disabled but the problem persists
07:46:06 <strcat[m]> blocking connections not going through the VPN doesn't restrict what the VPN app can do
07:46:23 <strcat[m]> it just means that if the app crashes, the service is provides is down, etc. the OS drops the traffic instead of bypassing it
07:46:49 <strcat[m]> kayront: sounds like this app is quite buggy
07:47:00 <strcat[m]> we don't do anything in these regards differently than the stock OS
07:47:06 <stencil[m]> strcat: why don't you use quotes, the message history gets confusing
07:47:13 <kayront> it's openvpn for android
07:47:21 <kayront> probably android 11 related problems then
07:47:26 <strcat[m]> we enable the standard auto-power modes and app compaction / freezing like the stock OS
07:48:19 <strcat[m]> stencil: I want my messages to be readable on IRC
07:48:37 <strcat[m]> don't really see what's confusing
07:49:04 <strcat[m]> I would only quote something I was replying to from much earlier
07:49:42 <kayront> strcat[m]: can you recommend a vpn app that works well iye? maybe time to try wireguard?
07:50:40 <strcat[m]> wireguard app works really well
07:50:48 <strcat[m]> built-in IPSec support works really well
07:51:11 <strcat[m]> kayront: that openvpn for android app has always been sketchy
07:51:17 <strcat[m]> there's another popular open source one iirc
07:51:36 <stencil[m]> Yeah use
07:51:36 <stencil[m]> >  Message someone said
07:51:41 <strcat[m]> kayront: it could be that it's incompatible with modern Android, I really don't think we change anything that is relevant to it
07:51:45 <stencil[m]> Use the />
07:51:56 <strcat[m]> stencil: I don't really see the point when it was just said
07:52:26 <strcat[m]> and that's not a proper structured Matrix quote for messages in the channel
07:52:34 <strcat[m]> which is what I would use if I was replying to something from a while ago
07:52:43 <strcat[m]> I don't really understand what you want me to do and why
07:53:14 <stencil[m]> Like your answering above, and in the middle the other person asks a different but related question
07:53:50 <kayront> sure strcat[m], i'll try wireguard and see where it takes me. it should support that excluded network(s) setting I need too

08:09:16 <sign4l[m]> What is the best FIDO2 solution for Google Pixle Hardware and GrapheneOS?
08:15:46 <strcat[m]> we'll probably just end up implementing our own via StrongBox keystore
08:15:50 <strcat[m]> for Vanadium
08:35:00 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Are you bradgarlinghaouse?
08:57:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <s‚Äãurfhard> Yeah üòÖ
09:01:36 <M1blob0-1[m]> is it worth to buy a pixel 4a new or second hand  ?   new = $420 / ¬£299   / second hand = $210 / ¬£150.  The only downsides i can think off buying the second hand is the possibility of faults or potentially being blocked by the og owner.   But if plan to use it as a wifi phone only then blocking is hardly going to effect it .
09:09:07 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you don't really know if it's OEM unlockable
09:09:37 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and if that's gonna be the case, you won't be able to install GrapheneOS on it
09:10:13 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> taabcndefodvgkry is selling his pixel 4a with GrapheneOS already installed, check the logs
09:13:51 <M1blob0-1[m]> so what determines wether it oem unlockable.  ? is it wether its a plain pixel or a carrier branded one ?
09:16:20 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, that's about right
09:16:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> some carrier locked phones cannot be OEM unlocked
09:18:32 <M1blob0-1[m]> Thanks for the heads up i will be sure to scrutinize these finer details.
09:30:34 <tharg[m]> Hello world! Is this the right place to ask about recommended app stores (eg f-droid)?
09:30:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yes, this is ok to ask here, welcome!
09:31:38 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> if you want some apps from Google Play Store, you can use Aurora

09:41:52 <M1blob0-1[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<!Hulk> you don't really know if"> So to confirm  buying it brand new from shop. ( outside a of carrier ) means it would definetly be oem unlockable ?  where as second hand is not guranteed and would need to be checked on the device.
09:42:29 <Telegram-Bridge> <x‚Äãiomarvonfrankfuhrt> I was informed that this is a good place to ask. Or perhaps someone could link me to relevant articles discussing the capabilities of Intel's Management Engine.
09:42:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> buying new from Google store - 100% OEM unlockable
09:43:09 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and yes, you can't be sure about OEM unlockability when buying second hand

09:46:29 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> afaik, there are a lot of people spreading FUD regarding Intel Management Engine
09:46:51 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> when in reality you can somewhat compare its importance as Titan M on Pixels
09:48:08 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> I'm not knowledgeable enough to answer this question accurately, but long story short, IME is important if you want to build a secure desktop environment
09:49:33 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Moof> Only if you want to use secure boot with windows though, no?
09:49:55 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> yeah i don't know this far

10:13:39 <EV-9600[m]> It doesn't matter what you try to do, if you use libreboot.org, then people will disqualify your statement
10:18:43 <somenerd[m]> that's not what happened here
10:18:54 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> the article by libreboot.org states "The ME is a threat to freedom, security, and privacy, and the libreboot project strongly recommends avoiding it entirely."

10:24:41 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> on a similar topic, did you know that Titan M is not open?
10:25:01 <somenerd[m]> yeah, it isn't
10:25:13 <EV-9600[m]> You simply provided a link with information and without even considering anything else, they downgraded what you were trying to say
10:25:14 <somenerd[m]> I believe that the firmware is open (not sure about this though)

15:24:21 <djentosaurus[m]> Jo guys, I just installed GrapheneOS on my Google Pixel phone. but when I activate the phone I get a message that says: you device is loading a different operating system (with a yellow exlamation mark). Is there a way to get rid of this?
15:25:01 <EV-9600[m]> No it's fine
15:25:57 <djentosaurus[m]> EV-9600 matrix  Was that an answer for me?
15:26:05 <EV-9600[m]> Yes
15:26:12 <djentosaurus[m]> So you also have that message?
15:26:25 <EV-9600[m]> It just tells you you aren't loading the default system
15:26:39 <EV-9600[m]> Which you don't, you are loading Graphene
15:26:40 <EV-9600[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "So you also have that message?"> Yes
15:26:41 <djentosaurus[m]> I know, but can you get rid of this message?
15:27:30 <EV-9600[m]> No because it is part of the inaccessible parts
15:27:41 <djentosaurus[m]> okay, no worries then
15:33:31 <djentosaurus[m]> How is everybody feeling about GrapheneOs here? I'm new to it
15:36:54 <jj1013[m]> There are times where I try to select an Invidious instance from redirect.invidious.io and it's broken (timeout, 502 Error, whatever). Does anybody know which is the best instance? yewtu.be seems to be a decent one.
15:37:26 <djentosaurus[m]> I also have that problem JJ1013
16:15:03 <tharg[m]> Hi team - please can you help? Either a) I cannot find the android calendar in graphene or b) I need an app to do this (DAVx reqd). Thanks  :-)
16:17:28 <nscnt[m]> tharg: You have to install a calendar app of your choice
16:18:51 <tharg[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "How is everybody feeling about G"> Pretty good. On WiFi I am at 50% after 36hr, so it seems a lot quieter than standard Android. Lots of cool security features. Just missing a calendar, and trying to work out how to not run data over mobile. But it looks v promising
16:20:03 <tharg[m]> Thanks! I take it there aren't any standard offerings then...

16:58:51 <djentosaurus[m]> What does hashing or pgp mean?
16:59:10 <djentosaurus[m]> Someone recommend me to hash an app or use pgp
17:08:59 <djentosaurus[m]> Is it possible to install a vpn on GrapheneOs?
17:09:42 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "What does hashing or pgp mean?"> hashing is putting some data through a one way algorithm, it's impossible to tell the input for a given output
17:10:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> PGP is a public key protocol
17:10:24 <djentosaurus[m]> Not sure what that all means
17:10:35 <djentosaurus[m]> How do i pgp an app?
17:12:50 <dnull> djentosaurus[m]: A hash is a mathematical function that takes the entire program/iso/whatever and reduces it to a number that can he checked for no errors or modifications. GPG is similar, but uses a key so you can see it was signed by someone or an entity with no changes.
17:13:24 <djentosaurus[m]> and how to I do this GPG thing?
17:13:36 <dnull> It's a way to see no changes have been made
17:14:00 <dnull> Depends on if there is a gpg sig for whatever
17:15:36 <dnull> Do you have a specific thing you want to check?
17:19:30 <djentosaurus[m]> I wanted to check F droid
17:19:44 <djentosaurus[m]> Also, is there a way to make the keyboard azerty and not qwerty?
17:19:50 <djentosaurus[m]> I'm a noob...I know
17:20:43 <dnull> Never used azerty so can't answer
17:21:41 <dnull> You want to check gpg on your phone?
17:21:46 <dnull> https://f-droid.org/F-Droid.apk.asc
17:21:56 <dnull> That's the key for the apk
17:22:21 <djentosaurus[m]> okay, I'll check!
17:26:13 <djentosaurus[m]> not realy sure what it does
17:26:50 <djentosaurus[m]> i just see some random letters an numbers
17:28:34 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: The keyboard layout matches the language you use for the keyboard
17:29:00 <djentosaurus[m]> Oh, so I need to change the language then?
17:29:28 <nscnt[m]> The language for your keyboard at least, yes
17:29:38 <djentosaurus[m]> how to do this?
17:29:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <dnull "djentosaurus: A hash is a mathem"> just being pedantic but GPG is just a frontend for PGP
17:29:54 <Railgun_Lover[m]> afaik
17:30:11 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's the same OpenPGP protocol
17:30:35 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Settings > System > Languages & input > On-screen keyboard > GrapheneOS Keyboard > Languages
17:31:46 <nscnt[m]> If you've set "Use system languages" and keep it this way, you can just add the language at Settings > System > Languages & input > Languages
17:32:03 <nscnt[m]> and *you want to keep it this way
17:32:32 <dnull> Railgun_Lover[m]: Really?
17:32:35 <djentosaurus[m]> still qwerty though
17:32:57 <dnull> Railgun_Lover[m]: And you said I was being difficult?
17:33:00 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Have you chosen the language in your keyboard?
17:33:41 <djentosaurus[m]> yes
17:33:44 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: When the keyboard is open, press the globe
17:33:45 <djentosaurus[m]> now it's okay
17:33:48 <nscnt[m]> press and hold will open the popup
17:35:03 <RobBraxman1> Yo yo yo!
17:35:07 <nscnt[m]> You can switch the input method with the globe
17:35:50 <djentosaurus[m]> still talking to me nscnt?
17:35:53 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Yes
17:36:28 <nscnt[m]> Well, if you have several languages activated
17:36:37 <RobBraxman1> Keys: solo, nitro or what?
17:36:41 <nscnt[m]> Don't know... maybe you've only one activated now
17:37:09 <djentosaurus[m]> The language is okay now
17:37:13 <djentosaurus[m]> I have azerty back
17:37:57 <djentosaurus[m]> What do you mean with 'globe'
17:38:29 <RobBraxman1> Noone seems to be responding to me...
17:38:48 <nscnt[m]> On the left of the space key. You only have it if you've activated several languages for the keyboard
17:39:05 <djentosaurus[m]> Ah okay, don't have/need that
17:39:23 <nscnt[m]> okay
17:39:54 <djentosaurus[m]> This Gpg Pgp stuff is kind off intriguing though
17:40:07 <djentosaurus[m]> A bit difficult it seems?
17:41:16 <djentosaurus[m]> is there a way to have a background image for Grapheneos
17:41:25 <djentosaurus[m]> It's kind of dark now
17:41:28 <djentosaurus[m]> hehe
17:43:56 <dnull> You mean a wallpaper? Or during the boot process?
17:44:03 <djentosaurus[m]> wallpaper
17:44:23 <dnull> Sure, you can change that easily
17:45:54 <djentosaurus[m]> how then?
17:47:25 <ramenweekend[m]> <lackshan[m] "ramenweekend Easy to not go down"> WTF! Really? We are not safe üò¨

17:53:01 <ramenweekend[m]> In case you forgot akc3n, does anyone know of a FOSS app for podcasts?
17:54:36 <akc3n[m]> ramenweekend: nope didnt forget. I did reply to you. And mentioned that I have no experience with podcasts whatsoever. Sorry.
17:56:47 <ramenweekend[m]> <bradgarlinghouse "On a paranoid scale from 1 to 10"> I'm in the same boat! Hidden Tails OS might just be my main girl going forward.

17:57:50 <dnull> Tails is designed to leave no footprint. Why would you try and  make it hidden? Pull the usb and reboot.
17:58:22 <ramenweekend[m]> Work and play.
17:58:46 <nscnt[m]> ramenweekend: Take a look at AntennaPod
17:59:34 <ramenweekend[m]> Sad üòÇ my first thought was that I would have to "Google it!" I mean DDG.

18:45:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <dnull "I am impersonating Railgun_Lover"> You really need to drop that. You're getting ridiculous at this point.
18:49:35 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I never said you were difficult anyway, that was someone else, but your recent actions make me think he was right...
18:50:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> The whole point of clarifying the difference between PGP and GPG was to avoid confusing someone who didn't know what they were.
19:23:35 <dnull> Railgun_Lover[m]: What in the everlivingfuck are you quoting? I never said that and I did drop it, and apologized.
19:23:43 <dnull> Grow the fuck up.
19:30:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> dnull: Please stop, it's getting ridiculous.
19:31:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Don't be so rude and hostile in the chat, it derails it when it's supposed to be about GrapheneOS instead of insults.
19:31:24 <dnull> Great. I did stop.
19:31:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Good
19:31:50 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And you'll not do it again?
19:32:33 <dnull> Grow up,
19:32:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> lol
19:33:09 <Railgun_Lover[m]> please stop telling me to grow up, you're the only one swearing
19:33:33 <trail_undergroun> you are an absolute idiot, I'm right your wrong
19:33:33 <dnull> And the only one who dropped it.
19:33:42 <trail_undergroun> <trail_undergroun "you are an absolute idiot, I'm r"> Idk what this is about but im arguing now
19:33:57 <trail_undergroun> * you are an absolute idiot, I'm right you're wrong
19:34:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> dnull: If you agree to stop, without insults, this whole drama can be over
19:34:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I'm sure you want that
19:34:21 <dnull> It already is.
19:34:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Good
19:34:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Let's leave it at that
19:34:35 <trail_undergroun> I think we can all agree on coming together and giving each other a big group hug
19:34:38 <trail_undergroun> Good
19:34:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <trail_undergroun "I think we can all agree on comi"> yessire
19:46:50 <annochris> Anyone there?
19:51:38 <lackshan[m]> tharg I've heard good things about Etar Calendar and that's what I'm using rn

19:52:44 <sign4l[m]> <annochris "Anyone there?"> Yepp
19:53:40 <sign4l[m]> Etar is maximum minimalistic....thats why i also like and use it
19:57:23 <joltman[m]> Etar is what I use as well
20:01:05 <sign4l[m]> Today I really had a strange experience with my GrapheneOS Pixel. I forgot my USB charging cable and had to use the cable of my girlfriend
20:01:12 <lackshan[m]> For weather I'd recommend Geometric Weather
20:01:26 <lackshan[m]> Its pretty and I'm a sucker for that
20:01:43 <sign4l[m]> She has had couple of Samsung phones in the past and has 3 power supply's and cables
20:02:03 <sign4l[m]> Not one of the Samsung cables or recharger worked
20:02:28 <sign4l[m]> I totally freaked out thinking my pixel could not charge anymore
20:02:54 <sign4l[m]> She also has a huawei super charger and not even this one works
20:03:26 <sign4l[m]> Back at home all of my cables and my old apple chargers just work normal
20:04:05 <sign4l[m]> And I googled... For some reason really pixel devices don't charge on Samsung supply and USB cables üòÖ
20:05:44 <sign4l[m]> I also could not connect the Samsung cable to my macbook to charge there... It just did not work with any of the Samsung cables
20:07:01 <lackshan[m]> Samsung must not be complying with USB C standards then
20:07:15 <sign4l[m]> Maybe....
20:07:21 <lackshan[m]> Because AFAIK Apple and Google have been great with standards compliance
20:07:27 <sign4l[m]> So stay away from Samsung gear
20:07:51 <lackshan[m]> Plus Samsung has traditionally tried to make everything proprietary or work better with Samsung gear

22:07:02 <djentosaurus[m]> okay
22:07:09 <djentosaurus[m]> why not?

22:11:44 <gt500> Hi guys, can I ask you an op sec question? Where/how do you all store your password manager/email/2fa recovery phrases and back-ups?
22:13:28 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> Aegis for 2FA is a good choise afaik
22:14:11 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> when it comes to password manager, depends on whether you want auto cloud backup backup or not
22:15:16 <djentosaurus[m]> I just downloaded some apps on the auroroa store, but they don't show up on my phone??
22:16:00 <djentosaurus[m]> why??
22:17:05 <gt500> Thanks, Hulk. I already have PW manager and 2FA, but my question was about how best to store the recovery phrases so I don't get locked out. Is it best to write it down in plain text, store it on cloud with hard token etc.
22:18:12 <gt500> My concern is that the PW manager has all my accounts, which means if I lose access, I'm f*cked. So to prevent that, I need to store my 2FA recovery somewhere, and I was just curious as to how you guys did it.
22:18:44 <gt500> Also, where/how do you store your 2FA and PW manager back-ups?
22:22:50 <djentosaurus[m]> Is it possible to have shortcuts off the apps that I downloaded and installed on the aurora store on mij phone?
22:32:49 <djentosaurus[m]> Can somebody help me with my problem please?
22:33:51 <djentosaurus[m]> I also have this weird white line when I swipe between screens on my phone
22:41:53 <djentosaurus[m]> hello?
22:50:41 <gt500> Hi
22:55:55 <djentosaurus[m]> Why don't I see icons of the apps I downloaded in the Aurora store?
22:56:54 <Cliff[m]> djentosaurus i had the same i just pressed install multiple times after couple tries it shows itself
22:57:18 <djentosaurus[m]> Is that normal?
22:57:56 <Cliff[m]> I dont know i don't download alot from aurorastore
22:58:14 <Cliff[m]> The autoupdate also doesnt work i just check for updates every day.
22:58:22 <djentosaurus[m]> the apps are allready installed so I can't reinstall them
22:58:32 <djentosaurus[m]> This shouldn't happen I think
22:59:34 <Cliff[m]> Then they should be in the menu. I downloaded maps a couple days ago in a different profile and it wouldn't appear at first and after couple times it did.
23:02:37 <Cliff[m]> <gt500 "Hi guys, can I ask you an op sec"> Keepass works great for local storage it is from f-droid. If you want to be able to upload to the cloud i would use bitwarden.
23:03:16 <Cliff[m]> And aegis works very well for 2fa
23:04:07 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> gt500: yeah, i see your problem, honestly, i'm just using google's password manager, because i'm scared of losing all of my passwords, and because Google is not a treat in my treat model
23:04:54 <akc3n[m]> <gt500 "My concern is that the PW manage"> Hi, one scenario that works for me, is using bitwarden ( I have a paid account) and backup my 2fa recovery codes (encrypted)from all my accounts using the attachment feature in bitwarden. Its all on a cloud and I have local backups of it too.
23:05:19 <Cliff[m]> <cx7dd[m] "I use native"> Do you get auto updates with native installer?
23:06:17 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> djentosaurus: alright, it seems to me that you're very very very noob
23:06:30 <akc3n[m]> gt500: I use keepassdx on mobile and keepassxc on desktop as well.
23:06:31 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> i highly recommend you to get back to stock
23:06:34 <djentosaurus[m]> I am Telegram
23:06:50 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> and look thru the "Pixel Tips" app
23:07:01 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> you will learn how to use your phone
23:07:14 <djentosaurus[m]> stock?
23:07:15 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> later on, you can get back to GrapheneOS as to your liking
23:07:19 <djentosaurus[m]> what do you mean?
23:07:40 <djentosaurus[m]> no GrapheneOs?
23:07:45 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> stock = default Google's Android that comes pre-installed with your phone when you buy it
23:07:55 <djentosaurus[m]> That's the whole reason why I bought the phone
23:08:05 <Telegram-Bridge> <!Hulk> this is my personal recommendation to you
23:08:23 <Cliff[m]> djentosaurus its not very hard, my gf uses graphene and she is noob exceptional
23:08:29 <Cliff[m]> What are your problems?
23:08:35 <djentosaurus[m]> It's my first smartphone

23:09:03 <djentosaurus[m]> I can't see the icons of downloaded apps (aurora store) on my phone
23:09:17 <Cliff[m]> Did you download and press install
23:09:27 <djentosaurus[m]> Also I have this weird white line when swiping between two screens
23:09:45 <djentosaurus[m]> I have the apps and i'm able to open them
23:09:51 <djentosaurus[m]> but only in the aurora store
23:09:59 <djentosaurus[m]> not on my phone itseld
23:10:01 <djentosaurus[m]> itself
23:10:42 <Cliff[m]> Reboot your phone and try again, if you press install it installs the app on the phone not in aurora store
23:10:57 <Cliff[m]> Or go to the home screen and swipe up to see all apps
23:11:14 <djentosaurus[m]> Could there be a faulty instalation of the aurora store?
23:11:41 <Cliff[m]> Does it say open if you go to the app in aurora store?
23:11:59 <djentosaurus[m]> yes it does
23:12:00 <Cliff[m]> And if you can open it from there it means they are installed on your phone
23:12:07 <djentosaurus[m]> true
23:12:15 <djentosaurus[m]> but how about shortcuts?
23:12:32 <Cliff[m]> Go back to the home screen and swipe up.
23:12:55 <Cliff[m]> There you will see all apps installed, for me it adds a shortcut to the home screen automatically
23:12:57 <djentosaurus[m]> nothing happens when I do that
23:13:16 <djentosaurus[m]> Weird
23:13:24 <Cliff[m]> As in home screen when you unlock your phone?
23:13:32 <Cliff[m]> Try rebooting
23:13:33 <djentosaurus[m]> I know
23:13:45 <Cliff[m]> Before you try anything else
23:14:33 <djentosaurus[m]> still the same
23:14:43 <Cliff[m]> Did you reboot in 2 seconds?
23:14:49 <Cliff[m]> Are you the flash
23:15:01 <djentosaurus[m]> no, i just rebooted
23:15:04 <djentosaurus[m]> restarted
23:15:27 <Cliff[m]> How did you open your matrix client?
23:15:39 <djentosaurus[m]> What is a matrix client?
23:15:54 <Cliff[m]> How are you chatting with us right now?
23:15:59 <djentosaurus[m]> element
23:16:03 <djentosaurus[m]> pc
23:16:18 <Cliff[m]> I think you are trolling dude
23:16:24 <djentosaurus[m]> no, I'm not
23:16:34 <djentosaurus[m]> I have Element on my pc
23:16:46 <djentosaurus[m]> I am chatting on windows
23:16:54 <djentosaurus[m]> really not trolling
23:18:07 <Cliff[m]> Go to settings -> system -> reset options -> factory reset
23:18:19 <Cliff[m]> Try again you'll be fine.
23:19:15 <Cliff[m]> If you can setup windows and install element you'll get there
23:20:18 <djentosaurus[m]> Maybe I'll do that. but it's too late here now
23:20:29 <djentosaurus[m]> Will post again tommorrow
23:20:47 <djentosaurus[m]> I'm good with computers, not so much with phones
23:21:14 <djentosaurus[m]> So it seems
23:58:07 <GhostSplinterSix> <Cliff[m] "I think you are trolling dude"> He's not. A friend of mine uses Element on PC.
